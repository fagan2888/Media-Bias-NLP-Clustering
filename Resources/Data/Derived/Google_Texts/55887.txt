ProPublica has been tracking industry payments to doctors since 2010, with a "Dollars for Docs" interactive database which initially allowed people to search payments made by 17 companies between 2009 and 2013. According to ProPublica, most of those companies were required to report their payments as a condition of legal settlements with the federal government.

The most recently released expands the amount of data available to to the public, as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, a part of 2010's Affordable Care Act, mandated that all drug and device companies publicly report payments to doctors.

Between July 2013 and December 2014, over $9 million dollars from drug companies was spent on Rhode Island doctors -- here are doctors that received the most money.
