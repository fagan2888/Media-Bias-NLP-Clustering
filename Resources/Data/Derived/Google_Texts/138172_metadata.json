The fund had agreed to double the amount available for Zimbabwe, known as a financial quota, to $984 million, he said.\n\n\"We are talking about the third quarter, that's when you see most of the action happening,\" Mangudya told Reuters in an interview, referring to when Harare expected the loan.\n\nZimbabwe would also receive an $896 million loan from an unnamed country to pay off arrears to the World Bank.\n\nIn addition, the African Export-Import Bank would provide $601 million for Harare to clear arrears to the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nZimbabwe would then receive the same amount as a grant from the AfDB, Mangudya said.\n\nThe Southern African country's foreign debt stands at $8.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion is arrears.\n\nZimbabwe is trying to emerge from years of international isolation, largely blamed on Mugabe's policies, including the seizures of farms from white farmers.\n\nThe worst drought since 1992 has left 4 million Zimbabweans facing hunger.\n\nMangudya said the drought had forced the government to lower its growth target for 2016 to below 2 percent from 2.7 percent. The IMF and World Bank forecast growth of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent respectively.\n\nOnce Zimbabwe clears its arrears, it would be ready for rating by international ratings agencies, with a view to issue international bonds in future, said Mangudya.\n\nMangudya said he supported the government's decision to take over diamond mining in Marange because the government was receiving little money from the operations.\n\n\"After the rating we will then go for the Eurobonds and all to raise money on the international capital markets,\" he said.\n\nThe government had issued $250 million in treasury bills to raise money for its operations in 2015, Mangudya said, adding that the bank would soon start holding public auctions of treasury bills to enhance transparency in state borrowing.\n\nThe central bank also issued $1 billion in bills last year to creditors of the bank, which owes $1.35 billion.\n\n(Editing by James Macharia and Tom Heneghan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe expects a loan from the International Monetary Fund(IMF) i", "title": "Zimbabwe expects first IMF loan in nearly two decades this year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/16/Zimbabwe-get-first-IMF-loan-nearly-two-decades-year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/zimbabwe-economy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/16/Zimbabwe-get-first-IMF-loan-nearly-two-decades-year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/zimbabwe-economy_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe expects a loan from the International Monetary Fund(IMF) i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Zimbabwe would also receive an $896 million loan from an unnamed country to pay off arrears to the World Bank.\nCentral bank governor John Mangudya said the IMF would decide the exact amount of the loan to issue at a later date.\nThe central bank also issued $1 billion in bills last year to creditors of the bank, which owes $1.35 billion.\nThe fund had agreed to double the amount available for Zimbabwe, known as a financial quota, to $984 million, he said.\nIn addition, the African Export-Import Bank would provide $601 million for Harare to clear arrears to the African Development Bank (AfDB)."}
