Andrea Stewart-Cousins has for two years been in the unusual position of leading a minority conference of Democrats\u2013even though the New York state Senate has a Democratic majority.\n\nPresident Barack Obama greets State Senator Andrea Stewart Cousins in Tarrytown on May 14. Associated Press\n\nMs. Stewart Cousins, the first woman to hold a New York state legislative leadership position, is in charge of the Senate Democrats, sometimes referred to in Albany as \u201cthe mainline\u201d Democrats. But the state Senate is run by a power-sharing coalition of breakaway Democrats \u2014 called the Independent Democratic Conference \u2014 and Republican senators, whose leaders jointly negotiate the budget and decide which bills see a vote.\n\nPotential for another sea-change in the sometimes chaotic state Senate was raised last month at a convention for the Working Families Party, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo vowed by video message to help Democrats regain total power in the chamber.\n\nMs. Stewart-Cousins, who represents Yonkers, said in an interview this week that she and Sen. Jeff Klein, who leads the Independent Democrats, have discussed a power-sharing coalition. She said the conversation was \u201camenable\u201d but \u201cnot conclusive.\u201d But one way or another, she said, \u201cI believe we\u2019ll be the majority\u201d next session.\n\n(In response, Mr. Klein said in e-email: \u201cThere are no discussions taking place.\u201d)\n\nA spokeswoman for Sen. Dean Skelos, the Republican Senate leader, said, Senator Skelos very much enjoys working with Senator Stewart-Cousins, but \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the direction she \u2026 want[s] to take this state.\u201d\n\nEven if Senate Democrats are able to gain power, Ms. Stewart-Cousins has to be reelected to a leadership position next year by her members in order to remain leader. If Ms. Stewart-Cousins did get elected to a leadership position in a majority conference, she would become the first female Senate president in state history.\n\nShe sat down with The Wall Street Journal to discuss her legislative disappointments, and if she can mend fences with Mr. Klein. Below is a slightly condensed transcript of the interview.\n\nWSJ: The legislative session ends this week. How did it go for you?\n\nIt\u2019s been an exercise, on some level, in frustration, trying to keep our issues alive and on the front burner. We were able to do some good things \u2026 anyway, it\u2019s not like school is out for us.\n\nWSJ: You introduced a public campaign finance bill, one of the most talked-about issues of the session, but it was never brought to the floor. Why do you think that is?\n\nI fully expected to have something done other than what happened in the budget [a program for financing solely the state comptroller's race with public funds], which I think is woefully inadequate. It certainly wasn\u2019t for lack of trying on the part of my conference.\n\nWSJ: Did you talk to Sen. Klein about it?\n\nThere was always the assurance that it was a priority of the IDC, and a priority of the governor\u2019s. The talks were public \u2014 this was important. There was every expectation that even if you didn\u2019t like my bill, you would introduce something that could get us to the point where we could say we had meaningful campaign finance reform. That never happened.\n\nWSJ: Coalition leaders have said it\u2019s a bipartisan give-and-take, and they work together, trading legislation. Do you believe Democrats have lost in that give-and-take?\n\nThe expectations have been thwarted \u2026 what\u2019s happened, frankly, is the values we have as Democrats have being given to Republicans to manage, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not getting results.\n\nWSJ: Sen. Klein and Sen. Skelos were in negotiations for a campaign finance bill throughout the session, but the talks soured. Do you think they could have produced a bill this session?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. What was apparently the byproduct of negotiations appeared in the budget, and it was relevant to one race.\n\nWSJ: Sen. Klein said the Working Families Party is the reason campaign finance failed. What do you think of that?\n\nThe Republicans are not interested in campaign finance \u2026 The IDC-Republican coalition talked about progressive things happening, but progressive things didn\u2019t happen. And campaign finance fell victim to that leadership.\n\nWSJ: Are you interested in forming a power-sharing coalition with the IDC?\n\nThe electorate voted for a majority of Senate Democrats, and we should be the majority, so I am supportive of an arrangement that allows Democrats to be the majority. I\u2019m open to having the Senate majority.\n\nWSJ: Can you and Sen. Klein get along?\n\nWe get along. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find somebody who doesn\u2019t get along with me. I\u2019m not a hyper-partisan person, I\u2019m not an unreasonable person \u2026 what\u2019s not to get along?\n\nI think it\u2019s important when people elect people to represent them on a specific party line that those people then go up and do that, and anything less than that is disenfranchising the voter. Because there was no expectation that you were going to go off and empower Republicans. For example. So I\u2019m sure I could get along with Sen. Klein.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A top New York state Democrat, Sen.
