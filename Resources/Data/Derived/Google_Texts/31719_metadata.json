GSK sent doctors to lavish resorts to promote Wellbutrin, the Justice Department charged. Johnson & Johnson bestowed trips, perks and honoraria on Texas Medicaid officials to get its drug Risperdal preferred on the formulary, a state lawsuit charged. Bristol-Myers Squibb enticed doctors to prescribe its drugs with access to the Los Angeles Lakers and luxury box suites for their games, California regulators say. In China GSK is charged with using a network of 700 middlemen and travel agencies to bribe doctors with cash and sexual favors, and Victory Pharma, an opioid drugs maker, was charged with treating doctors to strip shows. Nice.\n\nOf course, Pharma reps did as well as the doctors. Thanks to their Barbie and Ken doll looks and the free samples, gifts and lunches they would bring medical staff, they would often waltz in to see the doctor before the sick and waiting patients. Some had their own lounges at medical offices. Since the 2010 sunshine law, part of the Affordable Care Act, went into effect in 2013, drug companies must display the doctors and groups they pay on their websites. That includes their payments to faux grassroots groups like Go Red For Women and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, or NAMI, which are widely seen as Pharma fronts. But will it make a difference? For years, doctors have also begun presentations with slides detailing their Pharma funding but it doesn\u2019t seem to alter their credibility or audience cynicism.\n\nWhen it comes to acknowledging the influence of gifts and money on behavior, doctors, like everyone else, suffer from self-delusion. Most say they believe it affects the other guy, not them, and many become offended at the idea that they are \u201cfor sale.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy prescribing never changes because once a month a drug rep brings in a tray of sandwiches,\u201d Maria Carmen Wilson told the Tampa Bay Times. (Wilson was Eli Lilly\u2019s number-two earner in Florida in 2009, the paper reports.) It\u2019s tempting to ask such doctors that if the largesse doesn\u2019t affect them, when was the last time they prescribed the competitor\u2019s pill? Would anyone believe or even read the journalism of a reporter who accepted an honorarium or speaker\u2019s fee from the subject she reported on? Even if she claimed it didn\u2019t influence her?\n\nTrips to resorts and strip clubs will likely continue to diminish under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, but there are many other ways, often sneaky, that Pharma can entice doctors to prescribe its expensive, patent drugs.\n\n1. Spying on Prescribing\n\nLike the NSA spying program, shameless spying on doctors\u2019 prescribing habits spares almost no one. Recently, the full sweep of IMS Health Holdings\u2019 prescription data mining was revealed by ProPublica, which reported that its collection includes over 85 percent of the world\u2019s prescriptions and \u201ccomprehensive, anonymous medical records for 400 million patients.\u201d In 2007, there was a backlash against another seller of medical information: the AMA itself. By selling the names, office addresses and practice types of almost every doctor in the US to marketing firms the AMA netted almost $50 million a year, the American Medical Student Association and the National Physicians Alliance charged at the AMA\u2019s convention. The database of 900,000 doctors does not violate privacy, counters the AMA, since doctors can opt out.\n\nPsychiatrist Dan Carlat wrote in the New York Times that he was \u201castonished at the level of detail that drug companies were able to acquire about doctors\u2019 prescribing habits\u201d and that his drug reps told him \u201cthey received printouts tracking local doctors\u2019 prescriptions every week.\u201d A 2011 Supreme Court ruling found the collection and dissemination of prescribing behavior was \u201cspeech\u201d and protected by the First Amendment. (See: a corporation is a person.)\n\n2. Continuing Medical Education Courses\n\nIn order to keep their state licenses and satisfy insurance regulations, doctors must enroll in a certain amount of CMEs\u2014continuing medical education courses. Not surprisingly, these classes are often \u201ctaught\u201d for free by Pharma-funded specialists, sparing doctors from having to pay for them but providing the objectivity of a time-share presentation.\n\nOne such class, \u201cAtypical Antipsychotics in Major Depressive Disorder: When Current Treatments Are Not Enough,\u201d funded by Seroquel maker AstraZeneca was taught by former Emory University psychiatrist Charles Nemeroff, who lost his department chairmanship due to unreported Pharma income. Another CME called \u201cBipolar Disorder: Individualizing Treatment to Improve Patient Outcomes,\u201d was \u201ctaught\u201d by Trisha Suppes, who admits to funding by Abbott, AstraZeneca; GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Novartis, Pfizer, Wyeth, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Shire and four more Pharma companies. Another CME, \u201cIndividualizing ADHD Pharmacotherapy with Disruptive Behavioral Disorders\u201d was taught by the Johnson & Johnson-funded Robert L. Findling and refers to Risperdal or its generic version, risperdone, 13 times. Many CMEs teach doctors about the lucrative new disease category of Adult ADHD and how to keep kids from going off their ADHD meds when they get to college.
