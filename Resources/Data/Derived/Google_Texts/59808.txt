Friends and family of Nicholas Hoang laid the 13 year old Merritt Brown Middle Schooler to rest Saturday morning.

Hoang lost his life last week in a small Cherokee plane crash on May 25th near Fountain. He was flying with his uncle, mother, and aunt, and the plane had just taken off the runway when police believe motor issues caused it to crash.

The funeral took place this morning at 9 a.m. at Southerland funeral home in Panama City. Classmates from Merrit Brown Middle come out to support the family.

After the service Hoang was taken to the Catholic Cemetery on Frankford Avenue.
