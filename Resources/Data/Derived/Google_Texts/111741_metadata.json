This year? Santa wore shorts. A few flakes finally fell last week -- smashing a 116-year record for the longest streak with no snow.\n\nIn cities up and down the East Coast, Christmas Eve was the warmest ever. It felt like summer in the Big Apple, with temperatures in the 70s.\n\n\"Oh, this is awesome,\" said one boy. \"Being able to see 70 degree weather in New York City on Christmas Eve, is something really cool to experience.\"\n\n\"Where's the nearest beach?\" one guy said.\n\nThis month's wacky warm weather has broken more than a thousand records from coast to coast.\n\n\"This December has been exceptional for a lot of areas of the country,\" said Eric Fisher, chief meteorologist for CBS Station WBZ in Boston. \"You look into the Northwest where the rain and snow has been nonstop. You look into the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, upper Midwest -- winter completely on pause, and temperatures that are so far above average they'll be smashing records before we're done.\n\n\"To me, this is the most staggering thing: In the Boston area we're going to see the coldest winter month ever recorded and the warmest winter month ever recorded in the same year in 144 years of records.\"\n\nThe nation's weather map essentially is divided in half: In many Eastern cities, temperatures are as high as 30 degrees above normal.\n\nOut West, it's colder and wetter than it's been in years. Two weeks ago, dangerous floods in Oregon swallowed homes and prompted terrifying rescue missions.\n\nSo what's up? Scientists say what's behind this weather madness, in part, is a phenomenon that goes back millennia: El Ni\u00f1o. It's a year-long warming that takes place along the equator in the eastern half of the tropical Pacific, related to changes in the trade winds.\n\nNate Mantua, a climatologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Santa Cruz, California, has been studying the effects of El Ni\u00f1o for 30 years. Every four to seven years, he says, those Pacific trade winds weaken. \"And when that happens, there's a massive shift in rainfall patterns in the tropics. So wet places end up being really dry, and normally dry places end up getting lots of rainfall.\"\n\nMantua says the current El Ni\u00f1o is among the three strongest since 1950, at least. \"So it's among the strongest in the historical record.\"\n\nSo strong that the effects of this El Ni\u00f1o can be seen on every weather forecaster's radar the world over.\n\nLouis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service, says El Ni\u00f1o causes the temperature of the Pacific Ocean to increase up to ten degrees -- and triggers a ripple effect across the globe.\n\n\"Wetter than normal [in the West],\" he said, \"and as we see the El Ni\u00f1o pattern evolve, we should see a more active storm track along the South, so wetter and warmer [there].\"\n\nAnd as if right on cue, over the last five days, killer tornadoes swept across the South, killing more than 20 people from Texas to Tennessee.\n\nStrassmann asked, \"So what, to you, is worrisome about all this?\"\n\n\"There are parts of the globe that are impacted by El Ni\u00f1o that do suffer form those impacts,\" Uccellini replied. \"Increased drying in Brazil and Indonesia with possibility of forest fires. Increased precipitation over Africa, central Africa and east Africa, which lends itself to the the increased likelihood of disease outbreaks like malaria and dengue fever.\"\n\nBut can these alarming weather events also be blamed on climate change? Scientists say, not so fast.\n\n\"Maybe climate change adds a couple more warm days, or makes the warmest temperatures a little bit warmer,\" said Eric Fisher. \"I don't think that you can just say that because it's a warming world, we're seeing a record warm December. You might be enhancing the normal pattern that would have happened anyway by a little bit.\"\n\nIn California, oceans that were already warming are getting even hotter. And that has created a crisis for creatures who live in it.\n\nShawn Johnson directs the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito. He says that in the past two years, 90 percent of California's sea lion and fur seal pups have died. When critically-ill animals wash up on beaches, the staff tries to nurse them back to health.\n\n\"2015 has been one for the record books,\" said Johnson. \"Typically we rescue 600-800 animals. We're almost to 1,800.\n\n\"Because the water is so warm, it's pushed all the feeder fish -- the foraging fish for their mothers -- farther out to sea, deeper in the water column, or farther north. What it's come down to is, all the animals have a lack of food. There's not enough food right in this area for them right now.\"\n\nRelief will come eventually, because historically, El Ni\u00f1o is followed by La Ni\u00f1a, characterized by cooler ocean temperatures.\n\nBut at least for the next few months, the world will continue to feel El Ni\u00f1o's effects -- both on land and in the ocean.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\u00a9 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.
