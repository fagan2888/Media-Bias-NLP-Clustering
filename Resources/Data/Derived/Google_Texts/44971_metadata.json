But the religious charities get the bulk of their funding not from private donors or church members putting checks into a basket. They get it from the federal government.\n\nAlexandria, Va.-based Catholic Charities USA reported receiving $1.7 million in government grants in 2012, according to its IRS Form 990.\n\nBut one of the largest recipients of government funds to resettle immigrant children is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The USCCB helps resettle not only unaccompanied alien children, or UACs, who enter the country illegally but also refugees fleeing persecution overseas who enter through legal channels.\n\nThe USCCB is one of nine agencies that receive hundreds of millions in tax dollars to resettle refugees and asylum seekers in the U.S. under contract with the federal government. Six of the nine contractors are religious groups, WND has learned, including the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, Episcopal Migration Ministries, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Church World Service and World Relief Corp., which includes a plethora of evangelical groups.\n\nThe Catholic Bishops alone received $65.9 million in federal grants to care for unaccompanied alien children and refugees, according to its 2012 annual report.\n\nBy contrast, the group raised $1.4 million from its own church members while federal loans and private-sector grants made up the remainder of the $71 million spent on the resettlements that year. That means 93 percent of the USCCB\u2019s spending on charity work with UACs and refugees was covered by the American taxpayer.\n\nKevin Appleby, director of USCC\u2019s Migration and Refugee Services Office, did not respond to calls and emails from WND seeking comment.\n\nSimilar funding ratios have been found to be the norm with the Lutheran effort.\n\nThe Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service reported total income of $41.7 million in 2012, and government grants accounted for $40.4 million, or 96.8 percent of that amount, according to the nonprofit\u2019s most recently reported Form 990, a disclosure that nonprofits must file with the Internal Revenue Service. The group raised only $1.3 million from private donors.\n\nMiji Bell, press spokeswoman for Lutheran Immigration, also did not return calls Tuesday.\n\nThe money for refugees and asylum seekers may not even include the federal money funneled to Catholic Charities USA and other religious groups to resettle illegal border crossers coming into Texas, Arizona or New Mexico who arrive by themselves. The charities often subcontract with other charities, making it difficult to track the money.\n\nThe numbers of UACs coming through the Southern border have increased dramatically since 2009, and so have the costs, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which operates within the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nEight years ago, the program averaged 6,775 referrals a year. In fiscal 2013 the number reached 24,668. Now, the agency is expecting 60,000 referrals in 2014 at a cost to the U.S. government of more than $750 million, up from less than $500 million in 2013 and less than $250 million in 2009.\n\nThe University of Texas at El Paso\u2019s National Center for Border Security and Immigration conducted a study published in March in which it laid bare the major cause of the problem \u2013 exploitation of weak border enforcement policies by the U.S.\n\n\u201cBoth Border Patrol and ICE ERO officers agreed that the lack of deterrence for crossing the U.S.-Mexican border has impacted the rate at which they apprehend UACs. Officers are certain that UACs are aware of the relative lack of consequences they will receive when apprehended at the U.S. border,\u201d the authors wrote on page 3 of the UTEP study. \u201cUTEP was informed that smugglers of family members of UACs understand that once a UAC is apprehended for illegal entry into the United States, the individual will be re-united with a U.S. based family member pending the disposition of the immigration hearing. This process appears to be exploited by illegal alien smugglers and family members in the United States who wish to reunite with separated children.\u201d\n\nHow many of the Central American children will seek asylum is not clear at this point. The United Nations is considering granting some type of legal status to children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras who can show evidence of being persecuted. An asylum seeker differs from a refugee in that the person comes into the U.S. on his own, often crossing the border illegally, and then seeks to gain asylum through legal channels.\n\nIncluded in President Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion emergency aid package for dealing with the border crisis is $1.1 million for immigration lawyers to represent the illegal alien children. Another $1.8 billion would go toward resettling the children as opposed to deporting them.\n\nDon Barnett, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, said he would like to see the feds rein in the grants and loans to charities that resettle refugees and UACs seeking asylum.\n\nThe federal government gives out not only grants but loans, and the nonprofit charities are able to pocket 25 percent of whatever they collect on those loans, Barnett explained. He said many of the loans are made to refugees or UACs for travel purposes.\n\n\u201cThey actually hire collection agents to get the money back from the refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very profitable for the nonprofits, really quite profitable, and it has introduced perverse incentives into the whole process, into decision making and policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt totally disincentivizes rational thinking.\u201d\n\nThese same religious charities can also be found lobbying Congress and the Obama administration for amnesty legislation and other policies that immigration watchdogs see as encouraging more illegal immigrants to cross the border.\n\nOn July 2 the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a letter to Obama urging him not to send any of the unaccompanied children who had illegally crossed into the U.S. back to their home countries.\n\n\u201cCurrent law permits children from non-contiguous countries to remain in the country until their request for asylum or immigration relief is considered by an immigration judge,\u201d said Eusebio Elizondo, auxiliary bishop of Seattle and chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Migration. \u201cThis is a very vulnerable population which has been targeted by organized crime networks in Central America. To return them to these criminal elements without a proper adjudication of their cases is unconscionable.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2011, the Catholic Bishops advocated for passage of the DREAM Act, which would provide permanent legal status, some call it amnesty, to young people under 35 brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents if they had been here in the country since the age of 16 or younger, provided they had completed two years of college or military service.\n\nConflicts of interest?\n\nDan Cadman, with the Center for Immigration Studies, says it\u2019s a conflict of interest for a group that benefits financially from immigration \u2013 both legal and illegal \u2013 to try to influence immigration policy.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me that any private organization is using a government funding stream for that purpose, not only Catholic Charities but Lutheran World Service, the Episcopal Church, they\u2019ve all got their hands in the pie,\u201d Cadman said. \u201cThe thing is that everyone understands that, with a wink and a nod, this so-called emergency money (from Obama) is not going to result in any substantial number of individuals being deported. It\u2019s just not. How ironic to see an emergency budget supplemental request and then when you look at the details you see it\u2019s all going to be chewed up for things like brick and mortar buildings for resettlement and not used in any useful way to stop this tidal wave of human beings.\u201d\n\nCadman said there is \u201cno doubt in my mind\u201d that the religious NGOs or \u201cnon-governmental organizations\u201d are working with the United Nations to get the children qualified as refugees or asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cThe religious charities have had a hand in that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind they are looking to afford people status in any way, shape or form because the end game is to not get them sent back to their country of origin.\u201d\n\nChildren don\u2019t qualify as refugees\n\nFrank Head Jr., director of Immigration Services for Catholic Charities of Arkansas, said the Central American children would not qualify as refugees under the current United Nations definition, but it\u2019s not out of the question that a special legal status could be created for the children.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no easy pat answer to that,\u201d he told WND. \u201cThey will not get refugee status. That\u2019s never been the case. There is a special set of regulations for children not accompanied by parents, but no immediate status. They get put into a special adjudication system. They never get called \u2018refugees\u2019 but there is a category, a process where a juvenile who is basically an orphan with no family to claim them could get a certain status (as an asylum seeker) after a lengthy court battle.\u201d\n\nThat court battle could be fought with federally funded lawyers, a development even more likely if Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion in emergency aid gets passed by Congress.\n\n\u201cThe actual answer, everyone wants to know (about the status), but the Obama administration has proposed a new set of regulations and $3.7 billion to fund it,\u201d Head said. \u201cA juvenile, aside from the fact that they get special treatment if caught, and only in recent years have they been afforded that special status \u2013 they used to get thrown into adult jails \u2013 they now get treated as a juvenile. But there isn\u2019t any immediate status. Definitely there is intensive meetings going on to possibly create some new status because the current refugee law doesn\u2019t apply. They couldn\u2019t qualify.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because a refuge by definition is someone who has been pre-screened by the U.N. and then allowed to legally enter a host country.\n\n\u201cBut these kids for the most part don\u2019t qualify as refugees because you have to be part of a designated group facing political or religious persecution, but these are just kids fleeing from violence. They\u2019re not running off all right-wing children or all left-wing children or government-inclined children,\u201d Head said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a religious sect, it\u2019s not a political group, so they wouldn\u2019t qualify for asylum status and so you would ultimately just ship them back and that\u2019s what a lot of people want to do. You have a pretty good idea who that is.\u201d\n\nHead said he doesn\u2019t expect the Obama package to pass the Republican-dominated House.\n\nPursuing the U.N.\u2019s channels would be a totally separate approach.\n\n\u201cThat would have to be for people who hadn\u2019t entered the country yet,\u201d Head said. \u201cThe U.N. would have to setup an office in say Guatemala or El Salvador and you could come there, make a case and possibly get refugee status and get a safe place to come. Even if the U.N. approves you it doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. will let you in. But if someone\u2019s already here you have to apply for asylum status.\u201d\n\nHe said the U.S. lets in 75,000 to 85,000 foreign refugees a year. \u201cAnd at any given time there\u2019s several million in the world.\u201d\n\nThis is separate from the unaccompanied alien children who illegally cross the border and offer themselves up to be apprehended by Border Patrol agents then get turned over the Health and Human Services and given a piece of paper ordering them to appear at a deportation hearing two to three years down the road.\n\nComing out of the shadows\n\nWND also reported in its July 11 article that many of the charities doing the resettlement work for the government try to keep a low profile to avoid upsetting the host community. But with the recent surge of illegals at the border and the media attention it has attracted, it\u2019s getting more difficult to keep their resettlement work under the radar.\n\nIn fact, the border surge is creating a corresponding surge in opposition from citizen activist groups. A coalition of 11 activist groups is organizing two days of protest rallies on July 18 and 19 across the United States on highway overpasses, state capitols and Mexican consulates. A list of protest sites can be found here.\n\nThere have been reports of angry residents showing up at city council meetings in some cities where illegals have been resettled. In Vassar, Michigan, 50 people marched on city hall July 14 in protest of a plan to house a group of Central American boys ages 12 to 17 in their city. Some carried AR-15 rifles and \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flags, reported a local newspaper.\n\nOther cities are taking a more proactive approach, passing ordinances forbidding any resettlements of illegals in their communities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Thousands of Central American children crossing the border illegally could soon turn into asylum seekers armed with immigration lawyers provided by church groups and paid for by federal tax dollars.
