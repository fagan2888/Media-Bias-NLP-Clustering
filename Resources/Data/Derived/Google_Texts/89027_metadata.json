I\u2019ll wait while you yawn. But this is actually pretty important. CBO has used dynamic scoring in the past on multiple pieces of legislation \u2013 it\u2019s an attempt to score not just the obvious impact of a piece of legislation, but what will happen to the economy because of the legislative changes that are made. This is a logical thing to do, from my perspective and the perspective of many on the right, because government policy has such an outsized impact on today\u2019s American economy. People respond to incentives and to penalties, and to pretend otherwise is foolish and ignores the impact of tax cuts and tax hikes and a multitude of other policies.\n\nBut dynamic scoring is also a liberal bogeyman, particularly for Jonathan Chait, who pronounced the CBO reform a \u201cwar on math\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Congressional Budget Office is a 40-year-old institution that has acquired enormous clout within Washington by virtue of its reputation for ideological neutrality. It furnishes Congress and the public with budgetary estimates that, if necessarily imperfect (as all predictions must be), are arrived at fairly. It is also a perfect modern expression of an old Progressive Era\u2013ideal: that policymakers should be informed by the work of impartial experts. That the conservative majority has set out to corrupt this institution as one of its first major acts is, therefore, perfectly fitting.\u201d\n\nUnbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair. The \u201cperfect modern expression of a Progressive Era ideal\u201d. Wait, what? See, that\u2019s the problem with the CBO as currently constructed \u2013 an entity built on the progressive idea that there is such a thing as an \u201cimpartial expert\u201d when it comes to assessing the impacts of policy. How can the unbiased impartial experts possibly act as if tax changes don\u2019t affect people\u2019s behavior, and therefore the broader economy, when every bit of practical evidence indicates that people respond to such impacts? The whole basis of Obamacare was such an assumption. That\u2019s how \u201cLet\u2019s pass new health care tax laws so people will behave differently!\u201d becomes \u201cUgh, these idiots want to pretend new tax laws make people behave differently!\u201d\n\nThere are all sorts of detail-based critiques one can lodge against dynamic scoring, challenging the assumptions involved or making the case that it reaches the wrong conclusions. But revulsion at the basic concept just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nReform of the CBO shouldn\u2019t stop at dynamic scoring, though. The revelation by the broader public that someone like Jonathan Gruber played such a critical role in both the creation and the scoring of Obamacare revealed a longrunning problem: a serious lack of transparency on the part of CBO. Consider this:\n\n\u201cUnlike most federal and congressional agencies, Congress\u2019 nonpartisan budget scorekeeper appears to have no policy on conflicts of interest for their outside advisers. The Congressional Budget Office has two groups of external consultants\u2013the Panel of Health Advisers and the Panel of Economic Advisers\u2014made up of more than three dozen people, most PhD economists, who operate as a sounding board for CBO. While their functions and purpose differ, both are influential in their own right. And it appears that neither panel is required to let CBO know about other projects they may be working on, either on behalf of private industries that could have a financial interest in how CBO views federal spending, or the executive branch, which CBO was set up to act as a counterweight against. When asked if the agency has ethics requirements for advisers related to potential conflicts of interest, a CBO spokesperson said she was unable to comment on the record. She was also unable to comment on whether CBO\u2019s counsel reviews the activities of panel members to determine if any conflicts of interest exist, or if there are any policies that require members to notify CBO should conflicts arise during their time on the panels.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 13:36:23 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Reforming CBO to be more transparent and reasonable in its estimates is a good thing, not a war on math.", "title": "Yes, We Need CBO Reform", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/13946605527_82e5a3a848_b.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/01/13/yes-we-need-cbo-reform/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Reforming CBO to be more transparent and reasonable in its estimates is a good thing, not a war on math.", "title": "Yes, We Need CBO Reform", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/13946605527_82e5a3a848_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@bdomenech", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Budget", "tag": "CBO,Class Act,Congressional Budget Office,Doug Elmendorf,Jonathan Gruber", "published_time": "2015-01-13T13:36:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Reforming CBO to be more transparent and reasonable in its estimates is a good thing, not a war on math."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06ee\"", "article_summary": "But dynamic scoring is also a liberal bogeyman, particularly for Jonathan Chait, who pronounced the CBO reform a \u201cwar on math\u201d.\nReform of the CBO shouldn\u2019t stop at dynamic scoring, though.\nLast week the House voted to direct the Congressional Budget Office to use \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d of legislation.\n\u201cThe Congressional Budget Office is a 40-year-old institution that has acquired enormous clout within Washington by virtue of its reputation for ideological neutrality.\nWhen asked if the agency has ethics requirements for advisers related to potential conflicts of interest, a CBO spokesperson said she was unable to comment on the record."}
