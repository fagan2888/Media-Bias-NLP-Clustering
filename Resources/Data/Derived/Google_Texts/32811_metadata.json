Bremner was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, she said Thursday during a White House press call about the individual insurance market before passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAfter nearly five years of aggressive chemotherapy, immunotherapy, bone marrow harvests and more, my cancer has never returned, but since then I have waged a battle \u2014 a three-decade struggle to get quality, affordable coverage,\u201d said Bremner,\u201d a volunteer board member with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the group\u2019s advocacy arm. \u201cI was denied coverage outright more times than I can count and I was quoted sky high prices for flimsy plans numerous times. Discussions with insurers effectively ended as soon as I disclosed my long ago cancer diagnosis.\u201d\n\nBut the 2010 Affordable Care Act has made quality health insurance available to millions of people with cancer and other life threatening diseases, she said. Each plan must cover essential health benefits needed to prevent and treat cancer and other serious diseases. No plan can turn down people with pre-existing conditions or charge them more than someone who has never been sick, she said.\n\n\u201cI am so happy to say that I am now enrolled in a plan on California\u2019s marketplace, Coveragecalifornia.com,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m paying $628 less per month for better coverage than I had before and I get to keep all my same doctors. During the enrollment process, no asked if I ever had cancer.\u201d\n\nBesides marketplaces\u2013also known as exchanges\u2013the Affordable Care Act seeks to provide coverage to uninsured Americans by expanding Medicaid and changing insurance laws so that insurers cannot refuse coverage when it becomes too expensive.\n\nThe White House offered up Bremner\u2019s story Thursday, along with those of members of the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association, to help showcase the Affordable Care Act in an effort to brush back mounting criticism of the law since the flawed rollout of healthcare.gov. Technical problems have dogged the enrollment site since its Oct. 1 launch, but most of the problems have been repaired and an estimated 2 million people have signed up for private insurance. The White House hopes to have an estimated 7 million people enrolled by March 31, the deadline for coverage under the law.\n\n\u201cBefore the Affordable Care Act, health insurance did not provide a peace of mind,\u201d David Simas, White House Deputy Senior Advisor, said during Thursday\u2019s call. \u201cIn fact, the model for insurance before the Affordable Care Act was not to bring in as many people as possible. It was to bring in as many healthy people as possible and to put in barriers to either price out or to completely deny coverage for individuals who had pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act was passed, Simas said, up to 129 million Americans, or nearly 1 in 2 adults, could be discriminated against because of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, pregnancy and even acne.\n\n\u201cThis was the insurance market before the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThe insecurity that it brought people was a profound hindrance to the quintessential American ideal that if you work hard you could get ahead. For too many people, the insecurity and lack of peace of mind that came from knowing that you had a pre-existing condition and not wanting to expose yourself to the market was debilitating and kept people back.\u201d\n\nSimas and Bremner stressed that America cannot returned to the flawed health care system of the past.\n\n\u201cOne thing is for certain, people like me cannot go back to the flawed health care system that made this reform necessary,\u201d Bremner said \u201cOur lives depend on it.\u201d\n\nAlso On News One:", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Cancer Survivor: Before Obamacare, \u2018I Was Quoted Sky High Prices For Flimsy Plans\u2019", "image": "https://ionenewsone.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aca11.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1", "description": "When she was a college student 36 years ago, Lori G.
