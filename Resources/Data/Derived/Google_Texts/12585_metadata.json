And then he beat all political comers, becoming the first governor to win three four-year terms.\n\nHe crushed the century-old truism of a constitutionally weak governor because no one envisioned one executive owning every appointment in every agency for more than a decade. And while Perry didn\u2019t place the oil under the Texas soil, he relentlessly sold the economy that it helped foster. He slashed regulations and hawked the state as a place that smells like freedom and tastes like apple pie, pushing to keep it at the top in job creation and population growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a dynamic, growing state,\u201d Perry said in an interview with The Dallas Morning News. \u201cDid we get it all done? No. But I think we made extraordinary progress.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 47th governor will be remembered as the longest-serving chief executive who led a time of economic boom, even as the rest of the nation sank under a recession, observers said. But they add that his legacy also likely will reflect a shortsightedness.\n\nWhile growth was the ballyhooed golden child, the state\u2019s infrastructure and public education systems were its stepchildren, left to shoulder the brunt with hardly a nod to the increasing burden of a booming, changing population.\n\nPerry obviously now has his sights set on another presidential race, using his economic credentials as a starting block. He is impatient with the notion of an epilogue when there is more he wants to write.\n\n\u201cLegacy\u2019s going to be what the legacy\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf there was anything of great concern or note that I felt I hadn\u2019t accomplished, I would have run for re-election.\u201d\n\nFour more years? With Perry\u2019s political skills, it would have been entirely possible.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at him, you\u2019d say it was a time of great prosperity and he was an unbeatable politician,\u201d said Republican consultant Bill Miller.\n\nLongevity was key to making him the most powerful governor the state has known, but it was his skill as a political architect, capable of changing with the times, that got him there. Perry went from rural Democrat to pro-business Republican to tea party evangelical.\n\n\u201cPeople will say this guy was a hell of a politician,\u201d Miller said. \u201cLots of people tried to take him, and lots of people lost.\u201d\n\nOver his 14 years, Perry amassed control by placing loyalists into key jobs \u2014 making 8,000 appointments in all. His supporters are running institutions throughout Texas \u2014 its universities, regulatory agencies, courts, public schools and energy production, to name a few.\n\nThey shared his philosophy of business first, which he preached as the economic tide that raised all boats. Since Perry took office, the state has added almost 2 million new jobs and about 6 million people.\n\n\u201cSome have the bully pulpit,\u201d said outgoing Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who held office as a Republican throughout Perry\u2019s tenure. \u201cHe had the marketing pulpit.\u201d\n\nRice University political scientist Mark Jones said Perry took a fiscally conservative, pro-business philosophy that has dominated Texas politics for decades and elevated it to new heights.\n\nUnder Perry, the Texas model was portrayed as a gospel contrasted to the high-deficit, pork-barrel, partisan noise in Washington.\n\n\u201cHe certainly has left Texas a pro-growth, pro-business state,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOthers would criticize that he has not done enough for the poorest and those who have the least in our society.\u201d\n\nTexas leads the nation in adults and children without health insurance, while Perry has fought implementation of the Affordable Care Act as an intrusion by the federal government.\n\nWhile virtually every former governor had made boosting education the mainstay of his or her administration, Perry\u2019s loyalty was to a balanced budget without new taxes. He oversaw a $5.4 billion cut to public education in 2011 and also vetoed legislation that would have created full-day kindergarten and further limited the size of those classes.\n\nIn a state that leads the nation in greenhouse gas emissions, Perry worked to fast-track coal burning plants, streamline industrial regulation and limit citizen concerns in the permitting process.\n\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s going to be a partisan legacy, highly tempered by one\u2019s political position,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMany Republicans are going to remember him fondly, and almost all Democrats view his legacy in a much more negative light.\u201d\n\nDemocratic consultant Jason Stanford said Perry is a free-market ideologue. He suggests the governor has turned over much of the machinery that used to be state government to private contractors, including school curriculum, charter schools, toll roads, technology, Medicaid delivery and foster care.\n\n\u201cPrivate companies are doing government functions. That is a huge sea change in Texas,\u201d said Stanford, who ran Democrat Chris Bell\u2019s losing campaign against Perry in 2006.\n\nMuch of it has failed or spawned lawsuits or scandal, Stanford said. The Medicaid and food stamp services contract was canceled, as was one with IBM to take over state technology needs. The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas and Texas Enterprise Fund have raised charges of cronyism, leading to at least one indictment on a charge of favorable treatment with state funds.\n\nAnd Democrats have been powerless to stop much of the abuse, shortchanging and inside-dealing, Stanford said.\n\n\u201cHe has been ascendant at a time of comparative ineptness by the Democratic Party. We\u2019re flabby and weak. And only now is the next generation coming along to repair it,\u201d he said.\n\nPerry largely dismisses the naysayers. He points to an uptick in high school graduation rates, the largest reduction in pollution-causing emissions in the nation, and low taxes and limited government that have fueled tremendous growth.\n\nAs he likes to say, people vote with their feet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about results,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomist Ray Perryman said Perry helped lead major changes to reduce regulations and limit lawsuits, greatly enhancing the state\u2019s business climate. His Texas Enterprise Fund and Emerging Technology Fund have spent about $800 million, enticing companies to relocate or expand in Texas.\n\nThe state is No. 1 for exports and is now the home of 52 of the Fortune 500 companies. Texas has led the nation in job growth.\n\n\u201cFor all of these reasons, he justifiably ranks among the very best governors of Texas \u2014 or anywhere else, for that matter \u2014 in terms of proactive economic development programs,\u201d Perryman said.\n\nBut the applause has died down in recent years.\n\n\u201cHis agenda has become increasingly partisan over the years and included several items that are not in the best interest of long-term economic growth,\u201d Perryman said, citing the education cuts and the paltry investment in water development and roads.\n\nIn addition, the state has produced no \u201cTexas solution\u201d to address the health care needs of more than 2 million indigent people. It means Texas has forsaken billions of federal dollars available through the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\nThat political intransigence \u201cwill cost the economy hundreds of thousands of jobs, create a net loss in dynamic state revenues, impose additional local taxes to fund emergency care, create hundreds of millions of dollars in penalty taxes on small businesses and forgo an opportunity to significantly address the critical issue of uninsured Texans,\u201d Perryman said.\n\nOverall, Perry should get exceptional marks for economic development, but his record on \u201cfundamental issues that will drive long-term growth is less than stellar,\u201d Perryman said.\n\nPerry said that while Gov.-elect Greg Abbott will have much he wants to do, the problems he faces are likely the envy of 49 other states.\n\nHe pointed out that a $2 billion revolving fund is in place to help cities and counties keep water flowing. And newly dedicated oil and gas money will help fund new roadways.\n\nThe problems he leaves, Perry argued, are the outcroppings of tremendous growth.\n\nStates losing population \u201cbecause they put bad policies into place aren\u2019t having to worry about transportation funding because they don\u2019t need any new roads. Needing more roads is a good challenge to have,\u201d Perry said.\n\nBesides, Perry said, he didn\u2019t get everything he hoped for from the Legislature.\n\n\u201cWanting and getting are two different things in this building,\u201d he said in his Capitol office. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some pretty good progress.\u201d\n\nFollow Christy Hoppe on Twitter\n\nat @christyhoppe.\n\nRICK PERRY\u2019S TEXAS: THEN AND NOW\n\nTransportation\n\nPerry\u2019s attempt to tackle one of the state\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 traffic congestion \u2014 was one of his boldest moves as governor. He abandoned the pay-as-you-go highway funding model and in 2001 unveiled the plan for a Trans-Texas Corridor. The $175 billion project called for cutting a swath through Texas to lay 4,000 new miles of toll roads, high-speed rail, pipelines and utilities.\n\nPushback from landowners and lawmakers soon derailed the ambitious plan. Since then, Perry has pushed for roadway construction through toll roads and bond debt. Now residents are complaining about toll roads popping up like dandelions, and transportation experts warn that the state is falling far behind its burgeoning needs.\n\nPerry likes to point to 6,600 new lane-miles added during his tenure \u2014 the most in the nation. But a recent state comptroller\u2019s report looking at the past 25 years shows the state\u2019s population increasing 57 percent and road use growing by 95 percent, while road capacity inched up just 8 percent.\n\nEconomy\n\nPerry led the state through the harshest recession in decades, and Texas has come out on top, especially in job creation. He credits low taxes, predictable regulation, small government and limiting lawsuits, a banner he carries as a national model \u2014 and a potential presidential platform.\n\nWith the deal-closing Texas Enterprise Fund \u2014 created in 2003 and followed two years later by the Emerging Technology Fund \u2014 Perry has doled out about $800 million in corporate incentives. It has given him a high profile and made him a target of cronyism charges.\n\nPerry counters that his answer is all in the results. Since 2000, the state\u2019s population has increased by 12.7 percent, nearly twice the pace of growth nationally.\n\nSchools\n\nIn Texas, 1 out of every 3 dollars the state spends goes to education. When Perry had a choice of cutting big budget items or spending down the state\u2019s rainy day fund in 2011, he did not spare schools.\n\nThe Legislature cut $5.4 billion, providing no new money for enrollment growth for the first time in seven decades. School districts cut 11,000 teaching jobs. And the state requirement of a 22:1 ratio of elementary students to teachers took a huge hit. Almost 1,300 elementary schools \u2014 nearly 30 percent of campuses \u2014 exceeded the limit.\n\nSchool districts have won the first round of a lawsuit challenging the state over inadequate funding. While many of the cuts have been restored, Texas is still lagging most other states in educating its children.\n\nHigher education\n\nWith the stroke of his pen in 2003, Perry ushered one of the most sweeping policy changes in Texas higher education: He deregulated tuition. The Legislature had always set a ceiling to keep college affordable. But in another move to shift costs away from state government, Perry traded cuts to state higher education funding for allowing universities to set higher tuition rates. The change was immediate and dramatic, with ballooning tuition costs. More recently, his regents aggressively have confronted University of Texas administrators for, among other ills, enrolling less-qualified offspring of the well-connected. The publicity has shaken UT\u2019s national reputation and led to censure of one of Perry\u2019s appointees for over-meddling.\n\nChristy Hoppe\n\nPerry\u2019s biggest successes\n\nJobs: While other states withered, Texas bloomed. In the past five years, Texas has been the overwhelming national leader in adding jobs.\n\nHurricanes Ike and Katrina: In the face of nature\u2019s fury, Perry welcomed evacuees and led a swift emergency response.\n\nAbortion limits: He has signed into law some of the most sweeping abortion restrictions in the nation. And thus far, they have all withstood legal challenges.\n\nPerry\u2019s biggest misses\n\nOops: Perry\u2019s failure in a presidential debate to remember the third federal agency he proposed to abolish capped a miserable showing on the national stage and helped drain his political reserve in his home state.\n\nHPV vaccine: In 2007, Perry ordered that schoolgirls receive vaccination against the human papillomavirus, the most commonly sexually transmitted disease. The Legislature quickly shredded the order, and the effort casts a shadow on his conservative credentials.\n\nRosemary Lehmberg: Perry saw an opening to force out the Democratic district attorney of Travis County after her conviction for drunken driving in 2013. Instead, his threats and strong-arm tactics led to his indictment for coercion of a public official and abuse of office.\n\nA success and and a miss\n\nCPRIT: Perry decided Texas could lead in finding cancer breakthroughs. In 2007, he was instrumental in creating the $3 billion Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. But like his business incentive programs, the fund quickly became mired in charges of cronyism, with top Perry supporters snaring major grants. An executive was indicted on charges of inside dealing.
