We know you ostracize smokers by making them stand in forlorn spots at least 25 feet from a doorway, but this is ridiculous. We\u2019re like, hundreds of miles away.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like an inter-state version of a battle between neighbors in which one keeps his lawn pristine by using his leaf-blower to deposit his leaves onto his neighbor\u2019s property. Or, maybe more to the point, the person in front of you who keeps farting in your face.\n\nOnly those altercations don\u2019t usually reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThis one did because the Environmental Protection Agency (referred to, ironically, by Tea Party ilk, as an example of \u201cgovernment waste\u201d) tried to address this issue with the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which said, in effect, that it\u2019s not enough for upwind states to meet their own air pollution requirements, they have to reduce them even further because their resultant spewings are responsible for the downwind states\u2019 failure to meet their legal polluting limits, and incidentally, the deaths and incapacitation of tens of thousands of people. (More specifically, one in 20 deaths in the US, 200,000 nonfatal heart attacks, 90,000 hospital admissions and 2.5 million cases of aggravated asthma among children.)\n\nThe EPA came up with a formula involving cost-benefit analysis, pollution credits and similar measures that no one except accountants and attorneys can possibly understand. What\u2019s germane, though, is that the upwind states challenged the EPA\u2019s approach and last year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed with them, overturning the regulation by a score of 2-1.\n\nSo now the Supreme Court has it.\n\nMany of these same states are already at each other\u2019s throats over a health issue, namely the Affordable Care Act, with many states run by Republican governors opting not to create state exchanges offering coverage, because it\u2019s, you know, Obama-care.\n\nAnd The New York Times recently reported that a lone 3 Democratic senators stand in the way of the entire South being a solid block of \u201cred.\u201d\n\nSo, remember when Obama said, \u201cWe\u2019re not red states and blue states, we\u2019re the United States?\u201d\n\nFuhgeddaboutit.\n\nThere\u2019s also a pretty good chance we\u2019ll be subjected to a more entertaining variation of these \u201cair\u201d wars beginning next month in Colorado when recreational use of marijuana becomes legal, and we can look forward to downwind neighbors suing their pot-consuming \u201cupwinders\u201d with causing them second-hand highs, and indirectly getting their children stoned.\n\nAll of this finger-pointing sounds vaguely familiar\u2026\n\nI know! It\u2019s because in November, at a U.N. climate summit in Warsaw, 130 nations demanded that wealthy countries, and in particular the U.S., compensate poorer nations for natural disasters like Typhoon Haiyan and droughts because a contributing cause is man-made global warming, which industrial giants are disproportionately responsible for. And the \u201cbad\u201d weather gets dumped on them.\n\nAnd there you have it. The world in a nutshell. One part is always farting in another part\u2019s face.\n\nAnd passing the buck on passing the gas.\n\nRelated articles", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Article 3", "description": "Bob Dylan had it wrong: it\u2019s the question that\u2019s blowin\u2019 in the wind.
