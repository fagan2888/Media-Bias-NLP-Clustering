Lactation counseling/equipment. Plans must cover in-network, comprehensive prenatal and postnatal lactation support, counseling and equipment rental.\n\nPlus, if plan participants don\u2019t have access to in-network lactation counseling \u2014 a service that can\u2019t be limited to inpatient services \u2014 out-of-network services must be covered at no cost.\n\n2. Weight management. In response to a question about a plan\u2019s exclusion for weight management services for adult obesity, the DOL clarified that such exclusions aren\u2019t allowed. Plans must cover these weight management services for all adults, including those with certain risk factors.\n\n3. Colonoscopies. If it\u2019s scheduled and performed as a screening procedure, plans can\u2019t impose any cost-sharing on any required pre-procedure consultations or pathology exams on polyp biopsies.\n\n4. Religious accommodations. Certain companies \u2014 qualifying nonprofits, closely held for-profits \u2014 can apply for a religious accommodation to the contraceptive coverage rule by either:\n\nGiving a completed EBSA Form 700 to its TPA, or\n\nProviding appropriate notice of objection to HHS.\n\n5. BRCA testing. In cases where women are at an increased risk for BRCA mutations (i.e., breast cancer susceptibility genes), plans must cover BRCA testing and genetic counseling as a preventive service.\n\n6. Wellness rewards. Non-financial (or \u201cin-kind\u201d) incentives \u2014 such as water bottles, sports gear or gift cards \u2014 are subject to limits for wellness plan incentives under the ACA. The maximum incentive for a health-contingent wellness program under the ACA is 30% of the total coverage cost (50% for tobacco prevention/reduction programs).\n\n7. Mental health parity. In the FAQs the DOL clarified that plans can\u2019t refuse to disclose info to employees about medical necessity determinations regarding mental health or substance abuse (including denials) on the grounds the info is \u201cproprietary\u201d or has \u201ccommercial value.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "In its\u00a029th set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on the ACA, the DOL\u00a0covered everything from preventive services like lactation counseling/equipment to the Mental Health Parity Act.", "title": "Obamacare guidance covers much ground: 7 things you need to know", "url": "http://www.hrmorning.com/obamacare-guidance-covers-much-ground-7-things-you-need-to-know/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/HCReform.jpg", "height": 239}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, FAQ", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-28T12:00:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T00:36:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Weight management.\nMental health parity.\nPlans must cover these weight management services for all adults, including those with certain risk factors.\nIn response to a question about a plan\u2019s exclusion for weight management services for adult obesity, the DOL clarified that such exclusions aren\u2019t allowed.\nIn its 29th set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on the ACA, the DOL covered everything from preventive services like lactation counseling/equipment to the Mental Health Parity Act."}
