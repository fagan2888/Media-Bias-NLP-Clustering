Justin Morneau definitely has a number he’d like to wear for the Rockies, and it traces to his childhood.

He grew up in British Columbia idolizing Larry Walker. He played on Larry Walker Field as a kid. Walker, as Morneau put it during Friday’s conference call, showed him that it was possible to be a big leaguer. He and Walker are friends as Walker served as his hitting coach in the World Baseball Classic. Morneau would like to don No. 33 as a tribute to Walker. It’s likely that the Rockies will retire Walker’s number at some point, though Todd Helton is expected to be the first, according to owner Dick Monfort’s wishes last September.

As a result, it’s easy to see this happening. Morneau could wear it until it is taken out of circulation.

“The only reason I wouldn’t is if I didn’t feel like it was right. As far as No. 33 I don’t know if anyone has ever worn it since Larry. If the team was going retiring this year or next, I wouldn’t do it. Obviously, it’s the number I would like. It would be a good way of saying thank you to Larry. It would be a tribute,” Morneau said.

Morneau also was a hockey goalie like Walker. Morneau’s favorite player? Patrick Roy. He went to an Avs game on Tuesday and is hoping to meet Roy this spring.

“It’s kind of ironic that I ended up where Larry played and where Patrick was a star and is coaching,” Morneau said.
