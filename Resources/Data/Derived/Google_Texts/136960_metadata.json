John McCain (R-AZ) and his bid for re-election against conservative Arizona State Senator Kelli Ward (R-Lake Havasu City) in a Saturday email urging PAC supporters to back Ward.\n\nThe practicing emergency room physician recently returned from a trip to Washington, D.C. during which she met with conservatives pressing for their support.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe momentum is building for Conservative Republican Kelli Ward and with your help we can win this race! The most recent Gravis Marketing Survey shows Kelli Ward leading John McCain among Republican voters by a 9-point margin, 45% \u2013 36%,\u201d reads a portion of the CCC PAC message.\n\nMcCain\u2019s actions calling conservatives \u201cwhacko birds\u201d and \u201ccrazies\u201d was called out among the PAC\u2019s grievances against the over three-decade D.C. insider.\n\nIn January 2014 McCain\u2019s own party in Arizona censured the Senator for excessive liberal voting including support for the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty plan. At the time of the Arizona State Committeemen meeting censure of the Senator, six of the state\u2019s fifteen county parties had censured McCain.\n\nMaricopa County\u2019s Republican Party Committee was among those and cited a \u201clong and terrible record of drafting, co-sponsoring and voting for legislation best associated with liberal Democrats, such as Amnesty, funding for ObamaCare, the debt ceiling, liberal nominees, [and] assaults on the Constitution and 2nd amendment,\u201d as an explanation for their decision.\n\nSaturday\u2019s email noted the support for the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill at the top of a list of \u201cdisappointing\u201d McCain Senate votes. Second on the list of points against McCain was the censure.\n\nThird on the list of grievances was Gun Owners of America calling McCain \u201ca liberal in disguise.\u201d Also on the list of McCain votes disappointing to the PAC were funding for Obamacare, support of ObamaTrade, the Wall Street Bailout, supporting the \u201c$600 Million fiscal cliff tax increase,\u201d and raising the national debt 15 times.\n\nAs the CCC PAC email suggests, Ward has seen significant and growing support. In the first quarter of fundraising Ward\u2019s campaign raised over half a million, an achievement that at least in recent history has only been outdone by Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative Campaign Committee PAC came out swinging against Sen.
