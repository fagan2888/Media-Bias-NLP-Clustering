Chris Murphy chatted with middle-schoolers and manufacturers Friday as he paid visits to DePaolo Middle School and Smiths Medical products manufacturer.\n\nAbout 250 eighth-grade students came to the auditorium at DePaolo to hear Murphy talk about his career in politics and government.\n\nA former Southington resident, Murphy once served on the local Planning & Zoning Commission before going on to the state House of Representatives, the state Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, where he now serves.\n\n\u201cI was a part of a river cleanup crew back when the environmental movement was really starting back up again,\u201d the senator recalled. \u201cOne day I thought to myself \u2018Why are we doing this? Shouldn\u2019t someone from the government be doing something about it?\u2019 Then I started paying attention to who was running for office and me, along with a group of 15- and 16- year-old friends, started knocking on doors for those candidates who cared about what we cared about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was 21 when I ran for the state legislature,\u201d Murphy continued. \u201cI was up against someone who had been there for 14 years. My advantage was that he assumed I wasn\u2019t a threat until it was already too late. I knocked on every door in town twice and won over voters while he was doing nothing. People paid attention to me because I was young. Young people have a tremendous ability to make change in ways that people twice or three times your age don\u2019t. No change has ever occurred in this country without the youth fighting for it.\u201d\n\nMurphy then shared his concerns over global warming and encouraged the assembled youth to help combat it.\n\n\u201cThe world is warming at an extraordinary rate,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are saying that if we don\u2019t fix it now, it can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d\n\nOne student asked Murphy how he felt about insurance companies cutting off coverage for people\u2019s hearing aids once they reached 14 years old.\n\nMurphy said he would research the issue and put it on his agenda because it \u201cdidn\u2019t make sense.\u201d This earned wild applause and cheers from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly battling with insurance companies to encourage them to cover more things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are necessary, but they are in the business to make money. They spend as little on healthcare as they can get away with, denying care to make a profit.\u201d\n\nAnother student named McKenzie asked what sort of characteristics a senator should have.\n\nMurphy said a senator should have a lot of energy, love people and be thick-skinned.\n\nAnother asked Murphy about bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cI love working with Republicans, I really do,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf you want to get anything done in Washington today, you need Republican and Democratic support. I co-sponsored a mental health bill with Bill Cassidy, a tea party conservative from Louisiana, and I\u2019m a progressive Democrat from the Northeast. The idea was to show that while the two of us don\u2019t agree on a lot of issues, we can agree on this. Some people think that compromise is weakness, but I think that while you have to fight for what you believe in, you also have to recognize when it\u2019s the right time to compromise.\u201d\n\nMurphy concluded the presentation by encouraging students to reach out to him on social media and to fight for the change they wanted to see in the world. Murphy later complimented the students on their \u201cfantastic\u201d questions.\n\nChris Palmieri, Town Councilor and assistant principal at the school, thanked Murphy for coming.\n\n\u201cOur kids asked phenomenal questions and it\u2019s great to know that he will follow up on them,\u201d he said.\n\nLater, Murphy stopped in to Smiths Medical at 201 West Queen St. Company representatives discussed with him the impact of the Affordable Care Act on their medical product manufacturing business.\n\n\u201cThe Medical Device Tax put a halt on some of our plans when it took $2 million off of our bottom line,\u201d said Jeff Bowen, site coordinator. \u201cWe had just saved ourselves $1 million with a vertical integration project but this took it all away.\u201d\n\nBowen added that while his goal is to remain in Connecticut, a move to Mexico would cut costs in half.\n\n\u201cWhile it would be a big initial investment, it remains an attractive jump,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, I would rather that we are able to succeed here and my No. 1 priority is to keep jobs here. I enjoy being here and being a charitable member of the community, but eventually the costs of operation might make that impossible.\u201d\n\nMatthew Rousseau, materials manager with Smiths Medical, said the facility manufactures 2-million to 2.2-million catheters each week, which are sold \u201cmostly in the U.S.\u201d\n\nBrian M.
