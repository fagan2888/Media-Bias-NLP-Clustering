Cruz may say, it\u2019s clear what Rep. Garcia has said. She wants a pathway to citizenship. She said that in the sponsored resolution with the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators,\u201d Lambert said.\n\nLambert joined supporters in Nashua to watch the New England Patriots\u2019 season opener.\n\nJim Lawrence, the other Republican competing in the primary, was in Concord.\n\n\u201cThe voters are understanding that now I\u2019m the only Republican candidate that can unite the party to defeat Rep. Annie Kuster,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nGarcia\u2019s sights seemed set on November.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re just trying to look forward. Seems I\u2019ll have some success Tuesday. I appreciate everyone who has supported me, and we want to pick up right Wednesday morning and move forward,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nCruz also attended events in Manchester and Concord.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sun, 07 Sep 2014 19:40:04 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Texas Sen.
