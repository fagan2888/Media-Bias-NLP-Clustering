ST. LOUIS, Mo. — In Saturday night’s game against the St. Louis Blues, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy is sticking with the same lineup that produced Thursday’s 5-0 triumph against the New York Islanders.

Thus, Semyon Varlamov is the starter in goal and forward Daniel Briere and defenseman Zach Redmond will be the healthy scratches. Forward Jesse Winchester and defenseman Ryan Wilson remain out with injuries.

Roy isn’t changing a thing. Center Matt Duchene will continue to play with wingers Gabe Landeskog and Ryan O’Reilly on the Nine Line — sweater numbers 9, 92 and 90, respectively — and the other lines and defensive pairings are the same from Colorado’s best performance of the young season.

The Avs (3-4-4) are on a five-game points streak (2-0-3) and Varlamov has led the team to points in his last six starts.

St. Louis (5-3-1) will be without center Paul Stastny (shoulder), the former Av, and T.J. Oshie (concussion). Blues captain David Backes has been cleared to play after missing Thursday’s 2-0 win over Anaheim with a head injury, and center Joakim Lindstrom (bacteria infection) is questionable.
