MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama first lady Dianne Bentley has filed for divorce from Gov. Robert Bentley, saying their 50-year marriage has suffered an “irretrievable breakdown.”

The complaint, filed Friday, says that attempts at reconciliation are futile and that the couple has been living apart since January.

A lawyer for Dianne Bentley wrote that her client says “there is such a complete incompatibility of temperament that the parties can no longer live together.” The complaint says the couple’s personalities conflict.

The Bentleys have been married since 1965 and have four adult sons. In July, the couple marked their 50th wedding anniversary.

The office for the 72-year-old Robert Bentley didn’t respond to an immediate request for comment.

The complaint was filed in Tuscaloosa, the city the couple called home for most of their marriage.
