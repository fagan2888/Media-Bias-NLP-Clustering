Then again Powell also came out in support of ObamaCare and just about anything Obama did in the hopes of landing a job. So far it hasn't worked out, but Powell seems too bitter and angry to stop trying.\n\nPowell's hostility to Israel is nothing new. He was blasted for his wishy-washy response to an invitation to Farrakhan's Million Man March. Colin Powell initially claimed a scheduling conflict, then under pressure criticized Farrakhan's anti-Semitism, but also praised him for bringing black people together.\n\n(Back then collaborating with Farrakhan was still considered a disqualifier. But later Richard Cohen would praise Obama despite his own presence at Farrakhan's rally.)\n\nThen in Jamaica, there were photos of Farrakhan and Powell palling around like good friends. (photo via Doug Rink)\n\nPowell had also defended Hagel, an Iran Lobby man, for talking about the \"Jewish Lobby\", but claimed that calling Obama lazy is racist.\n\nOf course Colin Powell doesn't have much national security credibility left considering his seeming affair with a Romanian politician and diplomat.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "But Powell claimed that calling Obama lazy is racist", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "But Powell claimed that calling Obama lazy is racist", "title": "Farrakhan Pal Colin Powell Backs Iran Deal", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/260045/farrakhan-pal-colin-powell-backs-iran-deal-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-09-07T11:52:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/260045/farrakhan-pal-colin-powell-backs-iran-deal-daniel-greenfield", "description": "But Powell claimed that calling Obama lazy is racist", "card": "summary", "title": "Farrakhan Pal Colin Powell Backs Iran Deal"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T22:15:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-07T11:52:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Of course Colin Powell doesn't have much national security credibility left considering his seeming affair with a Romanian politician and diplomat.\nDisgraced former Secretary of State Colin Powell has come out in support of the Iran Deal.\nColin Powell initially claimed a scheduling conflict, then under pressure criticized Farrakhan's anti-Semitism, but also praised him for bringing black people together.\n(photo via Doug Rink)Powell had also defended Hagel, an Iran Lobby man, for talking about the \"Jewish Lobby\", but claimed that calling Obama lazy is racist.\nThen in Jamaica, there were photos of Farrakhan and Powell palling around like good friends."}
