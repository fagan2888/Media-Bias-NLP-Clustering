Friends will join the family for a funeral for a black college football player shot fatally by a North Texas police officer answering a burglary call at a car dealership.

The funeral for 19-year-old Christian Taylor is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Saturday at the Koinonia (koyn-oh-NEE'-uh) Christian Church in Arlington.

Taylor was unarmed when he was fatally shot Aug. 7 by an Arlington police officer responding to an after-hours burglary call. Security footage of the dealership lot shows Taylor busting out a car windshield, then driving his vehicle into the showroom.

Taylor was fatally shot while inside the business.

The rookie police officer who shot the Angelo State University student was fired Tuesday.
