× Sparks Regional Medical Center To Host Health Care Event

If people are having trouble understanding their options for the online Health Insurance Marketplace, applications counselors will be available during a health insurance event at the Sparks Regional Medical Center, according to a news release from Alicia Agent, Community Relations & Events Manager for Sparks Health System.

The event will be from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Friday (March 21) in the Shuffield Education Center inside Sparks Regional Medical Center on Towson Avenue.

“The Affordable Care Act requires that most Americans obtain health insurance by March 31, 2014, or pay a tax penalty. The penalty will be applied to a resident’s annual taxable income for each month the person does not have health insurance after that,” the news release states.

Application counselors on site will be available to help area residents determine which option is best for them.

The event is free, and there is no registration necessary, according to the news release.

Everyone will be helped on a first come, first served basis.
