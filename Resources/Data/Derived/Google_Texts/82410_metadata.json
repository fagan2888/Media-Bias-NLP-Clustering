Yes, 2013 still ends on Dec. 31, and after that date, there\u2019s not much you can do to impact your taxes.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know, and what you can still do, to save money on your tax bill.\n\nTAX CHANGES\n\nThis is the depressing part.\n\nFor starters, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re in a higher tax bracket than you were in 2012. You can look up your bracket here.\n\nTaxpayers had enjoyed a two-year break on Social Security taxes, but now, no matter what you earn, you\u2019ll pay more.\n\nAdieu to the lower 4.3% Social Security tax, and a grudging welcome back to the 6.2% rate.\n\nHigh wage earners will feel the biggest bite, with those people chasing down \u201cmillionaire\u201d status \u2014 marrieds who earn more than $450,000, heads of household who bring in more than $425,000 and singles who earn more than $400,000 \u2014 facing a top tax rate of 39.6%.\n\nThose same folks are seeing higher rates \u2014 20% up from 15% \u2014 on capital gains and qualified dividends.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Medicare surtax, which is 1.45% \u2014 unless you\u2019re a high wage earner. You\u2019ll pay an extra 0.9% Medicare surtax if you\u2019re a single person or head of household who earns more than $200,000, or if you\u2019re married filing jointly and earn more than $250,000.\n\nThose same earners will also see a fat 3.8% percent Medicare tax on net investment income. This so-called \u201cObamacare surtax\u201d or \u201chealth care surtax\u201d is due on interest, dividends, rents, royalties, capital gains and annuities.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nWhile the personal exemption rises to $3,900, there\u2019s a new phase-out for high wage earners. Singles with adjusted gross incomes of $250,000, or marrieds with AGI of $300,000, will start to see the phase-out. It phases out completely at $372,500 for singles and $422,500 for marrieds.\n\nThose same high earners will see new limits for itemized deductions for 2013.\n\nTAX-LOWERING STRATEGIES\n\nThough the countdown clock to Dec. 31 is ticking, you still have time to limit the damage these new rules will do to your overall tax bill.\n\n1. Save more\n\nYou can save up to $17,500 in your 401(k) for 2013, and if you\u2019re over age 50, you can save $23,000. If you haven\u2019t started saving this year, it\u2019s not too late. Ask your benefits administrator if you can accelerate your contributions so you can come close to the max \u2014 if you can afford it.\n\nEvery penny you save will lower your taxable income for the year because you\u2019re saving pre-tax dollars \u2014 but you have to save it by December 31.\n\nIf you choose to save in a Roth 401(k), you won\u2019t get the deduction today, but there are future tax benefits.\n\nThere\u2019s more time to fund an IRA, but this will only help you on taxes if you can deduct your contributions. That deadline is the same as your tax filing day, April 15.\n\nFor the 2013 tax year, you can save $5,500 in an IRA, or $6,500 if you\u2019re over age 50.\n\nA tip for next year: start your 401(k) and IRA savings early in the year. That will allow you to contribute smaller amounts each week, and going on auto-pilot will give you one less thing to worry about.\n\n2. Fix your hangnail\n\nIt\u2019s a lot harder to accumulate enough medical expenses to reach 2013\u2019s higher threshold. While you used to be able to deduct your medical costs once they exceeded 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, starting with your 2013 return, medical costs must exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income.\n\nIf you\u2019re over age 65, you have a few more years before 10% becomes your number. You can still use the 7.5% number until Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nBeginning Jan. 1, 2017, all taxpayers are in the 10% boat, no matter their age.\n\nYou still have a few months to see all your doctors, specialists and have that procedure you\u2019ve been putting off. If you can bunch together your medical expenses, you\u2019ll have an easier time hitting the 10% threshold.\n\n3. Keep my check, please\n\nIf you think 2013 will be a tough tax year for you, but have enough cash on hand to make it through the end of the year, consider asking your employer or clients to withhold payments to you until after Dec. 31.\n\nThis will lower your taxable income for the year, but it also means you\u2019ll have to find another way to pay your bills. And it comes with the huge caveat: If you kick the can down the road, you could wind up with a higher-than-expected taxable income for 2014.\n\n4. Give it away\n\nIncreasing your charitable donations is another way to lower your tax burden for the year.\n\nDonating appreciated stock is one option. You\u2019ll get the charitable write-off, and you\u2019ll also avoid paying the new, higher capital gains tax on the sale of the security.\n\nAnother option is to donate your Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your retirement plans. If you use a \u201cQualified Charitable Distribution,\u201d the RMD money you give to charity won\u2019t be counted as your taxable income. But the IRS won\u2019t let you have it both ways. You can\u2019t claim a Qualified Charitable Distribution as a charitable donation.\n\n5. Check your investments\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken profits by selling winning stocks or mutual funds during the year, consider selling some losers, too, so you can offset the gains.\n\n6. Check your credits, mom and dad\n\nA batch of credits loved by families across the fruited plains were extended until 2017:\n\n\u2022The Child Tax Credit\n\n\u2022The Earned Income Tax Credit\n\n\u2022The American Opportunity Tax Credit\n\nAnd the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit was made permanent.\n\n7. Invest in a good CPA\n\nIt seems the tax code gets more complicated every year, and while you may try to keep up, consider enlisting the help of someone for whom the tax code is already a full-time job.\n\nYou can look for a certified public accountant through the American Institute of CPAs.\n\nHave a topic you\u2019d like to see covered in How To Not Suck?
