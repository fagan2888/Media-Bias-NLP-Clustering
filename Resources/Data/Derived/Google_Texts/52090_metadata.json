The small business celebrated its 20th anniversary on December 17.\n\nETD Inc. has had important roles in countless development projects on the Navajo Nation and other reservations. ETD Inc. facilitates the development of community based land use plans, ensures an appropriate level of environmental compliance, incorporates environmental planning into various design and engineering projects of their clients, and collects community feedback, often required for planning and by the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nEunice Tso started the company to provide professional services on tribal land.\n\n\u201cI saw a need and I knew I could do the work,\u201d Tso said. \u201cBy then I had already written a few environmental assessments during the time I worked in the Navajo Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program. I returned to Northern Arizona where I later received a Master's Degree in Geology with an emphasis in Environmental Geology.\u201d\n\nToday, Tso has over 20 years of experience in providing environmental consultation services. She has a deep understanding of the regulations that govern development on tribal lands and is able to navigate the often complex situations that result from federal and tribal governments' dual authority over environmental permitting. Her background in geology gives her a strong understanding of land, water and mineral resources on tribal land.\n\nTso says that key to her success is her background and knowledge of tribal cultures, history, and socio-economic conditions.\n\n\u201cI understand the underlying issues facing Native communities and I dedicate my work to strengthen their capacity to manage their land and to create opportunities for economic development, which in turn generates local jobs and tax revenue for community projects,\u201d she said.\n\nTso feels fortunate to be where she is today and to have the opportunity to help empower communities and tribal entities. \u201cI think our work is very interesting and I am fortunate to have a career where each day is different because each project is tailored to a specific community.\u201d Tso continued.\n\nETD Inc. is well known for delivering high quality work to its clients in Indian country. Last week, Navajo Division of Transportation, Road Maintenance Department Manager, Ray Russell wrote on ETD Inc.\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cETD Inc. is most ethical and productive in this distinct period in procession of change in native economic advancement toward a better, more compete and modern condition, mainly on the Navajo Nation.\u201d\n\nETD Inc. is certified by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and holds a Priority 1 Vendor status with the Navajo Nation.\n\nTso added, \u201cWe are working toward getting more federal contracts. I am confident that with the help of my young team of professionals, we will take this company to the next level.\u201d\n\nFor more information or to contact ETD Inc. visit, etd-inc.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since 1995, ETD Inc.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/28/navajo-woman-owned-small-business-celebrates-20-years-162890", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/_mg_2746_fn.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Navajo Woman-Owned Small Business Celebrates 20 Years"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-12-28T11:11-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/28/navajo-woman-owned-small-business-celebrates-20-years-162890", "dc": {"title": "Navajo Woman-Owned Small Business Celebrates 20 Years"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Navajo Woman-Owned Small Business Celebrates 20 Years"}, "article_summary": "Her background in geology gives her a strong understanding of land, water and mineral resources on tribal land.\nETD Inc. has had important roles in countless development projects on the Navajo Nation and other reservations.\n\u201cI saw a need and I knew I could do the work,\u201d Tso said.\nEunice Tso started the company to provide professional services on tribal land.\n\u201cBy then I had already written a few environmental assessments during the time I worked in the Navajo Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program."}
