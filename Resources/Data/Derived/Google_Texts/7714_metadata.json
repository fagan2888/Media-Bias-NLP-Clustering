Andy Slavitt, Acting Administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) that a \u201cfair portion\u201d of the losses would be recovered in the event that an Obamacare exchange sank. Americans for Tax Reform feels that the \u201cfair portion\u201d should be close to 100 percent since the federal government doled out $5.5 billion in taxpayer dollars to help fund President Obama\u2019s health care reform. So far, the recovery totals are \u201cnon-existent,\u201d with hundreds of millions of dollars being misappropriated:\n\nTo date, recovery of the billions in wasted state exchange funds has been near non-existent, despite failed exchanges in Oregon, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Nevada costing taxpayers $733 million. In fact, according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, these four states have returned ZERO dollars to the federal government, and state exchanges collectively have so far returned just $1 million. But the waste doesn\u2019t end there, as \u201cworking\u201d state exchanges including Vermont, Minnesota, Maryland, and Massachusetts have each misused as much as hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds. Further, an investigation led by House Energy and Commerce Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) found that federal officials were unable to provide information on the long-term sustainability of remaining exchanges, and were unable to defend the four failed state exchanges. This investigation also raised concerns that failed exchanges may have improperly kept user fees even after transferring all functionality to the federally run Healthcare.gov. Of all state exchange failures, the most alarming story is undoubtedly Cover Oregon. A recently uncovered email confirmed the accusations that the $305 million exchange was run by partisan political advisors focused solely on then-Governor John Kitzhaber\u2019s 2014 reelection.\n\nOn top of this mess, there\u2019s the whole other fact that premiums under Obamacare are set to spike this year. In North Carolina, health care companies, like Blue Cross and Blue Shield, might have to withdraw from the Obamacare market since five percent of their Obamacare recipients consumed $830 million in health care costs, while only receiving $75 million in premiums; that\u2019s with the subsidy. The whole law is an abject disaster. How do we know this? The very people it\u2019s meant to help are paying the penalty to remain uninsured\u2026because it\u2019s more economical for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "recovery effort of those funds has been a disaster.05/27/2016 3:00:21AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "recovery effort of those funds has been a disaster", "title": "Trainwreck: Billions Have Been Wasted On Failed Obamacare Exchanges", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/11/great-success-billions-have-been-wasted-on-failed-obamacare-exchanges-n2130976", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/310/2015-11-06T125320Z_1_LYNXNPEBA50O4_RTROPTP_3_INDONESIA-ECONOMY-TERM-DEPOSITS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "recovery effort of those funds has been a disaster", "title": "Trainwreck: Billions Have Been Wasted On Failed Obamacare Exchanges", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/11/great-success-billions-have-been-wasted-on-failed-obamacare-exchanges-n2130976", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/310/2015-11-06T125320Z_1_LYNXNPEBA50O4_RTROPTP_3_INDONESIA-ECONOMY-TERM-DEPOSITS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trainwreck: Billions Have Been Wasted On Failed Obamacare Exchanges , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The last remaining Obamacare exchanges are on the brink of collapse, and billions have been wasted on the ones that did fail.\nThis investigation also raised concerns that failed exchanges may have improperly kept user fees even after transferring all functionality to the federally run Healthcare.gov.\nBut the waste doesn\u2019t end there, as \u201cworking\u201d state exchanges including Vermont, Minnesota, Maryland, and Massachusetts have each misused as much as hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds.\nOf all state exchange failures, the most alarming story is undoubtedly Cover Oregon.\nAndy Slavitt, Acting Administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told Sen.
