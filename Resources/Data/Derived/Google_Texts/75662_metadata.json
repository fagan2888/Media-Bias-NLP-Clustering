First, it erased a 14% gain from a 21.70 buy point. Stocks that give up a significant profit should be sold.\n\nThe stock also breached its 50-day line in heavy volume, another sign of weakness.\n\nJetBlue and other airlines had been getting a boost from lower oil prices, but fears of a slowdown in economic growth are weighing on the industry.\n\nSeveral other Spotlight names faltered after enjoying a nice runup. AMN Healthcare (AHS) gapped down and slid as much as 9% Friday, undercutting a 32.63 buy point of a flat base after the stock had been up as much as 14%.\n\nAMN later pared most of its losses after getting support near the 50-day line. Yet few stocks can buck a market correction, even ones like AMN that enjoy best-possible 99 Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings.\n\nFlorida-based property and casualty insurer Universal Insurance (UVE) scored a trifecta \u2014 round-tripping a 15% gain past a 27.49 entry, slicing through its 50-day line in heavy volume and then falling 8% below the buy point. All were sell signals.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC) fell 8% below a 39.27 entry of a double-bottom base that it cleared Monday in heavy volume. The provider of cloud-based human resources management software has reported two straight quarters of triple-digit profit growth.\n\nHowever, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has slipped to a neutral C, indicating a standoff between buyers and sellers.\n\nMolina Healthcare (MOH), a provider of managed health care services for low-income families, erased an 11% gain past a 74.08 flat base entry. Like AMN, Molina pared losses sharply after getting support near its 50-day line. It ended back above the buy point, but buying on weakness is risky.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A handful of leading stocks triggered sell signals Friday as the market sold off sharply.
