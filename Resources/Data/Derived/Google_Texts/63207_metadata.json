A combined research effort from Germany and Austria investigated why people enjoy playing video games and what benefits they may be providing the autism community. The study, published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, found non-violent storytelling games could actually be helpful in curbing certain social aspects of autism.\n\n\"The motivation to engage in and enjoy video games corresponds with principals that apply to human motivation in general,\" said the study\u2019s lead author Daniel Bormann of the University of Freiburg, in a press release. \"For instance, successful game franchises offer players a spectrum of meaningful choices to shape the game's narrative and environment, provide carefully balanced challenges, or encourage players to experience social connectedness and meaningful social interactions.\"\n\nThe entire concept is based on immersion and the \u201ctheory of mind,\u201d which explores how storytelling allows players to access the mental states of others. A player experiences immersion in a video game much like a moviegoer. There is a sensation of being transported into the movie\u2019s time, place, and feeling, as if you are experiencing the journey and feeling the emotional impact of the lead character\u2019s fate.\n\nResearchers tested two different video games on randomly assigned participants. One group played Gone Home, which involved players returning home from college to find an empty house; their goal was to figure out what happened to their family members using clues. The second game was Against the Wall, in which players scaled a wall with interactive bricks. This game, however, provided no story line or character development.\n\nChildren with autism often experience difficulty with social interactions, communication challenges, and the tendency to engage in repetitive behaviors, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, according to Autism Speaks. Based on this understanding, researchers realized socially interactive video games could simulate the real world to help kids practice empathy and understanding toward other people.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of playing the games, participants\u2019 facial expressions were measured to evaluate each player\u2019s ability to understand other people\u2019s emotional states, which ultimately tests theory of mind. Story telling games like Gone Home reinforced players' ability to perceive opportunities for meaningful choices and relationships, while Against the Wall fell flat on fostering opportunities to improve social skills. Bormann believes non-violent storytelling games could provide a motivational and immersive experience for students so they can build on daily interactions in the outside world.\n\n\"Although the effects regarding theory of mind were relatively small,\" Bormann said, \u201cwe were excited to see initial evidence for the short-term enhancement through in-game storytelling. Importantly, this effect was specific to the condition in which participants actively engaged in the games narration, while the mere exposure to the narrative video game did not affect theory of mind, in comparison to playing a neutral video game.\"\n\nOne in 43 boys are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder compared to 1 in 189 girls, according to Autism Speaks. Boys play more video games than girls across the board, according to the Pew Research Center. Based on these findings, parents who bring the right kind of video games into the household could play an important part in improving their child\u2019s social skills.\n\n\"If further research could reveal how exactly in-game storytelling affects theory of mind,\u201d Bormann said, \u201cclinicians and software developers could utilize this knowledge to develop tools to aid the treatment of disorders characterized by social-interaction impairments, like autistic disorders.\"\n\nSource: Bormann D and Greitemeyer T.
