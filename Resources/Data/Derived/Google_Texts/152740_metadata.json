Originally in support of president Barack Obama\u2019s health-care reform, the Affordable Care Act, and first posted in September 2009, it read: \u201cNo one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. If you agree, post this as your status for the rest of the day\u201d.\n\nIt did well in its original form (470,000 exact copies of the status in the first month alone) but it quickly began evolving. First there were insubstantial changes in wording; then people began making jokes that played off it, turning it into a statement about other diseases like cancer; and finally some began shifting it into a political message against Obamacare instead of for it. By taking note of the political leanings of each person who posted it, Facebook\u2019s analysts were able to track the evolution of the meme from its origins on the left to its culmination on right, where people posted variants of \u201cNo one should go broke because government taxes and spends.\u201d\n\nEvolution of the meme, from \u201cvery liberal\u201d (-2) users to \u201cvery conservative\u201d (+2) (Facebook Data Team)\n\nSo there you have it: Just as we made the magnificent transition from single cells to meme-creators with a series of random mutations, a meme in support of healthcare reform went from zombies to beer to anti-Obama outrage.
