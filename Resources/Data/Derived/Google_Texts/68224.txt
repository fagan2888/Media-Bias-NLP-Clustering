× Cow Escapes Butcher Shop In Idaho

IDAHO (HUFFINGTON POST) – Every dog has his day, but that doesn’t apply to cows, apparently.

A 1,000 pound Idaho cow was able to escape from a butcher shop while being prepared for slaughter on Dec. 12, according to a report from the Huffington Post.

The cow jumped a six foot fence and then led police on pursuit through town, damaging three vehicles, the Huffington Post reported.

Being shot through the head wasn’t enough to kill the animal, but it was later cornered and killed, according to the Huffington Post.
