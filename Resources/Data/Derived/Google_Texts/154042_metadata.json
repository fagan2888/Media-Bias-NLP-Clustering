All the hospitals had bad debt that was approaching between 15 percent and 25 percent in some cases,\" he said. \"Ours were a little under 20 percent. And that has gone down substantially because people have coverage. They can pay.\"\n\nMiller is one of the longest-serving CEOs in America\u201437 years at the helm.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obamacare has failed to deter emergency room visits because many patients still have no other choice, says Universal Health Services' Alan Miller.", "author": "Matthew J.
