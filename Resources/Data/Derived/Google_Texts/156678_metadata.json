And it\u2019s clear from early indications, with regard to the 2016 presidential race, that the same modus operandi will be employed against those critical of Hillary Clinton. Only this time, it will be gender based \u2013 the charge of sexism.\n\nDuring the Obama tenure, the charge of \u201cracist\u201d has been unavoidable to any who were critical of the president. Whether it was criticism of Obamacare, lack of transparency, fiscal profligacy, inscrutable foreign policy, class-envy fomentation, and anti-capitalist policies, it didn\u2019t matter. Regardless of the logic, data, facts, or strength of argument, if you opposed the administration\u2019s policies and initiatives, you were a racist. At least according to the sycophants, who were either oblivious to logic, data, or facts, and had an empty logical quiver from which to fire back with anything except blanks.\n\nAnd what\u2019s pathetic, from a free speech, open discourse, and cogent political discourse perspective, is that it worked. The millions of Americans who flocked to Tea Party rallies, Glenn Beck confabs, and other conservative functions were successfully labeled \u201cracists\u201d because of their opposition to the liberal, destructive policies of the administration. It didn\u2019t matter what color, race, creed, or socio-economic status they hailed from; they were all racists.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFor some reason, the fact that the policies propounded and foisted on the nation the past six years are not race-based seems lost on the vapid purveyors of the \u201cracist\u201d tactic. Big government, massive debt, onerous regulations, expansive government control, and the concomitant loss of personal liberty are naturally opposed not because they might be advanced by someone of a certain color, ethnic background, or native language. They\u2019re opposed because they\u2019re antithetical to the founding principles of our republic! It matters not who is foisting the destructive policies and ideology on the nation; it matters that they\u2019re distinctly anti-American. Conservative Ben Carson\u2019s current lead in the crowded GOP primary race underscores that fact.\n\nWhat\u2019s brilliant about the tactic is that you don\u2019t have to worry about any facts, data, or common sense to employ it. Just by hurling the accusation, several things have been accomplished with one fell swoop. 1) The argument has been misdirected, so it\u2019s no longer about the policies or the substance of the disagreement; it\u2019s now whether the dissenter is truly racist or not. 2) It neutralizes and diminishes the objections of the dissenter; for now, the greater issue is whether he is in fact racist, or not. And 3) it successfully stifles dissent, since no one, probably even real racists, likes to be called one; so why go out on a limb and face the probability of such an accusation?\n\nAnd now it appears that Hillary Clinton supporters will use the same tactic. Just last month, a pro-Hillary group, self-dubbed the HRC Super Volunteers, warned journalists that they were going to be watching vigilantly how the media reports on Hillary\u2019s campaign. Group member and co-founder John West was thoughtful enough to serve as an early warning system on the words that cannot, I repeat, cannot be used to describe the probable Democrat candidate for president. According to West, \u201cpolarizing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d \u201cinsincere,\u201d \u201cambitious,\u201d \u201cinevitable,\u201d \u201centitled,\u201d \u201cover-confident,\u201d \u201csecretive,\u201d \u201cwill do anything to win,\u201d \u201crepresents the past,\u201d and \u201cout of touch,\u201d are all apparently sexist code-words that the media are not to use when describing the candidate.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nAccording to West, \u201cAlready we have seen the coded language of sexism and innuendo used by major news outlets and we are not happy.\u201d As a student of language and etymology, I have to admit I was unaware those words and phrases were definitionally sexist.\n\nBut alas, I shouldn\u2019t let myself fall into their misdirection and accusatory trap. It\u2019s not that those words are sexist, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re so accurately descriptive of the presumptive Democrat nominee that using the terms will earn the consternation of Hillary devotees, hence justifying accusations of sexism. By couching those terms in a sexist context, they can as easily avert factual criticism of Hillary as they did in protecting Obama. Just like the accusations of \u201cracism,\u201d it has nothing to do with what is true or what is factual; it has everything to do with ensuring electoral success and neutralizing the opposition by attempting to shape and control the language.\n\nThose of us who are bitter clingers to our freedom, our liberties, and the principles the nation was founded on shouldn\u2019t allow ourselves to be rebuffed or silenced by the non-thinking Alynski devotees who utilize these nefarious and polarizing tactics. And remember, if that\u2019s their primary tool to fight back with, you know that logically you\u2019ve already won because their only defense is casting aspersions ad hominem.\n\nThere are two things even more disturbing than a group attempting to regulate political speech. One, that the liberal-biased media may well comply, and play their game; and two, that for a large segment of our unenlightened and uninformed electorate, their \u201csexist\u201d tactic will work.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those of us who are bitter clingers to our freedom, our liberties, and the principles the nation was founded on shouldn\u2019t allow ourselves to be rebuffed or silenced.", "author": "Richard Larsen", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Those of us who are bitter clingers to our freedom, our liberties, and the principles the nation was founded on shouldn\u2019t allow ourselves to be rebuffed or silenced.", "title": "How The Left Uses 'Racism' And 'Sexism' To Silence The Right", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10683705_10152650630716749_6254158267677994776_o.jpg", "height": 803}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/how-the-left-uses-racism-and-sexism-to-silence-the-right/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Those of us who are bitter clingers to our freedom, our liberties, and the principles the nation was founded on shouldn\u2019t allow ourselves to be rebuffed or silenced.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10683705_10152650630716749_6254158267677994776_o.jpg", "title": "How The Left Uses 'Racism' And 'Sexism' To Silence The Right", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-18T11:47:03-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "Racism", "published_time": "2015-05-18T11:47:03-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack obama, conservatism, hillary clinton, liberalism, liberals, media bias, racism, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "One, that the liberal-biased media may well comply, and play their game; and two, that for a large segment of our unenlightened and uninformed electorate, their \u201csexist\u201d tactic will work.\nIt matters not who is foisting the destructive policies and ideology on the nation; it matters that they\u2019re distinctly anti-American.\nRegardless of the logic, data, facts, or strength of argument, if you opposed the administration\u2019s policies and initiatives, you were a racist.\nDuring the Obama tenure, the charge of \u201cracist\u201d has been unavoidable to any who were critical of the president.\nWhether it was criticism of Obamacare, lack of transparency, fiscal profligacy, inscrutable foreign policy, class-envy fomentation, and anti-capitalist policies, it didn\u2019t matter."}
