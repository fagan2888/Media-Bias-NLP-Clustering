Rick Scott's office.\n\nAHCA Secretary Liz Dudek on July 17 sent a letter that requested hospitals and insurers certify that they did not exceed a limit on Medicaid payment rates. That limit is 120 percent of a Medicaid fee schedule.\n\nThe hospitals that will be audited did not respond to the request or did not meet an Aug. 1 deadline. The hospitals are scattered throughout the state.\n\nMost Medicaid beneficiaries are required to enroll in managed-care plans, as lawmakers and Scott have sought to better control the costs of the program.\n\nBut in the July 17 letter, Dudek wrote that the agency has \"grave concerns that hospital contractual arrangements may have ballooned to unreasonable proportions and higher than what is allowed by state law.\"\n\nAccording to the Governor\u2019s Office, the following hospitals will be audited by the Office of Medicaid Program Integrity for either not responding to the request, indicated by an asterisk, or for failing to provide information by the deadline:\n\n\u00b7 Cleveland Clinic Hospital *\n\n\u00b7 Baptist Hospital Physicians Regional Medical Center \u2013 Collier Boulevard\n\n\u00b7 Physicians Regional Medical Center \u2013 Pine Ridge\n\n\u00b7 Flagler Hospital\n\n\u00b7 Venice Regional Bayfront Health\n\n\u00b7 Bay Medical Center an affiliate of Sacred Heart Health System (Editor's note: an earlier version of this story incorrectly identified this facility.)\n\n\u00b7 Bayfront Health Punta Gorda\n\n\u00b7 Calhoun-Liberty Hospital\n\n\u00b7 Campbellton-Graceville Hospital *\n\n\u00b7 Doctor\u2019s Memorial Hospital\n\n\u00b7 Healthmark Regional Medical Center\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 Melbourne\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 Ocala\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 The Palm Beaches\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 Bay Area \u2013 St. Petersburg\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 Bay Area \u2013 Tampa\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 Central Tampa\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 North Florida\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 South Florida \u2013 Coral Gables\n\n\u00b7 Kindred Hospital \u2013 South Florida \u2013 Ft.
