He roamed far, wide and often within sight of delighted tourists and their cameras. He was captured, collared and released by biologists 17 times, making him \u201cone of the most studied bears,\u201d in the region, according to the Seattle Times.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

At 25 years old, he was elderly.\n\nThey were right that his time was short. But Scarface didn\u2019t die of natural causes. Last week, the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department released a statement that said No. 211 had been fatally shot in November near Gardiner, Mont., just outside Yellowstone\u2019s northern edge.\n\nThe bear\u2019s death is now under investigation by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, because grizzly bears are protected under the Endangered Species Act, and most killings not carried out in self-defense are illegal. The Montana state agency offered no details about the the killing or why it was not announced sooner, and a Fish and Wildlife representative contacted by the Washington Post declined to comment.\n\nThe killing of the famous bear is sure to fuel opposition to recent Fish and Wildlife proposal to remove federal protections for grizzly bears in the so-called Greater Yellowstone Area, which could lead Montana, Idaho and Wyoming to approve their hunting. Grizzlies were declared threatened in the 1970s, when hunting, trapping and other issues caused their population to decline to less than 150.\n\nFederal officials say the bears\u2019 population has recovered, but many conservation and wildlife organizations are fighting the proposal. The Sierra Club, for example, has said \u201cbears\u2019 naturally slow reproductive rate, loss of key food sources to climate change, and state plans to reduce numbers through methods like trophy hunts, all spell disaster.\u201d\n\nScarface\u2019s killing is being widely mourned among those familiar with the bear, who\u2019d earned a reputation as an unflappable \u201cking of the woods,\u201d in the words of Kerry Gunther, Yellowstone\u2019s bear management program leader, who spoke to the Times shortly before the bear\u2019s death.\n\nScarface was first captured in 1993, when he was a \u201csub-adult\u201d bear weighing 150 pounds. At his peak, the bruin tipped the scales at about 600 pounds, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. But he\u2019d grown emaciated in recent years, the agency said, noting that less than 5 percent of male grizzlies live to the age of 25.\n\nScarface owed much of his fame to the scuffles with other bears over females, carcasses and dominance that had made his face so recognizable, and that had so destroyed his right ear that it flopped over. Photographers, in particular, have sung his praises \u2014 and, in recent days, angrily mourned his loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him almost kill a black bear for getting too close to his carcass in Antelope Valley and I\u2019ve seen him barely bat an eyelash at people who find themselves far too close,\u201d nature photographer Simon Jackson of Ghost Bear Photography wrote on his blog two years ago, adding that he\u2019d seen the bear 20 times over the years. \u201cThere is no one animal that has inspired me like Scarface nor any animal that has played such a profound role in defining the person I\u2019ve become.\u201d\n\nAs news of the bear\u2019s death spread, Jackson\u2019s blog published another post. \u201cOur emotions alternate between shock, sadness, anger and a profound sense of loss,\u201d Jackson and fellow photographer Jill Cooper wrote, urging people to campaign against the proposal to de-list the grizzly bear. \u201cNothing will bring back our beloved Scarface, but we can still do right by the many bears he fathered and all of the bears that shared the landscape he once roamed.\u201d\n\nSandy Sisti, a wildlife photographer who blogs at Wild at Heart Images, once wrote a paean about seeing \u201cYellowstone\u2019s Grand Old Man\u201d in all corners of the park and watching as he grew more scarred over the years.\n\n\u201cAs happens each year as spring approaches, bear watchers anxiously await news that Scarface has made it through yet another winter,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen evidence of his first sighting is confirmed, it will be acknowledged with a sigh of relief and with hopes that we will again have the opportunity to see this amazing bear one final time as he makes his way through the wilds of Yellowstone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "There are more than 750 grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park, but none as famed as a brawny, cocoa-colored male dubbed No. 211.", "title": "Karin Brulliard: Famed Yellowstone grizzly 'Scarface' shot and killed, spurring investigation", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/othercolumnists/karin-brulliard-famed-yellowstone-grizzly-scarface-shot-and-killed-spurring/article_26dc684d-cc35-5a1d-beb6-42a81d95026f.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/26/e26a5350-4414-5ed7-a1bf-bbd30369945d/572b85d4e9724.image.jpg?resize=972%2C630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "There are more than 750 grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park, but none as famed as a brawny, cocoa-colored male dubbed No. 211.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "bear,yellowstone national park,grizzly bear,scarface,grizzly,yellowstone,karin brulliard,nature photographer,wildlife photographer,fish and wildlife,united states,wyoming,jill cooper,sierra club,simon jackson,montana state agency,food sources,idaho,bear management program leader,othercolumnists", "news_keywords": "bear,yellowstone national park,grizzly bear,scarface,grizzly,yellowstone,karin brulliard,nature photographer,wildlife photographer,fish and wildlife,united states,wyoming,jill cooper,sierra club,simon jackson,montana state agency,food sources,idaho,bear management program leader,othercolumnists"}, "article_summary": "Last week, the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department released a statement that said No.\nAt his peak, the bruin tipped the scales at about 600 pounds, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\nHe was best known by his nickname, which was inspired by his fight-maimed face and damaged right ear: Scarface.\nThere are more than 750 grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park, but none as famed as a brawny, cocoa-colored male dubbed No.\n\u201cAs happens each year as spring approaches, bear watchers anxiously await news that Scarface has made it through yet another winter,\u201d she wrote."}
