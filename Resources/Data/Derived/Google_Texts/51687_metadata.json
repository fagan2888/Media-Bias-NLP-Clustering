Bank, M.D., director of research at the United Heart & Vascular Clinic of Allina Health in St. Paul, Minn. and associate professor of cardiology at the University of Minnesota, stays on schedule and sees 30 percent more patients a day than colleagues without scribes, Bank wrote.\n\nThe scribes, typically medical students who plan to enter the healthcare profession, review patients' medical records, summarize the patients' previous clinic visits and hospitalizations, find and copy relevant test results, document physician findings and treatment recommendations, enter billing codes and schedule future visits, according to the piece.\n\nPhysician productivity (measured in hours) increased more than 50 percent when doctors used a scribe, and revenue also increased, according to a study Banks cites that compared visits to his cardiology clinic. Doctors spent 30 percent less time in each patient's room, but the direct interaction with the patient increased significantly and physician-patient interaction improved.\n\n\"Everybody wins with this system. The patients win. They are seen on time, access to their physician is increased, and they get more attention at each visit,\" Bank wrote. \"The physician wins by performing less paperwork, finishing work on time, and spending more time doing what he or she is trained to do.\"\n\nThe scribes also get a hands-on education about the healthcare industry, and at $10 to $25 an hour, they provide an inexpensive solution to physicians' time management issues, Bank said.\n\nNot everyone agrees, however. Art Caplan, Ph.D., of New York University Langone Medical Center's Division of Medical Ethics, said adding a third party into the mix is less efficient and creates additional opportunities for data entry errors, FierceEMR previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the WSJ article\n\n- read the study abstract\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nScribes a boon to EHR-using doctors\n\nEmbrace of scribes for EHRs not universal\n\nEHR scribes improve patient, physician satisfaction", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an era where doctors spend hours a day filling out forms, scheduling patients, searching for data and coordinating care to improve quality and lower costs, medical scribes could be the key to freeing doctors to spend more time treating and interacting with patients, according to an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In an era where doctors spend hours a day filling out forms, scheduling patients, searching for data and coordinating care to improve quality and lower costs, medical scribes could be the key to freeing doctors to spend more time treating and interacting with patients, according to an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Medical scribes make docs more efficient, productive", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/medical-scribes-make-docs-more-efficient-productive/2014-04-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,medical scribes,New York University Langone Medical Center,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,time management,University Of Minnesota", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc159\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the WSJ article- read the study abstractRelated Articles:Scribes a boon to EHR-using doctorsEmbrace of scribes for EHRs not universalEHR scribes improve patient, physician satisfaction\nThe scribes, typically medical students who plan to enter the healthcare profession, review patients' medical records, summarize the patients' previous clinic visits and hospitalizations, find and copy relevant test results, document physician findings and treatment recommendations, enter billing codes and schedule future visits, according to the piece.\nArt Caplan, Ph.D., of New York University Langone Medical Center's Division of Medical Ethics, said adding a third party into the mix is less efficient and creates additional opportunities for data entry errors, FierceEMR previously reported.\nMedical scribes could allow doctors to spend more time treating and interacting with patients and less time filling out forms, scheduling patients, searching for data and coordinating care, according to an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal.\nThey are seen on time, access to their physician is increased, and they get more attention at each visit,\" Bank wrote."}
