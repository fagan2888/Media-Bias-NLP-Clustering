This year, mistakes can be costlier than ever if you are not prepared.\n\nThis summer, the IRS increased penalties for failure to file correct information returns and failure to provide correct payee statements for information returns filed after December 31, 2015, with maximum penalties on small businesses increasing from $500,000 to $1 million. These changes apply to 1099, W-2 and 1095 filings.\n\nGreatland Corporation, a provider of W-2 and 1099 products for businesses, has compiled a list of ins and outs for easy review to help businesses avoid penalties.\n\nA W-2 is the form employers use to report annual pay and withholding information. Due to the typical filing deadline (January 31) falling on a weekend, the deadline for employers to mail the 2015 Form W-2 to employees is February 1, 2016. Employees will receive four copies of this form to report federal, state and local income, and maintain a copy for their records. It is suggested that taxpayers hold on to W-2 forms for a minimum of three years to ensure proper documentation if needed.\n\nThere are a variety of 1099 forms that account for other sources of income. Issuers must mail out these 2015 forms to recipients by February 1, 2016. However, 1099 forms do not have to be issued to the IRS until February 29, allowing businesses to catch potential mistakes and correct them. This is also true for W-2s, although they are issued to the Social Security Administration rather than the IRS.\n\nNew for reporting year 2015 as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), employers and insurers are also expected to be compliant with ACA reporting requirements, including filing Form 1095, which must also be issued to recipients by February 1, 2016. Filing each of these forms properly is important so businesses do not spend it on costly, unnecessary fines.\n\nThe penalties (Section 6721) are revised as follows:\n\n$50 per information return if you correctly file within 30 days (by March 30 if the due date is February 28); maximum penalty $500,000 per year ($175,000 for small businesses).\n\n$100 per information return if you correctly file more than 30 days after the due date but by August 1; maximum penalty $1,500,000 per year ($500,000 for small businesses).\n\n$250 per information return if you file after August 1 or you do not file required information returns; maximum penalty $3,000,000 per year ($1,000,000 for small businesses).\n\n\u201cBusinesses work hard year-round for their money, and we at Greatland are here to help them avoid preventable penalties and fines,\u201d said Bob Nault, Greatland\u2019s CEO. \u201cOur experts and software products are ready to help businesses meet deadlines, answer questions, file data accurately and stay current with year-over-year changes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This summer, the IRS increased penalties for failure to file correct information returns and failure to provide correct payee statements for information returns filed after December 31, 2015, with maximum penalties on small businesses increasing from ...", "og": {"site_name": "CPA Practice Advisor", "description": "This summer, the IRS increased penalties for failure to file correct information returns and failure to provide correct payee statements for information returns filed after December 31, 2015, with maximum penalties on small businesses increasing from ...", "title": "Businesses Face Up to $1 Million Fine for Failure to File W-2s and 1099s", "url": "http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12148845/businesses-face-up-to-1-million-fine-for-failure-to-file-w-2s-and-1099s", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://r1.cpapracticeadvisor.com/files/base/CSN/image/2015/12/16x9/1280x720/Tax_Penalty_1_.566aff909c331.jpg", "height": 720}, "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 203013999739730}, "keywords": "W2, w2-1099, 1099, W-2/1099, penalties, IRS Penalties, tax penalties, income tax penalties, Wage Reporting, Greatland Corporation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "$250 per information return if you file after August 1 or you do not file required information returns; maximum penalty $3,000,000 per year ($1,000,000 for small businesses).\nIt is suggested that taxpayers hold on to W-2 forms for a minimum of three years to ensure proper documentation if needed.\nDue to the typical filing deadline (January 31) falling on a weekend, the deadline for employers to mail the 2015 Form W-2 to employees is February 1, 2016.\nThis summer, the IRS increased penalties for failure to file correct information returns and failure to provide correct payee statements for information returns filed after December 31, 2015, with maximum penalties on small businesses increasing from $500,000 to $1 million.\nIssuers must mail out these 2015 forms to recipients by February 1, 2016."}
