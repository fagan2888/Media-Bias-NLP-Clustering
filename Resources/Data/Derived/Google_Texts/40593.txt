Five years before the Affordable Care Act turned employer-sponsored health care on its head, Zions Bancorporation implemented a consumer-driven health plan. It was a huge undertaking, requiring years of consistent communication using a variety of media, to get employees to a point where they felt comfortable.

We were definitely an early adopter of the consumer-driven health plan, says Diana Andersen, executive vice president and HR benefits director for Zions Bancorporation, a financial services company with 11,000 employees that operates five full-service banking offices across 11 states. We realized early on that our employees needed to be part of the solution in managing our health care spend. The consumer-driven health plan design provided our employees with the ability to take on the smaller medical expenses in exchange for a huge reduction in insurance premiums.
