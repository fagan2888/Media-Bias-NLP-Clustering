Officials want the program up and running January 1, 2016, because they seek $51 million in savings in the first 6 months.\n\nMary K. Caffrey\n\nIowa Governor Terry Branstad\u2019s plan to wring $51 million in savings from the state\u2019s Medicaid program in early 2016 took a key step forward Monday when the Department of Human Services (DHS) posted a Request for Proposals (RFP) on its website, inviting health plans to bid on managing pieces of the $4.2 billion program.The RFP document, titled the \u201cIowa High Quality Health Care Initiative,\u201d calls for bids from vendors willing to move toward \u201ca risk-based managed care approach.\u201d DHS announced the availability of the document in a press release, saying the program\u2019s 3 objectives were \u201cimproving quality and access, promoting accountability in outcomes, and creating a more predictable and sustainable Medicaid budget.\u201d\u201cModernizing Medicaid will allow Iowa to create incentives to better health outcomes for members through comprehensive healthcare delivered within budget constraints,\u201d DHS Director Charles M. Palmer said in a statement. \u201cBy better managing Medicaid, we will make sure Iowans are getting the right care at the right time and in the right setting.\u201dWhile the plan calls for better coordination of services for Medicaid clients, the need to find near-term savings concerns some advocates for the poor. \u201cIt is a big change for the state of Iowa and we need to be concerned about how it will impact vulnerable Iowans,\u201d state Sen. Amanda Ragan, a Democrat and co-chair of a key healthcare committee, told the Des Moines Register.In other states, transitions to Medicaid managed care that were driven primarily by the need for budget savings have been rocky, with service disruptions and complaints about bureaucracy. Last year in Ohio, for example, news accounts chronicled tales of home health aides who left long-term clients for other jobs, after working for weeks without pay. New Hampshire\u2019s move to Medicaid managed care is not yet complete, but already some families say they lack access to longtime providers.However, the Branstad Administration is correct when it notes that most states are moving to managed care to bring escalating Medicaid costs under control. A survey in late 2014 by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 39 states incorporated some form of managed care into their Medicaid programs, and most planned to expand its use this year.What makes Iowa\u2019s transition noteworthy is that it comes after Governor Branstad\u2019s well-publicized decision to expand Medicaid to residents between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty line. Iowa\u2019s unique expansion required a waiver from CMS under the terms of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Healthcare advocates have praised Iowa\u2019s efforts to expand access to this population.Less well-publicized was Iowa\u2019s transition to managed care for its Medicaid clients seeking mental health services , a process that Palmer has said expanded access tremendously, despite some administrative challenges.With experience in mental health services and another small program behind them, administrators said Monday that almost all 564,000 Iowans in Medicaid will be affected by the upcoming transition.Iowa will follow an aggressive schedule to select its contractors, leaving almost 4 months to implement the change on January 1, 2016. According the RFP, bids are due May 8, 2015, with contractors scheduled to be selected July 31, 2015, and contracts signed August 28, 2015.
