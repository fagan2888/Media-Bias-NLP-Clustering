Then, on Thursday, Leon Botstein conducted the American Symphony Orchestra in \u201cRussia\u2019s Jewish Composers,\u201d a program of shorter works by Krein and Mikhail Gnesin, Anton Rubinstein\u2019s Cello Concerto No. 2 and the American premiere of Maximilian Steinberg\u2019s 40-minute Symphony No. 1.\n\nThat these programs took place on successive days, however, was just a \u201cterrific coincidence,\u201d as Mr. Botstein, the orchestra\u2019s music director, explained during a preperformance talk on Thursday. In any event, these two evenings offered a rare look into a fascinating cultural tradition. The history of Jews in Russia in the several decades surrounding the 1917 revolution is an amalgam of \u201csegregation, poverty, exclusion, persecution and extraordinary intellectual and cultural achievement,\u201d as Mr. Botstein wrote in extensive program notes.\n\nMr. Kissin, continuing his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall with his program, took the audience deep into the larger Jewish culture by giving extraordinary performances of three teeming pieces. Here was a classical-music superstar revealing profoundly personal connections to a rich heritage. I left the hall with newfound intellectual respect and personal regard for this dedicated artist.\n\nHe began with a stupendous account of Bloch\u2019s 25-minute Piano Sonata (Op. 40), composed in 1935. Born in Switzerland, Bloch became American by choice and \u201cbristled at the label of \u2018Jewish composer,\u2019\u201d as the scholar James Loeffler writes in excellent program notes. Yet Bloch was strongly attached to the expressive musical language of Jewish Eastern Europe and drew upon Yiddish musical syntax, as he did in this sonata.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSoon into the somber opening of the first movement, a stern three-note motif prods through murky, restless piano textures. The music evokes, and somehow deftly blends, disparate influences: grim Expressionist harmony, plaintive klezmer melodic writing, even hints of jazzy dance. The searching qualities of the piece continue even during a tranquil middle movement, a pastoral; the finale is like a stormy march that scatters that main motif.\n\nThen, using a microphone, Mr. Kissin recited from memory the poems by Peretz, a Polish Jew who lived from 1852 to 1915. He said, in a recent New York Times interview, that he learned Yiddish from his maternal grandmother, and grew to love the language and culture. For all his confidence as a virtuoso, Mr. Kissin has always had an awkward stage presence; he almost never speaks to audiences, not even to introduce the numerous encores he often plays. So it was startling to see him in a theatrical mode, speaking with earthy expressivity, relishing the Yiddish words and conveying the ambiguities of these poems, which, in his presentation, came across beautifully.\n\nHe recited 14 in all, in two groups, each engrossing. I especially like \u201cTime,\u201d where time is presented as a woman who goes her way, knows nothing of \u201cclose\u201d or \u201cfar,\u201d who hears not whether thousands rejoice or thousands need bread. The overall sentiment conveyed in the poem, and by Mr. Kissin, seemed to be resignation: What are you going to do about it?\n\nIn \u201cMy Muse,\u201d the poet says that his muse is no dainty flower or butterfly, nor a nightingale singing a sweet tune, but an \u201cold Jewish woman,\u201d her face \u201can ugly ruin,\u201d or an abandoned wife with orphans, to quote Mr. Loeffler\u2019s translation. Mr. Kissin sounded like a wizened Jewish elder telling the sad truth.\n\nHe gave a brilliant account of the Piano Sonata No. 2 (1924) by Veprik, who was born in Ukraine in 1889 and died in California in 1958. A composer who helped found the Society for Jewish Folk Music in St. Petersburg in 1908, Veprik spent four years in the early 1950s in a gulag under Stalin. As this sonata made clear, his music combined Jewish musical idioms with avant-garde style in the manner of Bartok. The final piece was \u201cSuite Dans\u00e9e,\u201d by Krein (1883-1951), who was born and remained in Russia. This inventive suite has Neo-Romantic touches and tuneful episodes, and recalls the texturally murky style of Scriabin, the composer\u2019s mentor. Mr. Kissin played magnificently.\n\nThe American Symphony Orchestra program began with another intriguing work by Krein, \u201cThe Rose and the Cross,\u201d subtitled \u201cSymphonic Fragments After Aleksandr Blok,\u201d the Russian symbolist poet. I also liked Gnesin\u2019s \u201cFrom Shelly,\u201d another symphonic fragment, this one a curious blend of wayward lyricism, diffuse chromatic harmonic writing and evocations of Wagner. Rubinstein\u2019s Second Cello Concerto, a 30-minute work from 1874, received a rousing ovation from the audience, especially for the elegant, accomplished soloist, Istvan Vardai. I found this unabashedly Romantic piece a little light, too eager to please. The cello, playing animated and often melodic lines, dominates, with not much competitive back-and-forth with the orchestra in the way of most concertos of that period.\n\nIn his talk, Mr. Botstein expressed enormous respect for the early Symphony No. 1 by Steinberg (1883-1946), a student of Rimsky-Korsakov at the same time as Stravinsky. He became Stravinsky\u2019s rival and Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s son-in-law. The piece, completed in 1906, is impressively orchestrated, often inventive (especially the slow movement, which seems to unfold as a continuously flowing melodic line), and ends with a hurtling finale. I found the music, over all, somewhat conventional.\n\nMr. Kissin chose bolder, wilder pieces to play and gave inspired performances. To end the evening, he recited another Yiddish poem, one of his own, he told the audience. Titled \u201cAni Maymin\u201d (\u201cCredo\u201d), it begins with the father of Abraham asking his son, \u201cWhy are you not like all the others?\u201d In the final line, Abraham answers: \u201cIf I am like the others, who will be like me?\u201d\n\nWell said. We certainly need someone to be Evgeny Kissin.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20151218175725, "twitter": {"description": "On successive nights at Carnegie Hall, separate programs featured Jewish composers.", "title": "Two Russian Tours, One Led by Evgeny Kissin, the Other by the American Symphony Orchestra", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/arts/music/two-russian-tours-one-led-by-evgeny-kissin-the-other-by-the-american-symphony-orchestra.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004099935"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/arts/19JEWISHMUSICJP/19JEWISHMUSICJP-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/arts/music/two-russian-tours-one-led-by-evgeny-kissin-the-other-by-the-american-symphony-orchestra.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004099935", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/arts/music/two-russian-tours-one-led-by-evgeny-kissin-the-other-by-the-american-symphony-orchestra.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/music", "hdl_p": "Invoking a Heritage Through Music (and Poems)", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 18, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/anthony_tommasini/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/arts/index.html", "section": "Music", "modified": "2016-04-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "tag": "KISSIN, EVGENY", "published": "2015-12-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "keywords": "Music,BOTSTEIN  LEON,Carnegie Hall,Classical Music,AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA,KISSIN  EVGENY", "description": "On successive nights at Carnegie Hall, separate programs featured Jewish composers.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Anthony Tommasini", "SCG": "music", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "KISSIN, EVGENY", "slug": "19jewishmusic", "byl": "By ANTHONY TOMMASINI", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "On successive nights at Carnegie Hall, separate programs featured Jewish composers.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/arts/19JEWISHMUSICJP/19JEWISHMUSICJP-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Music", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160412110002, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/arts/music/two-russian-tours-one-led-by-evgeny-kissin-the-other-by-the-american-symphony-orchestra.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/arts/19JEWISHMUSICJP/19JEWISHMUSICJP-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On successive nights at Carnegie Hall, separate programs featured Jewish composers.", "title": "Two Russian Tours, One Led by Evgeny Kissin, the Other by the American Symphony Orchestra"}, "pdate": 20151218, "des": "Classical Music", "col": "Critic's Notebook", "articleid": 100000004099935, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Two Russian Tours, One Led by Evgeny Kissin, the Other by the American Symphony Orchestra", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/arts/19JEWISHMUSICJP/19JEWISHMUSICJP-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Then, using a microphone, Mr. Kissin recited from memory the poems by Peretz, a Polish Jew who lived from 1852 to 1915.\nThe overall sentiment conveyed in the poem, and by Mr. Kissin, seemed to be resignation: What are you going to do about it?\nMr. Kissin chose bolder, wilder pieces to play and gave inspired performances.\nMr. Kissin played magnificently.\nThe American Symphony Orchestra program began with another intriguing work by Krein, \u201cThe Rose and the Cross,\u201d subtitled \u201cSymphonic Fragments After Aleksandr Blok,\u201d the Russian symbolist poet."}
