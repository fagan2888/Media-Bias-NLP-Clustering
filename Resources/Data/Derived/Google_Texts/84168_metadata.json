Little kids conspire to eat cookies behind their parents\u2019 backs, while parents conspire to hide grownup truths from their children. On the other extreme, tobacco companies conspire to addict, and (unfortunately for the bottom line) inevitably kill, a vast ocean of customers. In between such extremes, the plots of countless stories involve conspiracies of one sort or another, simply because humans are social creatures who readily conspire (literally, \u201cbreath together\u201d) to get things done that they might not be able to do alone.\n\nWith all this conspiring going on, it\u2019s not surprising that some folks would notice \u2014 and many have. The writers of all those stories, for example. But some folks who notice have an annoying tendency to get things all wrong. What makes most stories interesting is precisely the fact that conspiracies are human creations, and we humans are fallible lot, we mess things up all the time. We can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s just our nature. As a result, conspiracies are usually rather messy and limited affairs, often undone by other conspiracies, or by their own internal tensions, like the scheming on a typical \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode.\n\nBut some folks see conspiracies as anything but a reflection of our nature. They see conspiracies almost wholly as \u201cother,\u201d deeply sinister, and maddeningly perfect \u2014 or at least nearly so. Such folks are properly known as \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d They\u2019re not wrong to believe there are conspiracies everywhere around them \u2014 as many of their critics mistakenly believe \u2014 but they are wrong about the nature of the vast majority of what\u2019s really there, as well about how powerful and important conspiracies are, absent other forces working in tandem with them \u2014 such as the enormous economic and political clout possessed by tobacco companies.\n\nThe philosopher Brian L. Keeley wrote a brief but insightful article in 1999, \u201cOf Conspiracy Theories,\u201d from the perspective of epistemology (the philosophical study of knowledge). In it, he defines conspiracy theories as \u201ca proposed explanation of some historical event (or events) in terms of the significant causal agency of a relatively small group of persons \u2014 the conspirators \u2014 acting in secret.\u201d Although his analysis is insightful, this definition fails to capture the historical/social science sense of what\u2019s commonly meant by the term, to wit: that it\u2019s an explanation of human events via behavior that deeply violates ordinary norms, usually including serious criminal acts. Another paper by social psychologists provided a definition more in line with this:\n\nConspiracy theories are lay beliefs that attribute the ultimate cause of an event, or the concealment of an event from public knowledge, to a secret, unlawful, and malevolent plot by multiple actors working together.\u201d\n\nTo clarify: One list of \u201c33 Conspiracy Theories That Turned Out To Be True\u201d (discussed below) included the Manhattan Project as an example. This fits with Keeley\u2019s definition, but it\u2019s strikingly at odds with how the term is generally used, and the reasons are simple: the actions involved did not, on their face, deeply violate ordinary norms, and were similar in secrecy to other wartime research efforts, such as the development of radar and codebreaking efforts which greatly accelerated the development of modern computers. Of course it\u2019s true that the atomic bomb was a weapon like no other \u2014 and even some who worked on it were profoundly troubled thereafter \u2014 as well they should have been. However, it was developed in the course of a war like no other, with the prospect of a 1000-year Reich, not in an historical vacuum. Hence, the morality involved was clearly contested, with many potential deep ramifications, rather than being a clear-cut violation of ordinary norms.\n\nTwo further points. First, those involved in conspiracy theorizing invariably bring with them a moral overlay \u2014 they seek not only to understand some historical event, but to judge it, and those responsible, usually quite hastily. This is particularly evident in the example of the Manhattan Project. By simply assuming (or at least implying) that the actors were nefarious, the conspiracy theory account prejudges and dismisses precisely what ought to be a most serious matter for our moral reflection. They completely misdirect our moral attention. Second, in doing so, they themselves frequently violate norms \u2014 norms of civilized discourse, most visibly, but also, more subtly, norms of reason itself, which come into sharper relief precisely by studying how conspiracists violate them.\n\nIn short, the false image that conspiracy theorists have is a natural consequence of a set of cognitive characteristics that researchers and scholars like Keeley have identified which do not necessarily indicate false beliefs on a one-to-one basis, but that do impair the ability to think critically, consider alternatives, accept contradictory feedback, and otherwise gain a more rounded perspective \u2014 both in terms of facts as well as morality. In the worst case, such thinking inadvertently leads to rejecting the very possibility of any sort of systematized knowledge at all \u2014 a point that Keeley carefully considered.\n\nA more recent paper, \u201cRecursive Fury: Conspiracist ideation in the blogosphere in response to research on conspiracist ideation\u201d (which I discussed here back in May) identified six such characteristics (or criteria) from the literature on conspiracist thought, which were then used to analyze blog comments attacking an earlier paper on the role of conspiracism in rejecting global warming science. (\u201cRecursive Fury\u201d was then recursively attacked by conspiracists, and shamefully retracted by the journal which published it, not for any methodological or ethical reasons, but because of legal liability issues \u2014 itself an example of how conspiracist thinking can cripple scientific inquiry.) The paper explained:\n\nWe derived six criteria from the existing literature to permit classification of hypotheses pertaining to LOG12 as potentially conspiracist (see Table 3). Our criteria were exclusively psychological and hence did not hinge on the validity of the various hypotheses. This approach follows philosophical precedents that have examined the epistemology of conspiratorial theorizing irrespective of its truth value (e.g., Keeley, 1999; Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009). The approach also avoids the need to discuss or rebut the substance of any of the hypotheses.\n\nTo illustrate the usefulness of this sort process perspective approach, we turn to each of those characteristics in turn, quoting an excerpt of the description (with formal citations removed), followed by some commentary. After that, we\u2019ll return to that reflect on that list of conspiracy theories that turned out to be true, to reconsider just what it might mean, in light of this sort of process perspective.\n\nThe first conspiracist characteristic identified is \u201cnefarious intention\u201d:\n\nFirst, the presumed intentions behind any conspiracy are invariably nefarious. Conspiracist ideation never involves groups of people whose intent is to do good, as for example when planning a surprise birthday party. Instead, conspiracist ideation relies on the presumed deceptive intentions of the people or institutions responsible for the \u201cofficial\u201d account that is being questioned.\n\nOne example cited is the book \u201cWatermelons: The Green Movement\u2019s True Colors,\u201d about which the publishers say: \u201cGreen on the outside, red on the inside, the liberty-loathing, humanity-hating \u201cwatermelons\u201d of the modern environmental movement do not want to save the world. They want to rule it.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t get much more nefarious than that \u2026 unless you want to get into the Satanic ritual (child) abuse moral panic of the 1980s and \u201990s. As Wikipedia notes:\n\nScholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, with little or no validity beyond paranoia. Official investigations produced no evidence of widespread conspiracies or of the slaughter of thousands; only a small number of verified crimes have even remote similarities to tales of SRA.\n\nThat moral panic produced books like \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Go Back, Mommy: A Child\u2019s Book about Satanic Ritual Abuse.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to imagine how nefarious these imaginary conspirators were. Buzzfeed has some sample illustrations here.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always so batshit crazy. As a journalist, I\u2019ve had plenty of frustrating experience dealing with institutions putting out official stories, so I could easily sympathize with less extreme conspiracists in this regard. But, professionally, it\u2019s a luxury I can\u2019t afford. Most people repeat the official story in good faith; error is far more common than evil. Lack of institutional transparency and accountability is one of the most serious and widely-seen maladies of our time. But the conspiracist interpretation of why it occurs does far more to obscure matters than to bring them to light \u2014 even when it stops far short of wild stories about Satanic rituals.\n\nThe second conspiracist characteristic is \u201cpersecution-victimization\u201d:\n\n\u201cA corollary of the first criterion is the pervasive self-perception and self-presentation among conspiracy theorists as the victims of organized persecution. The theorist typically considers herself, at least tacitly, to be the brave antagonist of the nefarious intentions of the conspiracy; that is, the victim is also a potential hero.\u201d\n\nThis clearly applies in spades to the \u201cvictims\u201d of Satanic ritual abuse. The article cites another example: \u201cwhen isolated scientists who oppose the scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS are presented as persecuted heroes and are likened to Galileo,\u201d as described in the book \u201cDenying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience and Human Tragedy.\u201d AIDS patients who\u2019ve rejected treatment also present themselves heroically \u2026 and can still be seen online in video testimonials after they die, as recounted in the Guardian by award-winning UK journalist Brian Deer. Moral: One can be a true victim and yet be absolutely clueless as to what you\u2019re the victim of. You can become a victim of your own mistaken beliefs.\n\nThe third conspiracist characteristic is \u201cnihilistic skepticism\u201d:\n\n\u201c[D]uring its questioning of an official account, conspiracist ideation is characterized by \u201c\u2026an almost nihilistic degree of skepticism\u201d; and the conspiracy theorist refuses to believe anything that does not fit into the conspiracy theory. Thus, nothing is at it seems, and all evidence points to hidden agendas or some other meaning that only the conspiracy theorist is aware of.\u201d\n\nCalling this \u201cwacky,\u201d as many are inclined to do, dramatically understates what a serious attack it is on the very possibility of ever knowing anything at all. \u201cTrust no one,\u201d may make a cool tagline for a TV show, but no one can actually live like that. We trust people all the time \u2014 to point us to right aisle in a store, to tell us where they want to meet for lunch, etc.\n\nYet, as Keeley noted in his 1999 paper, \u201cThese theories throw into doubt the various institutions that have been set up to generate reliable data and evidence. In doing so, they reveal just how large a role trust in both institutions and individuals plays in the justification of our beliefs. The problem is this: most of us \u2014 including those of us who are scientists and who work in scientific laboratories full of expensive equipment \u2014 have never carried out the experiments or made the empirical observations that support most contemporary scientific theories.\u201d Hence, the vast majority of scientific knowledge depends on trusting others, not blindly, but through a carefully developed system of rigorous sifting and cross-checking.\n\nAs Keeley put it, \u201cIn modern science, this procedure involves the elaborate mechanisms of publication, peer review, professional reputation, university accreditation and so on. Thus, we are warranted in believing the claims of science because these claims are the result of a social mechanism of warranted belief production.\u201d And this, ultimately, is the full scope of what the conspiracy theorist would ask us to abandon \u2014 as the withdrawal of \u201cRecursive Fury\u201d gave us a foretaste of. Without this social mechanism of science, we would know very little at all. Such are the fruits of nihilistic skepticism.\n\nWe can see a small hint of this outcome in the world as seen by \u201cyoung earth\u201d creationists \u2014 those who insist on a literal reading of the Bible (ignoring the contradictions between Genesis 1 and 2), and thus say the world was created 6,000 years ago. Of course this means that they reject evolution, but that\u2019s only a small fraction of the science they nihilistically reject. They also reject tree rings, since, as of 2009, the University of Arizona\u2019s bristlecone pine database established a timeline of 8,836 years \u2014 almost 50 percent older than the Young Earth creationists claim the earth to be. They also reject carbon dating \u2014 using elaborate arguments, the most noteworthy of which are debunked here by the National Center for Science Education. And there\u2019s also the little problem that the \u201cbig bang\u201d happened over 13 billion years ago. NASA\u2019s also got an excellent Big Bang webpage, providing even more of the incredible knowledge of our cosmos that creationist conspiracists demand that we abandon, in deference to their purportedly \u201cdivine\u201d nihilistic skepticism.\n\nThe fourth conspiracist characteristic is \u201cnothing by accident\u201d: \u201cFourth, to the conspiracy theorist, nothing happens by accident. Thus, small random events are woven into a conspiracy narrative and reinterpreted as indisputable evidence for the theory.\u201d\n\nA classic example of this sort of thinking is a list of coincidences supposedly linking the Kennedy and Lincoln assassinations, which first appeared shortly after Kennedy was shot. (My personal favorite is \u201cBooth shot Lincoln in a theater and was caught in a warehouse. Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and was caught in a theater.\u201d It\u2019s so bizarre, surely it must mean something! Where\u2019s Agent Mulder when you really need him?)\n\nThis characteristic reflects something deeper about conspiracist thinking \u2014 it has less in common with science than immediately meets the eye. In \u201cThe Battle For God\u201d (introduction here), Karen Armstrong talks about two contrasting modes of human understanding: logos, which is concerned with understanding how the world works, and mythos, which is concerned with meaning and purpose. The importance of mythos is obvious, Armstrong explains: \u201cUnless we find some significance in our lives, we mortal men and women fall very easily into despair,\u201d and supplying significance is what mythos is all about.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No matter the topic, a conservative fringe views it through a conspiratorial lens.
