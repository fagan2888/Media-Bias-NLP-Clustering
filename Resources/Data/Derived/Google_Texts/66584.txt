WASHINGTON — Sen. John Cornyn has launched the first statewide ad blitz of his re-election effort, and he’s keeping his aim squarely on President Barack Obama, ignoring Rep. Steve Stockman, his best-known rival in the March primary:

“ASTONISHINGLY LIBERAL”: In a 30-second TV spot and a minute-long radio version, Cornyn calls Obama “astonishingly liberal.” He ominously accuses Obama of trying to “change the very fabric of American life,” with references to Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and allegations that the IRS targeted conservative groups. The ads assert that Cornyn is standing up to the administration. “Lifelong conservative. Pro-life. Lives the Second Amendment. Tight-fisted with our taxpayer dollars. Fights for the truth from a dishonest administration,” the narrator says.

AIRING STATEWIDE: The campaign wouldn’t give precise figures on how much it’s spending on the ads, but an aide called it “a substantial statewide buy” at a cost “well into six figures.” The aide called it “the start of what will be a multimillion-dollar ad campaign.” Cornyn had a stockpile of $7 million going into the primary.

FOCUS ON OBAMA: Taking on the president rather than Stockman, R-Friendswood, reflects a standard tactic for incumbents: treat challengers as pesky and insignificant for as long as possible. And Cornyn has a closely allied group that has been doing the dirty work for him. Texans for a Conservative Majority, run by Cornyn loyalists, launched its first TV ad attacking the congressman this week.

GUN BILL: Also Friday, Cornyn announced support for a bill that would let people with a concealed-carry gun permit use that permit in any other state that allows concealed-carry — essentially treating the permits like a driver’s license, he said. Earlier this week, Stockman accused Cornyn of an “aggressive expansion of the anti-gun agenda,” citing his stated goal of making it harder for people with serious mental illness to have access to guns.
