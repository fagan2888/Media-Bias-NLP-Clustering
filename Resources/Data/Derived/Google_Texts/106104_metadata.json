Along with setting up child care and functioning on limited sleep, nursing mothers have to navigate office pumping policies.\n\nPumping at work just became far less stressful for some moms in Texas. Starting Sept. 1, a new bill requires all public employers to allow reasonable breaks and accommodation for salaried workers who need to express breast milk.\n\nHourly workers across the nation are already guaranteed this right. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 amended section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, requiring employers to grant breaks for pumping up to one year after a child is born, and workers are able to use a private location other than a bathroom. Texas\u2019 law is similar, although it lists a single-stall bathroom as an acceptable lactation location.\n\nWith the federal law protecting only hourly workers, it\u2019s up to each state to institute its own laws for salaried workers. Twenty-seven states have established laws for moms who need to pump at work, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThat coverage varies across the nation. Texas\u2019 legislation doesn\u2019t include salaried workers in the private sector. Georgia\u2019s law allows employers to opt out of pumping breaks if they \u201cunduly disrupt workplace operations.\u201d Colorado requires pumping breaks for up two years after a child is born, and employers must make a \u201creasonable effort\u201d to establish a private space other than a bathroom stall. California requires all employers to grant breaks to any mother who wants to pump, with no age requirement listed for the child. Twenty-three states\u2014including Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania\u2014do not require employers to allow breaks for salaried employees.\n\nMoms who pump at work are likely to continue breast-feeding longer than those who don\u2019t, according to a 2011 study on the law\u2019s impact on nursing. Not only is skipping pumping sessions or not pumping for long enough uncomfortable for nursing moms, but it can also lead to a diminished milk supply. Because of breast milk\u2019s protective antibodies, the World Health Organization recommends that infants be breast-fed exclusively for the first six months of life and with supplemented food for the first two years. WHO also notes that breast-feeding helps reduce a child\u2019s risk of becoming obese or developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nAlthough Texas\u2019 law doesn\u2019t extend to all nursing moms, advocates feel it is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThis new law will make sure that more babies will get off to a healthy start in life,\u201d Alice Bufkin, policy associate at Texans Care for Children, told the Texas Observer. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that we have workplaces that are supportive of moms and their decisions to breastfeed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Samantha Cowan", "description": "Federal and state laws require lactation breaks for hourly workers and public employees.", "rights": "TakePart is the Social Action Network\u2122 of Participant Media. \u00a9 2008-2016 TakePart, LLC", "og": {"site_name": "TakePart", "description": "Federal and state laws require lactation breaks for hourly workers and public employees.", "title": "The Working Moms Left out of Texas\u2019 New Breast-Feeding Protections", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/09/02/texas-breast-feeding", "image": {"width": 775, "identifier": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/breastfeeding-promo.jpg", "height": 518}, "type": "article"}, "abstract": "Federal and state laws require lactation breaks for hourly workers and public employees.", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-02 15:17:40", "MobileOptimized": 320, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "health,openpublish_article", "fb": {"admins": 1327833247, "pages": 9287842439, "app_id": 247137505296280}, "keywords": "Health", "tab-keywords": "Health", "twitter": {"description": "Federal and state laws require lactation breaks for hourly workers and public employees.", "title": "The Working Moms Left out of Texas\u2019 New Breast-Feeding Protections", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/09/02/texas-breast-feeding", "image": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/breastfeeding-promo.jpg", "creator": "@TakePart", "site": "@TakePart", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd91\"", "article_summary": "Although Texas\u2019 law doesn\u2019t extend to all nursing moms, advocates feel it is a step in the right direction.\nTexas\u2019 law is similar, although it lists a single-stall bathroom as an acceptable lactation location.\nPumping at work just became far less stressful for some moms in Texas.\nWith the federal law protecting only hourly workers, it\u2019s up to each state to institute its own laws for salaried workers.\nNot only is skipping pumping sessions or not pumping for long enough uncomfortable for nursing moms, but it can also lead to a diminished milk supply."}
