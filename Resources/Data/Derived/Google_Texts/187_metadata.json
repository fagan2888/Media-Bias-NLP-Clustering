That's all. But what she ended up with was a hilarious 37 seconds of unscripted fail. Well, to be fair, she did bring a bit of sexy to about 20 seconds of the video...\n\nHuffington Post dropped this YouTube nugget on Sept. 6. Caitlin Heller herself, seeing that her video might not be the sexiest twerking video ever made, did see it for what it was -- comedic gold. So, after putting out the fire (yes, there's a sexy girl and a fire in the video -- and twerking) and going over what she had, instead of deleting what she had captured, she posted it to YouTube.\n\n(The boyfriend is one lucky guy: A girlfriend who is attractive, sexy, and has a sense of humor.)\n\n\"I tried making a sexy twerk video for my boyfriend and things got a little too hot :)\", she wrote.\n\nAlthough short, the video is definitely long enough to prove a cautionary tale for those who plan to do a little twerking without thinking about where said twerking is being done. Like, for instance, in a furniture-cluttered apartment. Or around lit candles. Or near a door that can be opened.\n\nBecause if one plans to do a few handstands near an unlocked door while working the twerk, one could very well end up like Caitlin Heller, butt-first through a coffee table with a bit of fire racing up one's crotch, screaming at the top of one's lungs.\n\nAnd although not all that sexy, it is quite amusing...\n\nThe video is entitled \"Worst Twerk Fail EVER - Girl Catches Fire!\" and it has garnered 6.7 million views since it was posted on Sept. 3.\n\nAnd as bad as it might have been for Heller (and probably just bad enough to get a call from Daniel Tosh to do a \"Web Redemption\" on his Comedy Central show), at least she's got people willing to watch her fail over and over and over, accumulating millions of views. Miley Cyrus did her twerking fail in front of millions at the 2013 MTV VMAs and there isn't anyone who wants to ever see that hot mess again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Caitlin Heller just wanted to make a sexy twerking video for her boyfriend.
