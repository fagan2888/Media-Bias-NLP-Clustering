John Carter, R-Texas, in next year\u2019s Republican Party primary. In an interview, Cornelius said Carter\u2019s voting record isn\u2019t conservative enough, citing votes to fund the health care overhaul, which he calls Obamacare, and military cuts in continuing budget resolutions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve traveled the district and spoken to leaders in the party,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make a final decision in the next couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nCornelius describes himself as a \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d who\u2019s both socially and fiscally conservative. He said he supports a flat tax similar to what Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., advocates for and wants to address border and transportation issues in his district.\n\nCornelius said he is worried about the announced 3,250 military personnel cuts coming to Fort Hood by the end of 2017. The military base is located in his district and is the most populous U.S. military base in the world.\n\nHe added that Carter is a big supporter of House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who Cornelius says \u201cis not doing all he can to\u201d advance the conservative cause. Cornelius said he would like to see the Republican-controlled Congress challenge President Barack Obama more.\n\n\u201cStop making excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have majorities in the House and Senate. Let\u2019s put pressure on the president to veto this stuff.\u201d\n\nBefore going back to Texas, where he was born and spent some of his youth, Cornelius worked for the Bernalillo County Republican Party and ran for state Land Commissioner in 2010.\n\nThat year, he lost the GOP primary to Matt Rush in a race that got ugly by the end. Cornelius said he was one of the Republican candidates that year that didn\u2019t run as part of a \u201cslate\u201d aligned with then-gubernatorial candidate Susana Martinez.\n\n\u201cI refused to use some of the consultants that those campaigns wanted to use and did use,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring that election, a supporter of Rush alleged Cornelius was making exaggerated claims about a biogas company called Petro Verde.\n\nAt the time, Cornelius said the company, which he helped facilitate meetings for, had the potential to create hundreds of jobs when it hadn\u2019t yet secured an investor. Today, he said that \u201cis the risk of any small business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they wanted to do was create a bio energy plant to use manure from the Clovis area to make energy,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cThey would have created hundreds of jobs had they found the funding. There\u2019s no untrue statement in that.\u201d\n\nRush went on to lose the general election to Democrat Ray Powell that year.\n\nCornelius then started 90 Degrees and helped work on the 2012 congressional campaign for Republican Jefferson Byrd, who pulled an upset primary defeat against Rick Newton. Byrd could not pull the upset against incumbent Democrat Ben Ray Lujan, who easily won reelection.\n\nCornelius\u2019 company is based in the Austin area.\n\nHis name later came into controversy in New Mexico the following year when Steve Kush, the then-executive director of the Bernalillo County Republican Party, made a Facebook comment calling an Albuquerque liberal advocate a \u201cradical bitch.\u201d\n\nCornelius replied to the comment writing \u201cmaybe she used those shoes to walk Central,\u201d a reference to prostitution.\n\nCornelius quickly apologized to Chelsey Evans, the woman Kush referred to in his Facebook post, by telling her that his comment was \u201cboth inappropriate and unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made a comment that shouldn\u2019t have been made,\u201d Cornelius told New Mexico Political Report. \u201cUltimately that\u2019s not in my character.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Elections, News, Quick Reads, Bernalillo County Republican Party, Bob Cornelius, Chelsey Evans, Fort Hood, House Of Representatives, Jeff Byrd, John Boehner", "original-source": "http://nmpoliticalreport.com/13489/ex-nm-statewide-candidate-might-run-for-congress-in-texas/", "og": {"site_name": "The NM Political Report", "description": "A political consultant who previously ran for statewide office in New Mexico is now mulling a run for Congress in Texas.
