According to financial news site ETF Trends, roughly half of ETFs introduced each year fail to even reach $10 million in assets.\n\nSecurity has become big business on Wall Street as hackers continue to crack the cyber defenses of retailers, banks and government agencies.\n\nGartner analysts project $77 billion will be spent on cybersecurity this year alone.\n\nSecurity firms have benefited from the growing frequency of massive breaches in the U.S.\n\nWhen Target was hacked in late 2013, exposing 40 million customers\u2019 payment card data, the scale shocked the public. But such breaches have become common, with retailers such as Home Depot, banks such as JPMorgan and health insurers such as Anthem all suffering attacks.\n\nEach high-profile incident has also given a slight bump to security firms\u2019 stock.\n\nThe recent digital intrusions at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) showed the phenomenon still exists. HACK closed at a record high the day after the initial breach was announced in early June.\n\nCIBR hopes to capitalize on these booming market forces.\n\n\u201cAlong with the clear benefits of an increasingly interconnected world comes the growing need to ensure the security of cyberspace,\u201d said Ryan Issakainen, a senior vice president at First Trust, which is offering the ETF. \u201cThis presents significant opportunities for companies involved with this task.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Increasingly frequent breaches have driven up stock prices for security firms.", "description": "Increasingly frequent breaches have driven up stock prices for security firms.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Increasingly frequent breaches have driven up stock prices for security firms.", "title": "Cybersecurity booms as new stocks debut", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247074-traders-rush-to-capitalize-on-soaring-cybersecurity-stocks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/wallstreet_101614getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247074-traders-rush-to-capitalize-on-soaring-cybersecurity-stocks", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-07T14:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-07T14:06:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247074-traders-rush-to-capitalize-on-soaring-cybersecurity-stocks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Increasingly frequent breaches have driven up stock prices for security firms.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cybersecurity booms as new stocks debut"}, "dcterms.title": "Cybersecurity booms as new stocks debut"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda50a\"", "article_summary": "The cybersecurity boom on Wall Street is growing.\nThis week, the second-ever cybersecurity exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 which bundles multiple crime fighting companies to trade as one stock \u2014 hit the New York City-based NASDAQ stock exchange.\nSecurity has become big business on Wall Street as hackers continue to crack the cyber defenses of retailers, banks and government agencies.\nGartner analysts project $77 billion will be spent on cybersecurity this year alone.\nEach high-profile incident has also given a slight bump to security firms\u2019 stock."}
