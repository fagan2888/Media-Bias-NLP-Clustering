The Meridian Police Dept. and the Lauderdale Co. Sheriff's Dept. responded to an early Sunday morning robbery at the Walmart on Highway 19 North.

Detective Dareall Thompson says Walmart was closed, but some employees were inside at the time. He says a black male entered the store and went to the manager's office and waited. When an employee came in, Thompson says the suspect pointed a handgun and demanded money before leaving the store. Police say the suspect knew there would be employees there and what door he could get open.
