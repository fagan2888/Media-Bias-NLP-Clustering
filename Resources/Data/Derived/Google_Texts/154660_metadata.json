Regulators want stricter financial requirements for the company as well.\n\nThere had been talk that regulators could force what\u2019s called divestiture. Basically, in parts of the state where Aetna and Humana together would be too powerful, the state could have forced the insurance company to sell policies to a third, unrelated company. Regulators stopped short, instead writing that forcing the companies to sell polices would be \u201cdisruptive to policyholders and short-term in nature.\u201d\n\nSo instead, regulators want Aetna to start competing in new parts of the state. They are requiring Aetna to start selling Obamacare insurance policies in five new counties by 2018 and statewide by 2020. The idea seems to be if the state is losing competition in one market, it will gain competition somewhere else.\n\n\u201cThe requirements sound pretty mild to me, especially because no divestiture of any current enrollees is required,\u201d wrote Allan Baumgarten, a health insurance financial analyst. \u201cStill possible that the U.S. Department of Justice will push harder on some of these local markets.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice and the Florida Attorney General both must still approve the deal. The Florida deal is part of a national merger plan by Aetna, which could be valued at $37 billion.\n\nRelated\n\nWMFE is a partner with Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n\n\nHealth reporting on WMFE is supported in part by Florida Hospital and the Winter Park Health Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analyst: Florida\u2019s Conditions For Aetna To Buy Humana \u2018Pretty Mild\u2019", "generator": "MasterSlider 2.7.1 - Responsive Touch Image Slider | www.avt.li/msf", "title": "Analyst: Florida\u2019s Conditions For Aetna To Buy Humana \u2018Pretty Mild\u2019 - 90.7 WMFE", "og": {"site_name": "90.7 WMFE", "description": "Florida regulators have approved Aetna\u2019s bid to buy Humana\u2019s health insurance companies in Florida \u2013 with conditions.", "title": "Analyst: Florida\u2019s Conditions For Aetna To Buy Humana \u2018Pretty Mild\u2019", "url": "http://www.wmfe.org/analyst-floridas-conditions-for-aetna-to-buy-humana-pretty-mild/56970", "image": "http://www.wmfe.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Health-Nerd-Check-Here-for-More.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wmfeorlando", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Abe Aboraya", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 518629354, "app_id": 1548836692013354}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-15T21:38:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-16T17:54:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "Y7hH39hBuXyNDcSaUYeVS5reQoCbVDVCIdb0XQlgfzI"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7282\"", "article_summary": "Florida regulators have approved Aetna\u2019s bid to buy Humana\u2019s health insurance companies in Florida \u2013 with conditions.\n\u201cThe requirements sound pretty mild to me, especially because no divestiture of any current enrollees is required,\u201d wrote Allan Baumgarten, a health insurance financial analyst.\nThey are requiring Aetna to start selling Obamacare insurance policies in five new counties by 2018 and statewide by 2020.\nBasically, in parts of the state where Aetna and Humana together would be too powerful, the state could have forced the insurance company to sell policies to a third, unrelated company.\nRelatedWMFE is a partner with Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."}
