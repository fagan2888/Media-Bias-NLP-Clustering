A 58-year-old Garden City doctor was killed late Friday afternoon in a rollover accident.

It happened around 5:40 p.m. in the 1700 block of Sagebrush Road in Garden City. The Kansas Highway Patrol said Dr. Michael Baughman was heading west on Sagebrush and went off the north side of the road, lost control and rolled.

Baughman was ejected, and his Ford pickup came to resting in a ditch. He was taken to a local hospital where he later died. Reports state he was not wearing a seatbelt.

The Garden City Telegram reports Baughman opened Sandhill Orthopaedic and Sportsmedicine in Garden City in 1993. He was a graduate of Salina Central High School, Kansas State University and the University of Kansas School of Medicine.
