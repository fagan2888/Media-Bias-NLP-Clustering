(\u2026) It\u2019s all about him assuming Mandela\u2019s place\u201d and \u201cassuming the mantle of world leftist leadership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a second inauguration if you will,\u201d Limbaugh continued. \u201cObama is now the conscience of the world. The torch has been passed whether Mandela knew it or not.\u201d\n\nAfter the President shook hands with communist Cuban dictator Raul Castro, CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour quickly tried to preempt any criticism of Obama\u2019s gesture, insisting the president was simply \u201cdoing the diplomatic thing\u201d during a \u201cmoment of reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drive by media is literally having orgasms over Obama shaking hands with Raul Castro,\u201d Limbaugh said. Meanwhile, he reminded listeners, \u201cThere\u2019s an American citizen who\u2019s been sitting in a Cuban dungeon for months now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Obama even knew who [Castro] was,\u201d Limbaugh continued. \u201cHe\u2019s too preoccupied with himself.\u201d\n\nAs proof, Limbaugh noted that in the midst of the ceremony, Obama was busily taking \u201cselfies\u201d with other dignitaries like British Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.\n\nLimbaugh added that the president isn\u2019t really \u201cimpressed with any of these people. (\u2026) Obama is a narcissist. He\u2019s not looking to impress these guys. He is thinking they envy him,\u201d and will be eager to boast about meeting Obama when they get back home.\n\n\u201cThen some gospel singer [Kirk Franklin] was bringing down the house,\u201d Limbaugh continued, and Christiane Amanpour gushed that \u201cObama couldn\u2019t have asked for a better \u2018opening act.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe CNN correspondent is treating this memorial service \u201clike a pop concert,\u201d Limbaugh complained. Comparing the event to the raucous movie comedy The Wedding Crashers, the radio host joked he felt like he was watching \u201cThe Funeral Crashers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media,\u201d he said, is trying to \u201cchange and turn the focus to Obama.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t news. They want it to be news. Anything to distract everybody from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such slavish kiss-ass\u201d behavior from the media, Limbaugh said. \u201cThis is Obama\u2019s official final step onto the world stage.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s decision to shake Castro\u2019s hand \u201crepresents another giant step for the United States, away from its founding and make it more or less like and no different than any other country on the planet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Talk-radio giant Rush Limbaugh expressed disgust at President Barack Obama\u2019s behavior at the memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela \u2013 and at the mainstream media\u2019s fawning coverage of Obama\u2019s every move. \u201cThis whole week is about Barack Obama,\u201d said Limbaugh. \u201cThat\u2019s what the script is.
