He referred to the Chinese repression of peaceful protesters in 1989 as \u201cthe Tiananmen Square riots.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an odd gaffe, in that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve never actually heard that particular phrasing before. \u201cTiananmen Square protests,\u201d or \u201cTiananmen Square massacre,\u201d sure. \u201cTiananmen Square incident,\u201d if you want to be particularly weak-kneed and British about it. But \u201cTiananmen Square riots\u201c? That was a new one to me.\n\nI\u2019ve probably never heard that phrase because it\u2019s a particularly odious one, one that suggests that peaceful demonstrators\u2014students, many of them\u2014were to blame for being gunned down by the Chinese military. That this was some sort of violent effort that needed to be brutally repressed. That the Chinese were simply reacting to thugs and troublemakers torching shop fronts and looting homes, or something. That the hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries were, therefore, excusable.\n\nNow, I\u2019m sure Donald Trump hasn\u2019t given much thought to his locution, because I don\u2019t think Donald Trump takes a great deal of time to think about human rights. It\u2019s not really his bag. But I do think it\u2019s a telling one. And one that actually scares me a bit. As I\u2019ve noted elsewhere, Trump thrives on conflict\u2014leftist protestors and rightwing media alike are just as likely to suffer attacks. He doesn\u2019t know how to deescalate, nor does he really want to. All that happens when he heightens tensions\u2014when he tells people at his rallies that he wants to punch protestors; when he yearns for a better time when agitators left on stretchers; when he tells his supporters that he\u2019ll pay for their legal bills if they fight back on his behalf; when one of his supporters sucker-punches a protestor and doesn\u2019t earn a proper rebuke; when he praises a staffer who assaults a friendly journalist; when one of his rallies is shut down by aggressive leftist protestors; when he threatens riots if the GOP doesn\u2019t hand him the nomination at the convention\u2014is that he goes up in the polls.\n\nAnd that\u2019s, honestly, what concerns me the most about a Trump presidency.\n\nLook: I imagine that he\u2019ll govern similarly to Hillary Clinton, Great Wall of Trump and disastrous trade wars aside. He\u2019ll keep Obamacare in place and do little to solve the entitlement crisis headed our way while doing nothing to shrink the size of government elsewhere. Maybe the judges he\u2019d pick for the Supreme Court would be better, who knows. He doesn\u2019t, like, have a track record on the issue.\n\nThat being said, a Trump presidency is almost certain to spark protest movements the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since the start of the Iraq War. People in the streets, marching, shouting, whatever. Not really making a difference, of course, but certainly making themselves feel better. In other words: doing something altogether American! What I fear about a Trump presidency is how he will respond to these movements. Does anyone doubt that he\u2019ll take them as a personal affront? That he\u2019ll use the slightest pretext to send in armed forces to \u201cmaintain order\u201d? That he\u2019ll escalate in the hopes of using televised division to solidify his support? That he\u2019ll be more than happy to use violence against American protestors on a scale unlike what we\u2019ve seen in living memory? That he sees China\u2019s \u201cstrength\u201d during the \u201cTiananmen Square riots\u201d as an example to emulate rather than an action to be abhorred?\n\nThat\u2019s not a chance I\u2019m particularly interested in taking, thanks.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "In the last debate\u2014or maybe the one before that, who can really keep track anymore\u2014Donald Trump used a very odd phrase.
