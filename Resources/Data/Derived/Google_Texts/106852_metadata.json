It might not be a terrible legacy, but it certainly won\u2019t be a celebrated one [bold mine-DL]. That\u2019s because history rewards those leaders who do not mark time with small things but use it to accomplish big things \u2014 ones that are great and enduring.\n\nMiller is making a number of dubious assumptions here. The first and most important assumption is that \u201chistory\u201d consistently hands down similar verdicts on all leaders that use their time in power \u201cto accomplish big things.\u201d There may be such a bias in very bad American presidential historiography, but we know from recent experience how significantly assessments of past presidential records can change depending on the period in which they\u2019re being interpreted. Eisenhower left office with few major international accomplishments, but his reputation has benefited from recent revisionist accounts that give much higher marks to his foreign policy because he wisely avoided several potentially disastrous errors. On the other side, Truman ended his tenure as a failure and has since been grossly overrated by historians seeking to rehabilitate his reputation. (Bush loyalists continue to hang on to the slim hope that he will receive the same positive treatment in decades to come.) McKinley can be credited with having accomplished \u201cbig things\u201d in the Spanish War, but in retrospect most Americans now would not consider it a success that he embarked the U.S. on half a century of overseas colonial rule. Despite being arguably one of the very worst presidents, Wilson continues to have a disturbing number of admirers and defenders.\n\nSuch judgements are liable to change as later historians with greater distance from events find new evidence or interpret the existing evidence in new ways. So there\u2019s no way to know how \u201chistory\u201d (i.e., contradictory interpretations offered by various historians) will \u201creward\u201d this or any other administration at different points in time. It is possible that later historians with no personal experience of the Bush era will judge Obama more harshly than contemporaries do, or Obama might be succeeded by someone who presides over some major disaster that will make his tenure seem better than it was. All things considered, it is more likely that many of the things that provoke criticism from contemporaries will not receive nearly as much attention in later decades. For example, endless whining about lost American \u201ccredibility\u201d will probably seem even more absurd ten or twenty years from now when it becomes clear that the U.S. lost nothing important by opting not to attack Syria. Because Syria\u2019s civil war is not a \u201cstrategic disaster for the United States,\u201d historians writing on this subject decades from now may be trying to understand why so many politicians and pundits were so convinced that the U.S. had to take part in the conflict. So who\u2019s to say that \u201chistory won\u2019t judge Obama kindly\u201d on this? The truth is that we can\u2019t know, and more to the point it shouldn\u2019t really matter either way. If there are \u201ccompelling arguments against militarizing America\u2019s role\u201d in Syria, it shouldn\u2019t concern us in the least whether or not later historians agree with those arguments.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "Aaron David Miller thinks he knows how \"history\" will judge Obama's foreign policy record:  Now it seems likely -- though not absolutely certain -- that his f", "title": "Presidential Legacies and the Judgements of \u201cHistory\u201d", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/presidential-legacies-and-the-judgements-of-history/", "image": "http://theamericanconservative.com/images/facebook-logo.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Aaron David Miller thinks he knows how \"history\" will judge Obama's foreign policy record:Now it seems likely -- though not absolutely certain -- that his foreign policy will be remembered, at bes", "creator": "@amconmag", "image": {"src": "http://theamericanconservative.com/images/logo-for-twitter-card.jpg"}, "title": "Presidential Legacies and the Judgements of \u201cHistory\u201d", "site": "@amconmag", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "maisie.allison"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c9c\"", "article_summary": "Such judgements are liable to change as later historians with greater distance from events find new evidence or interpret the existing evidence in new ways.\nSo who\u2019s to say that \u201chistory won\u2019t judge Obama kindly\u201d on this?\nIf there are \u201ccompelling arguments against militarizing America\u2019s role\u201d in Syria, it shouldn\u2019t concern us in the least whether or not later historians agree with those arguments.\nThat\u2019s because history rewards those leaders who do not mark time with small things but use it to accomplish big things \u2014 ones that are great and enduring.\nAll things considered, it is more likely that many of the things that provoke criticism from contemporaries will not receive nearly as much attention in later decades."}
