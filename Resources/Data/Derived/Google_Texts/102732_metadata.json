In his songs with the Afghan Whigs in the 1990s and with the Twilight Singers in the 2000s, the Cincinnati-born, New Orleans-based songwriter always has a ride waiting outside. \u201cI\u2019ll get the car, you get the match and gasoline,\u201d he instructs a lover on the Whigs\u2019 \u201cGoing to Town,\u201d promising great conflagration. On the Singers\u2019 \u201cFollow You Down,\u201d he sings, \u201cGet the wheel, let\u2019s go for a ride. If you\u2019re trouble, then I\u2019ll follow you down.\u201d That car \u2014 presumably a sinister muscle car circa \u201972, painted oil-slick black and with tinted windows, growling in idle \u2014 sometimes offers salvation, but more often it\u2019s a vehicle to damnation.\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful metaphor, simultaneously menacing and reassuring, and it\u2019s the first thing that connects the Afghan Whigs\u2019 first album in 16 years with that band\u2019s revered catalog. The opening song \u2014 one of the heaviest in Dulli\u2019s catalog \u2014 is called \u201cParked Outside,\u201d while another, \u201cCan Rova,\u201d includes what might be a kind of mission statement for the singer/songwriter: \u201cStart the car, check the mirror \u2026 We leave tonight, ain\u2019t nuthin\u2019 but the stripes.\u201d Dulli is taking us for a ride, showing us around the seamy underworld he has created in his music. He might crash that car, he might open the door and kick us to the curb, he might even have the cops behind him, but he will never run out of gas.\n\nAn alt-soul auteur with a deep knowledge of pop and R&B history, Dulli plays the role of Virgil in his own Purgatory, ushering the listener through various levels of obsession, addiction, self-annihilation and insoluble ache. Yet, he\u2019s never so self-absorbed as your typical confessional songwriter, not only because he filters his emotions through back-alley imagery \u2014 junkies, dealers, squares, thugs and the cars they drive to and from their crime scenes \u2014 but because you never know if he\u2019s bemoaning that pain or savoring it. Or both.\n\nIn the 1990s, Dulli was out of place. Mainstream rock favored flannel shirts, long hair, intense self-absorption and classic rock filtered through a punk ethos. The Afghan Whigs, on the other hand, sported crisp suits, short hair and a sound built on rhythmic thrust. They understood that punk and R&B were imminently compatible, so made no bones about nodding to Isaac Hayes or Stevie Wonder, James Brown or Joe Tex rather than Neil Young, the Clash or the Who. They may have been lambasted for trying to \u201csound black,\u201d but their albums \u2014 especially the epochal \u201cGentleman\u201d and their swan song \u201c1965\u201d \u2014 are beholden to no particular scene and have aged remarkably well.\n\nThe Afghan Whigs disbanded in 2001, citing logistical problems and family obligations. Dulli formed the Twilight Singers, which boasted a loose membership; he was the only constant for 10 years and five studio albums. As with many classic alt-rock bands of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 such as Mission of Burma, Dinosaur Jr, the Feelies, the dBs, among many others \u2014 the Afghan Whigs reconvened in 2011 for a handful of new dates, dusting off old tunes and recording two new covers. \u201cDo to the Beast\u201d arose from that tour, an immensely satisfying addition to Dulli\u2019s incredible catalog. Salon spoke to him about the new album, the nature of performance and the act of reconnecting with his younger selves.\n\nWas there a moment when you realized that you could get new music out of the Afghan Whigs reunion?\n\nThose shows were a retrospective, so to speak. I just really enjoyed playing them. Other than doing the covers for that tour \u2014 the Queenie Lyons and Frank Ocean songs \u2014 we never talked, not one fucking time, about making a record. Not once. It wasn\u2019t until that Usher gig [at South By Southwest 2013] that it clicked for me that I wanted to do another record. People don\u2019t believe that.\n\nWhat was it about that show that sparked that idea?\n\nWe had two days to make the show happen, so it reminded me of the old days when a bunch of people got into a room with a common goal. I talked to Usher about this, while it was happening. It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a battle of the bands on Saturday and you\u2019ve got Thursday and Friday to make a band. That was thrilling for me, just to get in a room with a bunch of people and make something happen. You have to get to know each other. You have to see what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nUsher\u2019s guitar player appears on the album. You must have been impressed by him.\n\nJohnny \u201cNatural\u201d Najera was just standing on the sidelines observing, and eventually I invited him to play. I couldn\u2019t believe what an amazing player he was. I was stunned. So he got put in the band. That process reminded me of being a young guy again. I had other people playing on a lot of the Twilight Singers records, but they were mostly solitary. And I was excited by the band dynamic \u2014 putting that Usher show together \u2014 and wanted to explore that again.\n\nDid you plan on releasing this album on Sub Pop [the Afghan Whigs\u2019 original label]? It seems like you\u2019ve come full circle.\n\nThis is my third record on Sub Pop since 2008 [following the Twilight Singers\u2019 Dynamite Steps and a collaboration with Mark Lanegan called Gutter Twins]. They\u2019re friends, keep in mind. The landscape of recording and touring and making music was so different in 1993 than it is right now. We had outgrown what we could do at Sub Pop at that time, so that\u2019s why we moved to Elektra to do \u201cGentleman.\u201d Nowadays, there\u2019s not much disparity [between major labels and independent labels]. I\u2019d much rather work on a label where I can call the president on his cellphone at midnight and ask him what he thinks of something. I don\u2019t have to wait to talk to anybody. I\u2019ve maintained a relationship with [founder] Jonathan Poneman and [executive vice president] Megan Jasper since 1989. They\u2019ve always supported me, even in the years when I wasn\u2019t on their label. They always come to my shows. They call me on my birthday. So it was a no-brainer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive: Afghan Whigs singer on connecting with his '90s songs, loving R&B, how the band decided to record again", "title": "Afghan Whigs\u2019 Greg Dulli: \u201cWriting songs is the greatest gift I could give myself\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Exclusive: Afghan Whigs singer on connecting with his '90s songs, loving R&B, how the band decided to record again", "title": "Afghan Whigs\u2019 Greg Dulli: \u201cWriting songs is the greatest gift I could give myself\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/24/afghan_whigs_greg_dulli_writing_songs_is_the_greatest_gift_i_could_give_myself/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/afghan_whigs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive: Afghan Whigs singer on connecting with his '90s songs, loving R&B, how the band decided to record again", "title": "Afghan Whigs\u2019 Greg Dulli: \u201cWriting songs is the greatest gift I could give myself\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/afghan_whigs.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Stephen Deusner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Afghan Whigs, Greg Dulli, Jonathan Poneman, Music, SubPop, Twilight Singers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Afghan Whigs, Greg Dulli, Jonathan Poneman, Music, SubPop, Twilight Singers, Entertainment NewsGreg Dulli has a thing about cars.\nThe Afghan Whigs, on the other hand, sported crisp suits, short hair and a sound built on rhythmic thrust.\nThe Afghan Whigs disbanded in 2001, citing logistical problems and family obligations.\nIn his songs with the Afghan Whigs in the 1990s and with the Twilight Singers in the 2000s, the Cincinnati-born, New Orleans-based songwriter always has a ride waiting outside.\nWas there a moment when you realized that you could get new music out of the Afghan Whigs reunion?"}
