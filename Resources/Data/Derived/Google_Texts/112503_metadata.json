These ideas come with hardly a whisper of a reckoning with the great cost\u2014 in both money and opportunity\u2014such ideas might impose on Americans. That\u2019s not his jam. It might be his job, but it\u2019s not his jam. Undergirding each of these ideas is an impression of a country that makes no effort to do any of the things he wants done. If you just listened to this speech, you\u2019d think we greedy taxpayers never contribute any of our tax money to infrastructure. You\u2019d think we live in a country that\u2019s one lapsed federal regulation away from poisoning our children with bad water and laced Tonka trucks. None of that is true, but it helps to make the case. It also has the advantage of skipping over any accountability for the federal government for what it\u2019s done with our money in the past.\n\nYou\u2019d also think we live in a country where very few people get paid sick leave. Why else would the government need to impose paid sick leave on greedy private companies from the top down? The president:\n\nHere\u2019s another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. 43 million workers have no paid sick leave. 43 million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I\u2019ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let\u2019s put it to a vote right here in Washington. (Applause.) Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It\u2019s the right thing to do. (Applause.)\n\nThough he\u2019s right that there are people without paid sick leave, the impression he\u2019s creating that we\u2019re a workaholic country full of flu-ridden zombies staggering through workdays because we can\u2019t afford to take off is not, strictly speaking true.\n\nFrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is part of the Labor Department, which is part of the Obama administration:\n\nPaid leave was the most prevalent employee benefit provided by employers in private industry throughout the United States in 2012. Eighty-four percent of private industry workers received vacation, holiday, or personal leave.1 Seventy-two percent of workers received both paid holidays and paid vacations, and 61 percent were covered by sick leave plans. For employers, the cost for providing these benefits to employees was $1.98 per hour worked, and these benefits made up 6.9 percent of total compensation.2 The eligibility for paid leave has undergone change over the past 20 years. While fewer workers enjoy paid vacations, employers are increasingly providing access to sick leave, personal leave, and family leave. (See table 1.) Also, by comparison, the employer cost per employee hour worked for paid leave was $1.09 or 6.8 percent of total compensation in March 1992.\n\nIt\u2019s also not true that we\u2019re the only advanced country without such a guarantee. We\u2019re right up there with such disasters as\u2026Canada and Japan:\n\nObama exaggerated when he said the United States was \u201cthe only advanced country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid sick leave.\u201d While Canada and Japan have social insurance programs that would cover an extended leave for cancer treatment, they don\u2019t have guaranteed paid leave for an illness that lasts a few days. And Obama made the claim in calling for \u201ca bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.\u201d A 2009 report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a group funded by various labor groups and foundations, examined policies in 22 countries \u201cranked highly in terms of economic and human development.\u201d It says in the first paragraph that the U.S. is \u201cthe only country that does not guarantee that workers receive paid sick days or paid sick leave,\u201d but it goes on to say that neither Canada nor Japan has a policy for financial support for short-term leave, for an illness such as a five-day flu. Those countries do have social insurance that would cover some of the pay for an employee needing 50 days off for cancer treatment. Those are the two scenarios examined in the study. The report says that 11 countries guaranteed full pay for an illness requiring five sick days. Others paid for some missed time, but not all five days (and in a few cases not even one full day), because of waiting periods before the financial support would kick in.\n\nThough there are certainly people in the private sector without paid sick leave, the majority of workers do have it, and that number is going up. Note what\u2019s going down, according to BLS, and see if you can spot a correlation: \u201cWhile fewer workers enjoy paid vacations, employers are increasingly providing access to sick leave, personal leave, and family leave.\u201d\n\nThe state and municipal campaigns the president mentioned to add paid sick leave to workers\u2019 benefits have been successful in many places, which means employers then have to make decisions about how to compensate for these new costs. When mandates on what a business offers to its employees go up, other areas of compensation often go down. If you\u2019re requiring businesses to deliver full health-care coverage and paid sick leave, employees will see a shift away from their paid vacation or their base pay.\n\nAn economic study of a San Francisco policy requiring paid sick leave (though less than the president demands) found that\u2019s exactly what happened there:\n\nThe San Francisco policy hasn\u2019t been without problems. Dube and his team found that to comply with the law, some employers have had to cut other compensation, such as vacation days. Stanford economist Nick Bloom told National Journal that, under a federal policy, this phenomenon could be more detrimental in a part of the country that\u2019s not experiencing such economic growth.\n\nIronically, right after demanding that businesses add paid sick leave, the president bemoaned falling wages. Again, the more mandates you add, the more potential pay gets funneled to take care of those costs instead of giving them directly to an employee who could then choose to spend them as she pleased.\n\nStudies of San Francisco\u2019s law have shown it\u2019s not terribly detrimental to existing employers, who are largely satisfied with the law. It doesn\u2019t account, as these things never can really, for the potential businesses that never exist because of the growing burden on any business owner. There\u2019s your opportunity cost, and it\u2019s real. Margins matter a hell of a lot when you\u2019re trying to get off the ground, especially in a place as expensive as San Francisco.\n\nThe economist Arindrajit Dube, mentioned above and reported on by National Journal, also notes that San Francisco\u2019s booming tech economy is a special case:\n\n\u201cThe extent to which there\u2019s been any cost, in that it\u2019s maybe slightly more expensive to employ people, it would not be very obvious, because we\u2019re booming economically,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cTake parts of the Midwest that are still in heavy recession\u2014they may struggle more if there\u2019s a national sick leave policy.\u201d\n\nIndeed. And, the question is, how much of that opportunity do you want to lose, how much do you want to risk, in a place that\u2019s been hard-hit by this economy since 2008? Especially, when as noted by the BLS, paid leave in all areas is growing, and more than 60 percent have access to short-term paid sick leave now. At the very least, let the people of those towns and cities decide on those risks for themselves instead of the federal government doing it for them.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly that this is a solution looking for a problem, but it\u2019s a ridiculously gigantic and expensive solution to a problem that is increasingly being solved by Americans on their own. (And, of course, there\u2019s always the case of people who don\u2019t think forgoing paid sick leave is a problem, and would like to have the dadgum freedom to choose more take-home instead because \u2018Merica, but try explaining that to a statist.) It\u2019s a solution that will add to other problems, like unemployment, shrinking labor force, and wage stagnation. And, it\u2019s a problem, by the way, that has been exacerbated by Obamacare\u2019s mandates, which led employers to make many of their workers part-time employees who, wait for it, have lower wages and don\u2019t get paid sick leave. Good plan, guys. Try more mandates. That\u2019s probably the ticket.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "President Obama announced many, many things during his State of the Union address that he\u2019d liked to force taxpayers and businesses to do because he thinks they\u2019re swell ideas.
