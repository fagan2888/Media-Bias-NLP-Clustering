When you enter the world of business and politics, this is what happens,\" he told Reuters.\n\nHe said that the taxes were owed not by him but by a person who bought a company from him that did business in Estonia.\n\nA biography of Haidari compiled by the Afghanistan Analysts Network cited a recent television interview in which he said he once ran an agricultural import-export company that did business in eastern Europe and Russia.\n\nHis current business is focused on construction and information technology as well as agricultural products, the profile said.\n\n(Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Hamid Shalizi", "Author": "Hamid Shalizi", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's nominee for agriculture minister in the new cabinet is on an Interpol wanted list for tax evasion in Estonia, a fact Ghani's spokesman said was unknown to his office at the time of his nomination.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "Afghan cabinet nominee wanted by Interpol for tax evasion", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
