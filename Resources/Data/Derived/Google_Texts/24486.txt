Selfie sticks—long, handheld poles used to capture that perfect photo of oneself—are among the list of items banned at some of this year’s most popular music festivals, including Coachella and Lollapalooza.

“GoPro attachments like sticks, selfie sticks & monopods” are listed as forbidden items under Lollapalooza’s FAQ section, while Coachella similarly writes, “NO selfie sticks/narcisstics” on its own festival website.

The photography accessory—which President Obama notoriously utilized earlier this year in a Buzzfeed video promoting Obamacare—has gained in popularity since being imported from overseas last year. Time magazine called the stick one of “The 25 Best Inventions of 2014.” Some of the more advanced versions of the stick include a built-in Bluetooth remote control for easier use.

However, the sticks have proved controversial, not to mention annoying, for those in the vicinity of the photographer.

“Anyone walking around with a prop to take pictures of themselves is a tool,” New Yorker Gregory Davis put it bluntly to the New York Post in December.

Now it appears that some of this summer’s biggest festivals and music venues are taking the criticism seriously. In addition to Coachella and Lollapalooza, the UK’s O2 arena and Wembley Stadium have also outlawed the sticks due to “safety considerations,” according to Rolling Stone.

So far, it looks like similarly-sized festivals like Bonnaroo and Governor’s Ball have not yet outlawed selfie sticks. However, if the item continues to gain popularity, these festivals may be forced to amend their rules as well.
