Its creator is too obsessed with sexual weirdness. It\u2019s a rip-off of James Ellroy\u2019s novels. And, as we keep hearing, it\u2019s not as good as the bayou-set Season 1. There\u2019s no consensus \u2014 one IndieWire article wonders \u201cWhy No One Can Agree on Anything About \u2018True Detective\u2019 Season 2\u2033\u2013 but critics and civilians alike started, a few weeks ago, to take real pleasure in their dissing of Nic Pizzolatto\u2019s show. There\u2019s even a whole online discussion of why people \u201chate-watch\u201d the show, and whether it makes sense, and what they might view instead; these folks don\u2019t agree either, but the hatred of this California-set season is taken for granted.\n\nThe shortcomings of this season are real. Most seriously, the plot is so dense and complicated that it\u2019s easy to lose track even while watching attentively. And it makes it harder to focus on details of character or storytelling or whatever when one unlikely plot twist after another keeps appearing out of nowhere.\n\nBut there is so much good in the second season: strong performances, intelligent dialogue, a strong if imperfect sense of place. And Season 1 \u2014 especially thanks to its Louisiana setting, its use of fractured narrative, and the chemistry between Matthew McConaughey\u2019s and Woody Harrelson\u2019s characters \u2014 is some of the best television in history. So whether you believe that Season 2 is just a bit messy or a major bellyflop, it\u2019s worth asking, What happened?\n\nWhat it may come down to is the limits of something that seemed to define this genuinely great era of high-end television: the heroic showrunner auteur. Instead of being a product made by committee, these new character-driven series were crafted by mavericks and intellectuals who compressed all their experience, all their neuroses, into their storytelling. These smart cable shows were, as journalist Brett Martin laid out in his useful chronicle of the post-\u201cSopranos\u201d revolution, \u201cDifficult Men,\u201d our age\u2019s equivalent to the Great American Novel, the serious film. (And of course, the term \u201cauteur\u201d was most famously applied to the work of heavy American filmmakers, and it was the individuality of their vision, in part, that made them major artists in the way that mere craftsmen or journeyman directors were not.)\n\nSometimes it works: \u201cThe Wire\u201d is one of the great documents of our time, and, a lot of that greatness came from David Simon and his decades of journalistic storytelling. Despite some dissipation near the end, Matt Weiner\u2019s \u201cMad Men\u201d chronicled a misunderstood period of American life in a fresh, lively way. Would we have wanted difficult man David Milch to have had a collaborator for \u201cDeadwood\u201d? Probably not \u2014 though we\u2019d have preferred another season or two.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A single strong vision can be a wonderful thing for a show \u2014\u00a0or it can be its downfall", "title": "The dangers of auteur TV: How \u201cTrue Detective\u201d went from critical darling to laughingstock", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A single strong vision can be a wonderful thing for a show \u2014\u00a0or it can be its downfall", "title": "The dangers of auteur TV: How \u201cTrue Detective\u201d went from critical darling to laughingstock", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/26/the_dangers_of_auteur_tv_how_true_detective_went_from_critical_darling_to_laughingstock/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/true_detective_season_split.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A single strong vision can be a wonderful thing for a show \u2014\u00a0or it can be its downfall", "title": "The dangers of auteur TV: How \u201cTrue Detective\u201d went from critical darling to laughingstock", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/true_detective_season_split.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, HBO, Nic Pizzolatto, Television, true detective, true detective season 2, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: HBO, Nic Pizzolatto, Television, true detective, true detective season 2, TV, Entertainment NewsBy now, just about everyone has taken a shot at the current season of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d It\u2019s too dense, too grim, too earnest, too masculine.\nThese smart cable shows were, as journalist Brett Martin laid out in his useful chronicle of the post-\u201cSopranos\u201d revolution, \u201cDifficult Men,\u201d our age\u2019s equivalent to the Great American Novel, the serious film.\nThere\u2019s no consensus \u2014 one IndieWire article wonders \u201cWhy No One Can Agree on Anything About \u2018True Detective\u2019 Season 2\u2033\u2013 but critics and civilians alike started, a few weeks ago, to take real pleasure in their dissing of Nic Pizzolatto\u2019s show.\nWhat it may come down to is the limits of something that seemed to define this genuinely great era of high-end television: the heroic showrunner auteur.\nDespite some dissipation near the end, Matt Weiner\u2019s \u201cMad Men\u201d chronicled a misunderstood period of American life in a fresh, lively way."}
