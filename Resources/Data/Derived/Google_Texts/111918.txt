Over the next ten days, we're challenging you to do what you can to end hunger in South Dakota.

Start a collection at work, at school or at church. It doesn't matter if it's spare change or cans of food. If we all work together, it will add up fast.

Visit our Hunger: Feeding The Need page to find ideas of what you can do to help. And be sure to keep us updated. Share your stories with us online, and we can all inspire each other.

Then on September 20, we'll have a drop-off at KELOLAND Television and everything you bring in will go directly to Feeding South Dakota.
