They instead want two-way communication, Schultz said. As for hypocrisy, they want church leaders to be authentic and to admit they don't have all the answers about God and faith, he said.\n\nAnd they want God to be \"packaged\" differently in a way they find relevant, Schultz said.\n\n\"They want a close and personal interaction with God,\" he said. \"In real simple terms, what the majority is crying for is evidence and stories that God is real.\"\n\nThe Schultzes identified four tested and proven principles for bringing people back to the church, which they call the \"4 Acts of Love,\" as a way to experience God based on faith as a relationship.\n\nThe first act is \"radical hospitality,\" a replacement for judgment by welcoming visitors as they are, no matter their backgrounds or stations in life, Schultz said.\n\nInstead of lecturing, church leaders can engage in \"fearless conversation,\" encouraging two-way communication and a willingness to tackle difficult and controversial topics.\n\n\"People today really want to grapple with the important issues in their lives,\" Schultz said.\n\nThe third act favors genuine humility over hypocrisy.\n\n\"We're not putting ourselves on a pedestal. We're fellow travelers on this faith journey,\" Schultz said. \"Genuine humility also points toward a ministry that doesn't focus on personalities but more on the community of believers.\"\n\nAs for packaging God, the Schultzes recommend helping churchgoers see that God is real and active today, not just in biblical times, Schultz said.\n\n\"Jesus exemplified these four acts of love,\" Schultz said. \"These are biblically based practices that would be good to do even if the culture wasn't walking away from the church.\"\n\nOverall, the Schultzes are not recommending changing the message, but the methods for reaching people, Schultz said.\n\n\"Joani and I have a deep love of the church and the ministry of the church,\" he said. \"It is out of that love that we desire the church reach its full potential.\"\n\nShelley Widhalm can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 531, or swidhalm@reporter-herald.com.
