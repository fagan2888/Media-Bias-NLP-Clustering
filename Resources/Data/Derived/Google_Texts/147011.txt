Senator and presidential candidate Lindsey Graham recently blamed Rachel Maddow and Sean Hannity for polarization, and tonight the latter confronted Graham about that jab.

Graham explained to Hannity that he might agree with him more than he does with Maddow, but all the partisan bickering doesn’t actually solve any problems.

Hannity responded by asking, “Wasn’t Martin Luther King Jr. polarizing in a good way for justice?”

He also pointed out to Graham that he’s polarizing too, but Graham just insisted that things Hannity pushed for––like fighting Obamacare to the point of shutdown––”make zero sense to me” and the GOP “needs to knock off some of this stuff.”
