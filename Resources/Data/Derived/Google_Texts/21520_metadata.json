Fitch expects that the company will apply the proceeds of the proposed notes to refinance senior debt obligations of HCA Holdings, Inc. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to $29.4 billion of debt outstanding at March 31, 2015. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.\n\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nHospital Industry-Leading Financial Flexibility: HCA's financial flexibility has improved significantly in recent years as a result of organic growth in the business as well as proactive management of the capital structure. The company has industry-leading operating margins and generates consistent and ample discretionary FCF (operating cash flows less capital expenditures and distributions to minority interests).\n\nTransition to Public Ownership: The sponsors of a 2006 LBO previously directed HCA's financial strategy, but their ownership stake decreased steadily following a 2011 IPO and HCA has appointed four new independent members to the 11-member board of directors (BOD), bringing the total to seven.\n\nShifting Priorities for Cash Deployment: Under the direction of the LBO sponsors, HCA's ratings were constrained by shareholder-friendly capital deployment; the company has funded $7.4 billion in special dividends and several large repurchases of the sponsors' shares since 2010. Fitch thinks HCA will have a more consistent and predictable approach to funding shareholder payouts under public ownership and an independent BOD.\n\nExpect Nominal Deleveraging: Fitch forecasts that HCA will produce discretionary FCF (operating cash flows less capital expenditures and distributions to minority interests) of about $1.6 billion in 2015, and will prioritize use of cash for organic investment in the business, acquisitions and share repurchases. At 3.8x, HCA's gross debt/EBITDA is below the average of the group of publicly traded hospital companies and Fitch does not believe that there is a compelling financial incentive for HCA to apply cash to debt reduction.\n\nSecular Headwinds to Operating Outlook: Measured by revenues, HCA is the largest operator of for-profit acute care hospitals in the country, with a broad geographic footprint. The company benefited from this favorable operating profile during a period of several years of weak organic operating trends in the for-profit hospital industry. Although operating trends improved industrywide starting in mid-2014, secular challenges, including a shift to lower-cost care settings and health insurer scrutiny of hospital care, are a continuing headwind to organic growth.\n\nLiquidity Profile is Solid: At March 31, 2015, HCA's liquidity included $586 million of cash on hand, $2.6 billion of available capacity on its bank facility revolving loans and LTM discretionary FCF of about $2.3 billion. HCA's EBITDA/gross interest expense is solid for the 'BB-' rating category at 4.4x and the company has ample operating cushion under its bank facility financial maintenance covenants, which require debt net of cash maintained below 6.75x EBITDA.\n\nDebt Maturities are Manageable: Fitch believes that HCA's favorable operating outlook and financial flexibility afford the company good market access to refinance upcoming maturities. Large upcoming maturities include $1 billion of HCA Inc. unsecured notes and $1.23 billion of bank term loans maturing in 2016. Proceeds of the proposed notes issuance will be used to refinance the 7.75% $1.525 billion senior notes due 2021 of HCA Holdings, Inc., which are structurally subordinate to the debt obligations of HCA Inc.\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nIf HCA consistently operates with leverage below 4.0x over the next several quarters, it could support an upgrade of the IDR to 'BB'. In addition to a commitment to operate with lower leverage, sustained improvement in organic operating trends in the hospital industry would support a higher rating for HCA. Fitch believes the hospital industry may post another couple of quarters of above-trend growth in patient volumes as the positive effects of the Affordable Care Act gain momentum in 2015. However, secular headwinds to growth remain intact over the longer term.\n\nMaintenance of the 'BB-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) considers HCA operating with total debt/EBITDA below 4.5x, and with an FCF margin of 4% or higher. A downgrade of the IDR to 'B+' is unlikely in the near term, since these targets afford HCA with significant financial flexibility to increase capital investment and acquisitions while still applying some cash to share repurchases.\n\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS\n\n--Very strong rates of organic volume growth in the first half of 2015, supported by ramp up of ACA related benefit and improving economic conditions, tapering to a more normalized 2-3% later in the year;\n\n--Modest EBITDA margin compression in later 2015-2016 primarily resulting from negative operating leverage as volume growth rates normalize and pricing trends remain stable;\n\n--EBITDA of $7.8 billion and discretionary FCF of $1.6 billion in 2015 with higher capital expenditures of about $2.5 billion; higher capital spending is related to growth projects that support the expectation of EBITDA growth through the forecast period;\n\n--The majority of discretionary FCF is directed towards share repurchases and acquisitions, and all debt coming due is refinanced; resulting in gross debt/EBITDA of 3.5x-4.0x through the forecast period.\n\nDEBT ISSUE RATINGS\n\nFitch currently rates HCA as follows:\n\nHCA, Inc.\n\n--IDR 'BB-';\n\n--Senior secured credit facilities (cash flow and asset backed) 'BB+';\n\n--Senior secured first lien notes 'BB+';\n\n--Senior unsecured notes 'BB-'.\n\nHCA Holdings Inc.\n\n--IDR 'BB-';\n\n--Senior unsecured notes 'B'.\n\nTotal debt of approximately $29.4 billion includes $8.1 billion of first-lien secured bank debt, $11.1 billion of first-lien secured notes, $7.1 billion of HCA Inc. unsecured notes, and $2.5 billion of Hold Co. unsecured notes. HCA's bank debt comprises approximately $5.5 billion in term loans maturing through May 2018: a $2 billion capacity cash flow revolving loan and a $3.25 billion capacity asset-based revolving loan (ABL facility).\n\nThe secured debt rating is two notches above the IDR, illustrating Fitch's expectation of superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The first-lien obligations, including the bank debt and the first-lien secured notes, are guaranteed by all material wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of HCA, Inc. that are 'unrestricted subsidiaries' under the HCA Inc. unsecured note indenture dated Dec. 16, 1993.\n\nThe HCA Inc. unsecured notes are rated at the same level as the IDR despite the substantial amount of secured debt to which they are subordinated, with secured leverage of about 2.5x. Fitch often notches ratings on unsecured debt obligations below the IDR level when secured debt leverage is greater than 2.5x. The strength and stability of HCA's cash flows supports an expectation of at least average recovery for these lenders relative to historical rates in an event of default, supporting a rating at the same level as the IDR. However, if HCA were to layer more secured debt into the capital structure, such that secured debt leverage is greater than 3.0x, it could result in a downgrade of the rating on the HCA Inc. unsecured notes to 'B+'.\n\nThe HCA Holdings Inc. unsecured notes are rated two notches below the IDR to reflect the substantial structural subordination of these obligations, which are subordinate in right of payment to all debt outstanding at the HCA Inc. level. Leverage at the HCA Inc. and HCA Holdings Inc. level is 3.5x and 3.8x, respectively.\n\nAdditional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.\n\nApplicable Criteria and Related Research:\n\n--'High-Yield Healthcare Checkup' (April 30, 2015);\n\n--'Hospitals Credit Diagnosis: Operating Performance Strength to Persist in Early 2015' (April 14, 2015);\n\n--'For-Profit Hospital Insights: Fitch's Annual Review of Bad Debt Accounting Policies and Practices' (Jan. 7, 2015);\n\n--'U.S. Leveraged Finance Spotlight Series: HCA Holdings, Inc.'
