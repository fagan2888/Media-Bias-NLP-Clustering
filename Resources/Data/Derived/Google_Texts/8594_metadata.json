When they come back to the facility, there\u2019s an almost certainty they will have a reduced level of functioning, less strength, and need rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicaid Service is partnering with 145 nursing facilities in seven states to implement the trial program. Nineteen of those nursing homes are in Indiana.\n\nEach Indiana facility gets a registered nurse like McClinton and there\u2019s a shared pool of nurse practitioners who visit the facilities and help fill in gaps.\n\n\u201cThe 19 facilities we partnered with were already working on reducing avoidable hospitalizations. That\u2019s important because it\u2019s a big deal for them to accept an outside person coming in and jumping into their team, talking about doing things differently, trying this or trying that,\u201d says Unroe. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that they were already interested in this outcomes. In line with their priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the push of the industry to decrease hospitalizations we certainly want to be on the front end of innovation frankly and get on board with that,\u201d says Toron Jackson-Kenny, the executive director of North Capitol Nursing Home where McClinton works.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates nursing homes develop plans to improve health care quality and reduce Medicare and Medicaid costs. Reducing avoidable hospitalizations figures into that.\n\nFigures from 2011 show unnecessary hospitalizations each year among Medicare and Medicaid patients cost between $7 billion and $8 billion.\n\nHow Nursing Homes \u2018Double Dip\u2019\n\nThe reason these avoidable hospitalizations cost so much is complicated.\n\nAccording to Unroe, Medicaid pays the day to day nursing home rate for most long term nursing home residents.\n\nWhen someone is hospitalized, Medicare kicks in and pays for the bulk of their acute care. If the nursing home resident is in the hospital for three days or more, they\u2019ll be able to access what is called the Medicare Post Acute Care Benefit after they go home to the care facility.\n\nThe Medicare Post Acute Care Benefit reimburses nursing homes at a much higher rate than the Medicaid daily rate.\n\nThe rationale is that a person might require skilled services like therapy after a hospitalization.\n\n\u201cA lot of the discussion about why transfers happen from the perspective of federal policymakers is that the financial incentives are misaligned and encourage facilities to send residents outs,\u201d Unroe says. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly more complicated than that, but that is the thought that there are misaligned financial incentives that contribute to this problem and that the federal government is going to change these incentives in some way to try and favor treating people in nursing homes.\u201d\n\nUnroe says the big question is whether nursing homes have the ability to provide those extra resources even if they want to.\n\nThat of course, is what the pilot project does.\n\nIf it\u2019s successful, Unroe says part of what the government might do when it restructures the financial incentives, is look at adding additional resources in nursing homes on a permanent basis.\n\nThe grant for the project runs for four years. It\u2019s been about a year and a half.\n\nIt is too early to determine whether the program is a success or exactly how much money it has saved, but Jackson-Kenny says at her facility there has been a notable decline in unnecessary hospitalizations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPTIMISTIC seeks to reduce Medicaid and Medicare costs by treating patients in nursing homes instead of transferring them to the hospital.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "OPTIMISTIC seeks to reduce Medicaid and Medicare costs by treating patients in nursing homes instead of transferring them to the hospital.", "title": "Nursing Homes Aim To Cut Billions Spent On Hospitalizations | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/program-65551/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/04/nurses.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/04/nurses.jpg", "description": "OPTIMISTIC seeks to reduce Medicaid and Medicare costs by treating patients in nursing homes instead of transferring them to the hospital.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nursing Homes Aim To Cut Billions Spent On Hospitalizations"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a9c\"", "article_summary": "According to Unroe, Medicaid pays the day to day nursing home rate for most long term nursing home residents.\nHow Nursing Homes \u2018Double Dip\u2019The reason these avoidable hospitalizations cost so much is complicated.\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates nursing homes develop plans to improve health care quality and reduce Medicare and Medicaid costs.\n\u201cOPTIMISTIC, our intervention, is designed to put these extra resources in nursing homes, see what kind of difference we can make in providing enhanced care,\u201d Unroe says.\nNineteen of those nursing homes are in Indiana."}
