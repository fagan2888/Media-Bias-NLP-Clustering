The Wickecheoke Creek flows into the Delaware River, which provides drinking water for more than 1 million Central Jersey residents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to add this property to the Wickecheoke Creek Preserve, a patchwork of preserved open space and farmland along and near the Wickecheoke Creek,\u201d said Greg Romano, assistant director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation. \u201c(The) New Jersey Conservation Foundation has been working in the region for more than 30 years, permanently saving nearly 4,000 acres with our partners.\u201d\n\nFunding for the acquisition was provided by the state Green Acres Program and Hunterdon County open-space grants to the New Jersey Conservation Foundation and Raritan Township. The New Jersey Water Supply Authority contributed to additional costs, such as the appraisals, survey and environmental assessment.\n\n\u201cHunterdon County is pleased to support and partner with New Jersey Conservation Foundation to preserve this important greenway connector,\u201d said Hunterdon County Freeholder Director John W. King. \u201cWith the proposed expanded hiking opportunities, this acquisition will highlight the natural beauty of our county to residents and visitors alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are so pleased to partner with (the) New Jersey Conservation Foundation to preserve this important forest land that protects the headwaters of the Wickecheoke Creek while providing opportunities for our residents to enjoy hiking and nature study,\u201d said Amy Greene, chairwoman of Raritan Township\u2019s Open Space Committee. \u201cThis land preservation project is an appropriate use of our Green Acres funding and offers linkages to lands previously protected in partnership with (the) New Jersey Conservation Foundation.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey Conservation Foundation is a private nonprofit that preserves land and natural resources throughout New Jersey for the benefit of all. Since 1960, New Jersey Conservation has protected 125,000 acres of open space \u2014 from the Highlands to the Pine Barrens to the Delaware Bayshore, from farms to forests to urban and suburban parks.
