To really understand where our health system may be headed, however, I suspect that Peter Drucker would have turned his gaze elsewhere: to ThedaCare.\n\nThedaCare is a community health system with more than 6,000 employees working at five hospitals and 22 clinics across Northeast Wisconsin. Over the past decade, it has established an extraordinary record of raising quality (with nearly 100% of its patients now rating their experience a 5 out of 5) while controlling the cost of inpatient care (down 25% since 2007).\n\nThe secret: ThedaCare uses Lean, a set of management principles originated by Toyota in the late 1940s to build cars.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, nothing else works\u2014and I\u2019ve tried everything,\u201d says physician John Toussaint, ThedaCare\u2019s former chief executive who these days runs the ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value, which he launched five years ago to help spread what he and his colleagues have painstakingly learned.\n\nPerhaps their biggest lesson is just how hard it is to institute real reform: practicing evidence-based medicine, paying for value as opposed to volume and implementing Lean.\n\n\u201cLean is not a program; it is not a set of quality improvement tools; it is not a quick fix; it is not a responsibility that can be delegated,\u201d Toussaint and Texas A&M professor Leonard Berry explained in a piece they wrote earlier this year in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. \u201cRather, Lean is a cultural transformation that changes how an organization works . . . It requires new habits, new skills and often a new attitude throughout the organization.\u201d\n\nToussaint\u2019s a-ha moment came in 2002, when as ThedaCare\u2019s CEO he decided that he needed to look outside the healthcare sector to stimulate his thinking for how to systematically upgrade clinical performance. He visited Ariens Co., a manufacturer of snow blowers, and was stunned at what he saw: Front-line workers, teamed in small groups, were solving quality issues on the spot.\n\n\u201cThe power they had to make radical changes to the product was just remarkable,\u201d Toussaint recalls. \u201cI thought, \u2018These snow blowers are getting better care than our patients.\u2019\u201dAriens was using a version of Lean. Toussaint was hooked.\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted, Drucker\u2019s influence on the Toyota Production System was profound, and so it\u2019s not surprising that he would have found much to admire in ThedaCare\u2019s techniques.\n\nFor starters, ThedaCare has created a culture of continuous improvement, with staff at all levels encouraged to ceaselessly experiment and then readily adopt what works, so that the bar is perpetually being raised. \u201cEventually,\u201d Drucker pointed out, \u201ccontinuous improvements lead to fundamental change.\u201d\n\nSecond, ThedaCare is fully focused on delivering value, which it defines as enhancing the benefits that patients receive while lessening the burdens\u2014both monetary and nonmonetary\u2014that they have to endure. This approach stands in stark contrast to the way that many medical providers gauge \u201cvalue\u201d: health outcomes per dollars spent.\n\nEvery step in a particular process at ThedaCare\u2014being admitted to the hospital, say\u2014is broken down and laid out in a \u201cvalue stream map\u201d so that new efficiencies can be uncovered. \u201cIn knowledge and service work,\u201d Drucker wrote, \u201cthe first questions in increasing productivity\u2014and working smarter\u2014have to be, \u2018What is the task? What are we trying to accomplish? Why do it all?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe real beauty of making these maps is that it puts the patient at the center of everything. \u201cThere is no loss to the customer,\u201d Drucker pointed out, \u201cby eliminating activities that do not add value.\u201d In the case of admissions, for example, the time it takes to be checked in to a ThedaCare facility has been cut in half.\n\nThird, ThedaCare rallies all of its employees around a small number of well-articulated strategic objectives. Progress is measured, first and foremost, through a customer loyalty score. Meanwhile, other metrics\u2014regarding patient and staff safety, mortality and readmission rates, employee engagement and financial stewardship\u2014are widely broadcast and meticulously tracked. As Drucker wrote, \u201cInformation-based organizations require clear, simple, common objectives that translate into particular actions.\u201d\n\nFourth, ThedaCare flips the org chart on its head, with nurses and others traditionally at the bottom of the hospital hierarchy trusted\u2014indeed expected\u2014to do most of the innovating. Those higher up the chain, for their part, must then slide into new roles as facilitators and mentors.\n\nThis can be particularly difficult for doctors to swallow. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to be autocratic and controlling,\u201d Toussaint says. Yet Drucker considered it essential to cultivate \u201ca managerial attitude on the part of even the lowliest worker.\u201d\n\nDespite all the challenges, a growing number of medical institutions are going Lean. And when things click, the results are amazing. \u201cYou see the nurses and docs acting differently,\u201d Toussaint says\u2014huddling every morning to review performance targets, troubleshooting in real time, making sure the patient remains front and center.\n\nEven a snow blower couldn\u2019t ask for more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Washington stalemated and the government\u2019s new online medical insurance exchanges trying to work out the kinks, much of the nation is fixed on the fate of Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://business.time.com/2013/10/09/the-real-face-of-healthcare-reform/", "type": "article", "image": "https://timebusinessblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/healthland_insurance_06211.jpg?w=307", "site_name": "TIME.com", "title": "The Real Face of Healthcare Reform | TIME.com"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The latest news and commentary on the economy, the markets, and business", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d8fe9c72e6ddb8decc694e4fdd84f015?s=16", "application-name": "Business & Money", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "keywords": "management & leadership, the drucker difference,", "google-site-verification": "RuBIxOwStTsi-KOuQpMhdd-F4UmaxCoOJAOJ8D2hh8Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "management & leadership, the drucker difference,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c66\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn knowledge and service work,\u201d Drucker wrote, \u201cthe first questions in increasing productivity\u2014and working smarter\u2014have to be, \u2018What is the task?\nPerhaps their biggest lesson is just how hard it is to institute real reform: practicing evidence-based medicine, paying for value as opposed to volume and implementing Lean.\nThe secret: ThedaCare uses Lean, a set of management principles originated by Toyota in the late 1940s to build cars.\nWhy do it all?\u2019\u201dThe real beauty of making these maps is that it puts the patient at the center of everything.\nThedaCare is a community health system with more than 6,000 employees working at five hospitals and 22 clinics across Northeast Wisconsin."}
