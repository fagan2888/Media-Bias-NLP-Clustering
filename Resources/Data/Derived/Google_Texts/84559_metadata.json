But his wildly popular insurgent campaign will have a powerful effect nevertheless \u2014 and not a positive one.\n\nEd Rollins, speaking at the Concordia Summit in New York, said that while he doesn\u2019t think Trump will receive the nomination, his campaign has already caused a major disruption.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone dominate the media like he has,\u201d Rollins said. And what Trump says while he basks in the spotlight is a problem for the Republican Party.\n\nTrump\u2019s many negative comments about minority groups are hurting Republican support among Hispanics. A Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 82 percent of Hispanics view Trump unfavorably, with 68 percent feeling \u201cstrongly so.\u201d Rollins says that\u2019s going to be a problem in the handful of states that will likely decide the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Trump\u2019s Tax Plan would Affect You\n\nMinority votes are more important than ever, especially in swing states like Florida and Colorado. Rollins says that the percentage of minority voters has grown by around 2 to 3 percent in every swing state. Even if Trump isn\u2019t the Republican nominee, it\u2019s unlikely these minority voters will come around and support the party\u2019s eventual choice after feeling the sting of Trump\u2019s sometimes insulting language.\n\nAccording to Rollins, Republicans are going to have to do some serious damage control to rebuild support among Hispanic voters in the wake of Trump\u2019s campaign. In the end, Trump may end up damaging the GOP\u2019s image so badly in swing states that the party has trouble competing, no matter who the nominee may be.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "According to at least one prominent Republican strategist, Donald Trump will not be th", "title": "Why Trump Is So Dangerous for the GOP in 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/02/Why-Trump-So-Dangerous-GOP-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/02/Why-Trump-So-Dangerous-GOP-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "According to at least one prominent Republican strategist, Donald Trump will not be th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4d61\"", "article_summary": "According to at least one prominent Republican strategist, Donald Trump will not be the 2016 GOP candidate.\nIn the end, Trump may end up damaging the GOP\u2019s image so badly in swing states that the party has trouble competing, no matter who the nominee may be.\nRollins says that the percentage of minority voters has grown by around 2 to 3 percent in every swing state.\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Trump\u2019s Tax Plan would Affect YouMinority votes are more important than ever, especially in swing states like Florida and Colorado.\nAnd what Trump says while he basks in the spotlight is a problem for the Republican Party."}
