This person tweeted that he had been on board:

There's a security issue on my flight and they are making us go to a remote area of the airport so they can check all luggage and people. — Paul Francis (@pfranci2) January 17, 2015

We're literally being held in the police building of the Raleigh airport — Paul Francis (@pfranci2) January 17, 2015

Who made the bomb threat on social media about my flight I just took from Atlanta to Raleigh? Totally not cool. http://t.co/0wMpqs9Sc7 — Paul Francis (@pfranci2) January 17, 2015

Not cool at all.
