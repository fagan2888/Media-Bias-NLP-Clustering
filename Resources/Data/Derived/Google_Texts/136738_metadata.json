I mean, you\u2019re going to have a tough time if you have all of these people demanding services at the same time,\u201d said Dr. Steven Lamm of the NYU School of Medicine.\n\nLamm said the Affordable Care Act could mean an explosion of demand for doctors and services, but will the system be able to handle it?\n\n\u201cI think the concern would be that the system will be overwhelmed, that there will be a greater demand that we can meet in a quality fashion and that we will have to delay services for a lot of individuals,\u201d Lamm said.\n\nRight now, there is already a shortage of 20,000 doctors nationwide, and with healthcare expansion, plus increasing population, there will be a need for about 52,000 primary care doctors by 2025.\n\nThis while only 20 percent of new doctors become primary care physicians and the new landscape has older doctors bailing, Brennan reported.\n\n\u201cDoctors are planning to retire. Anybody who is anywhere near retirement age is talking about retirement. \u2026 There\u2019s just too much going on,\u201d said Dr. Sam Unterricht of the New York State Medical Society.\n\nOthers fear that centralizing medical care will squeeze out small independent doctor groups, groups that insurers claim are more expensive, in favor of large centralized care.\n\n\u201cIt will be inferior care. They will end up going to clinics, to situations where they don\u2019t have their own private physician. When they go to hospitals they are not going to know any of doctors who are taking care of them,\u201d cardiologist Dr. David Hess said.\n\nDoctors say one solution could be a quick infusion of residents.\n\n\u201cThey are not training enough residents. The number of medical students has increased a little bit, but the number of residency spots has not. They\u2019ve kept the number of residency spots frozen for, I think, 13 years now,\u201d Unterricht said.\n\nJust by sheer numbers, doctor retirements will increase. Nearly half right now are over the age of 50, and the American Medical Association says nurses will also be in short supply, Brennan reported.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Yorkers are notorious for wanting things immediately, and that includes medical care.
