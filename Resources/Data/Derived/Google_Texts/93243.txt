A federal judge this week upheld the sale of the formerly bankrupt Christ Hospital to CarePoint Health, a Hudson County for-profit company, and dismissed a lawsuit brought by the California competitor who tried to buy the struggling facility in Jersey City first.

Prime Healthcare Services, whose lawsuit against CarePoint was dismissed Tuesday in federal bankruptcy court, “disagrees with the judge’s order and plans to appeal,” Prime’s spokesman Edward Barrera said.

CarePoint owns three Hudson County hospitals: Bayonne Medical Center, Hoboken Medical Center and Christ Hospital. Prime sought to buy Christ Hospital in Jersey City, but withdrew the offer after the bid sparked community and union backlash. Christ Hospital went bankrupt and CarePoint bought it last year for less than Prime had offered to pay.

Prime sued CarePoint, accusing it of being behind the opposition unlawfully interfering with Prime’s “prospective economic gain,” according to court records.

In his order, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Morris Stern wrote that Prime “is and shall be permanently enjoined from seeking any relief including damages ... attributable to purchasing the assets of Christ Hospital.”
