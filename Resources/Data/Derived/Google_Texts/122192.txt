Due to inclement weather, Downtown Boulder Inc. this morning canceled the annual Tulip Fairy and Elf Festival on the Pearl Street Mall. Due to scheduling conflicts on the mall, this year's event will not be rescheduled.

The National Weather Service calls for rain in Boulder all afternon, with a high near 49. More rain is likely Monday, as well, before the run returns Tuesday.
