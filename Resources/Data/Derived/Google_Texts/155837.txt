Special Feature Who's Winning The Money Race? Every day, inewsource is investigating the race to win big money donors.

Little more than a year later, they’re at it again and our media partner inewsource promises you daily updates on the race for cash from big donors.

A new rule says candidates must report within 24 hours contributions of at least $1,000 from any donor.

Use these interactive charts to see who’s writing the checks and where they’re from. Use the database of donor information below to dig deeper. You can click on each column name to sort the data by that column.

We’ll have an even fuller picture of who’s winning the money race on Oct. 10, when candidates and non-candidate committees active in the election must report their total fundraising and expenditures. They’ll have to file additional disclosure reports on Nov. 7 and Nov. 15. The election is on Nov. 19.

Until then, check back here each day to see who’s winning the race for those big money donors.
