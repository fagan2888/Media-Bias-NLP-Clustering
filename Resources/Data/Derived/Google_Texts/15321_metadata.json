In a recent essay, Thomas Edsall writes, \u201cThe Republican appropriation of leftist populist rhetoric (and even policies) poses a significant threat to liberal prospects in 2016.\u201d It may well work, but not because Republicans are in fact reformist, but rather because voters and pundits eschew data and instead focus on rhetoric. When it comes to actual empirical evidence, the answer is indisputable: Democrats preside over far more income growth for the middle class than Republicans.\n\nPrinceton University\u2019s Larry Bartels has two studies on politics and income distribution, and together they encompass almost a century. His finding: under Republicans, the poor and middle class see almost no income growth, while under Democrats, they see dramatic growth (see charts). As he notes elsewhere, even after numerous controls, these partisan differences remain. \u201cEvery Republican president in the past 60 years has presided over increasing income inequality, including Dwight Eisenhower in the midst of the \u2018Great Compression\u2019 of the post-war decades,\u201d Bartels writes. \u201cAnd every Democratic president except one (Jimmy Carter) has presided over decreasing or stable inequality.\u201d\n\nIn another recent study, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson find that on a number of economic indicators, the country fares far better when a Democrat is in office. GDP growth is 1.8 point higher under a Democratic presidency, unemployment is lower, corporate profits are higher, the S&P grows faster and wages grow faster. This difference is not found in other countries, suggesting that the particularly rabid nature of American conservatism may be an important factor. It could also be that the effect is purely luck (although there is evidence to suggest that left-wing governments can facilitate growth). But the fact that the economy grows faster under Democrats is not enough to explain why the middle-class fares better. As the chart below shows, much of the distribution leg-work occurs after taxes and transfers. This isn\u2019t to say Democrats don\u2019t shape the pre-tax distribution (they do), but rather that simple differences in market distributions of income can\u2019t explain the difference.\n\nAs John B. Judis argued \u2014 contrary to his seminal proposition of an \u201cEmerging Democratic Majority\u201d \u2014 the future now belongs to the Republican party. It\u2019s increasingly likely that Democrats will continue to have a slight advantage in the electoral college, but struggle elsewhere, for reasons I\u2019ve previously discussed. So, while Judis\u2019 thesis that middle-class whites are dramatically shifting right is contestable, he raises an important point: Middle-class Americans like services but dislike taxes, and Democrats currently appear to be the party of taxes. And so, the struggle for Democrats is what Suzanne Mettler refers to as the \u201csubmerged state.\u201d That is, the way the government actually benefits the middle class often goes unseen, while taxes, particularly the income tax, are very obvious. Mettler notes that our federal tax code is full of handouts like the Mortgage Interest Deduction, but these tax benefits primarily benefit the affluent and middle class. \u201cOur government is integrally intertwined with everyday life from healthcare to housing, but in forms that often elude our vision,\u201d she argues.\n\nThe implication is that many people who believe themselves independent of government support in fact rely heavily on it. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 10 largest tax breaks cost the government $900 billion in 2013. But the benefits accrue to the wealthy: The top 1 percent gets 17 percent of the benefits and the bottom quintile only 8 percent. As the New York Times reported in 2012,\n\n\u201cThe government safety net was created to keep Americans from abject poverty, but the poorest households no longer receive a majority of government benefits\u2026 The share of benefits flowing to the least affluent households, the bottom fifth, has declined from 54 percent in 1979 to 36 percent in 2007, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis published last years.\u201d\n\nAs Christopher Howard notes in his book, \u201cThe Hidden Welfare State,\u201d \u201cThere is, still, a misconception that U.S. social programs primarily benefit the poor. That is not true for the visible welfare state direct expenditures, and it is an absurd claim to make about the hidden welfare state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Economic data shows that left-leaning parties are better for the middle class\u2014but voters have trouble seeing it", "title": "Dems\u2019 scary electoral future: Why the progressive sales pitch is getting harder", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Economic data shows that left-leaning parties are better for the middle class\u2014but voters have trouble seeing it", "title": "Dems\u2019 scary electoral future: Why the progressive sales pitch is getting harder", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/16/dems_scary_electoral_future_why_the_progressive_sales_pitch_is_getting_harder/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/obama_warren.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Economic data shows that left-leaning parties are better for the middle class\u2014but voters have trouble seeing it", "title": "Dems\u2019 scary electoral future: Why the progressive sales pitch is getting harder", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/obama_warren.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Democratic Party, Economic research, Economics, macroeconomics, safety net", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1cd\"", "article_summary": "His finding: under Republicans, the poor and middle class see almost no income growth, while under Democrats, they see dramatic growth (see charts).\nWhen it comes to actual empirical evidence, the answer is indisputable: Democrats preside over far more income growth for the middle class than Republicans.\nMettler notes that our federal tax code is full of handouts like the Mortgage Interest Deduction, but these tax benefits primarily benefit the affluent and middle class.\nTopics: Democratic Party, Economic research, Economics, macroeconomics, safety net, News, Politics NewsIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Republicans are trying to position themselves as the party of the middle class.\nPrinceton University\u2019s Larry Bartels has two studies on politics and income distribution, and together they encompass almost a century."}
