If there were an Olympic medal in college preparatory testing, Liberty Common High School would take home the gold.

The Fort Collins charter school's juniors broke the state record for highest composite ACT score last year, posting an average score of 28.63 out of a possible 36. The school also broke previous state records in each of the four tested subjects: English, math, reading and science reasoning.

The Vanguard School, a charter high school in Colorado Springs, set the previous average composite score record in 2010 with 27.78, the state department of education confirmed Thursday following the release of ACT and TCAP data from the prior school year.

This is the third year running that Liberty Common posted the highest average composite score among high schools statewide, an achievement that reflects "a solid classical, college-preparatory curriculum," Principal Bob Schaffer said. It's also the third year the school's juniors have taken the test; the high school opened in August 2010.

School leaders said such success is a testament to the educational foundation Liberty's juniors build during their formative years, which includes curricula such as Core Knowledge and Singapore math in grades K-8.

The ACT test, taken by high school juniors, covers four subject areas. Students receive a score out of 36 for each subject; these are averaged to get a composite ACT score.

Centennial, Polaris Expeditionary Learning, Poudre and Ridgeview Classical high schools also experienced gains. Poudre School District as a whole held steady over last year, coming in again with 22.3. That's the highest average tallied by PSD students in the past six years.

Statewide, the average climbed from 20.1 in 2013 to 20.3. Thompson School District saw a dip from 21.1 to 20.6 this year.
