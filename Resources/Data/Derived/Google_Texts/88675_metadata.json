(Photo: Gail Burton / Associated Press )\n\nThe putting stroke is the one skill that can take on a totally different look from one player to the next. That has never been more evident then when watching the putting style of LPGA Tour player Michelle Wie.\n\nTwo years ago I witnessed Wie putting at the Navistar Classic. I was very surprised at how \u201cbent over\u201d she was in her setup. So was every other golf instructor and golf critic in the country! In an interview that week, I heard her say she was the one who decided on that putting style, not David Leadbetter, her teacher of many years.\n\nThis past weekend I watched Wie play the first LPGA major of the season, where she went head to head with Lexi Thompson in the final group. Thompson ended up winning, but I was still impressed that Wie has stuck to her guns and is still putting the way I saw her putt two years ago.\n\nHere are some great things I observe about Wie\u2019s putting stroke that you can possibly use in your own putting game. I am certain that when you use these set-up and stroke keys, you will make more putts as well.\n\n\u2022 Get your eyes over the ball more at setup. You will see that even as much as Wie is bent forward, her eyes are definitely over the ball.\n\n\u2022 Keep your elbows close to the sides of your body (along the ribcage) throughout the stroke.\n\n\u2022 Use your shoulders rather than the hands to make the putting stroke.\n\n\u2022 You absolutely need to get fitted for the proper length and style of putter for your game.\n\nI recommend that you go to your local LPGA or PGA professional and allow them to help you to find the best putting style for you.\n\nNancy Quarcelino is an LPGA Hall of Fame member and Golf Magazine Top 100 Teacher.
