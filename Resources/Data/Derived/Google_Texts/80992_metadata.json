Eva Rinaldi, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nActress Nicole Kidman was blindsided when a paparazzo on a bike ran directly into her as she walked into her New York hotel Thursday. The cyclist, who was identified as photographer Carl Wu, apologized profusely after the incident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Wu screamed.\n\nKidman had just left the Calvin Klein fashion show where she was seated in the front row, just a few feet away from Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Wu was apparently trying to snap photos of Kidman as she exited her car and entered her hotel when he lost control of his bicycle and rode directly into the actress. Kidman let out a scream, fell to the ground, and lost one of her shoes in the incident. Forty-six-year-old Kidman was noticeably shaken and gripping her ankle as she got up. An ambulance did come to the hotel to check on her.\n\n\"She looked hurt, but there wasn't any blood,\" a witness said. \"She put her shoes back on and ran into the [hotel].\"\n\nAccording to TMZ, Kidman is pressing charges against Wu for crashing into her. He received a ticket for illegally riding his bike on the sidewalk, but there\u2019s no word on anything else yet.\n\n\"It was awful, but I got back up,\" Kidman told E! News. \u201cI was shaken up and I\u2019ll deal with it later\u2026 Luckily, I got up. But there will be a time when someone does not. \u201c", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nicole kidman, knocked down, carl wu", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Actress Nicole Kidman was knocked to the ground when paparazzo Carl Wu lost control of his bicycle while trying to snap a photo.", "title": "Nicole Kidman Hit, Knocked Down By Bike-Riding Paparazzo [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nicole-kidman-hit-knocked-down-paparazzo-carl-wu-actress-looked-hurt-there-was-no-blood-video-256731", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/nicolekidman2012cropped.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Actress Nicole Kidman was knocked to the ground when paparazzo Carl Wu lost control of his bicycle while trying to snap a photo.", "title": "Nicole Kidman Hit, Knocked Down By Bike-Riding Paparazzo [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nicole-kidman-hit-knocked-down-paparazzo-carl-wu-actress-looked-hurt-there-was-no-blood-video-256731", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/nicolekidman2012cropped.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/nicolekidman2012cropped.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-13T16:06:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:41:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Actress Nicole Kidman was knocked to the ground when paparazzo Carl Wu lost control of his bicycle while trying to snap a photo."}, "article_summary": "Actress Nicole Kidman was knocked to the ground when paparazzo Carl Wu lost control of his bicycle while trying to snap a photo.\n\"She looked hurt, but there wasn't any blood,\" a witness said.\nEva Rinaldi, CC BY-SA 2.0Actress Nicole Kidman was blindsided when a paparazzo on a bike ran directly into her as she walked into her New York hotel Thursday.\nWu was apparently trying to snap photos of Kidman as she exited her car and entered her hotel when he lost control of his bicycle and rode directly into the actress.\nKidman let out a scream, fell to the ground, and lost one of her shoes in the incident."}
