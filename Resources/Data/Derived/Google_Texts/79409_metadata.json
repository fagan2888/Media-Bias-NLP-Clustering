Yet many people still don\u2019t take advantage. A recent survey by online broker eHealth found that 53% of insured respondents didn\u2019t use their coverage at all, even for free preventive services.\n\nThat could be a health risk, but it\u2019s definitely a financial fail: You\u2019re giving up a service that you\u2019ve already paid for. Here\u2019s how to make sure you\u2019re getting full value.\n\nKnow what\u2019s eligible\n\nCoverage rules are governed by recommendations from medical and scientific authorities. The free-stuff list includes 18 services for adults, plus 26 just for women and another 27 for kids. Contraception is covered; so are tests for blood pressure, obesity, and, depending on risk factors, cholesterol, diabetes, and some cancers. Vaccines vary by age but include diphtheria, tetanus, HPV, measles, and mumps, plus a flu shot. (Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Preventive Services Tracker has a full list.)\n\nYet insurers do have some leeway. \u201cPlans are allowed to use reasonable medical management\u201d to determine coverage, says Alina Salganicoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation. When guidelines don\u2019t say how frequently a test should be given, your insurer can set its own rules. So while colonoscopy coverage is required for people age 50 and older, your plan may pay up only once a decade unless your doctor cites a medical reason for more frequent screenings. \u201cDiscuss it with your insurer\u201d before your appointment, Salganicoff says.\n\nWatch for loopholes\n\nNaturally, there are a few key exceptions to watch for.\n\nFirst off: Free services aren\u2019t free when you go outside your plan\u2019s network, so make sure everyone involved in a screening\u2014from the radiologist to the lab\u2014is in your network.\n\nGrandfathered health plans\u2014those in place when the law took effect on March 23, 2010\u2014are exempt from having to cover preventive care in full. If you have one of those policies, you may have to pay. (Unsure if your plan is grandfathered? Ask the benefits staff at work or call your plan.)\n\nAnother wrinkle: If you use a checkup to discuss other health issues, the conversation could trigger a separate bill. \u201cWhere folks get tripped up is when they go for a screening and also tell the doctor, \u201cI have this back pain,\u201d \u201d says Nate Purpura, a spokesman for eHealth. \u201cThe minute you deviate from preventive care, you\u2019ve entered a different type of medical visit.\u201d\n\nChallenge surprise bills\n\nBilling mistakes are common, so be sure to question any charge for care you thought was preventive.\n\nSometimes your doctor\u2019s staff may have used an incorrect code or failed to cite a medical justification, Purpura says. Call the office to see if the bill can be resubmitted to fix the problem. And remember that you have the right to file an appeal with your health plan if they don\u2019t pay up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to Obamacare, most insurers must now cover the full cost of preventive care\u2014checkups, vaccinations, screenings, and the like.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Get the freebies you're entitled to", "title": "How to Get the Most From Your Health Plan", "url": "http://time.com/money/4161032/health-care-free-checkups/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/160125_ff_healthfreebies.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/160125_ff_healthfreebies.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Get the freebies you're entitled to", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How to Get the Most From Your Health Plan"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", health care, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health insurance, health care, Obamacare, preventive care, checkups, screenings,"}, "article_summary": "A recent survey by online broker eHealth found that 53% of insured respondents didn\u2019t use their coverage at all, even for free preventive services.\nAnd remember that you have the right to file an appeal with your health plan if they don\u2019t pay up.\nFirst off: Free services aren\u2019t free when you go outside your plan\u2019s network, so make sure everyone involved in a screening\u2014from the radiologist to the lab\u2014is in your network.\n(Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Preventive Services Tracker has a full list.)\nGrandfathered health plans\u2014those in place when the law took effect on March 23, 2010\u2014are exempt from having to cover preventive care in full."}
