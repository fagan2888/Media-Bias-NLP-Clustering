She and her family managed to escape to the United States.\n\nJustin will speak about her experiences at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Rialto Theater Center at a commemoration event of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust.\n\nJustin was born to a Jewish family in Germany.\n\n\"Before Hitler, we were just part of the community,\" she said. \"We lived in a small village and we were the only Jewish children in that village. Then, when Hitler came, we were not allowed to go to school anymore.\"\n\nJustin was 12 years old in 1936 when she was sent to school in Holland to escape the Nazi regime. Her sister was sent to Italy.\n\nShe said as a little girl she had a very supportive family, which helped as things in Germany escalated. Jews had already been denied the right to go to school. Many people were being sent to concentration camps.\n\nThe boarding school was run by the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker non-governmental organizational that still performs service worldwide.\n\n\"The school was for political and religious refugees. (Students) came from all over Europe,\" Justin said.\n\nShe said that at the time, Jewish parents were allowed to send their children away but were not allowed to leave themselves.\n\nHer father was also sent to a concentration camp but was released later. She isn't sure why, but a few Jews were released from the camp and her father got out of Germany with the help of an underground Dutch network. Her mother also escaped the country in \"a complicated way,\" she said. Her family congregated in Holland and escaped on the last boat that was allowed to leave for the United States.\n\n\"It was a boat that was supposed to be just for cargo but because they could make a lot of money with refugees, it was stuffed full of people,\" Justin said. \"It was really scary crossing because of all the mines in the English channel.\"\n\nShe remembers that just before they left, another boat exploded, which killed many of her classmates.\n\nShe speaks at schools and other organizations about her experience, and said she hopes people learn from what she went through, even just by thinking about that history.\n\nSometimes children from classes write her to thank her for speaking to them. She said she received one letter from a child who said her speech made him think about the issue of bullying, and that he might be doing that himself without thinking about it.\n\n\"That was very satisfying (to have that impact),\" she said. \"I think it is easy for us to fall into traps of prejudice and act on it.\"\n\nShe has lived in Fort Collins now for 26 years and has spoken at Colorado State University about the Holocaust before.\n\nJessica Benes: 970-669-5050 ext. 530, jbenes@reporter-herald.com, Twitter.com/jessicabenes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_27892772/fort-collins-woman-shares-holocaust-experience-at-loveland", "modificationDate": "2015-04-12T18:32:19-0600", "sailthru.section": "Loveland News", "sailthru.author": "By Jessica Benes \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Dr. Renate Justin of Fort Collins and her family were some of the lucky ones.
