Obamacare. Whether they were for it or against it, they were all confused by it. But three weeks after that trip, the conversation I had with David Jackson at the Belmont General Store still rings in my ears.\n\nBen Carson\u2019s succinct remarks about Obamacare at the Values Voters summit last week were slightly more incendiary than anything Jackson said. \u201cYou know, Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d Carson said Friday. \u201cAnd it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.\u201d The man who felt comfortable unfurling the Confederate flag in front of the White House on Sunday took more action to protest President Obama than Jackson probably ever will.\n\nBut Jackson\u2019s forceful denunciation of Obamacare and the fact-challenged conspiracy theories he harbors show that he shares with the Confederate flag waver and Carson a troubling view of President Obama that goes far beyond quarrels over the health care law. They don\u2019t like him. They don\u2019t trust him. And they think he\u2019s destroying America.\n\nBelow are portions of the transcript of my conversation with Jackson at the Belmont General Store. From illegal immigrants taking advantage of Obamacare (which they can\u2019t) to the Muslim Brotherhood having prayer services \u201con the East Lawn of the White House\u201d (which never happened), Jackson believes the president doesn\u2019t love this country, \u201cnot one bit, not one breath that comes out of his body.\u201d As a result, Jackson fears Obama as \u201cthe most dangerous person that\u2019s ever walked in these United States.\u201d\n\nOn Obamacare\n\nCapehart: What do you think about Obamacare? Jackson: I think it is the biggest travesty in American history. It is forcing people to pay for other people\u2019s health care, because they\u2019re either too lazy or they know they can get the money from someone other than themselves\u2026. It should be thrown in the trash and be taken off the books as a giant mistake. And if they want to help poor people in this country, that\u2019s what they should do.\n\nOn parents being able to keep their children on their health insurance policies until they are 26 years old\n\nJackson: Twenty-six years old, you should be out on your own supporting yourself. Capehart: Well, it\u2019s up until you\u2019re 26, then after 26 \u2014 they\u2019re no longer on their parent\u2019s insurance. Jackson: When I was 18, my father showed me the door \u2013 good luck. Have a good life. It wasn\u2019t all this, keep you on your parents insurance until you\u2019re 26. Most people are out of college with either a bachelor\u2019s or a master\u2019s or working on a master\u2019s that really want to move forward. Twenty-six years old and still living off your parents? That\u2019s lazy. Capehart: Given the way the economy has been since the implosion of 2008, we know that lots of young people have graduated from college. They\u2019re mired in student debt. They can\u2019t find work. And the notion that they can stay on their parent\u2019s health care coverage until they\u2019re 26 has been the one bright spot in, you know, dark economic clouds that they face. You know \u2014 too bad for them? Jackson: Yeah. Suck it up. That\u2019s the way I look at it. Why should your parents have to pay your way? You\u2019re an adult. Be responsible for yourself.\n\nOn Obamacare and illegal immigration\n\nCapehart: The president and the Obama administration say the whole reason he did this is to get the 50 million Americans without health insurance to have health insurance. Jackson: They figured out a way to get money out of the American people\u2019s pockets. It won\u2019t benefit \u2014 it\u2019ll benefit a very small amount of people, and it\u2019ll be the ones that are too lazy or unwilling to work, along with the millions and millions of illegal aliens in this country. Capehart: You do know that the Affordable Care Act is not \u2026 undocumented workers are not eligible for Obamacare. That\u2019s specific in the law. Jackson: They can go into any Social security agency, welfare office, social services and they\u2019re giving them stuff. They are handing it out to them left and right. Capehart: What exactly are they handing out? Jackson: Benefits! Look at them. They get food stamps. They get welfare, dependent children\u2026. They help them with their housing, and they\u2019re not even supposed to be in our country. They are here illegally, but, yet, they know how to work our system to get what they want. They want our health care. They want our food. They want our money, yet they don\u2019t pay taxes. And they\u2019ll look right at you and they\u2019ll tell you, \u201cNo habla the English,\u201d and laugh. But you understand what they\u2019re saying. That really makes me angry.\n\nOn Obama\n\nCargill: Who do you blame for the problems with Obamacare? Jackson: Him! This was his creation. He wanted to change our country, and he has succeeded at it. Not making it change for the better, but he has destroyed the American way of life. He has made it a point \u2014 you don\u2019t have to work, we\u2019ll take care of it. People hear \u201cfree\u201d and they think it\u2019s free. Someone behind them has paid for that with sweat and hard work\u2026. Capehart: You mentioned earlier that the president has, I think you said, come in to change America and not in a good sense. Jackson: Correct. Capehart: Other than the Affordable Care Act, what other ways has he\u2026. Jackson: We went from a triple A+ economic rating in the world to a \u2013A for trade and for borrowing. The prices, just for example food prices have gone up at least 120 percent and it\u2019s because of imposed taxes that he\u2019s created and come up with. And Congress and Senate have been forced to go along with it because there\u2019s something in the barrel that they wanted. He has forced the United States to make choices that they should never have had to make. \u201cDo I pay the electric bill or do I go ahead and pay for Obamacare for somebody else to go to the doctor?\u201d I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\n\nJackson then went on to lambaste the Democrats for resisting Republican attempts to defund or delay Obamacare. \u201c[Republicans] are fighting for the American people as a whole: Democrat, liberal, Republican \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to preserve our Constitution.\u201d When I asked Jackson if he believed President Obama couldn\u2019t care less about the Constitution, he said, \u201cYes, sir, I totally do.\u201d And then we fell through the black hole of conspiracy. When I asked Jackson for an example of violations of the Constitution, he had a quick reply: \u201cBenghazi.\u201d\n\nRespect for the Constitution\n\nCapehart: What specifically about Benghazi [Libya] that\u2019s outside the realm of the Constitution? Jackson: We are sworn to uphold, defend and protect the Constitution of the United States and parts thereof. Part of that is to protect its citizens. Those people in Benghazi screamed for help for 16 hours and they were told, \u201cNo.\u201d They were \u2014 they were put out there. The list goes on and one and on. It\u2019s one thing after another. The one quote that he made was, \u201cWell if I didn\u2019t have to deal with Congress, I could get things changed around here.\u201d That\u2019s not an American president. They\u2019re supposed to work together for the common goal to make life better for the people of the United States of America\u2026. Capehart: If you were president of the United States and you had the same kind opposition that he\u2019s facing from the other party, wouldn\u2019t you daydream about being able to do what you believe is the right thing to do for the American people without the obstruction that you\u2019re facing? Jackson: No. We have a Constitution that we\u2019re supposed to abide by, and he violates \u2026 whenever he wants. You guys know this stuff. He makes it a point, \u201cWell, if I didn\u2019t have to deal with Congress, I\u2019d do this. I\u2019ll write an executive order.\u201d That\u2019s not the way our country works. That\u2019s not the way our country was founded. Mutual respect among ALL of its people. He doesn\u2019t respect us. Cargill: Why do you say he\u2019s flouting the Constitution? Jackson: \u2019Cause he doesn\u2019t respect it. He said he was going to change America when he went into office. And he has. He has no respect for our Constitution, the bylaws. He wants to do what he wants and if he doesn\u2019t he throws a tantrum and he writes an executive order\u2026. I can\u2019t tell you the things that bother me about what he does.\n\nOsama bin Laden\n\nCapehart: What about the capture and killing of Osama bin Laden? Jackson: I don\u2019t think that ever happened. No one would ever give up a SEAL team\u2019s names or what SEAL team went in there. I think that was a great mystery that they created. I do not believe they killed him, I will never believe it. Especially dropping him off at sea. No. Capehart: So, the rationale that they dropped Osama bin Laden\u2019s body at sea was to ensure that his burial place wouldn\u2019t become a shrine to a martyr\u2026. Jackson: No \u2026 nobody could prove whether it was him or not. I truly believe that.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and fear of Obama\n\nCapehart: One more question. You mentioned that your father, I think you said he fought in World War II. You said that the president doesn\u2019t respect, honor the Constitution. But the president\u2019s grandfather who helped raise him fought in World War II. The president is a constitutional law professor \u2014 was a constitutional law professor\u2026 Jackson: He lost his law license, too\u2026. [Not true] Capehart: Was a constitutional law professor. So, despite all that, you \u2014 and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ve been listening to you these last few minutes \u2014 you don\u2019t think President Obama loves this country? Jackson: Not at all. Not one bit, not one breath that comes out of his body. Capehart: So why would he run for president of a country that he doesn\u2019t love? Jackson: Because he wanted to change it. Capehart: And change into what? Jackson: Look at what our country has become. You can\u2019t go to church without somebody persecuting you. You can\u2019t say anything about the Muslim religion without somebody persecuting you for it. He makes it very well known what his intentions are and how he wants to change the country. And it goes completely against everything this country was founded on. He\u2019s a smart guy, he\u2019s brilliant. But I think he\u2019s the most dangerous person that\u2019s ever walked in these United States. I fear from him, and I\u2019m not afraid of anyone. I\u2019m afraid of him. Jonathan: Talk more about that. Why are you afraid of him? He\u2019s taller than I am, but he\u2019s barely bigger than I am. Jackson: Size doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s what\u2019s in his heart. He does not have the American people\u2019s best interests at heart. He doesn\u2019t respect the American people as a whole. There have been many veterans groups that asked to have meetings with him or come to the White House and have a picnic on the East Lawn and he said no. And at the same time, this was about two years ago, the Muslim Brotherhood had 1,000 of their people come to the East Lawn for a prayer session. Capehart: The Muslim brotherhood had\u2026.? Jackson: They had a huge gathering. They had prayer on the East Lawn of the White House. It was in the news. Capehart: Where did you hear this? Because if the Muslim Brotherhood were at the White House, that\u2019d be a huge story. Jackson: There are so many people within his administration that are part of it. They\u2019re admitted members of the Muslim brotherhood. Capehart: Who? Who exactly? Jackson: I don\u2019t know their names. They\u2019re not English. I don\u2019t know their names, but they\u2019re proud of the fact that, you know, \u201cwe work for the president.\u201d They know what they\u2019re doing to our country, and that hurts me. Capehart: Alright, Mr. Jackson.
