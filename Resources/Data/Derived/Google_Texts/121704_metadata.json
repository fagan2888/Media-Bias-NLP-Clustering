They are called \u201ccoddled,\u201d \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d \u201cspoiled,\u201d and at the same time \u201cterrifying\u201d to \u201ceven\u201d liberal professors. Students are collectively stigmatized with these labels and also considered whiney narcissists.\n\nNow a new study by FiveThirtyEightPolitics, \u201cHere Are the Demands From Students Protesting Racism at 51 Colleges,\u201d has sorted through the list of issues collected on the website \u201cThe Demands.\u201d It found that at the top of the list of the 13 most common demands were:\n\nIncrease diversity of professors (38)\n\nRequire diversity training (35)\n\nAt the bottom:\n\nRevise speech code (7)\n\nRemove officials (6)\n\nThus, instead of students censoring, chastising, silencing those whose pronouncements they find \u201cthreatening their safety,\u201d we find a set of proposals to bring the university more into line with an increasingly diverse demographic. It\u2019s worth noting as well that many faculty and some administrators are in favor of these top two demands, and in fact what students are asking for in many cases are simply enhancements to already existing programs. And contrary to the now common depiction of students as driven solely by passion and emotion, another major request was for better data collection. So where is the problem? Why are these demands unreasonable? If the issue of censorship has been grossly inflated, what is so troubling about the real core of the demands?\n\nOne of the most laudable functions of higher education is to facilitate upward mobility and increase inclusion of underrepresented minority populations \u2014 to, indeed, democratize society. Lamentably, this function has been mostly ignored, downplayed or deferred when it comes to race.\n\nIn his book \u201cCreating a Class: College Admissions and the Education of Elites,\u201d professor of education and sociology Mitchell Stevens explains how colleges and universities have been sites of what he calls \u201csocial reproduction,\u201d that is, the perpetuation of privilege. To understand this phenomenon he studied college admissions. What he discovered was a place of \u201cprivileged families and the impressive organizational machinery they have developed to pass their comfortable social positions on to their children.\u201d Consider that in the case before the Supreme Court, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, one of Fisher\u2019s key complaints is not that she was not admitted to the University of Texas, but that she was not admitted to its most prestigious campus, where she would be part of a much more useful and powerful social network. The issue, then, is access not just to education, but also, and maybe more importantly, to power. What students are demanding now is an education that will be both more aligned with our contemporary, increasingly diverse world, and an education that will distribute more evenly the power education allots. To some this is discomfiting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With an increasingly diverse demographic, demanding a more diverse faculty is reasonable", "title": "Quit assuming students protesting racism on campus are spoiled whiners!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With an increasingly diverse demographic, demanding a more diverse faculty is reasonable", "title": "Quit assuming students protesting racism on campus are spoiled whiners!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/13/quit_assuming_students_protesting_racism_on_campus_are_spoiled_whiners/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/missouri_protests.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With an increasingly diverse demographic, demanding a more diverse faculty is reasonable", "title": "Quit assuming students protesting racism on campus are spoiled whiners!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/missouri_protests.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Palumbo-Liu", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, campus racism, Education, Racism, student protests", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: campus racism, Education, Racism, student protests, Life News, NewsToday students who dare to voice complaints about racism on campus are more often than not slapped with a number of easy-to-use, prefabricated labels that take the place of actually seriously addressing the issues being raised.\nWhat students are demanding now is an education that will be both more aligned with our contemporary, increasingly diverse world, and an education that will distribute more evenly the power education allots.\nThey are called \u201ccoddled,\u201d \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d \u201cspoiled,\u201d and at the same time \u201cterrifying\u201d to \u201ceven\u201d liberal professors.\nAnd contrary to the now common depiction of students as driven solely by passion and emotion, another major request was for better data collection.\nStudents are collectively stigmatized with these labels and also considered whiney narcissists."}
