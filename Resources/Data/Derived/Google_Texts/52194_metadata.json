I\u2019m a Republican who wants clean air, clean water, and the life-extending miracle of electricity. I compost.\u201d\n\nOn Wall Street: \u201cOnly in a world of crony capitalism would bankers whose faulty decisions caused bankruptcy be allowed to cash out as the middle class absorbs the losses.\u201d\n\nOn his party: \u201cRight now, the Republican brand sucks. I promised Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, that I would stop saying the GOP sucks, and I will (except for this last time).\u201d\n\nOn racial minorities: \u201cI want a New GOP that resonates with America, that looks like America \u2014 white and black. . . . The face of the Republican Party should not be about suppressing the vote but about enhancing the vote.\u201d\n\nOn Ferguson, Mo.: \u201c[T]housands of peaceful protesters were met with rubber bullets, tear gas, and a police department that showed up at the protest in gear more fitting for Fallujah or Kandahar.\u201d\n\nOn drug sentencing: \u201cWe should free those who are in jail under the old guidelines. Our prisons are bursting with young men \u2014 and women \u2014 who are poor or of color.\u201d\n\nBut Paul has a problem: He isn\u2019t running for the Democratic nomination. And though Paul may think his Republican Party\u2019s brand sucks, the primary voters don\u2019t necessarily share his view that the party is too old and too white. His candidacy has so far failed to ignite \u2014 and, indeed, he seems to be fading as a force within the party.\n\nThe most recent national poll, by Fox News, has Paul in sixth place, with 7 percent, trailing Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee and Marco Rubio. Paul averages only about half the support he had late in 2013. Paul doesn\u2019t appear to be winning over young voters \u2014 perhaps the most important justification for his candidacy \u2014 and does not do better than other Republicans, according to a survey released last month by Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics. Even in his home state, a media consortium poll this month found that Paul had lost his lead in a theoretical matchup with Clinton.\n\nPaul\u2019s declining standing can be felt in Washington. Last week, he attempted to reprise his wildly successful 2013 filibuster, which caught fire on social media and forced party leaders to take notice. But this time Paul found indifference as he fought to limit government surveillance. As The Post\u2019s Philip Bump reported, it got only about one-tenth of the Twitter attention that his first effort did. Television footage from the chamber caught Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) rolling his eyes as Paul spoke last week, and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), who joined Paul\u2019s previous filibuster, openly opposed him this time.\n\nOn CBS\u2019s morning show Tuesday, Paul was asked to answer his Republican colleagues\u2019 complaint that his 11-hour speech was really a performance aimed at selling his new book; \u201cFox & Friends\u201d minutes later asked him to respond to the charge that he is a \u201cmisguided ideologue.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) took to the floor Wednesday afternoon to \"filibuster\" the renewal of the Patriot Act. Paul claims it gives government too much access to citizens\u2019 private cell phone records. (C-SPAN)\n\n\u201cRand Paul has now decided he wants to be a liberal Democrat,\u201d conservative commentator William Kristol said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nPaul is no liberal; his new book repeats all his conservative ideas about ending Obamacare, slashing government spending, auditing the Fed and privatizing Medicare, and he has the requisite references to free-market economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek.\n\nBut Paul is clearly separating himself from the rest of the GOP, both in his new book (in which he cites Pink Floyd, mentions that he met his wife over a beer keg and quotes Martin Luther King Jr. liberally) and in recent remarks. (He told an audience last week that he \u201cdidn\u2019t run for office\u201d because of the abortion issue.)\n\nAt least rhetorically, he is trying to get \u201crid of the old crust in the Republican Party,\u201d by declaring that the Bill of Rights protections are \u201cespecially for minorities,\u201d that Democrats are not \u201cthe only ones allowed to like the environment\u201d and that gerrymandered districts must be undone.\n\nPaul is outraged that \u201cthe connected rich didn\u2019t get a scratch\u201d when Wall Street collapsed. \u201cThey convinced Congress to have the middle-class taxpayer bail them out and went on as if nothing had happened. It\u2019s infuriating.\u201d\n\nIt is infuriating. What\u2019s probably more infuriating to Paul is so few in his party share his indignation.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His hopes for the Republican nomination now seem to be headed south.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "His hopes for the Republican nomination now seem to be headed south.", "title": "The decline of Rand Paul", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-decline-of-rand-paul/2015/05/26/10a7b932-03e5-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/05/26/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Paul-0dbdc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Milbank"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-decline-of-rand-paul/2015/05/26/10a7b932-03e5-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dana Milbank, Dana Milbank column, Dana Milbank washington post, rand paul, rand paul book, stand with rand, taking a stand, rand paul taking a stand,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank"}, "eomportal-uuid": "10a7b932-03e5-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Dana Milbank, Dana Milbank column, Dana Milbank washington post, rand paul, rand paul book, stand with rand, taking a stand, rand paul taking a stand,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cad\"", "article_summary": "Rand Paul took a left turn on his journey to the Republican nomination, and now his hopes seem to be headed south.\nThe face of the Republican Party should not be about suppressing the vote but about enhancing the vote.\u201dOn Ferguson, Mo.\nWhat\u2019s probably more infuriating to Paul is so few in his party share his indignation.\nAnd though Paul may think his Republican Party\u2019s brand sucks, the primary voters don\u2019t necessarily share his view that the party is too old and too white.\nOur prisons are bursting with young men \u2014 and women \u2014 who are poor or of color.\u201dBut Paul has a problem: He isn\u2019t running for the Democratic nomination."}
