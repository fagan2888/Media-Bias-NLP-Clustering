Former KSU basketball player Luis Colon and his fiancee were tied up and beaten during a robbery of their Ft. Lauderdale, FL home.

WPLG-TV in Miami said the robbery happened early Monday morning.

WPLG spoke with Colon's landlord Charles Walton. "I guess they went upstairs with guns and held them captive and tied them up on the bed," said Walton. "They lost their computers and their cell phones and wallets and purses."

Colon and his fiancee Elyse Ehlers were taken to Broward Health Medical Center with minor injuries.

Police say the robbers stole Ehlers's white IS250 Lexus with a Florida tag BLMV77. It also had a Kansas State alumni metal frame around the tag.

Colon played for KSU from 2006 to 2010, starting in 76 games during his career.

Colon's co-workers said he had no renters insurance. They've set up a fund to help the couple. To learn more
