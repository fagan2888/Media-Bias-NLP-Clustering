In the most recent republican debate it was the last topic discussed.\n\nWhen health care does come up, candidates hone in on voter\u2019s wallets by talking about the rising costs of prescriptions drugs, the growing cost of cancer treatment, universal health care access and reforming Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nHowever, none of them talked about the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance process that allowed medical devices like power morcellators, transvaginal mesh and retrievable intra vena cava (IVC) filters to harm the public. The devices caused the spread of uterine cancer, organ and vein perforation, and other painful complications.\n\nThe clearance process is under investigation by the Government Accountability Office and a congressman recently proposed a bill to remove a controversial birth control device cleared by the FDA. Meanwhile, the agency continues to approve drugs that its own reviewers warned against like Xarelto and Eliquis.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the candidates to talk about the drugs and devices that harm hundreds of thousands of Americans every year in the upcoming debates though. They may want everyone to have health care access, but they haven\u2019t talked about how safe the health care is when patients get it.\n\nPresidential Candidates on Health Care\n\nCandidates differ on the problems with the health care system and the ways to fix it. They all agree things could be better, and they\u2019re all confident their plan is the best way to fix things.\n\nTrump: \u2018Obamacare\u2019s a disaster\u2019\n\nDonald Trump uses his favorite keywords when talking about health care.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u2019s going to be repealed and replaced,\u201d Trump said during an interview on 60 Minutes in September. \u201cObamacare\u2019s a disaster.\u201d\n\nHis plan to fix it? \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of everybody,\u201d he said during the interview. He said he\u2019d do so by making the government pay for health care, and it\u2019d be cheaper because he\u2019d negotiate great plans and increase competition among insurance providers.\n\nTrump also made a push for improving health care for veterans. According to his campaign website, he\u2019d ensure veterans get the health care they need, both physical and mental. He\u2019d transform the Department of Veterans Affairs, end waste and provide better support for female veterans. Like many great Trump goals, he hasn\u2019t outlined specific ways for achieving them.\n\nClinton: \u2018I want to strengthen the Affordable Care Act\u2019\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wants to make the system she helped develop better.\n\n\u201cI want to strengthen the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Hillary Clinton said in an Iowa forum in October. That strengthening focuses on capping prescription drug expenses, ensuring affordable doctor visits and reclassifying emergency visits.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign website lists numerous ways to decrease copays, deductibles and prescription drug costs. Buried in it all is one positive for drug safety. In order to reduce drug costs, she wants to stop direct-to-consumer advertising subsidies for Big Pharma.\n\nClinton would eliminate corporate write-offs for DTC ads and establish procedures in which the FDA must clear ads for clarity and understandability before they reach consumers. The plan doesn\u2019t make drugs and devices safer, but it might make consumers more informed.\n\nCarson: \u2018More freedom and less government\u2019\n\nDr. Ben Carson has been talking about health savings accounts (HSAs) since the 90s. He wants to simplify health care by replacing Obamacare, Medicare and Medicaid and putting money into HSAs for every American every year.\n\n\u201cHealth savings accounts empower families to make their own decisions about their medical treatment,\u201d Carson says on his campaign website. \u201cHSAs will also drive down health care costs while protecting patient choice and freedom. More freedom and less government in our health care system will mean lower costs, more access, and continued innovation.\u201d\n\nBut according to The New York Times, Carson has changed plans for implementing HSAs so much that it\u2019s become confusing. In an October interview on Fox News, Carson couldn\u2019t get anchor Chris Wallace to understand the plan, and Wallace and the American public remained confused as to what exactly Carson was proposing.\n\nRegardless of how he\u2019s going to try to save money on health care, he\u2019s been quiet about patient safety.\n\nSanders: \u2018We need a new leader at the FDA\u2019\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t like how cozy the FDA is with pharmaceutical companies. That\u2019s why he opposed Obama\u2019s nomination of Dr. Robert Califf, a renowned health care expert with ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\u201cAt a time when millions of Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs they need, we need a new leader at the FDA who is prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies and work to substantially lower drug prices,\u201d Sanders said in a press release. \u201cUnfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that Dr. Califf is not that person.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the FDA doesn\u2019t have any authority to control drug prices. It would have been more comforting if he demanded a commissioner that would stand up to pharmaceutical companies seeking approval or clearance for dangerous drugs and devices.\n\nSanders is an advocate for women\u2019s rights, improving the VA, universal access to health care and lowering prescription drug prices.\n\nBush: \u2018We won\u2019t force people to buy coverage\u2019\n\nOf the top Republican candidates, former Florida governor Jeb Bush is one of the few who has offered a detailed plan to go along with his ambitious goals. His main argument for health care access is to not force it on people who don\u2019t want it.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t force people to buy coverage they don\u2019t want either because they don\u2019t need it or it violates their conscious,\u201d Bush told CNN.\n\nAccording to Bush\u2019s campaign website, he also wants to modernize the FDA. But modernization doesn\u2019t mean improved safety. He wants to accelerate clinical trials and allow manufacturers to share \u201ctruthful, non-misleading scientific information\u201d to help spur innovation. But Big Pharma has a history of corrupting clinical trial data and accelerated approval processes can lead to dangerous drug approvals.\n\nCruz: \u2018I\u2019ve been proud to lead the fight to stop Obamacare\u2019\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz would repeal the Affordable Care Act and propose \u201ccommonsense\u201d reform measures if elected president, according to an August interview on C-SPAN.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been proud to lead the fight to stop Obamacare in the U.S. Senate, and against the Washington cartel,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThere are a lot of politicians in Washington that have largely given up. They don\u2019t believe Obamacare can ever be repealed, including, sadly, a fair number of Republicans.\u201d\n\nHe wants to expand competition, empower patients, and take power away from bureaucrats. His plan for doing so includes allowing health insurance to be purchased across state borders, expanding HSAs and removing health insurance from employment.\n\nRubio: \u2018ObamaCare is fatally flawed\u2019\n\nU.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Cruz issued a joint statement alongside U.S. Sen. Mike Lee stating they refused to support any measure that did not fully repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cObamaCare is fatally flawed not just because it is poorly constructed, but because it relies on the outdated philosophy that the federal government can solve our problems through more spending, more taxes, more regulations, and more bureaucrats,\u201d Rubio wrote in Politico in August.\n\nRubio\u2019s plan to reform health care includes offering tax credits for those who purchase health insurance, reforming insurance regulations and reforming Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nO\u2019Malley: \u2018We have to eliminate the profit motive\u2019\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley thinks the U.S. could save money on health care costs by preventing avoidable hospital readmissions.\n\n\u201cHospital CEOs keep their hospitals solvent by keeping the beds filled\u201d O\u2019Malley said in August. \u201cWe have to eliminate the profit motive.\u201d\n\nAccording to his website, O\u2019Malley has 15 goals to improve America. Two of them involve health care, but unlike other candidates he doesn\u2019t have a goal of reducing costs or expanding coverage.\n\nInstead, O\u2019Malley wants to reduce deaths from drug overdoses by 25 percent by 2020, and reduce infant mortality by 10 percent by 2020. He has a plan for reducing the over-prescription of pain medications, expanding access to treatment for addictions and investing in community resources.\n\nCandidates Quiet on Dangerous Drugs and Devices\n\nMake no mistake, access to health care is important. Affordable health care is important. The VA let down veterans for too long, and the FDA let women down for too long. These are all important issues.\n\nBut drug and device safety is important too.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t know what power morcellators are or what transvaginal mesh is. The devices cleared through a flawed FDA process caused tens of thousands of women permanent damage and in some cases death.\n\nMost people think testosterone is safe because the hormone is produced naturally in the body. Millions of Americans don\u2019t know drug companies invented terms like \u201cLow T\u201d and marketed drugs like AndroGel to men to treat natural symptoms of aging. The drugs face thousands of lawsuits from men claiming they caused heart attacks or strokes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no education. There\u2019s nothing being said on TV,\u201d Estelle Tasz, a woman who underwent more than 12 surgeries from transvaginal mesh complications, told Drugwatch\u2019s Michelle Llamas.\n\nPeople harmed by the drugs and devices fight for compensation in court rooms. They protest outside the FDA building. They want to prevent others from experiencing what they went through.\n\nThe FDA has a problem with allowing dangerous drugs and devices to reach consumers. Big Pharma has a problem with marketing dangerous drugs and devices to the public.\n\nIt\u2019s time the people who want to lead our country talk about fixing those problems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care stances from Democratic and Republican presidential candidates focus on lowering drug costs, but candidates from both parties remain quiet on drug safety.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "DrugWatch", "description": "Health care stances from Democratic and Republican presidential candidates focus on lowering drug costs, but candidates from both parties remain quiet on drug safety.", "title": "Presidential Candidates Preach Cheaper Drugs Not Safer Drugs", "url": "https://www.drugwatch.com/2015/11/10/presidential-candidates-health-care-plans/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "https://www.drugwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/news-pres-candidates-v1.jpg", "height": 552}, "locale": "en_US", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-10T09:18:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T09:32:23+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Drug_watch", "image": {"src": "https://www.drugwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/news-pres-candidates-v1.jpg"}, "description": "Health care stances from Democratic and Republican presidential candidates focus on lowering drug costs, but candidates from both parties remain quiet on drug safety.", "card": "summary", "title": "Presidential Candidates Preach Cheaper Drugs Not Safer Drugs"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ObamaCare, IVC filters, Essure, Xarelto, Eliquis, Donald Trump, presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, health care reform, power morcellators, transvaginal mesh, testosterone, FDA process, drug complications, presidential debate, Republican debate"}, "article_summary": "They may want everyone to have health care access, but they haven\u2019t talked about how safe the health care is when patients get it.\nPresidential Candidates on Health CareCandidates differ on the problems with the health care system and the ways to fix it.\nWhether they want to fix ObamaCare, expand it or repeal it, the top U.S. presidential candidates are focusing on cheaper and easier health care access to get votes from the American public.\nHis main argument for health care access is to not force it on people who don\u2019t want it.\nAccording to his campaign website, he\u2019d ensure veterans get the health care they need, both physical and mental."}
