The House adopted the measure 226-197 on April 30.\n\nThe president has said repeatedly he would veto any proposal to gut or repeal Obamacare. Yet with the U.S. Supreme Court expected to rule next month on a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, Republicans could try to force him to compromise if the court strikes down most of the insurance subsidies that underpin the law.\n\nThe budget \u201cgives us the tools to leave Obamacare\u2019s broken promises and higher costs where they belong -- in the past,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s a budget that aims to make the government more efficient, more effective and more accountable to the middle class.\u201d\n\nMinority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said the budget is \u201cbalanced in name only\u201d and cuts items such as financial aid to attend college.\n\n\u201cThe Republican budget is unfair, it\u2019s unbalanced, unwise and some said it\u2019s immoral,\u201d Reid said.\n\nBudget \u2018Gimmick\u2019\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement that the budget would hurt middle-class families and relies on a temporary \u201cgimmick\u201d for defense funding.\n\n\u201cCongressional Republicans propose drastic cuts to programs that support the middle class and provide ladders of opportunity for those seeking to reach the middle class,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThe budget measure is a non-binding framework for spending bills to be passed later. It doesn\u2019t go to the president for his signature. Reid said last week that his party would block spending bills based on the budget.\n\nRepublican Priorities\n\nThe budget resolution, S.Con.Res. 11, spells out the Republican Party\u2019s priorities by calling for $5.3 trillion in spending cuts to reach balance in nine years. Most of the reductions, $4.1 trillion, would come from programs including entitlements like Medicare.\n\nThe plan would use a reserve fund to evade a limit on defense spending while keeping in place caps on domestic programs.\n\n\u201cAmerican families know they can\u2019t live on borrowed money and neither can the federal government,\u201d Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, said during floor debate.\n\nDemocrats oppose reductions to entitlement programs without tax increases for wealthier Americans. In the House, no Democrats supported the budget, while 14 Republicans opposed it.\n\n\u201cThis is an absolute disaster for the working families of this country,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats and is the party\u2019s top member of the Budget Committee. He is seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2016.\n\nObamacare Legislation\n\nThe budget agreement would let Republicans use a process called reconciliation to send Obamacare legislation to the president without needing Democratic votes.\n\nWhile the House has voted more than 50 times to delay or repeal Obamacare, Democrats controlled the Senate until January and still have the power as the minority party to block most legislation. The reconciliation process would let Republicans pass an Obamacare repeal with no Democratic support.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 chances of enacting an outright repeal of Obamacare remain slim, though, because Democrats would have the votes to sustain a presidential veto.\n\nCourt Decision\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price of Georgia said a Republican strategy on Obamacare will await a Supreme Court ruling on a lawsuit seeking to throw out most of the tax credits that underpin the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 response will depend on what the court says, whether it overturns the subsidies and whether existing contracts must stay in place, Price said.\n\nThe unified budget would use emergency war funds to evade a limit on defense spending while keeping in place caps on domestic programs.\n\nThe measure would limit discretionary spending in 2016 to $1.016 trillion, while war funding would total $96 billion, far above Obama\u2019s request. The plan allows total spending of $3.9 trillion in 2016, with a $400 billion deficit.\n\nA budget document is typically little more than an aspirational framework for spending. The most recent unified budget plan was enacted for fiscal 2010 when Democrats controlled both chambers.\n\nThe appropriations bills due at the Oct. 1 start of each fiscal year set the actual spending details for agencies and government functions.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heidi Przybyla", "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Congress adopted a budget that will allow Republicans to bypass Democrats and send a repeal or revision of President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark 2010 health-care law to his desk.", "title": "Senate Budget Allows Republicans to Seek Obamacare Repeal", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-05/senate-adopts-budget-that-lets-republicans-seek-obamacare-repeal", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSw0E_Dl3Nko/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Heidi Przybyla", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Barack H Obama,Law,Harry Mason Reid,U.S. Congress,Democrats,Republicans", "news_keywords": "Barack H Obama,Law,Harry Mason Reid,U.S. Congress,Democrats,Republicans", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-05/senate-adopts-budget-that-lets-republicans-seek-obamacare-repeal", "parsely-title": "Senate Budget Allows Republicans to Seek Obamacare Repeal", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-05T21:59:42.636Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The U.S. Congress adopted a budget that will allow Republicans to bypass Democrats and send a repeal or revision of President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark 2010 health-care law to his desk.", "parsely-tags": "Barack H Obama,Law,Harry Mason Reid,U.S. Congress,Democrats,Republicans,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-05-05T21:59:42.636Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The U.S. Congress adopted a budget that will allow Republicans to bypass Democrats and send a repeal or revision of President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark 2010 health-care law to his desk.", "title": "Senate Budget Allows Republicans to Seek Obamacare Repeal", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-05/senate-adopts-budget-that-lets-republicans-seek-obamacare-repeal", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSw0E_Dl3Nko/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "The U.S. Congress adopted a budget that will allow Republicans to bypass Democrats and send a repeal or revision of President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark 2010 health-care law to his desk."}, "parsely-post-id": "NNU8656KLVRK01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSw0E_Dl3Nko/v3/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The reconciliation process would let Republicans pass an Obamacare repeal with no Democratic support.\nThe president has said repeatedly he would veto any proposal to gut or repeal Obamacare.\nObamacare LegislationThe budget agreement would let Republicans use a process called reconciliation to send Obamacare legislation to the president without needing Democratic votes.\n\u201cThe Republican budget is unfair, it\u2019s unbalanced, unwise and some said it\u2019s immoral,\u201d Reid said.\nWhile the House has voted more than 50 times to delay or repeal Obamacare, Democrats controlled the Senate until January and still have the power as the minority party to block most legislation."}
