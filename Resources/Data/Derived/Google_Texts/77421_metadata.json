He must get counseling on impulse control and do yard work at the jail as his community service, Mutz said.\n\nWilliams came to Friday\u2019s Florida Board of Medicine hearing in Deerfield Beach with great hope of being able to resume full practice by the end of the summer. The Department of Health was willing to allow it as long as Williams always had a female licensee, such as a nurse, in the examining room when he was with women patients.\n\nDOH prosecutors went along with the deal because they said some of the witnesses were not cooperating and might not testify if the case went to a formal hearing before an administrative law judge.\n\nBut Board of Medicine members unanimously rejected the proposed settlement, pointing out that a nurse who worked for the doctor might not be in a good position to chaperone.\n\n\u201cHe should never be able to see female patients again,\u201d said board member Nina DiPietro. \u201cI\u2019d be afraid he\u2019d hit on the chaperone, too.\u201d\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s professional misconduct charges, Williams made sexually suggestive comments to five women patients and touched some of them in a way that was not appropriate to a medical exam.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do any of those things,\u201d Williams said at the Board of Medicine hearing. \u201cI did not say those things to those patients. I did not touch those patients.\u201d\n\nHe said the women made up the accusations in retaliation for his curbing the narcotics he prescribed.\n\nBut Dr. James Orr, board chairman, said \u201cthere were just too many\u201d women accusing Williams of similar inappropriate conduct for that argument to be convincing.\n\nThe settlement that the board had rejected called for a reprimand, $27,500 fine, about $14,000 in costs, some courses and six months\u2019 suspension, with credit for the time Williams had already been out of practice since he signed the papers in February.\n\nAfter rejecting that deal, the board counter-offered Williams a settlement with the reprimand, fine, costs, and courses. But it lengthened the suspension to a year and added the permanent ban on treating female patients.\n\n\u201cWe reject that,\u201d attorney Howard said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court!\u201d\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent for WUSF in Tampa.
