Just bombing, no boots on the ground. No, a little light bombing, we\u2019ll be out of your hair in a week.\u2019\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov did come to an agreement \u2014 bolstered by Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 early Saturday morning to secure Syria\u2019s chemical weapons.
