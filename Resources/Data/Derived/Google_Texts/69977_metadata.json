The truth is that it\u2019s probably too late for money in these amounts to change much of anything either way.\n\nBut this is significant, because it highlight how current campaigns are now getting hit by such a massive blizzard of spending and advertising that for candidates, accountability has become all but impossible and deception carries no meaningful risk.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the article:\n\nAll told, in seven races for which both Democrats and Republicans provided complete fund-raising totals by Wednesday evening \u2014 Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan and North Carolina \u2014 Republicans held more cash in six of them, with a net advantage of about $7 million. At the same time, Democrats had booked more advertising from Sept. 29 through Election Day in at least five of those races, with the biggest advantages in North Carolina and Iowa, according to a Republican tracking media purchases. In Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia and Iowa, Republican contenders posted their best fund-raising quarter of the year. In Iowa, the Republican candidate, Joni Ernst, who narrowly leads in polling, raised $6 million, more than double the amount taken in by her Democratic opponent, Representative Bruce Braley, and reported three times as much in cash on hand than Mr. Braley. Representative Tom Cotton of Arkansas reported raising $3.8 million, far more than the Democratic incumbent, Senator Mark Pryor, who took in $2.2 million. In Colorado, Representative Cory Gardner raised $4.5 million and reported $1.4 million more in cash on hand than Senator Mark Udall, the Democratic incumbent.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live in one of these states it may be hard to appreciate the incredible volume of political ads television viewers have already endured in recent months. A count from the Wesleyan Media Project of television ads shows that in just one week, some 14,000 ads were aired in North Carolina, 13,000 in Iowa, 11,000 in Kentucky, and so on. Buying a few hundred more ads in one of these states is like walking up to people who have been standing in the middle of a monsoon and firing a squirt gun at them.\n\nMeanwhile, the total spending so far in these races is enormous, as these data from the Center for Responsive Politics show:\n\nBy the time the race is over, the spending in, for example, North Carolina will probably total at least $75 million. Is another million or two going to be transformative? Probably not.\n\nThe important thing here is that all of this spending makes real accountability a lot harder. The candidates know that any forum where they might actually be held accountable will inevitably be drowned out by all the ads. For instance, in a debate yesterday Cory Gardner had to endure a grilling by a couple of obviously exasperated reporters over the fact that Gardner keeps denying that the \u201cPersonhood\u201d bill he sponsored in Congress actually does what it says it does. He bobbed and weaved, and the footage looks really bad. But is Gardner particularly worried? I doubt it. He\u2019s up by a couple of points in the polls, and how many people actually watched that debate? He has thousands of opportunities to get his message out his way.\n\nNor, I suspect, is Mitch McConnell worried that he\u2019ll pay a price for trying to fool people in Kentucky into thinking that you can repeal the Affordable Care Act \u201croot and branch,\u201d but they\u2019ll still get to keep Kynect, the hugely successful ACA exchange. Voters don\u2019t understand the distinction, and the media aren\u2019t helping them get it. In the post-Citizens United world, there\u2019s little to fear, so long as you and your allies have the money.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that the media couldn\u2019t impose some accountability if they truly wanted to. But it would take an agreement that a particular issue is important enough to warrant intense, repeated attention. And that, apparently, is something they only do for things that have little or no substantive importance, like whether a candidate will say who she voted for.\n\nThirty years ago, George H.W. Bush\u2019s press secretary Peter Teeley was asked by a reporter about a lie Bush had told during his debate with Geraldine Ferraro. \u201cYou can say anything you want during a debate, and 80 million people hear it,\u201d he said. And if reporters then correct the falsehood? \u201cSo what?\u201d Teeley responded. \u201c\u2018Maybe 200 people read it or 2,000 or 20,000.\u201d\n\nThe principle today is the same, but the information environment has changed. Candidates are no more afraid of accountability than they were, but now it\u2019s because they\u2019re drowning voters in advertising. And they can still say anything they want.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How the post-Citizens United campaign makes accountability nearly impossible.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "How the post-Citizens United campaign makes accountability nearly impossible.", "title": "Mega-blitz of ad spending makes it easier for candidates to lie", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/10/16/mega-blitz-of-ad-spending-makes-it-easier-for-candidates-to-lie/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/04/blog_mcconnell.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/10/16/mega-blitz-of-ad-spending-makes-it-easier-for-candidates-to-lie/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "2014 campaigns, 2014 elections, cory gardner, personhood, mitch mcconnell, alison lundergan grimes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "2014 campaigns, 2014 elections, cory gardner, personhood, mitch mcconnell, alison lundergan grimes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e78\"", "article_summary": "In Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia and Iowa, Republican contenders posted their best fund-raising quarter of the year.\nThe important thing here is that all of this spending makes real accountability a lot harder.\nCandidates are no more afraid of accountability than they were, but now it\u2019s because they\u2019re drowning voters in advertising.\nThe truth is that it\u2019s probably too late for money in these amounts to change much of anything either way.\nThe candidates know that any forum where they might actually be held accountable will inevitably be drowned out by all the ads."}
