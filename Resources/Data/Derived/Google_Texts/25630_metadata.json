Coppins cites a couple of Cruz lines on immigration and sugar subsidies that were clearly implied digs at Rubio; I would add Cruz\u2019s stress on how his own tax and spending plan adds up (it doesn\u2019t, really, but compared to Rubio\u2019s it does) and his attempt to position himself in between Rubio and Paul when the two clashed on foreign policy. Add them all together and you have a clear blueprint for an anti-Rubio offensive: Attack sharply on immigration, find his Floridian weakness on corporate welfare, claim the mantle of fiscal hawkishness at home and cast Rubio as a little too Wilsonian abroad. I\u2019m not sure what to think about the wisdom of unrolling the blueprint without going after Rubio directly. Cruz is probably wise not to explicitly attack his fellow senator just yet, but there\u2019s something too-clever-by-half about the kind of telegraphing he\u2019s engaged in. But still, it\u2019s not like Rubio\u2019s team can\u2019t see what\u2019s coming whether Cruz telegraphs it or not...For now, [Rubio is] smoothly returning to speech material in all his [debate] answers, and that\u2019s working well. But he won\u2019t be allowed to do that indefinitely; at some point Cruz will try to hold his feet to the fire, and then we\u2019ll have a better sense of whether Rubio really deserves the \u201ceffective frontrunner\u201d status so many of us have imputed to him...it must be said that Cruz\u2019s positioning is very impressively calibrated at the moment. And if he gets the war with Rubio he\u2019s clearly planning for, then regardless of the outcome we should prepare for some pretty interesting political television this winter \u2014 and perhaps this spring as well.\n\nRUBIO : This election is about the future, about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century. This next election is actually a generational choice. A choice about what kind of nation we will be in the 21st century. For over two-and-a-half centuries, America\u2019s been a special country, the one place on earth where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything, a nation that\u2019s been a force for good on this planet. But now, a growing number of Americans feel out of place in their own country. We have a society that stigmatizes those that hold cultural values that are traditional. We have a society where people \u2014 millions of people \u2014 are living paycheck to paycheck. They\u2019re working as hard as they ever have, but they\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet. We have young Americans who owe thousands of dollars in student loans for a degree that doesn\u2019t lead to a job. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than starting, and around the world, every day brings news of a new humiliation for America \u2014 many the direct response \u2014 direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the \u2014 of state. And so here\u2019s the truth: this election is about the future, and the Democratic Party, and the political left has no ideas about the future. All their ideas are the same, tired ideas of the past. More government, more spending. For every issue for America, their answer is a new tax on someone, and a new government program. This nation is going to turn the page, and that\u2019s what this election should be about, and, as I said at the first debate, if I am our nominee, they will be the party of the past, we will be the party of the 21st century.\n\n\n\nCRUZ : And, Maria, I will note, she\u2019s got a lot of experience, but her u have proven disastrous. If you look at foreign policy, every region in the world has gotten worse. Under her leadership, we abandon the nation of Israel. Under her leadership, radical Islamic terrorism has been on to the rise. Under her leadership, and Obama\u2019s leadership, Iran is getting $100 billion dollars, and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon. Everything she\u2019s put her hand to, or has touched \u2014 and when we talk about the cronyism of Washington, Hillary Clinton embodies the cronyism of Washington. And, I\u2019ll give you an example of that, which is the Congressional exemption from Obamacare, which is fundamentally wrong, and I\u2019ll tell you this, if I\u2019m elected president, I will veto any statute that exempts members of congress. The law should apply evenly to every American.\n\nRubio gives big picture/generational/narrative answer on Hillary. Cruz specific & prosecutorial. #GOPDebate \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) November 11, 2015\n\n\n\nAll of which is to say that, yes, a battle royale between Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz would make for absolutely fascinating political theater, in the best sense of the term. But on what grounds should this possible outcome, for which some in elite conservative circles are evidently yearning, be considered somewhat inevitable, or even all that likely? Donald Trump and Ben Carson have occupied first place in every major national poll since the beginning of July. Since early August, their combined support has hovered around 50 percent, with the other dozen candidates divvying up the scraps. This is not indicative of fleeting, flash-in-the-pan appeal. We've now gone months with virtually unchanged fundamentals, as the various spikes and swoons of lower-tier candidates have had little impact on the dominant top two. Before we get carried away, let's lay some caveats into place: Relatively few Republican-leaning voters have fully made up their minds. Ground game and turnout operations matter a lot, and we're still many weeks away from any actual voting taking place. And both Rubio and Cruz are building very formidable and well-financed political operations. That's all true.\n\n\n\nWhat's also true is that in spite of several impressive debate performances and a general consensus that they're both ascendant, adding Rubio and Cruz's RealClearPolitics polling averages together produces a number that's still a few points shy of either Carson or Trump. Same deal in Iowa and New Hampshire, more or less. GOP debates have drawn record audiences. People are paying attention. And two political novices with strange political instincts and undeniable knowledge blindspots have maintained a consistent lead, week after week. Do analysts spilling gallons of virtual ink hyping the coming heavyweight Rubio vs Cruz showdown have any reason to believe that's how things will actually play out, or does their assumption rest on some version of \"this outsider stuff can't possibly last\"? I'll leave you with Rich Lowry picking Cruz as Tuesday's winner, followed by Frank Luntz's focus group giving it to Rubio:\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Cruz had a terrific night. He had a stand-out answer on immigration and wages and made his own fortune by getting into an argument with John Kasich on bank bailouts, enunciating the anti-bailout position forcefully and repeatedly (although I don\u2019t really believe he wouldn\u2019t bail out a major financial institution in the midst of a financial panic if he were president). He was pointed, eloquent, and, of course, very conservative. Marco Rubio was very good, as well. But I thought Rubio was slightly better than Cruz last time, and that Cruz was slightly better this time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Narratives..05/27/2016 7:44:05AM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Narratives.", "title": "GOP Endgame: Rubio vs. Cruz?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/11/12/emerging-theory-the-gop-endgame-is-rubio-vs-cruz-n2079242", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/11/31.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Narratives.", "title": "GOP Endgame: Rubio vs. Cruz?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/11/12/emerging-theory-the-gop-endgame-is-rubio-vs-cruz-n2079242", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/11/31.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "GOP Endgame: Rubio vs. Cruz?, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Tonight was a step toward the Cruz vs Rubio final act a lot of us are anxious to see.\nBut I thought Rubio was slightly better than Cruz last time, and that Cruz was slightly better this time.\nRUBIO : This election is about the future, about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century.\nAnd both Rubio and Cruz are building very formidable and well-financed political operations.\nThey\u2019re working as hard as they ever have, but they\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet."}
