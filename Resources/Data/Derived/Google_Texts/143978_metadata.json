I can\u2019t ignore them today, however.\u201d\n\nSenator Cotton unloaded on Minority Leader Reid during discussion of a defense bill that passed unanimously Wednesday. The Arkansas Senator invoked some of Harry Reid\u2019s greatest hits including the Nevada Senator\u2019s comments in 2007 that the Iraq war was lost and Reid\u2019s infamous passing of Obamacare on Christmas Eve.\n\nCotton mocked Reid and railed against him:\n\nWhen was the last time the Minority Leader read a bill? It was probably an electricity bill. What about the claims that it was written in the dark of night? It\u2019s been public for weeks. And this coming from a man who drafted Obamacare in his office and rammed it through this Senate at midnight on Christmas Eve on a straight party line vote? To say that he\u2019s delaying this because he cares for the troops, a man who never served himself, a man who in April 2007 came to this very floor before the surge had even reached its peak and said the war is lost, when over 100 Americans were being killed in Iraq every month, when I was carrying their dead bodies off an airplane at Dover Air Force Base. It is an outrage to say that we had to delay this because he cares for the troops. We are delaying it for one reason and one reason only: to protect his own sad, sorry legacy.\n\nSenator Cotton finished by insulting Senator Reid\u2019s \u201ccancerous leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe now complains in the mornings that the Senate is not in session enough,\u201d Cotton finished. \u201cThat our calendar is too short. Well, whatever you think about that, the happy byproduct of fewer days in session in the Senate is that this institution will be cursed less with his cancerous leadership. I yield the floor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Floor Fight: Tom Cotton Blasts 'Cancerous' Harry Reid's 'Bitter, Vulgar, Incoherent Ramblings'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Floor Fight: Tom Cotton Blasts 'Cancerous' Harry Reid's 'Bitter, Vulgar, Incoherent Ramblings'", "title": "Floor Fight: Tom Cotton Blasts 'Cancerous' Harry Reid's 'Bitter, Vulgar, Incoherent Ramblings' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Tom-Cotton-Harry-Reid-Getty-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/25/floor-fight-tom-cotton-blasts-cancerous-harry-reids-bitter-vulgar-incoherent-ramblings/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Floor Fight: Tom Cotton Blasts 'Cancerous' Harry Reid's 'Bitter, Vulgar, Incoherent Ramblings'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Tom-Cotton-Harry-Reid-Getty-AP.jpg", "title": "Floor Fight: Tom Cotton Blasts 'Cancerous' Harry Reid's 'Bitter, Vulgar, Incoherent Ramblings' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Senator Tom Cotton,Big Government, National Security,Harry Reid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senator Tom Cotton", "published_time": "2016-05-25T19:29:31-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Senator Cotton finished by insulting Senator Reid\u2019s \u201ccancerous leadership.\u201d\u201cHe now complains in the mornings that the Senate is not in session enough,\u201d Cotton finished.\nI can\u2019t ignore them today, however.\u201dSenator Cotton unloaded on Minority Leader Reid during discussion of a defense bill that passed unanimously Wednesday.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSenator Tom Cotton went directly after Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid from the floor of the Senate blasting Reid for more than two-minutes Wednesday morning.\nSenator Cotton complained about listening to Reid\u2019s \u201cbitter, vulgar, incoherent ramblings,\u201d and found a silver lining in a reduction in Senate work days because at least the Senate would be \u201ccursed less with his [Reid\u2019s] cancerous leadership.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI am forced to listen to the bitter, vulgar, incoherent ramblings of the Minority Leader,\u201d Senator Cotton started.\nCotton mocked Reid and railed against him:When was the last time the Minority Leader read a bill?"}
