Former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin was in Arcadia on Sunday to campaign for Donald Trump.

She appeared at the All Florida Championship Rodeo, where she walked among the crowd and met with voters.

"It's refreshing to talk to his supporters," she said.

Palin, who endorsed Trump in January, called Trump an "outsider that's going to undo all that stuff," and said "he's the one."

Residents were caught by surprise to see Palin at their annual event.

"It was a huge surprise for her to come out to a small area like Arcadia," said resident Brenda Barnes.

"I know a lot of people are upset. He says what's on his mind. I like him because he can't be bought," said Sam Dunn.

Palin touched on the commotion at Trump rallies.

"I don't even want to call them protesters, you know, they're thugs," she said.

While fans greeted and hugged Palin, some were curious of her choice to visit Arcadia, and moreso her endorsement.

"I don't think there's much substance has been offered up. I don't think there's much actual policy initiative," said Caroline D., a Republican.

Palin also made a stop in Plant City. She plans to be at The Villages Monday at noon.

Donald Trump is planning his own stop in Florida on Monday in Tampa for a town hall meeting.
