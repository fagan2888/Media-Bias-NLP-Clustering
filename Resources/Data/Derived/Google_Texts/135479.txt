A man in his 20s who fell off his personal watercraft and into the water in the Manasquan Inlet was rescued by a a rescue swimmer from a helicopter crew of the United States Coast Guard based in Atlantic City early Sunday afternoon, United States Coast Guard spokesperson Nick Ameen said.

Ameen said the man, who was not identified, did not suffer major injuries.

Ameen said the rescue swimmer was lowered into the water by his crew and grabbed the man out of the water. The helicopter crew then lowered both the individual and the rescue swimmer onto the beach, Ameen said.

The helicopter crew had been on a training flight when the rescue swimmer looked out the window while they were flying over the inlet and saw a personal watercraft with nobody on it, Ameen said.

The crew then scanned the area and a saw a person in the water close to the jetty, Ameen said. The crew circled around while the rescue swimmer was putting his gear on. By that point, the watercraft had slammed into the jetty. That’s when the rescue swimmer was lowered down to the water.

“He (the individual) was getting pushed toward the rocks. The timing could not have been better," Ameen said. “The person was wearing a wet suit and life jacket. It helped him a lot."

Ameen said the Coast Guard strongly advises everyone to stay out of the water when the weather creates heavy surf.
