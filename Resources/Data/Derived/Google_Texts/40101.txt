Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who accused 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney during the last presidential campaign of not paying taxes for 10 years, said this week that “of course” Mr. Romney paid taxes but that the former Massachusetts governor still hasn’t shown his returns to the American public.

“I’m really happy to respond to this,” the Nevada Democrat told Fusion’s Jorge Ramos, saying the matter has been “blown way out of proportion — but blown my way.”

“Mitt Romney, during the time he was running for president, refused to give us his tax returns,” said Mr. Reid, who announced last month he’s not seeking re-election in 2016. “Of course he paid taxes — what he didn’t do is let us see his tax returns.”

“I said someone who worked at Bain Capital, a couple people told me he didn’t pay taxes, but let him give us his tax returns — let the American people judge that,” he said. “That’s what I’ve said.”

The fact-checking website Politifact ratedMr. Reid’s claim “Pants on Fire” in August 2012.

“I have no repentance, because it was an issue that was important,” Mr. Reid said.

So, Mr. Ramos asked, no apologies to Mr. Romney?

“Oh, none whatsoever — zero, none,” Mr. Reid said.
