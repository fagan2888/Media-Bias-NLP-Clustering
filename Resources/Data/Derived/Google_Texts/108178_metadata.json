It is an incredible show full of acrobatic dancing, beautiful, authentic costumes, music, and a story of the first Emperor of China \u2014 with a 3D background. I guarantee it is a show unlike anything you have ever seen before. The only disappointment was the sparse crowd. People, Denver is the first city in the United States to experience this. We are supposed to have culture. Get out and support this amazing show and pass the word on.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why the corpse flower has gotten so much more attention than this show. I\u2019d much rather go and see 90 minutes of awe than 10 minutes of a stinky flower (although it would be neat to see as well).\n\nJerry Minerich, Westminster\n\nThis letter was published in the Aug. 24 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/08/23/terracotta-warriors-3d-even-better-than-a-corpse-flower/38921/", "site_name": "eLetters", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/08/terracotta-warrior-3d-495x356.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "\"Terracotta Warriors 3D\": Even better than a corpse flower"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "\u201cTerracotta Warriors 3D\u201d: Even better than a corpse flower", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/08/23/terracotta-warriors-3d-even-better-than-a-corpse-flower/38921/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/08/terracotta-warrior-3d-495x356.jpg", "creator": "@denveropinion", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "I recently saw \u201cTerracotta Warriors 3D\u201d at the Newman Center."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2521\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m not sure why the corpse flower has gotten so much more attention than this show.\nJerry Minerich, WestminsterThis letter was published in the Aug. 24 edition.\nI recently saw \u201cTerracotta Warriors 3D\u201d at the Newman Center.\nI\u2019d much rather go and see 90 minutes of awe than 10 minutes of a stinky flower (although it would be neat to see as well).\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail."}
