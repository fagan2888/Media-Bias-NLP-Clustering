(Photo: Special to the Register)\n\nIowa\u2019s insurance regulator has taken the federal government to court regarding the liquidation of insurance company CoOportunity Health.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart filed a suit Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. At issue is whether a local order for CoOportunity's liquidation applies to the federal agencies.\n\nFiled in U.S. District Court, the suit asks the court to declare that Iowa law is applied when determining the priority of claims from creditors. In the suit, Gerhart argues the federal government is claiming it has \u201csuper priority\u201d over other claims and creditors tied to the case.\n\nIt also seeks to lift an \u201cadministrative hold\u201d Gerhart says HHS has put on payments it is supposed to make to CoOportunity.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has tried to jump to the head of the creditor line, but is not following Iowa or federal law in withholding over $20 million due to CoOportunity,\u201d Gerhart said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in an email the agency had no comment.\n\nCoOportunity Health was an Iowa-based health insurance company established under the Affordable Care Act. It had received about $146 million in federal money under the federal law, also known as Obamacare.\n\nState regulators took over the company in December 2014 after it faced millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThe company had an operating loss of more than $163 million in 2014, according to the lawsuit. It had about 120,000 policyholders in Iowa and Nebraska before its collapse.\n\nWhile it was one of 23 health insurance co-ops set up under the federal health care law, CoOportunity was the first to fail.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/26Q7c47", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Iowa\u2019s insurance regulator has taken the federal government to court regarding the liquidation of insurance company CoOportunity Health.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Iowa\u2019s insurance regulator has taken the federal government to court regarding the liquidation of insurance company CoOportunity Health.", "title": "State regulator sues HHS over CoOportunity liquidation", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2016/05/03/iowa-insurance-regulator-sues-feds-over-cooportunity-liquidation/83878038/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa\u2019s insurance regulator has taken the federal government to court regarding the liquidation of insurance company CoOportunity Health.", "title": "State regulator sues HHS over CoOportunity liquidation", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8220c191cc4090ebce8ab72f9f0c1c2049ed2c82/c=225-0-525-300&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/03/DesMoines/B9318322919Z.1_20150803185850_000_GVDBHD7OF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "title": "State regulator sues HHS over CoOportunity liquidation", "author": "Matthew Patane", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/581b8a798298409973120d75684acfd41b2ed729/c=262-0-487-300/local/-/media/2015/08/03/DesMoines/B9318322919Z.1_20150803185850_000_GVDBHD7OF.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0032a8ff411568e5670ba59ec952f9a7741c30a4/c=225-0-525-300/local/-/media/2015/08/03/DesMoines/B9318322919Z.1_20150803185850_000_GVDBHD7OF.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/286f9409e871738bccbcef6a675290f3b95bd650/c=175-0-575-300/local/-/media/2015/08/03/DesMoines/B9318322919Z.1_20150803185850_000_GVDBHD7OF.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c049f133f67b8315462161bc8e36d45b625d84f9/c=108-0-641-300&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/03/DesMoines/B9318322919Z.1_20150803185850_000_GVDBHD7OF.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-03T16:13:03.660000-05:00", "shorthed": "Iowa insurance regulator sues HHS", "articleid": 83878038, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0dea67e774800fb0a2b6f1069110fe2384f32766/c=108-0-641-300/local/-/media/2015/08/03/DesMoines/B9318322919Z.1_20150803185850_000_GVDBHD7OF.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b367a79a6d7b58d13165863a564778e8eae6ec1b/c=290-0-459-300/local/-/media/2015/08/03/DesMoines/B9318322919Z.1_20150803185850_000_GVDBHD7OF.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Special to the Register)Iowa\u2019s insurance regulator has taken the federal government to court regarding the liquidation of insurance company CoOportunity Health.\nCoOportunity Health was an Iowa-based health insurance company established under the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile it was one of 23 health insurance co-ops set up under the federal health care law, CoOportunity was the first to fail.\nCoOportunity Health, which was created under the Affordable Care Act, went out of business in December.\nIt had received about $146 million in federal money under the federal law, also known as Obamacare."}
