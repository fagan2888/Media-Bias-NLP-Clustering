(Photo: COURTESY OF TATE PUBLISHING) Story Highlights The book \u201cSylvie and Sean\u201d was taken from a true story that occurred in South Boston\n\nCheryl donated a kidney to her youngest sister, Roxanne Weisheit of Howell\n\nCheryl Filipak wrote her first children\u2019s book in order to inspire young people to look up to and perhaps become true heroes. Filipak knows a thing or two about being heroic. In 1993, she stepped up to the plate and donated a kidney to her youngest sister, Roxanne Weisheit of Howell.\n\n\u201cMy sister was diagnosed with Lupus at the age of 15,\u201d Filipak said. \u201cI did research and found out that Lupus often affects the kidneys. I always said, \u2018If you need a kidney, I\u2019m yours.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFilipak now is inspiring young readers with her new children\u2019s book, \u201cSylvie and Sean.\u201d The book was taken from a true story that occurred in South Boston, in which firefighters from Ladder 19 risked their lives to save a husky who had fallen through the ice in Pleasure Bay.\n\n\u201cI read about it on the Internet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was one of the wonderful things firefighters do in the winter during tremendous ice storms. I thought to myself that it would make a great children\u2019s book.\u201d\n\nAccording to a January 2014 story on Boston.com, firefighter Sean Coyle pulled Sylvie, a 13-year-old husky, from the icy waters of Boston Harbor after she broke away from her owner and fell through the ice. Coyle donned a special survival suit and ventured out 30- to 40-feet onto the ice in a specialized basket with a rope attached to him. Sylvie treaded water for nearly 30 minutes before Coyle was able to rescue her from the frigid water.\n\nFilipak thought about all the lessons that kids could learn from one simple story.\n\n\u201cSean could not save the dog alone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe book teaches the importance of teamwork, perseverance and cooperation. It also gives children real heroes to look up to, not just superheroes in the movies.\u201d\n\nWhile writing the 24-page book, Filipak communicated with Coyle, trying to get a mental picture of what went on that day and what the firetruck and equipment looked like so her story would be as accurate as possible.\n\n\u201cI told him if I made any money from the book, I would give a donation to the firehouse,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loved the idea.\u201d\n\nFilipak began working as a teacher in the Newark school system in 1994 and she now mentors teachers in the district. She is using the book, which was released this month, as a lesson for the students from preschool through first grade.\n\n\u201cAs an educator, I love to read and write, so writing a book was a natural fit for me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe mother of two adult children and also a singer in a Pink Floyd tribute band, Filipak has written articles throughout the years for various magazines, such as travel and Christian publications.\n\n\u201cI love writing, but I also love working in a school setting, so now I have the best of both worlds,\u201d she said.\n\nHer own heroic journey began in 1993, when she donated her kidney, knowing the odds of her sister\u2019s survival were better if the organ came from a relative.\n\n\u201cWe were very blessed and lucky that we both survived,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was wonderful that I was able to save her life. The doctors who performed the transplant are my heroes.\u201d\n\nFilipak said she wants to write more stories for young children because that is the age where they can be influenced the most.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many people we inspire when we do something good,\u201d she said. \u201cReading real stories sends positive messages to children. Anyone can be a hero. You don\u2019t have to give a kidney or risk your life. Doctors, lifeguards, even teachers are heroes. There are heroes all around us, and I have so many more stories that I want to write.\u201d\n\nSylvie and Sean is available for $8.99 at Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and Tate Publishing.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1ENUkvO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Cheryl Filipak wrote her first children\u2019s book in order to inspire young people to look up to and perhaps become true heroes", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Cheryl Filipak wrote her first children\u2019s book in order to inspire young people to look up to and perhaps become true heroes", "title": "Hillsborough author inspires others to find true heroes", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/02/24/author-writes-book-heroes/23951365/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cheryl Filipak wrote her first children\u2019s book in order to inspire young people to look up to and perhaps become true heroes", "title": "Hillsborough author inspires others to find true heroes", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eeff383cafeabeab01b46b071769b16e7663eed3/c=0-450-1763-2213&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2015/02/24/B9316296369Z.1_20150224155055_000_GS2A08LJO.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Cheryl Filipak, heroes, Boston Harbor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29c5\"", "article_summary": "Hillsborough author Cheryl Filipak obtained details about the incident from the firefighter involved in order to re-create the events of that day.\nIn 1993, she stepped up to the plate and donated a kidney to her youngest sister, Roxanne Weisheit of Howell.\nSylvie treaded water for nearly 30 minutes before Coyle was able to rescue her from the frigid water.\n\u201cAs an educator, I love to read and write, so writing a book was a natural fit for me,\u201d she said.\nShe is using the book, which was released this month, as a lesson for the students from preschool through first grade."}
