Springs police say drinking and speeding both played a part in a single-car rollover early Saturday morning.

The driver was reportedly heading north on Tutt Boulevard just before 1:40 a.m. when he hit the center median and rolled his car several times. The driver was thrown from the car, but was not badly injured.

A passenger also did not suffer any serious injuries, police told 11 News.

Tutt was closed in both directions from Dublin to Snowy River Drive for several hours. It reopened before 8 a.m.
