ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) - A woman convicted of setting fire to a bar and grill she co-owned in the South Dakota town of Herreid to get insurance money has been granted a new trial.

A jury in February found 42-year-old Lori Brandner guilty of arson, conspiracy to commit arson and filing a fraudulent insurance claim.

The American News reports (http://bit.ly/1VmpdmR ) defense attorney Brad Schreiber filed a motion for a new trial, citing concerns over jury instructions. A judge agreed, and granted a new trial for Aug. 3-5. She has been released on bond.

Authorities say Brandner and three others set fire to the business on Jan. 21, 2015, and that Brandner later submitted a $310,000 insurance claim.

Tyler Ambrust and Ryan Kaelberer, of Minot, North Dakota, were sentenced in February to a year in prison for arson conspiracy. Cheyenne Davis, of Pollock, awaits sentencing on the same charge.
