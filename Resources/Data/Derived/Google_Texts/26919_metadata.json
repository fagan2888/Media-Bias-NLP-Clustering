On October 1, 32% supported Democrats while 30% backed Republicans. The new poll shows 37% support Republicans and 26% back Democrats.\n\nQuinnipiac notes that voters still disapprove more of Republicans in Congress, 73%-20%, than they disapprove of Democrats, 62%-30%.\n\n\"In Washington today, it comes down to who the voters dislike the least,\" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \"There are no heroes.\"\n\nWith elections looming, Obamacare rattling Democratic nerves\n\nQuinnipiac's poll came after Gallup released a survey on Tuesday showing only 9% of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing. That's the lowest congressional approval rating in the 39 years Gallup has asked that question.\n\nQuinnipiac surveyed 2,545 registered voters nationwide by telephone from November 6-11. The sampling error is plus or minus 1.9 percentage points.\n\n- CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington (CNN) -- A new poll released Wednesday indicates voters are divided on whether they'll vote for Democratic or Republican House lawmakers in next year's midterm elections.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Poll: Voters split over Republicans, Democrats in 2014", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/13/poll-voters-split-over-republicans-democrats-in-2014/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/10/05/oct5.nevada.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Washington (CNN) -- A new poll released Wednesday indicates voters are divided on whether they'll vote for Democratic or Republican House lawmakers in next year's midterm elections.", "title": "Poll: Voters split over Republicans, Democrats in 2014"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "2014, congress, house, polls, cnn's ashley killough", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb349\"", "article_summary": "Follow @politicalticker Follow @KilloughCNNIn a similar Quinnipiac survey released October 1, Democrats held a 43%-34% advantage over Republicans.\nPoll: Christie, Clinton in virtual 2016 tieAccording to the new poll, independent voters have shifted in favor of Republicans.\nQuinnipiac notes that voters still disapprove more of Republicans in Congress, 73%-20%, than they disapprove of Democrats, 62%-30%.\n3 years agoWashington (CNN) - A new poll released Wednesday indicates voters are divided on whether they'll vote for Democratic or Republican House lawmakers in next year's midterm elections.\nThe new poll shows 37% support Republicans and 26% back Democrats."}
