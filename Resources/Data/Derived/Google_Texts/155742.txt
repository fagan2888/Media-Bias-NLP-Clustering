MADISON - The State of Wisconsin joined 10 other states in launching a lawsuit Wednesday against new bathroom rules for transgender students that were issued by President Barack Obama's administration.

It's only the latest legal challenge from Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel and other GOP officials here, who have also sued over a variety of other Obama policies such as the Affordable Care Act and rules on carbon emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect.

"President Obama's attempts to rewrite the laws of our country without congressional consent and approval are not going to be tolerated by the State of Wisconsin," Schimel said. "After discussing with Gov. Walker, I have decided to join my colleagues from across the country in challenging the Obama Administration's latest power grab, which will have a significant impact on Wisconsin, particularly at the University of Wisconsin and Department of Public Instruction."

The states joining Wisconsin in the lawsuit are lead plaintiff Texas, Alabama, West Virginia, Tennessee, Arizona, Maine, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah and Georgia.

The Obama administration seeks to ensure that transgender students in public schools are allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender with which they identify. Critics want students to only use bathrooms corresponding to their gender at birth.
