One hour delays or longer likely,\u201d according to the Colorado Department of Transportation web site.\n\nAir traffic filtering through Denver International Airport is expected to be heavy, with about 179,000 people passing through, compared to 145,000 on a normal day, according to Heath Montgomery, DIA spokesman.\n\nPassengers should arrive at the airport two-and-a-half hours before their flight, rather than the two hours normally recommended for passengers, Montgomery said.\n\nIt is expected to be the airport\u2019s second busiest day following a record 182,000 passengers on the Sunday following Christmas. Delays on that day were minimal.\n\nBut those coming through the airport late on the Saturday following Christmas, and into the morning hours, ran into lengthy security screening lines, when the Transportation Security Administration wasn\u2019t prepared for the number of flights.\n\nTSA spokesman Nico Melendez said at the time his agency was not prepared because the airlines had failed to communicate their needs.\n\nMontgomery said he doesn\u2019t expect similar problems on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a relatively smooth day, hopefully,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\nThe weather is expected to be mostly sunny throughout the state Sunday, with a high temperature of 47 degrees in Denver.\n\nTemperatures in the high country will range from 26 to 36 degrees, said Jim Kalina, of the National Weather Service in Boulder.\n\nTemperatures could be a little higher than that along the Front Range, he added. \u201cIt should be a really nice day for travel,\u201d he said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Travelers will have nice weather Sunday; traffic expected to be heavy", "title": "Travelers will have nice weather Sunday; traffic expected to be heavy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/travelers-will-have-nice-weather-sunday-traffic-expected-to-be-heavy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151217__I_70_express_lanesp1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151217__I_70_express_lanesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T09:52:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:12:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Traffic"}, "article_summary": "On Interstate 70, \u201cheavy eastbound traffic is expected this afternoon into the evening from Silverthorne to Denver.\nIt is expected to be the airport\u2019s second busiest day following a record 182,000 passengers on the Sunday following Christmas.\nTravellers returning to Denver after the holiday weekend will have good weather, but don\u2019t expect that to eliminate traffic delays as skiers return from the mountains.\nThe weather is expected to be mostly sunny throughout the state Sunday, with a high temperature of 47 degrees in Denver.\nAir traffic filtering through Denver International Airport is expected to be heavy, with about 179,000 people passing through, compared to 145,000 on a normal day, according to Heath Montgomery, DIA spokesman."}
