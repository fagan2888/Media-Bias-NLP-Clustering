Buckley, Encounter Books, 2014, 319 pages, $27.99.\n\nTry making sense out of what Americans tell pollsters. According to the Pew Research Center, fewer than one in five of us trusts the federal government. Gallup says that nearly three quarters of us consider it \"the biggest threat to the country in the future.\" Yet by equally overwhelming margins, Gallup shows Americans agreeing that \"the United States has a unique character because of its history and Constitution that sets it apart from other nations as the greatest in the world.\"\n\nApparently, we're disgusted and frightened by our government as it actually operates. And yet we're convinced that we've got the best system ever devised by the mind of man.\n\nOn both counts, no one's more convinced than American conservatives. Few go quite as far toward constitutional idolatry as former House Majority Leader Tom Delay, who earlier this year proclaimed that God \"wrote the Constitution.\" But the superiority of our national charter, with its separation of powers and independently elected national executive, is an article of faith for conservatives.\n\nIt's about time for some constitutional impiety on the right, and F.H. Buckley answers the call in his bracing and important new book, The Once and Future King. Buckley, a professor of law at George Mason University and a senior editor at The American Spectator, is unmistakably conservative. But that doesn't stop him from pointing out that America's not so all-fired exceptional\u2014or from arguing that our Constitution has made key contributions to our national decline.\n\nIn the conventional narrative, Buckley writes, \"our thanks [must] go to the Framers, who gave the country a presidential system that secured the blessings of liberty.\" A \"nice story,\" he says, but one that \"lacks the added advantage of accuracy.\"\n\nFirst off, we're hardly \"the freest country in the world.\" As Buckley points out, his native Canada beats the United States handily on most cross-country comparisons of political and economic liberty. In the latest edition of the Cato Institute's Economic Freedom of the World rankings, for example, we're number 17 and we don't try harder. Meanwhile, as Buckley points out, the Economist Intelligence Unit's \"Democracy Index\" ranks us as the 19th healthiest democracy in the world, \"behind a group of mostly parliamentary countries, and not very far ahead of the 'flawed democracies.'\"\n\nThere's a lesson there, Buckley argues. While \"an American is apt to think that his Constitution uniquely protects liberty,\" the truth \"is almost exactly the reverse.\" In a series of regressions using the Freedom House rankings, Buckley finds that \"presidentialism is significantly and strongly correlated with less political freedom.\"\n\nIn this, he builds on the work of the late political scientist Juan Linz, who in a pioneering 1990 article, \"The Perils of Presidentialism,\" argued that presidential systems encourage cults of personality, foster instability, and are especially bad for developing countries. Subsequent studies have bolstered Linz's insights, showing that presidential systems are more prone to corruption than parliamentary systems, more likely to suffer catastrophic breakdowns, and more likely to degenerate into autocracies. Buckley puts it succinctly: \"there are a good many more presidents-for-life than prime-ministers-for-life.\" Maybe what's exceptional about the United States, he suggests, is that for more than 200 years we've \"remained free while yet presidential.\"\n\nRelatively free, that is. The American presidency, with its vast regulatory and national security powers, is, Buckley argues, rapidly degenerating into the \"elective monarchy\" George Mason warned about at the Philadelphia Convention. Despite their parliamentary systems, our cousins in the Anglosphere also suffer from creeping \"Crown Government\": \"political power has been centralized in the executive branch of government in America, Britain, and Canada, like a virus that attacks different people, with different constitutions, in different countries at the same time.\"\n\nBut we've got it worse, thanks in large part to a system that makes us particularly susceptible to one-man rule. As Buckley sees it, \"presidentialism fosters the rise of Crown government\" in several distinct ways. Among them: It encourages executive messianism by making the head of government the head of state; it insulates the head of government from legislative accountability; and it makes him far harder to remove. On each of these points, The Once and Future King makes a compelling\u2014and compellingly readable\u2014case.\n\n\"The character of the presidency is such,\" the British journalist Henry Fairlie wrote in 1967, \"that the majority of the people can be persuaded to look to it for a kind of leadership which no politician, in my opinion, should be allowed, let alone invited, to give. 'If people want a sense of purpose,' [former British Prime Minister] Harold Macmillan once said to me, 'they should get it from their archbishops.'\"\n\nPresidential regimes invite executive dominance by combining the roles of \"head of state\" and \"head of government\" in one figure. \"As heads of government,\" Buckley writes, \"presidents are the most powerful officials in their countries. As heads of state, they are also their countries' ceremonial leaders,\" and claim \"the loyalty and respect of all patriots.\" Where parliamentary systems cleave off power from ceremony, presidential ones make the chief executive the living symbol of nationhood: the focal point of national hopes, dreams, fears\u2014and occasionally fantasies. In February 2009, author Judith Warner took to her New York Times blog to confess that \"The other night I dreamt of Barack Obama. He was taking a shower right when I needed to get into the bathroom to shave my legs.\" Warner's email inquiries revealed that \"many women\u2014not too surprisingly\u2014were dreaming about sex with the president.\"\n\nBuckley notes that \"Britons tend not to chat with David Cameron in their dreams,\" which presumably rules out soapy frolicking as well. Nor do Brits tend to look to the PM for a sense of national purpose or as a cure for spiritual \"malaise.\" Prime ministers are \"more likely to be figures of fun...or the butt of slanging matches during Question Period in the House of Commons.\" Indeed, the parliamentary practice of Prime Minister's Questions, in which the chief executive is regularly and ruthlessly grilled by the opposition, goes a long way toward explaining why there's no such thing as the Cult of the Prime Minister.\n\nPresidents can isolate themselves in a cocoon of sycophants, even putting protesters in \"Free-Speech Zones,\" where their signs can't offend the liege. And his role as head of state \"tends to make criticism of a president seem like lese-majeste\"\u2014as Justice Samuel Alito learned when he dared mouth the words \"not true\" while Obama pummelled the Court in his 2010 State of the Union.\n\n\"Thin-skinned and grandiose\" characters do better in presidential regimes, Buckley writes, whereas \"delusions of Gaullist grandeur are fatal for Prime Ministers.\" In the UK, they have to face the music in person every week. The aforementioned Harold Macmillan, British PM from 1957 to '63, admitted that the very prospect used to make him physically sick.\n\nThe PM's Question Time is but one facet of the superior executive accountability offered by parliamentary systems, Buckley argues. Such systems, he maintains, also do a better of restraining executives' proclivity for launching wars.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A conservative legal scholar's surprisingly convincing case against the Constitution.", "title": "The Presidency Has Turned Into an 'Elective Monarchy'", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/05/the-problem-is-the-presidency", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2014_07/buckleybook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2014_07/buckleybook.jpg", "description": "The Once and Future King: The Rise of Crown Government in\nAmerica, by F.H.
