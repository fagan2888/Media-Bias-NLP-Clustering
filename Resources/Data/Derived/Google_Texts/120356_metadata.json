The person becomes part of the health ecosystem of the community.\"Former Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who sat on the Senate Finance Committee when the Affordable Care Act was approved, told Bloomberg News he didn't remember the topic of using the health law to cover inmates coming up.\"It starts to look a little like a scheme by the states and local jurisdictions to avoid responsibilities that are really theirs,\" Conrad said.California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, and Ohio are reportedly signing up prisoners on the Obamacare exchanges, along with Montgomery County, Md.; Santa Fe County, N.M.; Cook County, Ill.; and Multnomah County, Ore.Beddoe said NACo is encouraging counties to use inmates' encounters with the justice system \"as an opportunity to get their lives turned around.\"These people tend to have \"messy chaotic lives,\" he said. \"They're not really form filler-outers.\"NACo, which represents 3,068 counties across America, is one of the \"Big 7\" state and local government lobbying groups, all of which push to expand the size and scope of government, conservative critics say.Production of NACo's March 2012 briefing booklet was funded by the left-wing Public Welfare Foundation, headquartered in Washington, D.C.That foundation acknowledged in a tax filing that it gave $62,000 in 2011 to NACo's charitable arm, the National Association of Counties Research Foundation, for an \"inmate health coverage\" project.A prominent member of the Public Welfare Foundation's board, nonprofit consultant Shirley Sagawa, served on President Barack Obama's transition team in 2008.The Public Welfare Foundation isn't the only grant-making institution funding groups that encourage states and local governments to sign up prisoners for Obamacare.Through his Open Society philanthropic network, left-wing financier and Obama donor George Soros gave money to Chicago-based Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC). TASC helped to set up Obamacare enrollment programs for prisoners at Chicago's Cook County Jail, one of the largest jails in the nation.According to the Daily Caller, Open Society gave TASC a $49,417 grant in 2012. TASC is also funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare,healthcare,prison,counties", "pubdate": "2014-03-05T14:50:55", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "At least six states and several local governments are signing up prison inmates on Obamacare exchanges after the National Association of Counties (NACo) began encouraging counties to shift some prisoner healthcare expenses onto federal taxpayers.", "title": "Association of Counties Pushes Obamacare for Prisoners", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Obamacare-healthcare-prison-counties/2014/03/05/id/556276/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Obamacare-healthcare-prison-counties/2014/03/05/id/556276/", "description": "At least six states and several local governments are signing up prison inmates on Obamacare exchanges after the National Association of Counties (NACo) began encouraging counties to shift some prisoner healthcare expenses onto federal taxpayers.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Association of Counties Pushes Obamacare for Prisoners"}, "epoch": 1394031055, "keywords": "Obamacare,healthcare,prison,counties", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-03-05T14:50:55"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Obamacare-healthcare-prison-counties/2014/03/05/id/556276/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "At least six states and several local governments are signing up prison inmates on Obamacare exchanges after the National Association of Counties (NACo) began encouraging counties to shift some prisoner healthcare expenses onto federal taxpayers."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef27\"", "article_summary": "\"When you are getting ready to put someone back on the street, that is a public health issue.\n\"But David Hogberg, a healthcare policy expert at the National Center for Public Policy Research, said putting prisoners into the Obamacare exchanges will drive up insurance premiums and hurt taxpayers.\nTASC helped to set up Obamacare enrollment programs for prisoners at Chicago's Cook County Jail, one of the largest jails in the nation.According to the Daily Caller, Open Society gave TASC a $49,417 grant in 2012.\n\"It just makes sense to get [prisoners] connected\" to health insurance, Beddoe said.\n\"Jail actually has been shown to be a very expensive place to keep people, and it makes their problems worse."}
