Fox News liberal commentator Juan Williams thinks conservatives are making “much ado about nothing” over MIT professor Jonathan Gruber‘s controversial remarks that the Affordable Care Act passed only because of a “lack of transparency” and “the stupidity of the American voter.”

Although he understood how the comments could be “insulting,” Williams insisted that all laws require some sort of clever packaging much like how corporations market products.

When Fox News Sunday host asked Williams if he thought the Gruber comments presented “nothing new” for the Obamacare debate, the former NPR reporter replied in the affirmative: “I would say it’s much ado about nothing with Gruber, except that the critics of Obamacare are having a field day.”

Contrary to Republican talking points, he continued, “the act is working,” and the GOP should be “celebrating” how the “uninsured rate in the country has dropped by 25 percent.”
