How did Vladimir Nabokov feel about Humbert Humbert, the pedophile narrator of his most famous novel? How does Brian DePalma feel about Al Pacino\u2019s Tony Montana (\u201cSay chhh-ello to my leetle frien\u2019\u201d) in \u201cScarface\u201d? For that matter, how did Howard Hawks feel about Paul Muni\u2019s Tony Camonte in the original 1932 \u201cScarface,\u201d which had to be released with a didactic prologue, a capital-punishment ending and an interpolated scene in which a group of newspapermen sit around talking about how bad the bad guys are? (I\u2019m deeply sorry for issuing a spoiler on a movie made 80 years ago.) Oh, and while we\u2019re on the subject, how do Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal feel about extraordinary rendition and torture? Are they more or less responsible for it than, say, Donald Rumsfeld?\n\nNow that I\u2019ve enraged nearly every possible reader, let me hasten to add that I\u2019m not suggesting that all these cases are the same. (Or that you\u2019re a hopeless Philistine if you find any of those works troubling.) I am saying that once you start interrogating the moral intentions behind art and culture, sooner or later you end up asking questions that don\u2019t have clear answers. I recently read an article or discussion online (which I now can\u2019t find) about Picasso\u2019s masterpiece \u201cGuernica,\u201d which raised the question of whether it was a great painting because it was an antiwar and anti-fascist painting, or whether that was an extraneous factor that made the audience feel virtuous about admiring the work\u2019s balance of careful design and explosive aesthetic innovation. Everyone\u2019s answer to that question will depend on his or her subject position and analytical perspective, but we can say a couple of things: It is clearly possible, God knows, to make bad art against war and fascism, and D.W. Griffith, Leni Riefenstahl and the Italian Futurists created good or great art that was informed by despicable politics. That said, does it really seem right to suggest that the power of \u201cGuernica\u201d has nothing to do with the political passion that we know, or believe, lay behind its creation?\n\nSome works of art come with explicit meanings attached and some don\u2019t, but meaning is an anarchic beast, a shape-shifter that never stays still, and the relationship between what books or movies or paintings \u201csay\u201d and how they affect us is never entirely clear. It\u2019s obviously prejudicial to compare Picasso\u2019s most famous painting to a brand new movie whose legacy is unknown, but let us note that \u201cGuernica\u201d drew mixed reviews and sparked heated debate on its 1937 unveiling; many leftists thought it lacked a clear political point of view. That\u2019s roughly where we find ourselves with \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d a deliriously and deliberately hyperbolic satire that has become, since its Christmas Day release, the latest litmus test of cultural politics. It has pitted feuding camps of film critics against each other, sometimes within the same publication: David Denby of the New Yorker was alternately nettled, bored and scandalized by \u201cWolf\u201d; after grousing that the movie is \u201ca bit of a trap for critics\u201d and that he may be considered squeamish for disliking it, he ultimately calls it \u201cdisgusting, obscene filmmaking.\u201d Richard Brody, the magazine\u2019s ultra-erudite film blogger, took an opposite tack, describing \u201cWolf\u201d as \u201can exuberant, hyper-energized riot\u201d and perhaps Scorsese\u2019s crowning masterpiece. (Yes, the world of New York film criticism is very small, and I\u2019m on cordial terms with both of them.)\n\nIt supposedly got a banker-heavy preview audience in Manhattan\u2019s financial district \u2014 literally within sight of the Goldman Sachs trading floor \u2014 cheering at the \u201cwrong\u201d moments, including Belfort\u2019s raid of his secret cocaine stash (inside the sofa cushions) and his attempt to double-cross the FBI and federal prosecutors. In the other direction, \u201cWolf\u201d also sparked a brief but surprisingly intense backlash in the social-media universe, largely among people who I suspect had not seen it. Christina McDowell, whose father went to prison as a business associate and co-conspirator of Belfort\u2019s, published an Op-Ed in the LA Weekly directed at Scorsese and DiCaprio, accusing them of glamorizing Belfort\u2019s misdeeds, \u201cexacerbating our national obsession with wealth and status and glorifying greed and psychopathic behavior,\u201d sending a \u201cmisogynistic, ass-backwards message\u201d to younger male viewers, and being traitors to some unspecified liberal agenda. \u201cDid you think about the cultural message you\u2019d be sending when you decided to make this film?\u201d she asked, and I don\u2019t think that question is meant to be rhetorical.\n\nI won\u2019t pretend to be neutral on \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d which I think is a terrific film that will likely get better with repeat viewings, a Grand Guignol spectacle of absurd and often nightmarish excess that snorts cinema history the way Jordan Belfort snorted coke and whose intentions are, in fact, pretty clear. There are various ways to respond to McDowell\u2019s simplistic understanding of culture as politics, including the observation that \u201cMarty\u201d and \u201cLeo\u201d (as she addresses them) are not personally responsible for our national obsession with wealth or the misogynistic attitudes of white male stockbrokers in the 1990s. Forbes blogger and Salon contributor Scott Mendelson made the fascinating point (in a Facebook post) that some people seem more exercised about the depiction of Wall Street greed and excess in \u201cWolf,\u201d or by the depiction of torture in \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d than they were by the actual phenomena as they occurred in the real world. It\u2019s a peculiar testimonial to the power of culture, or perhaps a fulfillment of Guy Debord\u2019s vision of \u201cThe Society of the Spectacle,\u201d in which \u201call that was once directly lived has become mere representation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Does Scorsese's would-be masterpiece glorify greed and debauchery or attack them?
