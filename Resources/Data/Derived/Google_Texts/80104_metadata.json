They need to change,\u201d the president said.\n\nMr. Obama, who later spoke at Kenyatta University and did a radio interview, frequently cited America\u2019s past to make a point about progress during his address, a way of persuading Kenyans on issues of social consequence without singling them out.\n\nHe likened Kenyan progress on women\u2019s rights to the U.S.\u2019 evolution on the Confederate battle flag in the wake of a mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\u201cThe fact is it was a flag that flew over an army that fought to maintain a system of slavery and racial subjugation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we should understand our history, but we should also recognize that it sends a bad message to those who were liberated from slavery and oppression \u2026 Just because something is a tradition doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d\n\nHe also urged Kenyans to fight corruption, citing studies that show it costs Kenyans 250,000 jobs each year, as bribes replace honest pay.\n\nBut, he insisted, the problem isn\u2019t unique to Africa.\n\n\u201cMy hometown of Chicago was infamous for Al Capone and the mob and organized crime corrupting law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut what happened was that over time people got fed up, and leaders stood up and they said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to play that game anymore.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama on Sunday told the people of Kenya that equal treatment of women is a key recipe for success, saying so-called traditions of forced marriage, domestic assault and genital mutilation are \"holding you back.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama on Sunday told the people of Kenya that equal treatment of women is a key recipe for success, saying so-called traditions of forced marriage, domestic assault and genital mutilation are \u201cholding you back.\u201d", "title": "President Obama tells Kenyans success in 21st century requires fair treatment of women", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/26/president-obama-tells-kenyans-success-in-21st-cent/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/25/5520ee1c2a6338217d0f6a70670095f4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/25/5520ee1c2a6338217d0f6a70670095f4.jpg", "description": "President Obama on Sunday told the people of Kenya that equal treatment of women is a key recipe for success, saying so-called traditions of forced marriage, domestic assault and genital mutilation ar", "card": "summary", "title": "President Obama tells Kenyans success in 21st century requires fair tr"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy hometown of Chicago was infamous for Al Capone and the mob and organized crime corrupting law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\u201cThese traditions may date back centuries; they have no place in the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nPresident Obama on Sunday told the people of Kenya that equal treatment of women is a key recipe for success, saying so-called traditions of forced marriage, domestic assault and genital mutilation are \u201cholding you back\u201d and that failure to educate and employ women will doom their economy.\n\u201cTreating women and girls as second-class citizens, those are bad traditions.\n\u201cThe fact is it was a flag that flew over an army that fought to maintain a system of slavery and racial subjugation,\u201d he said."}
