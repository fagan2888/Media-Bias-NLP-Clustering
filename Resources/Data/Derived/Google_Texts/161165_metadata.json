She tosses up a volleyball and smacks a serve over a net.\n\nA dozen people, laughing, keep the ball airborne at Bell Street Park in East Palo Alto. The park sits right next to a freeway exit in a city that remains an important hub of gang activity, partly because it\u2019s an easy stop-off point for buying and selling drugs.\n\nBut the park\u2019s visibility may also be a reason why these volleyball games have helped reduce shootings in the area, according to a new report from UC Berkeley\u2019s Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy. These are not just pickup games, but part of East Palo Alto\u2019s \u201cFIT Zones.\u201d The acronym is short for \u201cFitness Improvement Training,\u201d but the program is equal parts community building and public health.\n\n\u201cI think people in the community can really appreciate us being out here making our city look like a livable place,\u201d said Kailahi, on the sidelines.\n\nIn 2012, the police department started FIT Zones in the places with the highest concentration of gunshots. Researchers had used data from ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection system, to select the sites.\n\n\u201cThe overall idea,\u201d said Melvin Gaines, who works for the City of East Palo Alto and has been with the project since it started, is for \u201cresidents to overwhelm the negative activities with positive things, so bad guys don\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nWith police officers providing security, community members began riding bikes, playing soccer and volleyball, and taking free nutrition classes from the staff of a nearby health clinic. Participation grew over time, and today dozens of people show up three times a week at different East Palo Alto parks.\n\nWhere Shootings Are Down\n\n\u201cWe found that there was a statistically significant decline in shootings after the introduction of FIT Zones,\u201d said report co-author Sarah Lawrence, with the UC Berkeley Law School\u2019s Warren Institute. \u201cThere is a huge potential for this type of initiative.\u201d\n\nWhen Lawrence and her colleagues compared FIT zone sites to neighborhoods with similar demographics over 17 months, they found that shootings were at least 27 percent lower in the FIT zones.\n\nBut the shooting reduction was not uniform at the two sites. Shootings decreased significantly around one site \u2014 Jack Farrell Park \u2014 but there was not a significant reduction around the other site, Martin Luther King, Jr. Park.\n\nThe study does not explain why FIT Zones worked only in one place, but Lawrence said the parks\u2019 locations within their respective neighborhoods may have made a difference. Jack Farrell is central and visible, so anyone walking by could see cops and kids playing together.\n\nMLK Park, by contrast, is so hidden that the city has put up a half-dozen signs with arrows leading visitors through the neighborhood to the park. The entrance is at the end of a cul-de-sac, and most of the park faces the San Francisco Bay. That makes it harder for residents to notice that more people, and police, are using the park.\n\nPublic Health Approach\n\nFit Zones are about reducing shootings, but also about improving health.\n\n\u201cWe know that communities like East Palo Alto suffer from high chronic disease rates as well as high crime,\u201d said Gaines. \u201cAssuming people are less active in East Palo Alto out of fear, we asked, \u2018Can we do something that addresses both?\u2019 And the answer was Fit Zones.\u201d\n\nLawrence credits the city\u2019s police chief at the time, Ron Davis, for implementing the program. Davis thought \u201cthe police department had a role to play in the health of residents,\u201d said Lawrence. \u201cHe is a visionary guy.\u201d\n\nIn East Palo Alto, shootings are down, and people at Bell Street Park said that a safe place to play has helped them improve their own health. A 14-year-old girl named Paluteia was playing volleyball after rock-band practice.\n\n\u201cA lot of my family is overweight,\u201d she said, but \u201cseeing other people work out, it\u2019s motivating. I can do more, and there are other people who will do it with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I started, I was 397 pounds,\u201d said Smokey, another regular. \u201cI weighed myself last Saturday, and I was 332 pounds.\u201d\n\nOverall, health indicators are much worse in East Palo Alto than in the surrounding affluent cities. Life expectancy is 62 years \u2014 13 years less than the San Mateo County average. Half of all kids in East Palo Alto are overweight or obese, compared with 34 percent in the rest of the county.\n\nChanging Relationship Between Cops and Community\n\nFor some, FIT Zones are an opportunity to interact differently with police in a community where mistrust is common.\n\n\u201cIn a dark place,\u201d said Kailahi, \u201cI could be scared of them, and they could be scared of me \u2014 we don\u2019t know each other. But we\u2019re in the light, we\u2019re saying hello.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just like regular people. They come play games, they mess up, they do good,\u201d said Carl Mitchell, a high school student. \u201cAt least while they\u2019re here, they\u2019re acting good, let\u2019s say that.\u201d\n\nCops\u2019 attitudes may also be changing. \u201cI\u2019ve really seen a shift in the police officers\u2019 perspective,\u201d said Lawrence. When the program started, she interviewed participating cops. \u201cI asked why they were doing it, and quite frankly a lot of them said, \u2018I\u2019m getting paid to exercise.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Lawrence, \u201cthose same officers are saying, \u2018These are my kids,\u2019 and really taking ownership.\u201d\n\nBrian Lee, an East Palo Alto police officer, struck up a conversation with a 5-year-old boy who was poking at a dead opossum during a FIT Zone event. As they were chatting, Lee realized, \u201cI knew his dad from the streets. He was a known drug dealer.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s father had been murdered on Michigan Avenue, next to Jack Farrell Park, the same block where Lee and the boy now both ride bikes.\n\n\u201cI had personally taken his dad\u2019s homicide report,\u201d Lee says.\n\nLee has his own kids, so he could appreciate how sharp the boy was for his age, how bright a future he could have, given a chance. \u201cImagining this child\u2019s future,\u201d Lee says, was \u201cone of the most powerful things I\u2019ve felt.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Innovative program helps turn park in neighborhood of high gunfire into home for volleyball and soccer players.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Gunfire Down in East Palo Alto Thanks to ...
