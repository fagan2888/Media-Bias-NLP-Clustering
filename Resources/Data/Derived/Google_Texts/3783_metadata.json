At Edinburgh University, 22-year-old Imogen Wilson received a complaint that she violated the cupcake guidelines to authoritarianism school\u2019s safe space regulations because of inappropriate hand gestures. No, she didn\u2019t give the middle finger, though I wouldn\u2019t blame her for doing so in this instance; she simply raised her hand while questioning her school's possible involvement in the virulently anti-Semitic (and anti-Israel) Boycott, Disinvestment, and Sanctions movement (BDS) at a student council meeting. Wilson is the vice president for academic affairs for the Edinburgh University Students\u2019 Association, according to the Telegraph. What transpired afterwards was nothing short of madness, with complaints being lobbed at her for simply shaking her head in disagreement (via Telegraph):\n\nMs Wilson, 22, was subject to a \u201csafe space complaint\u201d over her supposedly \u201cinappropriate hand gestures\u201d during a student council meeting. According to the association\u2019s rules, student council meetings should be held in a \u201csafe space environment\u201d, defined as \u201ca space which is welcoming and safe and includes the prohibition of discriminatory language and actions\u201d. This includes \u201crefraining from hand gestures which denote disagreement\u201d, or \u201cin any other way indicating disagreement with a point or points being made\u201d. \u201cDisagreements should only be evident through the normal course of debate,\u201d it says. Ms Wilson said she raised her arms in disagreement after being accused by another speaker of failing to respond to an open letter, despite in fact having made efforts to contact the letter\u2019s authors. A complaint was made against Ms Wilson, who was then subjected to a vote on whether she should be removed from the room. Although the vote went in her favour, with 18 people voting to remove her and 33 voting for her to be allowed to remain, she was later threatened with another complaint after shaking her head while someone was speaking. [\u2026] She said: \u201cAt that meeting we were discussing BDS, the movement to boycott Israel. I made a long and passionate speech against us subscribing to this, on the basis it encourages anti-Semitism on campus. It was only after I made that speech that someone made a safe space complaint. I can\u2019t help but think it was a political move against me.\n\nMaybe people should be less concerned with my arm movements and more concerned that EUSA just passed policy to support BDS. \u2014 Imo Wilson EUSA VPAA (@eusavpaa) April 1, 2016\n\nOh, it was definitely political, Ms. Wilson. Anything that goes against the progressive ethos is an act of triggering that sends members of the far left into an emotional frenzy that\u2019s hilarious, entertaining, but also annoyingly tragicomic. It\u2019s a dangerous cocktail that could place anyone in the crosshairs of harassment for simply holding opinions that are (gasp!) different. Oh, and the school did pass a policy that supports BDS, according to Wilson\u2019s Twitter account. I say, keep fighting the good fight in Edinburgh, Wilson. Or shall we call it Oceania?\n\nOver here, we're still dealing with liberal college students having conniption fits over chalk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uh, what?!.05/26/2016 18:08:40PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Uh, what?!", "title": "Pure Insanity: Student Violated Safe Space Rules Because She Raised Her Hand", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/04/pure-insanity-student-violated-safe-space-rules-because-she-raised-her-hand-n2143102", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/4/1.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Uh, what?!", "title": "Pure Insanity: Student Violated Safe Space Rules Because She Raised Her Hand", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/04/pure-insanity-student-violated-safe-space-rules-because-she-raised-her-hand-n2143102", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/4/1.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Pure Insanity: Student Violated Safe Space Rules Because She Raised Her Hand , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "It was only after I made that speech that someone made a safe space complaint.\nAccording to the association\u2019s rules, student council meetings should be held in a \u201csafe space environment\u201d, defined as \u201ca space which is welcoming and safe and includes the prohibition of discriminatory language and actions\u201d.\nAt Edinburgh University, 22-year-old Imogen Wilson received a complaint that she violated the cupcake guidelines to authoritarianism school\u2019s safe space regulations because of inappropriate hand gestures.\nThis includes \u201crefraining from hand gestures which denote disagreement\u201d, or \u201cin any other way indicating disagreement with a point or points being made\u201d.\nWilson is the vice president for academic affairs for the Edinburgh University Students\u2019 Association, according to the Telegraph."}
