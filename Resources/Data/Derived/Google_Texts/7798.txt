The Affordable Care Act has lowered the number of people without health insurance throughout Michigan, based on data recently released by the U.S. Census Bureau.

About 8.5 percent of Michigan residents lacked coverage in 2014, the first year that the major changes of the Affordable Care Act took effect. That compares to 11 percent who were uninsured in 2013, before the expansion of Medicaid and the availability of subsidized insurance through the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov.

The law's impact was concentrated among adults age 18 to 64 â€” the population too young for Medicare and too old for MiChild, a government health-insurance program for children.

Database: Percent of uninsured by county

In 2013, 16 percent of Michiganders age 18 to 64 were uninsured. In 2014, that dropped to 12.3 percent.

By comparison, the percentage of uninsured Michiganders under age 18 dropped from 4 to 3.8 percent, and the percentage of uninsured senior citizens dropped from 0.5 to 0.3 percent.

The database here provides the Census Bureau's county-level data for the 29 Michigan counties with at least 65,000 residents, which was the Census Bureau's cutoff for this data release.

The numbers come from the Census Bureau's 2014 American Community Survey, and reflects the insurance status of respondents at the time they completed the survey.
