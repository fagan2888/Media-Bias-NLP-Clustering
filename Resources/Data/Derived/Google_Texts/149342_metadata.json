Hood: President Obama attends yet another memorial service for a shooting at Ft. Hood Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET. He delivers remarks at 3:35 p.m. ET. (Obama was already scheduled to be in Texas for fundraising events in Houston Wednesday night and to speak Thursday at the LBJ Library commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights bill.) This is at least the 15th time the president has delivered remarks following a tragedy in just five years as president. A look back: Oklahoma tornadoes (May 2013), Boston bombing (April 2013), Texas fertilizer plant explosion (April 2013), Newtown shootings twice (Dec. 2012), Superstorm Sandy (Nov. 2012), Wisconsin Sikh Temple (Aug. 2012), Aurora, Colo., shootings twice (July 2012), Joplin, Mo., tornado twice (May 2011, 2012), Tucson shootings/Gabby Giffords (Jan. 2011), BP aftermath (June 2010), Ft. Hood (Nov. 2009). Here\u2019s part of what he said the first time he spoke at a Ft. Hood memorial service: \u201cLong after they are laid to rest \u2014 when the fighting has finished, and our nation has endured; when today\u2019s servicemen and women are veterans, and their children have grown \u2014 it will be said that this generation believed under the most trying of tests; believed in perseverance \u2014 not just when it was easy, but when it was hard; that they paid the price and bore the burden to secure this nation, and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all free peoples.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s tough words for Putin: Speaking of potential 2016 candidates, despite her \u201creset\u201d button for Russia, Hillary Clinton was on the speakers\u2019 circuit in the Bay Area in California and had some very tough words for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. She called him \u201ca tough guy with a thin skin\u201d and someone who \u201cwants to renew the Russian Empire, in as far as that is possible.\u201d She then said Putin \u201cwill go as far as he can go unless he is contained. I don\u2019t believe Putin will be satisfied with Crimea.\u201d Of course, HOW he would be contained is a different question, and that was not spelled out. She also reiterated on 2016, \u201cI am thinking about it. I\u2019m not going to make a decision for a while because I\u2019m actually enjoying my life.\u201d But THIS IS NOT NEWS. She has said this time and again. What she IS doing, however, in staking out a tough-sounding foreign policy that tells you more about her 2016 plans than anything she has said directly about 2016. That centrist/hawkish instinct, however, didn\u2019t help her in 2008. Of course, she wound up with a real primary. And \u2014 for now \u2014 she doesn\u2019t have one in 2016.\n\nTaking the bait on women? We wrote yesterday that Democrats were trying to make Republicans take the bait on women\u2019s issues. Well, Democrats are now highlighting comments by Mitch McConnell and Mike Huckabee. McConnell Tuesday took to the Senate floor in an effort to dismiss the Democratic narrative on women. But McConnell, the Republican Senate leader in a tough re-election fight against a woman, did so by calling it a \u201cbizarre obsession\u201d of Democrats and that \u201cDemocrats chose to ignore serious job creation ideas so they could blow a few kisses to their powerful pals on the left.\u201d Tuesday night in Iowa \u2014 yes, Iowa \u2014 Huckabee, the 2008 Hawkeye State winner said, per the Des Moines Register\u2019s Kathie Obradovich, that men like to go hunt and fish with other men while \u201cwomen like to go to the restroom with other women.\u201d This comes after Huckabee said in January that Democrats try to tell women \u201cthey cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government.\u201d The Paycheck Fairness Act is expected to come to the Senate floor Wednesday, but is unlikely to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster.\n\n2014 \u2013 Start watching those House races: It\u2019s early, and the House is unlikely to change hands this cycle. But (for some of us) House races can be the most fascinating ones to watch. Two of those races emerged over the last couple of days \u2014 both are competitive districts that will see A LOT of money, and involve \u201celite\u201d Democrats and military veteran Republicans. Colorado\u2019s sixth congressional district could be the most expensive House race in the country at $25 million (there are governors\u2019 races that won\u2019t see that kind of cash). And in New York\u2019s 19th congressional district in the Hudson Valley north of Manhattan, an enigmatic 27-year-old Democrat who is the husband of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (now editor of The New Republic) has already spent $700,000 of his husband\u2019s $700 million fortune. He\u2019s got big-name consultants and glossy campaign ads, but is nowhere to be found.\n\nLINE ITEMS\n\nTOP TWEETS\n\n\u201cI am not a rat.
