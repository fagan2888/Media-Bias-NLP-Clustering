Gary Herbert\u2019s (R) August order blocking $275,000 from Planned Parenthood\u2019s affiliate in Utah.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIndeed, these are the types of decisions that should be left to elected officials,\u201d Waddoups wrote, \u201cand not managed by the courts.\u201d\n\nHerbert said the federal funding that would have gone to Planned Parenthood will be redirected to 26 health agencies in the state in 49 locations, reports The Salt Lake Tribune.\n\nIn September Waddoups issued a temporary order blocking Herbert\u2019s decision to end the state\u2019s contract with Planned Parenthood. His latest ruling ends the temporary order while Planned Parenthood Association of Utah pursues its lawsuit against the state.\n\nThough a health official warned that Herbert\u2019s redirecting funds from Planned Parenthood to other health agencies would take services \u201cfrom women who would have been helped,\u201d Waddoups wrote the authority of the governor to act in the state\u2019s best interest overrides the potential that some women in Utah would have to go elsewhere to receive STD testing and sex education services instead of being helped at Planned Parenthood.\n\nFollowing the release of a series of videos exposing Planned Parenthood\u2019s apparent practice of selling the body parts of aborted babies on the open market, several states \u2013 including Utah \u2013 moved to end their contracts with the abortion business. With support from the Obama administration, however, Planned Parenthood has sued those states, claiming the videos were misleading while at the same time it also announced it would no longer accept payment for the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nWaddoups said the government is best served by avoiding the appearance of corruption. Utah, he said, can end agreements just as much as it can fire a state employee who associates with someone engaged in illegal activity.\n\nThe government, the judge wrote, in choosing to end its contract with Planned Parenthood, was \u201cacting as a decisionmaker, making subjective, individualized assessments about whether to continue the contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, the terms of the contracts gave the defendants full discretion and authority to continue them or terminate them at will,\u201d he added.\n\nAttorneys for Planned Parenthood Association of Utah argued in October that the affiliate had not participated in the discussions about the sale of fetal tissue in the videos, and that Herbert knew this but was motivated by his own political aspirations.\n\nWaddoups wrote, however, that even though the Utah group had not engaged in the sale of fetal tissue itself, it was affiliated with other Planned Parenthood groups \u201cthat have allegedly engaged in illegal conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiff has provided no case law to support its position that a contract cannot be terminated when a party associates with entities allegedly engaged in illegal conduct,\u201d he explained. \u201cAccordingly, the court finds no violation of the right of association.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is an ethically and legally challenged organization under investigation at every level,\u201d John Stemberger, Florida Family Policy Council president said in a statement to Breitbart News. \u201cThe videos show Planned Parenthood senior national leadership, not rogue affiliates, negotiating prices for baby body parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery state with publicly released audits of Planned Parenthood has found waste, abuse and potential fraud; and Planned Parenthood has failed to report sex abuse of minor girls in at least seven states,\u201d he added. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is not entitled to our taxpayer dollars anywhere.\u201d\n\nWaddoups continued that Planned Parenthood had failed to prove that Herbert\u2019s motivation for ending the organization\u2019s federal funding was his personal opposition to abortion.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the claim by Planned Parenthood that the organization\u2019s \u201cright to advocate for and perform abortions has been violated,\u201d Waddoups observed, \u201cNo federal or state funds may be used to perform abortions. The court therefore concludes termination of the contracts does not violate Plaintiff\u2019s right to advocate for or perform abortions.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in October, 2016 GOP contender Sen. Ted Cruz said state legislatures and governors needed to \u201cstand up and lead\u201d on defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cI encourage every state legislature and every governor to stand up and lead on Planned Parenthood,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cUnfortunately, Republican leadership in Washington is unwilling to lead and, indeed, it\u2019s Republican leadership who\u2019s joined with Barack Obama in leading the fight to preserve taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-led Congress failed to take a stand to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding in the recent $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill. The abortion business is now funded with taxpayer monies through most of 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups upheld Gov.
