Vitamin D provides us with some pretty essential things that manage our health, such as regulation of calcium, phosphorus absorption, strengthening of our bones and teeth, and even bolstering of the immune system.\n\nPlenty has also been written about something called Vitamin D deficiency, which is likely to occur in the northern hemisphere and in the winter months, where people don\u2019t get enough sunlight. But until now, researchers haven\u2019t been too urgent about vitamin D deficiency. For the most part, doctors often suggest that their patients spend 15 minutes a day in the sun during summer months, then supplement that with eating vitamin D-rich foods and even taking supplement pills.\n\nIn a new study, however, researchers from the U.S. and Canada state that vitamin D deficiency is a lot more widespread than previously thought, and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for the vitamin is 10 times lower than what we actually need. The researchers are challenging the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which are responsible for the RDA. In a paper published in Nutrients, the scientists state there\u2019s an error in the RDA and it should be fixed.\n\n\u201cThe error has broad implications for public health regarding disease prevention and achieving the stated goal of ensuring that the whole population has enough vitamin D to maintain bone health,\u201d Dr. Cederic Garland, an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego, and an author of the study, said in the press release.\n\nAccording to the current RDA, recommended vitamin D intake should be around 600 IU per day for kids and adults, and for older people aged 70 and over it should be about 800 IU per day. But the researchers note that this is only about one-tenth of what people should really be getting.\n\n\u201cCalculations by us and other researchers have shown that these doses are only about one-tenth those needed to cut incidence of disease related to vitamin D deficiency,\u201d Garland said in the press release. \u201cThis intake is well below the upper level specified by IOM as safe for teens and adults, 10,000 IU/day.\u201d\n\nThe health experts will likely argue over this until changes are made to the RDA, or perhaps it will stay the same. Regardless, you can take some steps to improve your chances against vitamin D deficiency. Get sunshine, eat a vitamin D-rich diet, purchase some vitamin D lamps or take supplements in order to boost your vitamin D levels.\n\nSource: Veugelers P, Ekwaru J. \u201cA Statistical Error in the Estimation of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for Vitamin D.\u201d Nutrients, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vitamin d, vitamin d deficiency", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers warn about vitamin D deficiency in a new study, noting that most people aren\u2019t getting enough of the essential vitamin that helps fight illness and bolsters our immune system.", "title": "Vitamin D Deficiency May Be More Widespread Than Previously Thought", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/we-need-more-sunshine-vitamin-vitamin-d-deficiency-may-be-more-widespread-previously-326546", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/21/sunbathing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers warn about vitamin D deficiency in a new study, noting that most people aren\u2019t getting enough of the essential vitamin that helps fight illness and bolsters our immune system.", "title": "Vitamin D Deficiency May Be More Widespread Than Previously Thought", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/we-need-more-sunshine-vitamin-vitamin-d-deficiency-may-be-more-widespread-previously-326546", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/21/sunbathing.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/21/sunbathing.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-03-21T17:04:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T17:51:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers warn about vitamin D deficiency in a new study, noting that most people aren\u2019t getting enough of the essential vitamin that helps fight illness and bolsters our immune system."}, "article_summary": "Get sunshine, eat a vitamin D-rich diet, purchase some vitamin D lamps or take supplements in order to boost your vitamin D levels.\nRegardless, you can take some steps to improve your chances against vitamin D deficiency.\nWe derive Vitamin D from the sun \u2014 which makes it hard for people living in cold climates to get proper amounts.\nBut until now, researchers haven\u2019t been too urgent about vitamin D deficiency.\nIn a new study, however, researchers from the U.S. and Canada state that vitamin D deficiency is a lot more widespread than previously thought, and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for the vitamin is 10 times lower than what we actually need."}
