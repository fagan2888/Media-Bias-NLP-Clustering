The two biggest drawbacks to freelancing are unaffordable health insurance (even with the Affordable Care Act) and not being able to file for unemployment benefits.\n\nIn this so-called gig economy, we desperately need safety nets. Freelancing is an incredibly difficult way to make a living. We not only work the gig, but unless we are fortunate enough to be successful, we are also constantly looking for work.\n\nSure we have our freedoms, like flexible schedules, but when work is scarce, life may become unmanageable. Freelancing can provide a good quality of life only if you\u2019re have enough work, and have money set aside for the slow times.\n\nNow that the number of people in the \u201cgig economy\u201d is growing fast enough for the politicians to pay attention to us, they also need to realize that not everyone is capable of being an entrepreneur. We need a single-payer health care system, access to unemployment benefits and a workable retirement plan.\n\nIf these measures are not carried out, many people will not be able to survive. If it weren\u2019t for the health insurance offered through my wife\u2019s full-time job, I would not be able to remain a freelancer.\n\nPHIL MEYEROWITZ\n\nMetuchen, N.J.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150918215321, "twitter": {"description": "A freelancer writes that he and his colleagues \u201cdesperately need safety nets.\u201d", "title": "Freelancing in the \u2018Gig\u2019 Economy", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/opinion/freelancing-in-the-gig-economy.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003902015"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/opinion/freelancing-in-the-gig-economy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003902015", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/opinion/freelancing-in-the-gig-economy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "The \u2018Gig\u2019 Economy", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 18, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Freelancing  Self-Employment and Independent Contracting,Unemployment Insurance,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Labor and Jobs", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A freelancer writes that he and his colleagues \u201cdesperately need safety nets.\u201d", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A freelancer writes that he and his colleagues \u201cdesperately need safety nets.\u201d", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-09-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Labor and Jobs", "published": "2015-09-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "19LWEBfreelance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150919004809, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/opinion/freelancing-in-the-gig-economy.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A freelancer writes that he and his colleagues \u201cdesperately need safety nets.\u201d", "title": "Freelancing in the \u2018Gig\u2019 Economy"}, "pdate": 20150918, "des": "Labor and Jobs", "articleid": 100000003902015, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Freelancing in the \u2018Gig\u2019 Economy", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "The two biggest drawbacks to freelancing are unaffordable health insurance (even with the Affordable Care Act) and not being able to file for unemployment benefits.\nIn this so-called gig economy, we desperately need safety nets.\nWe not only work the gig, but unless we are fortunate enough to be successful, we are also constantly looking for work.\nIf it weren\u2019t for the health insurance offered through my wife\u2019s full-time job, I would not be able to remain a freelancer.\nFreelancing can provide a good quality of life only if you\u2019re have enough work, and have money set aside for the slow times."}
