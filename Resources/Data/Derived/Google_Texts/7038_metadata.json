Paul vows to work hard every day to be our voice in Madison.\n\nPaul was raised in Wausau and lives in Sawyer County. With Scottish, German, Irish, Ojibwe and Oneida ancestors, he is a product of America's melting pot and the vision it holds.\n\nPaul served as adviser on Indian Affairs policy during Gov. Tony Earl's administration, developing policy with legislators for Indian and non-Indian communities, and he served as a liaison to the 11 federally recognized tribes. His resume includes a wide variety of public service experience.\n\nPaul's work in communications led to his decision to begin Indian Country Communications in 1987. ICC is one of the largest employers on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation in Sawyer County.\n\nPaul understands the needs of Wisconsin's small business entrepreneurs who work to turn good ideas into local jobs.\n\nPaul will work with businesses and farmers to support policies that bring people back to rural areas and rebuild thriving communities; 18 percent of family farms have disappeared in 10 years.\n\nPaul's vision for the people of the 29th Senate District is focused on the \"Es\": economy, education (supporting strong public schools that are the heart and soul of the community), environment \u2014 and on health.\n\nPaul DeMain's spirituality imbues him with a love for Mother Earth and her inhabitants. Paul's wisdom is needed in Madison as our Senator from the 29th District, knowing \"Wisconsin works best when Wisconsin works together.\"\n\nJoyce Luedke,\n\nRothschild\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2014/07/07/paul-demain-state-senate-wisconsin/12298999/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Because \"Wisconsin works best when Wisconsin works together.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Because \"Wisconsin works best when Wisconsin works together.\"", "title": "Letter: Paul DeMain for state Senate", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2014/07/07/paul-demain-state-senate-wisconsin/12298999/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Because \"Wisconsin works best when Wisconsin works together.\"", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/84bf9a8cdbacde838863f7c4c9a79795594d60a1/c=0-546-2178-2724&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2014/07/07/-wdhbrd05-22-2014herald1a00320140521imgpaulheadshotprefer11ok.jpg", "title": "Paul DeMain running for state Senate in Wisconsin", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "wisconsin, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc991d\"", "article_summary": "Paul DeMain for 29th Senate DistrictPaul DeMainEDITOR: \"Wisconsin works best when Wisconsin works together!\"\nPaul's wisdom is needed in Madison as our Senator from the 29th District, knowing \"Wisconsin works best when Wisconsin works together.\"\nis the vision of Paul DeMain, the Democratic candidate for the 29th Senate District, which covers all or part of Sawyer, Rusk, Taylor and Marathon counties.\nPaul's vision for the people of the 29th Senate District is focused on the \"Es\": economy, education (supporting strong public schools that are the heart and soul of the community), environment \u2014 and on health.\nPaul understands the needs of Wisconsin's small business entrepreneurs who work to turn good ideas into local jobs."}
