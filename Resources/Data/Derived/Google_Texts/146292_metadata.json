One day John Boehner was standing proudly by the pope; the next day he was a lame duck. It was an odd development, really, one that recalled Republican political operative Lee Atwater\u2019s reminder that in American politics \u201cperception is reality.\u201d\n\nFissures within the GOP certainly existed prior to the pontiff\u2019s uplifting journey to America, but it was astounding to see how the soothing words of a wildly popular pope exacerbated divisions between the Republican establishment and restive Tea Party conservatives. It should worry anyone who cares about the Party of Lincoln.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, incidentally, was one of four Americans Francis mentioned by name. The others were Martin Luther King Jr., Catholic activist and union organizer Dorothy Day, and pacifist Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk. As columnist Melinda Henneberger noted, \u201cthat is one lefty list.\u201d\n\nWithout even knowing that, a handful of congressional conservatives expressed prior misgivings about the pope\u2019s speech on the grounds that he\u2019s been talking a lot about global warming and the excesses of corporate capitalism. Rep. Paul Gosar, a Catholic Republican from Arizona , chose to boycott the pope\u2019s speech because he \u201cchooses to act and talk like a leftist politician.\u201d\n\nGosar\u2019s religious faith and roots in the church seem to run deep, so one shouldn\u2019t be dismissive of such remarks , but refusing to attend the pope\u2019s speech seemed petty. It also proved premature. Francis didn\u2019t even utter the words \u201cclimate change.\u201d Knowing his audience better than Congressman Gosar knew the head of his church, Francis instead inveighed against \u201cenvironmental deterioration\u201d caused by \u201chuman activity.\u201d Who can disagree with that?\n\nSpeaking in the U.S Capitol, the pope also did not call for open borders, but instead drew attention the plight of those who \u201care led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and their loved ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this not what we want for our own children?\u201d he added in a statement that could easily have come from Jeb Bush. Afterward, Sen. Ted Cruz, another of the 2016 presidential hopefuls, grudgingly lauded the pope\u2019s speech, which in itself is a minor miracle.\n\n\u201cIt inspired me to be a better person in my personal life,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cbut I didn't take a legislative mandate from it.\u201d\n\nTwo asides about Cruz\u2019s temperate response: First, inspiring his listeners is all the pope is trying to achieve. Second, Cruz\u2019s equanimity didn\u2019t last long. With the pope still on American soil\u2014he was at Ground Zero in New York\u2014Cruz greeted the news Boehner\u2019s resignation thusly:\n\n\u201cIf it is correct that the speaker, before he resigns, has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of this year, to fund Obamacare, to fund executive amnesty, to fund Planned Parenthood, to fund implementation of this Iran deal, and then presumably to land a cushy K Street job after joining with the Democrats to implement all of President Obama\u2019s priorities, that is not the behavior one would expect from a Republican speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a mouthful, but it\u2019s a fairly concise recitation of the Tea Party-fueled view of the speaker.\n\nA devout Catholic from a heartland congressional district in southern Ohio, Boehner is a longtime fiscal conservative and small government advocate who has worked for the pro-life cause all his political life. That\u2019s not enough in today\u2019s GOP. Boehner\u2019s problem is that he has other loyalties, namely to his church and to the House of Representatives. In this instance, those two loyalties dovetailed nicely. After listening to Francis urge members of Congress to live by the Golden Rule, Boehner told reporters, he went home and told his wife he was quitting Congress.\n\nHe was doing so, he explained Friday, as an act of fealty to the legislative branch of government. Amplifying on this sentiment, Boehner said he believes a speaker\u2019s first duty is to \u201cprotect the institution.\u201d Some three dozen Republican members, most of them elected in the 2010 Tea Party tsunami, disagree. They see a nation facing $18 trillion in debt, underfunded entitlement programs extending unchecked into the future, and a U.S. foreign policy in disarray \u2014 and believe that the institutions and politicians responsible for this mess should be held to account. To them, another partial government shutdown is a price worth paying.\n\nSo Boehner\u2019s loyalty to Congress wasn\u2019t enough to save his job, and probably cost him his job. He didn\u2019t look like a man who was leaving with any regrets. He looked like a guy who\u2019d figured out a way to keep the government running at least until he steps down. He also looked like someone who\u2019d fulfilled a quest. He spent 20 years trying to get a pope to speak to a joint session of Congress. Francis was the third one who\u2019d been invited at Boehner\u2019s instigation. He made the decision to quit, he suggested, after spending a brief moment alone with his holiness.\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, as Francis prefers to be called, took Boehner by the arm and thanked him for his work on behalf of underprivileged children.\n\n\u201cPray for me,\u201d Francis then asked.\n\n\u201cWho am I to pray for the pope?\u201d Boehner recalled. \u201cBut I did.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here in the nation\u2019s capital, where every statement, action, and gesture is viewed through a partisan prism, Pope Francis\u2019 three-day visit left Democrats gloating and Republicans...", "title": "The Pope's Words and the Speaker's Choice | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/09/27/the_popes_words_and_the_speakers_choice_128224.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/322205_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Here in the nation\u2019s capital, where every statement, action, and gesture is viewed through a partisan prism, Pope Francis\u2019 three-day visit left Democrats gloating and Republicans...", "title": "The Pope's Words and the Speaker's Choice | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "The Pope's Words and the Speaker's Choice | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Pope Francis,John Boehner,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd65cc\"", "article_summary": "Afterward, Sen.
