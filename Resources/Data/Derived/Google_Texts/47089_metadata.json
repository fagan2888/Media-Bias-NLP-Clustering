The drop to 115,890 from 150,769 has left paid enrollment below where it was a year ago.\n\nColorado\u2019s problems were surely exacerbated by its low-priced, non-profit CO-OP, Colorado HealthOP, going out of business. Customers who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies are paying 34% more catastrophic plans and 21% more for bronze than they did in 2015. The COOP covered 69,000 exchange members last year, but only 25,000 of its former customers had signed up by Jan. 1, the Denver Post reported. People who lost their plans were given until the end of February to enroll.\n\nColorado may be an outlier with its high percentage of unsubsidized customers, but combined enrollment is down 12% even in the other four states, not much better than last year\u2019s rate of attrition \u2014 and that was just the first quarter.\n\nEnrollment At 10 Million By Year-End?\n\nIn the final three quarters of 2015, national enrollment sank by nearly 14%, or 1.4 million, to 8.8 million, despite lax policies that allowed people to sign up midyear without documenting that they qualified for an exception, due to the loss of employer insurance, for example.\n\nA similar decline in the remainder of 2016 would bring national enrollment down to around 10 million at year\u2019s end.\n\nThe news reinforces concerns that the pool of paying ObamaCare customers remains too small to balance out the older, higher-cost group that has flocked to the exchanges. Such concerns will prompt UnitedHealth (UNH) to exit exchanges in all but a handful of the 34 states where they are now doing business, the company said this week.\n\nPremium Spike As Reinsurance Fades\n\nMeanwhile, Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of the America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans trade association, told Morning Consult that she expects premiums to jump even more this year than last year. While the Obama administration said the actual premium increase only amounted to 8% this year because people shopped for bargains, an IBD analysis revealed that the ObamaCare premium increase was 10% once one accounts for the influx of kids and the level of coverage selected.\n\nIn Virginia, the first state where insurers have filed their rate-hike plans for 2017, ObamaCare participants are asking for a nearly 18% premium hike, on average, an analysis by ACASignups.net finds.\n\nAnthem (ANTM), which had about 180,000 ObamaCare customers in the state in 2015, is seeking a 15.6% premium hike. One big reason for the increase is the phase-out of ObamaCare\u2019s temporary reinsurance program, which offsets part of the cost of the sickest patients. In 2015, Anthem\u2019s bottom line got a $65 million boost from the program, but that will go to zero in 2017.\n\nState ObamaCare Figures\n\nConnecticut\u2019s exchange enrollment fell from about 116,000 to 105,000, a drop of 9.2%, Arielle Levin Becker of the Connecticut Mirror reported.\n\nBecker, citing information released at a board meeting of the Connecticut exchange, reported that of the 18,800 customers who dropped out, 20% failed to provide required information; 53% didn\u2019t pay; 10% asked to have their plans canceled; and 12% shifted to Medicaid. Those exiting customers were partly offset by nearly 8,000 latecomers, more than one-third of whom lost Medicaid.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s MnSure exchange reported that paid enrollment (including small-business enrollment) stood at 76,505 in March, down 10.4% from 85,390 from early February.\n\nAlso of note in Minnesota is the lopsided demographics of the exchange: Just 20% of members are age 18 to 34, and 38% are age 55 to 64.\n\nAdam Cancryn of SNL Financial reported that Oklahoma enrollment stood at 123,371 at the end of February, which is down 15.1% from the 145,329 total reported by the Department of Health and Human Services as of Feb. 1.\n\nAs of the end of February, Washington state had lost 12% of the 200,691 customers who signed up, with 176,914 still active. Yet state data show that only 156,493 customers had submitted payment by the end of February, with other last-minute or post-open-enrollment shoppers facing their first due date in March, so it\u2019s likely that there will be more dropouts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 1 million ObamaCare exchange customers have likely dropped out since open enrollment ended on Feb. 1, updated state reports suggest.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "More than 1 million ObamaCare exchange customers have likely dropped out since open enrollment ended on Feb. 1, updated state reports suggest.
