Chuck Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, meanwhile, remain the only Democrats who have broken ranks and will vote with the (likely) unanimous Republican majority in favor of a resolution of disapproval of the deal.\n\n\n\nIn the House, a few more Democrats declared themselves against the deal, bringing the total up to 14.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nFor weeks, those counting votes have been watching for two numbers: 34 Senate Democrats (including independents Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine) and 43 House Democrats. In the Senate, getting the support of 34 members would be enough to block the upper chamber from overriding a presidential veto, and in the House, they can do the same as long as no more than 43 Democrats oppose the agreement.\n\n\n\nBut as support gains momentum in the Senate, the White House is hoping it could get the backing of 41 members -- which would prevent the upper chamber from passing the resolution of disapproval in the first place by blocking the bill from moving to the floor on the first procedural vote it faces.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are already bashing the suggestion of a filibuster, including outspoken freshman Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who made waves earlier this year by penning a letter to Iran\u2019s leaders that dismissed the negotiations.\n\n\n\n\"Harry Reid wants to deny the American people a voice entirely by blocking an up-or-down vote on this terrible deal,\" Cotton wrote in a statement. \"He is obstructing because he is scared. He knows that a majority of Americans and senators oppose this dangerous deal, and that its only chance for survival is if he and the president ram it down the throats of the American people.\"\n\n\n\nBut from the White House\u2019s perspective, a veto, which would be just the fifth in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, would demonstrate shaky commitment to upholding the U.S. end of the bargain. Preventing the disapproval resolution from passing at all, meanwhile, would send a much stronger signal to the world community.\n\nObama Seeks to Pacify Jewish Americans' Concerns\n\nObama Seeks to Pacify Jewish Americans' Concerns Andrew Harnik/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nIn a conversation about the Iran deal with representatives from two major American Jewish groups Friday, Obama sought to both keep pressure on undecided members of Congress while at the same time taking some of the heat out of the rhetoric.\n\n\n\nThe president devoted much of his time to dismantling the arguments that lawmakers have used in defense of their decision to oppose the deal, including that it allows Iran access to billions of dollars that have been frozen by sanctions and that parts of the agreement expire in a matter of years.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt that point, we really don\u2019t have options,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of flying blind.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter 15 years, he said, even if Iran decided to try to go for a bomb, the U.S. would have vast amounts of information gathered on its nuclear program to be able to effectively stop it.\n\n\n\nWhy it Matters:\n\n\n\nHow the deal would affect Israel, and Israeli leaders\u2019 strong opposition to it, has featured heavily in the debate, which has often strayed from the merits of the agreement and into emotional hyperbole, and both supporters and opponents of the agreement have been visciously attacked. The first question leveled at Obama seemingly referenced a speech in which he said \u201cmany of the same people who argued against the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran deal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAt no point have I ever suggested, for example, that somebody is a warmonger, meaning they want war,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have said \u2013 and this I don\u2019t apologize for \u2013 is that if this deal is rejected, if we do not have this mechanism that nuclear experts around the world have said is unprecedented and severely constrains Iran\u2019s program, then there have to be alternatives.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama acknowledged that both sides had stepped over the line, but said the attacks on supporters had been far more fierce. He also promised the disagreements between his administration and Israel would do no lasting damage to the close relationship between the two countries.\n\n\n\n\"Like all families, sometimes there are going to be disagreements,\" he said. \"And sometimes people get angrier about disagreements in families than with folks that aren't family.\"\n\nVirginia Shooting Won't Lead to New Gun Laws\n\nVirginia Shooting Won't Lead to New Gun Laws (Courtesy of WDBJ-TV via AP) What Happened:\n\n\n\nThe country awoke to the horrifying news Wednesday that two Virginia journalists had been fatally shot on live television, and later, that the man who pulled the trigger was their former colleague and he had filmed the shooting and posted it online.\n\n\n\nWDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, were interviewing local chamber of commerce director Vicky Parker when they were approached by the gunman, identified by police as Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, who had been fired from the station more than two years ago.\n\n\n\nWhy it Matters:\n\n\n\nIf it seems like gun tragedies seem to occur every week, that\u2019s because mass shootings have, in fact, increased from 1.1 times a year to 4.5 times a year since the 1970s, according to a report released earlier this month from the Congressional Research Service.\n\n\n\nEach time in recent years \u2013 from the attempted assassination of former Rep. Gabby Giffords that killed six others in 2011 to the nine worshipers left dead in Charleston this summer \u2013 Obama has called on Congress and the nation to have a serious dialogue on gun violence.\n\n\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have focused on ensuring that guns don't get in the hands of people with mental illnesses. And amid disclosures that Flanagan purchased the gun used in the attack legally despite apparent emotional problems, the debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.\n\nShutdown Drumbeat Continues Despite GOP Leaders' Efforts\n\nShutdown Drumbeat Continues Despite GOP Leaders' Efforts The Associated Press What Happened:\n\n\n\nDespite promises from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that there would be no government shutdown over funding this fall, conservatives have so far refused to back down from their insistence that Congress cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\nThe charge has been led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a presidential candidate and the senator who single-handedly engineered the 2013 government shutdown over funding to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be a decision of the president's and the president's alone whether he would veto funding for the federal government because of a commitment to ensuring taxpayer dollars continue to flow to what appears to be a national criminal organization,\u201d Cruz told religious leaders Tuesday.\n\n\n\nIn a revealing moment Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, exposed some of the leadership's frustrations with Cruz, calling him a \"jackass\" at a fundraiser in Colorado, according to the Daily Caller.\n\n\n\nWhy it Matters:\n\n\n\nCruz and other conservatives, including Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Jordan\u2019s House Freedom Caucus, will seek to shift the blame to Democrats and Obama for blocking any government funding legislation that includes measures to defund Planned Parenthood. But after the 2013 shutdown, voters overwhelmingly blamed Republicans for what they saw as party leadership allowing extreme ideas to take precedence over basic government functionality.\n\n\n\nAmid comments acknowledging the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans on Thursday, Obama took a moment to warn Republicans that budget shenanigans would come at a price, especially as the U.S. economy picks up steam.\n\n\n\n\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to do it anyways, so let\u2019s just do it without too much drama,\u201d Obama said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it without another round of threats to shut down the government. Let\u2019s not introduce unrelated partisan issues. Nobody gets to hold the American economy hostage over their own ideological demands.\u201d\n\nEPA's Expansion of Water Protections Blocked", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Child Nutrition Programs Could Be Left Behind by Congress", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The reauthorization of the popular legislation could be overshadowed by other bills on the docket.", "title": "Congress May Leave Child Nutrition Programs Behind", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/09/02/child-nutrition-programs-could-be-left-behind-by-congress", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c3/0a/a17e48a142018da49ff2587ca14e/150902-cafeteria-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The reauthorization of the popular legislation could be overshadowed by other bills on the docket.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Child Nutrition Programs Could Be Left Behind by Congress"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 2, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Gabrielle Levy,politics,children's health,children,diet and nutrition,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The reauthorization of the popular legislation could be overshadowed by other bills on the docket."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29a5\"", "article_summary": "Why It Matters:For weeks, those counting votes have been watching for two numbers: 34 Senate Democrats (including independents Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine) and 43 House Democrats.\nIn the House, a few more Democrats declared themselves against the deal, bringing the total up to 14.\n\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to do it anyways, so let\u2019s just do it without too much drama,\u201d Obama said.\nNobody gets to hold the American economy hostage over their own ideological demands.\u201dEPA's Expansion of Water Protections Blocked\nPreventing the disapproval resolution from passing at all, meanwhile, would send a much stronger signal to the world community."}
