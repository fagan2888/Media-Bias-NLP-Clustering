(Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser)Buy Photo\n\nArtur Davis will not be running for the Montgomery County Commission seat \u2013 at least not as a Democrat.\n\nDavis, the former Democratic Congressman turned Republican, went before the Executive Board of the State Democratic Executive Committee Friday to convince the 24 board members present to allow him to run for office as a Democratic candidate.\n\nFollowing the show cause hearing and private discussion, former Alabama Democratic Party Chairman Redding Pitt motioned for Davis to become a Democratic candidate.\n\nThe motion was flatly denied.\n\nPitt may not have been the only \u201cyes\u201d in the room, but if there was another, it could not be heard audibly.\n\nBoard chairwoman Nancy Worley said official roll call is not kept, and she couldn\u2019t hear if there was another vote in favor.\n\n\u201cI was next to Redding and heard him vote \u2018Yes,\u2019 but I can\u2019t tell you whether someone else voted softly or not,\u201d Worley said.\n\nIn short, Davis was seeking an exception to the Radney Rule.\n\nThe Radney Rule was implemented to prevent Republicans from easily switching parties. It states that a candidate can\u2019t have supported an opposing party in the past four years.\n\nHowever, Davis had never seen the board not approve a Republican so long as they came before the board for a hearing.\n\n\u201cThe board has to consider its history,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou have never denied any other candidate under this rule. That is a very powerful precedent.\u201d\n\nA former lawyer, his argument was based on precedent. Namely, Parker Griffith, Greg Griffin and William Shashy among numerous others.\n\nUltimately, however, Davis was found to have supported the Republican Party in 2012 and 2013.\n\nBoard members also said he spoke too much about previous candidates instead of himself.\n\nWhen the floor opened for questions, Grover Dunn said exactly that.\n\n\u201cYou have done a great job of telling us what other Democrats have done,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you personalize it?\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019 well-publicized comments at the 2012 Republican National Convention were the primary source of mistrust among the board members.\n\nHis inability to speak about himself and take accountability was another factor, according to Tuskegee Mayor Johnny Ford.\n\n\u201cYou have opened your door time after time to people who have opposed Democrats and people who have left the party,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis also said he turned down \u201ceasier and better\u201d political opportunities to be at the hearing.\n\n\u201cHe was not sincere,\u201d Ford said. \u201cHe was arrogant. He was trying to embarrass us into saying that we were treating him differently but in this business you have to stand on your own.\u201d\n\nFord took exception to Davis\u2019 documented attacks on President Barack Obama and Davis\u2019 record of voting against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHe indicated that he criticized the Democratic Party and acknowledged that he criticized President Obama and voted against the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAll of these kinds of things he admitted.\u201d\n\nFord went on to say that the decision was not personal, but politically, Davis cannot be trusted yet.\n\n\u201cWe will always be personal friends, but we are not political friends,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned his politics are not friendly. I wish him well in his future endeavors. You have to earn the trust of the people in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThe ruling does not mean Davis cannot be a Democrat.\n\nBarring a special election, however, he can\u2019t run for office as a Democrat until 2017, four years after his 2013 transgressions against the party.\n\nIn the meantime, Worley encouraged Davis to earn the trust of the party.\n\nThis vote does not mean Davis cannot be a Democrat if he so chooses. It just means he can\u2019t run as a Democrat.\n\n\u201cHe can be a Democrat. He can attend Democratic meetings. He can\u2019t run as a Democrat,\u201d Worley said. \u201cDemocrats would love to hear his voice on issues. I think he is extremely intelligent. He would certainly add much to the Democratic discussions.\u201d\n\nMontgomery County Democratic Chairwoman Dr. Tyna Davis agreed that the board needed time.\n\nThe Montgomery County Democratic Conference even unanimously voted to oppose Davis at the October 5 meeting, although Dr. Davis was not present.\n\nArtur Davis spoke well about the Democratic platform. He spoke of expanding Medicaid and reopening driver\u2019s license offices and raising the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cI have been with you on the issues that define the Democratic Party,\u201d Davis said.\n\nOverall, however, many board members \u2013 including Dr. Davis \u2013 said he needs to earn the trust of the party.\n\n\u201cI certainly hope that he does support our Democratic nominees and our Democratic causes,\u201d Dr. Davis said. \u201cWe want that kind of support, but it would be more evidence of his support for the party and it would be good for the Democrats to see him in action.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article said Davis was a Republican candidate for governor in Alabama in 2010. He was a Democrat and became Republican after losing to Democrat Ron Sparks in the primary.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1LyPDMe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Artur Davis will not be running for the Montgomery County Commission seat \u2013 at least not as a Democrat.", "og": {"site_name": "The Montgomery Advertiser", "description": "Artur Davis will not be running for the Montgomery County Commission seat \u2013 at least not as a Democrat.", "title": "Feeling blue: Democrats deny Artur Davis", "url": "http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2015/10/16/feeling-blue-democrats-deny-artur-davis/73932654/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/montgomeryadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Artur Davis will not be running for the Montgomery County Commission seat \u2013 at least not as a Democrat.", "title": "Feeling blue: Democrats deny Artur Davis", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/842965e2cb1b584e3341d344a3c421f69c210911/c=1139-0-2767-1628&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Montgomery/Montgomery/635806148392835126-artur04.jpg", "creator": "@mgmadvertiser", "site": "@mgmadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=790279910", "fb": {"app_id": 163677993677689}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Montgomery, Montgomery news, Artur Davis, Democratic Party, State Democratic Executive Council, Montgomery County Commission"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou have opened your door time after time to people who have opposed Democrats and people who have left the party,\u201d Davis said.\n\u201cI have been with you on the issues that define the Democratic Party,\u201d Davis said.\nThe Montgomery County Democratic Conference even unanimously voted to oppose Davis at the October 5 meeting, although Dr. Davis was not present.\n\u201cI certainly hope that he does support our Democratic nominees and our Democratic causes,\u201d Dr. Davis said.\nFollowing the show cause hearing and private discussion, former Alabama Democratic Party Chairman Redding Pitt motioned for Davis to become a Democratic candidate."}
