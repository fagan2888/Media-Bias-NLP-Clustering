Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.) has become a major obstacle to a new bipartisan Iran sanctions measure, according to multiple sources on Capitol Hill and in Florida.\n\nWasserman Schultz has broken with leading pro-Israel Democrats like New York Senator Chuck Schumer and New Jersey Senators Robert Menendez and Cory Booker, privately urging her fellow Democrats to follow the White House\u2019s lead by opposing a bipartisan House resolution backing new sanctions on Iran, according to multiple congressional sources close to the debate.\n\nThe Iran resolution fell apart in the final days of 2013 after House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) withdrew his support for it following a last minute lobbying campaign helmed by Wasserman Schultz, who sources identified as the \u201ckey Democrat\u201d leading the anti-sanctions charge.\n\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s backroom bid to kill the sanctions measure has angered some Democrats on Capitol Hill and in her hometown of South Florida.\n\n\u201cDebbie has been busy at home telling her constituents she is doing all she can to stop Iran, but in reality it appears she is busy behind the scenes working to scuttle bipartisan action to put increased sanctions pressure on Iran,\u201d said one Democrat on Capitol Hill who is closely tracking the Iran debate.\n\n\u201cEvery minute she is publicly silent, or working against bipartisan efforts to pressure Iran, is a minute she is siding with the Mullahs over the American people who overwhelmingly want mounting pressure,\u201d said the source, who asked for anonymity.\n\nSources inside Wasserman Schultz\u2019s heavily Jewish South Florida community say that the lawmaker\u2019s opposition to strengthened sanctions has become a \u201cproblematic position\u201d for her constituents.\n\nWasserman Schultz has become \u201cone of the two problems in Florida in regards to support for those sanctions,\u201d according to one South Florida Jewish community insider.\n\nThe other Democratic opponent is Rep. Alan Grayson (Fla.), according to the source.\n\nThe concern is so great that Jewish community leaders in South Florida scheduled a meeting with Wasserman Schultz for early this week, the insider said.\n\nThe South Florida Jewish community\u2019s concerns have reverberated in D.C., where senior Jewish community officials and others have been quietly expressing frustration over Wasserman Schultz\u2019s bid to kill the new sanctions measure.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s being very careful not to say anything publicly while working hard behind the scenes to jam up the legislation,\u201d said a D.C. Jewish community insider involved in the political debate over sanctions.\n\nSenior congressional aides working on Iran sanctions say that Wasserman Schultz\u2019s behind-the-scenes bid to stymie the Iran resolution has become problematic for bipartisan supporters of a robust sanctions regime.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking about it,\u201d said one senior Capitol Hill insider familiar with the sanctions negotiations. \u201cSources in the Jewish Federation network in Florida are saying this too; she\u2019s not been very helpful.\u201d\n\nWhile Wasserman Schultz has publicly talked tough on Iran, she is believed to have played a key role in pressuring Democratic Whip Hoyer to pull his support for the bipartisan resolution at the last minute.\n\nHoyer had been working with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.), and Reps. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) and Ed Royce (R., Calif.) to pass a last-minute resolution supporting increased sanctions on Tehran.\n\nThe measure was to act as a companion to a new Iran sanctions bill currently up for debate in Senate.\n\nThe White House opposes new sanctions and has enlisted Democratic allies to launch a full court congressional press that effectively killed the issue in 2013 and could hold up new measures well into 2014, according to insiders.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wasserman Schultz did not respond to a Washington Free Beacon request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breaks with Pro-Israel Democrats", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Rep.
