The $18 trillion national debt drew 4 minutes \u2014 and last but not least, IRS targeting of conservative groups got zero. None. No mention.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama releases Gitmo detainees determined to keep trying to kill Americans\n\n\u201cThe ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts failed to produce any coverage of the IRS scandal, even as the House committee investigating the matter introduced a resolution calling for the impeachment of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for his alleged failure to comply with committee subpoenas and making false statements under oath,\u201d the researchers say, adding that the networks did manage to produce 54 minutes of coverage about assault charges made against Bill Cosby, and 127 minutes on the \u201cDeflate Gate\u201d scandal surrounding New England Patriots\u2019 quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nWAYNE LAPIERRE\u2019S INVITATION TO PRESIDENT OBAMA\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ll meet you for a one on one, one-hour debate with a mutually agreed upon moderator on any network that will take it. No prescreened questions and no gas bag answers. Americans will judge for themselves who they trust and believe on this issue. You or the NRA? Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re game for a fair debate. It\u2019s your chance to show the American people that you\u2019re not afraid to meet the NRA on neutral ground.\n\nSEE ALSO: Carly Fiorina lashes out at Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton in bid to regain mojo\n\n\u2014 NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre\u2019s open invitation to President Obama for a 60-minute dialogue about guns, gun rights and policy.\n\nTHE TEA PARTY RIDES AGAIN\n\nRelations between the mighty GOP establishment and the tenacious tea party may be icy. But Republican presidential hopefuls are still ready to strut their stuff in authentic grass-roots territory \u2014 the three-day South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention in Myrtle Beach this weekend, where the theme is \u201cWhom do we TRUST to lead this nation?\u201d On hand: Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina and Rick Santorum \u2014 along with Sen. David Perdue and Reps. Mark Meadows and Jeff Duncan, plus 25 activists ranging from investigative videographer James O\u2019Keefe to Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin.\n\nThe presidential hopefuls, says convention organizer Joe Dugan, \u201cwill be given adequate, uninterrupted speaking time to explain their policies and vision. This will give them a chance to convince voters that they can be trusted to lead this nation in it\u2019s time of peril.\u201d\n\nWEEKEND CANDIDATE TRACKER\n\nThe presidential hopefuls are restless. Gov. Chris Christie spends the weekend in Iowa with seven events scheduled, including a visit to the Blue Bunny Ice Cream Museum in Le Mars. Sen. Marco Rubio has 10 town halls around the state, Ben Carson three. Donald Trump breezes in for a jumbo rally at the Living History Farm in Urbandale, then whisks eastward for the aforementioned South Carolina tea party gathering, and a \u201cNo BS BBQ\u201d in Portsmouth, New Hampshire with former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown.\n\nAlso in the Granite State: Sen. Rand Paul boasts four \u201cStand with Rand\u201d town halls and a Patriots football game watch party in a sports bar.
