There's no love lost between Jackie Mason and President Barack Obama.The legendary comedian on Sunday unleashed a verbal assault on Obama, calling him "a maniac in an asylum," as well as on Obamacare, saying the law is "ridiculous." The rant aired on"It's such a ridiculous thing," Mason said. "The whole country's walking around wondering if this guy's really the president of a country. He sounds more like a maniac in an asylum."Self-described as "the Ultimate Jew," Mason continued his radio rant."He's saying things that nobody believes. He was always lying every day of his life. Every time he talks, it was a lie. The only time he told the truth is when you didn't hear from him. This is becoming so ridiculous, that even the biggest liar can't top himself."He looks at you straight in the face and tells you that if you want your plan, you got your plan, you keep your plan. Now, a month and a half later, you got no plan, you lost your plan, and he tells you you still got a plan," the comedian said.Mason said Obama's lying is so prevalent it is grounds for relegating"A guy like this should be locked up . . . If he wasn't the president, he'd be in jail or in a sanitarium. He wouldn't be outside talking to people in this condition. He would be considered a danger to his own health, to his own life."The latest is that it's only 5 percent of the people, only 15, 20 million people, who are going to lose their plan . . . What if you shoot a guy? He's only one person out of 300 million. How come it's in the paper that you shot an innocent person and you go to jail for it? . . . Since when do you destroy people and it doesn't count because it's too small a percentage?"
