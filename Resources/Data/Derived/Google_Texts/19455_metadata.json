But on the downside, hearing their stories of censorship and control by school officials is cause for worry, if not despair.\n\nIt was especially disturbing to hear students describe how school administrators misuse their power of \u201cprior review\u201d to keep any hint of controversy out of the school paper. Not surprisingly, what is considered off-limits varies from region to region.\n\nIn one community, for example, school officials ban coverage of student religious clubs while permitting coverage of all other student clubs. But in a very different community, administrators instruct students not to report on LGBT issues because a few parents once complained about a profile of a gay student in the school paper.\n\nUnder current law, school officials may review what goes into school publications (although they aren\u2019t required by any law to do so). But they may not turn \u201cprior review\u201d into \u201cprior restraint\u201d with overly broad and vague restrictions on what student reporters may cover.\n\nUnfortunately, many public school administrators are either unfamiliar with the First Amendment \u2014 or simply ignore it.\n\nThe stories of school censorship I heard at the convention are consistent with trends I have seen around the country. A growing number of public schools restrict school newspapers (or shut them down entirely) and, in other ways, limit student political and religious speech.\n\nIt is both strange and troubling that in the \u201cland of the free\u201d so many school officials are afraid of freedom.\n\nHere\u2019s the irony: Schools that give students meaningful opportunities to exercise their First Amendment freedoms are safer, more successful learning environments than schools that treat students like prison inmates.\n\nIf we are serious about creating better schools, places with fewer discipline problems and higher academic achievement, then students must have a meaningful voice in shaping the life of the school.\n\nMy advice to the student journalists at the conference is the same advice I would give to any student attending a public high school that ignores or censors student speech:\n\n\u2022If your school newspaper is subject to prior review, start a campaign to end it. Prior review stifles freedom of the press and undermines the work of student journalists.\n\n\u2022If your school district doesn\u2019t protect First Amendment freedoms, petition the administration and the school board, organize rallies and speak out for policies that uphold religious liberty, freedom of speech, press, assembly and petition. Exercise your rights to make the case for freedom.\n\n\u2022If students aren\u2019t involved in decision-making at your school, seek student representation on school committees and the school board to ensure students are involved in decisions concerning school policies, culture and governance.\n\nGo home, speak out and stand up for freedom. Remind your administrators and school board members that a country committed to democracy and freedom needs schools committed to democracy and freedom.\n\nIn a free society that would remain free, schools must be our laboratories of freedom.\n\nCharles C.
