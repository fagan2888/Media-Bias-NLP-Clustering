Together, Burgos and a handful of people from the group, called the LIBRE Initiative, distributed boxes of food to parishioners in need, the majority of whom were Hispanic.\n\nIn Florida, the organization helps Latinos with tax-preparation services. In Nevada, the group is helping undocumented immigrants get their driver\u2019s authorization cards. The LIBRE Initiative, in short, is helping Latinos with the things regular people need help with.\n\nAnd it\u2019s alarming Democrats.\n\nLIBRE is a group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch. They\u2019ve been providing services and building meaningful relationships with Hispanics since 2011 in states like Nevada, Florida, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona \u2014 and they\u2019re doing this all while espousing conservative principles to a key demographic of voters in person, in print, and online.\n\nDemocrats from these key states are upset about it, too. They say LIBRE effectively misleads Hispanics on a whole host of issues. And they worry the national Democratic Party is asleep at the wheel, unaware that the group is winning a game most Democrats don\u2019t even know is being played.\n\n\u201cI brought the LIBRE Initiative up to party leaders and their response was \u2018What? Who?\u2019\u201d said one Democratic official who asked for anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cAt the national level they didn\u2019t know who they were.\u201d\n\nWho the Libre Initiative really is depends on who you\u2019re talking to.\n\nThe group says its nonpartisan, but right-leaning in ideology.\n\nIts executive director, Daniel Garza, is a former George W. Bush administration official, and the group employs other former Republican staffers and operatives. LIBRE has received $10 million since 2011 from Koch-affiliated entities (Freedom Partners and the TC4 Trust), according to public records. Garza told BuzzFeed News the funding is public information but the group doesn\u2019t talk about it \u2014 he prefers to focus on their principles and work.\n\nThat work spans seven states with 50 employees, primarily in the Southwest, with a major presence in Florida and plans to add 20 people and expand into North Carolina and Wisconsin next. Libre, which means \u2018free\u2019 in Spanish, guides the group\u2019s central focus on economic freedom.\n\nGarza says community building makes up the majority of Libre\u2019s work now ahead of the 2016 election, and that each region gets different services depending on what the community is asking for. That means that in Texas there might be more of an education focus with back to school efforts as well as giving food and helping the children at the border; Florida involves the tax prep and school choice events; and in Nevada \u2014 where the group is helping undocumented immigrants get their driver\u2019s authorization cards \u2014 immigration issues are the priority.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at whether someone is documented or not,\u201d Garza said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re active in supporting immigration reform.\u201d\n\nLIBRE\u2019s critics (and there are many, with the mere mention of the group leading to impassioned rants), say Nevada is the perfect case study, showcasing the gulf between their words and actions on immigration, in a state where those issues play a key role in the economy.\n\nWhile LIBRE helps immigrants pass their driver\u2019s tests, which helps them get to work, Democrats and Latino advocates say the group is silent when it comes to Republican-led legislation in Nevada that would make it harder for immigrants to live in the state.\n\nOne such bill in the assembly, AB 133, introduced by state Assemblyman Ira Hansen, would make it more difficult for undocumented immigrants to work in construction by penalizing their employers. Critics say if LIBRE really has the best interest of Nevada immigrants at heart, they would fight legislation like this. Garza said the group has limited resources but doesn\u2019t rule out taking on Republicans. He noted they\u2019ve already slammed Marco Rubio over sugar subsidies, for example.\n\nLIBRE is also hammered for the way they explain their stance on Obama\u2019s immigration actions. Garza said the \u201ctrain has left the station\u201d on the president\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \u2014 the program has been implemented and young people are benefitting from it, he argued. But he feels differently about the recent executive actions that would shield 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not against the intent of the executive actions but when there is executive overreach we support reigning it in,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see why people are confused about our position, it has more to do with President Barack Obama than us and the ineptitude he has shown in getting permanent bipartisan immigration reform.\u201d\n\nGarza said it might be tough for undocumented immigrants to accept that argument, but it\u2019s fundamental to America. \u201cAt the end of the day you came to America because America gives you stability, gives you rule of law, and it has that because it was founded on constitutional principles,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the president exceeds his authority, it\u2019s against the will of the people, Congress in this case. He should be called on it, I know that\u2019s tough for people to buy.\u201d\n\nDemocrats find it tough to buy. Lucy Flores, a Democrat who ran for lieutenant governor in Nevada in 2014, said the organization speaks out of both sides of their mouth.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about why executive action is bad and then turn back around and help them with the immigration process. You can\u2019t say you\u2019re helping Latinos and then be silent,\u201d she said.\n\nFlores tangled recently with LIBRE, when the group was doing exactly the kind of thing that worries Democrats: LIBRE had planned to be a top sponsor of the Cesar Chavez Festival in Las Vegas later this month.\n\nThat decision sparked a protest from local activists and lawmakers. When the flier with the LIBRE Initiative logo came out, five groups and local councilman Isaac Barron reached out to event organizers. Barron said he either wanted his name off the flier or LIBRE\u2019s.\n\nIt got so serious that Alejandro Chavez \u2014 a grandson of Cesar Chavez\u2019s \u2014 got involved, telling organizers, \u201cIt would be a disrespect to the family because LIBRE Initiative do not represent what Cesar Chavez fought for, he was a union leader and they do anti-union and anti-collective bargaining messaging.\u201d\n\nThe festival dropped LIBRE from the event\u2019s sponsors.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it\u2019s not just the executive actions or labor issues that Democrats take issue with. Democrats don\u2019t like the group\u2019s opposition to Obamacare or their willingness to advocate against Latino candidates with whom they disagree.\n\nIn 2014, LIBRE spent $1.4 million in two separate ad buys taking on Democratic candidates for their support of the Affordable Care Act. One ad buy targeted Pete Gallego in Texas and Joe Garcia in Florida, who both lost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that an organization that claims to support the Latino community is attacking Latino candidates,\u201d said Labor Council For Latin American Advancement president Hector Sanchez, who works to increase Latino representation in government. \u201cWe are the most underrepresented group when it comes to public office, to have them going after Latino candidates is an attack on the Latino community.\u201d\n\nIn Garcia\u2019s race, LIBRE backed Carlos Curbelo, who is also Latino.\n\nGarza said that all things being equal it would be great to have more Latino elected leaders \u2014 but maintained that ideological principles matter. \u201cThe problem is ideas have consequences, ideas matter. If it\u2019s a non-Latino who has better ideas we\u2019re going to support them. What we care about is principles, what is generating poverty and dependency, we want self-reliance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his group doesn\u2019t want to keep health care from Latinos, but wants to move away from a system where \u201cgovernment mandates the individual.\u201d He said support for Obamacare among Latinos has dropped in a major way.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in 2014, Pew reported Hispanic support had decreased from 61% to 47% in six months. Last month, though, Pew said that number was back up to 63%.\n\n\u201cYou can call it freedom but it\u2019s really freedom to exploit,\u201d said Crist\u00f3bal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Project, a fundraising effort that supports Democratic candidates. \u201cLatinos benefit more than any demographic, they have the highest number of uninsured.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, uninsured Latinos dropped from 36% of the population to 23%, though Latino enrollment in the ACA is said to be lagging. Pew told BuzzFeed News updated numbers won\u2019t be available until this September.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3722532, "userid": 741910}, "description": "The Libre Initiative helps immigrants learn to drive in Nevada, does food banks in Texas and holds free health clinics in Florida.
