When it came to voting in the 2014 elections, Tennessee voters weren’t flocking to the polls, according to a Nonprofit VOTE report.

Tennessee ranked as the fourth-worst state for voter turnout during the past election season in Nonprofit VOTE’s “America Goes to the Polls 2014” report. In fact barely more than a quarter — 29.1 percent — of the Volunteer State actually voted.

The state showed a small improvement from the 2010 elections when it was the third-worst state.

The only states (including the District of Columbia) that ranked worse than Tennessee were New York at No. 49, Texas at No. 50 and Indiana at No. 51. The best three states for voter turnout were Colorado, Wisconsin and Maine, which all had more than 50 percent of residents casting votes.
