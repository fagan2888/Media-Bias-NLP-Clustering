Under the law\u2019s individual mandate, almost all Americans are required to have insurance or face a penalty, which is due when their income taxes are paid.\n\nWhen it became apparent in recent months that athletes could face penalties for the 2014 tax year for having inadequate coverage \u2014 through no fault of their own \u2014 federal health officials decided to grant exemptions to all affected athletes who apply, according to federal health officials.\n\nChris Barnes bowls during Day 11 of the XVI Pan American Games at the Tapatio Bowling Alley in Guadalajara, Mexico. (Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nAthletes were informed about the potential problem by the USOC, and many of them have filed and received an exemption.\n\nJason Young, 33, a discus thrower who was on the 2012 Olympic team and insured through the program for part of last year, has already received his exemption, he said.\n\nFor the 2014 tax year, the penalty is 1 percent of yearly household income or $95 per adult, whichever is greater.\n\n[Few have sought exemption from the tax penalty]\n\n\u201cWe are providing a limited exemption to enrollees for the months they were covered by this plan in 2014,\u201d said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in a statement Friday, referring to the athletes. He noted that the athletes were not to blame and that the USOC is working to meet the federal law\u2019s requirements for 2015.\n\nUnder the law, health plans in the individual and group markets must meet certain minimum requirements, including limits on out-of-pocket costs. The plans are required to provide a specific set of benefits, including prescription drug coverage and preventive services, and are barred from having lifetime and annual caps on benefits.\n\nBut the USOC plan has a $25,000 deductible for sports injuries and a $7,500 lifetime cap on hospice care. Its out-of-pocket maximum does not include prescription drugs and outpatient professional physical medicine, according to a copy of the program benefits provided by the USOC. (A sport\u2019s national governing body pays the first $25,000 for sports injuries; the insurance policy is a taxable benefit.)\n\nAthletes see doctors and trainers at a greater rate than the average consumer because even a minor health problem can affect performance, sports medicine experts have said.\n\n[NFL rising star says head injury worries prompted retirement at 24]\n\nThe health plan, known as the Elite Athlete Health Insurance Program, is a medical insurance plan offered only to TeamUSA\u2019s top athletes and their dependents. Athletes have to qualify annually for the coverage based on their performance. The plan is similar to coverage offered through employers. Policies are divided among the national governing bodies for individual sports. About 900 athletes and 200 dependents are currently enrolled.\n\nA spokesman for the USOC said the organization learned early this year that it needed to make changes to the health plan.\n\nAccording to a person involved in the federal exemption process, some athletes initially had their applications denied. That prompted USOC executives to complain to administration officials, and about a month ago, CMS officials directed that \u201chigh priority\u201d be given to the athletes, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to talk publicly about the program.\n\nUSOC spokesman Mark Jones said in a statement that although the insurance program provides \u201cgenerous benefits at extremely affordable rates for athletes, certain technical changes needed to be made in order for the plan design to be compliant with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d He did not provide specifics.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work with our partners in the government to ensure that is the case moving forward, while working with athletes to ensure they have substantial input to the kind of insurance that is most beneficial to their needs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe athletes are not the only people eligible for exemptions from the tax penalty. Others include people who had insurance through AmeriCorps, recently experienced domestic violence, filed for bankruptcy in the past six months or had incomes below a certain threshold.\n\n\u201cA lot of what the health law tried to do was rein in an in\u00adcred\u00adibly complicated health system and put some standards on coverage that really never existed,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nYoung, the discus thrower, had coverage under the elite athlete plan, starting in 2011. After he was injured in 2013, he no longer qualified for the program and was dropped in April of last year, he said.\n\nChris Barnes, 45, a professional bowler, has been on the USOC health plan for about a year. (Professionals are allowed to compete on the U.S. national team in bowling; the top two athletes in bowling qualify for USOC insurance.)\n\nHe has qualified for a second year of coverage that includes his wife and twin sons. The plan provides more generous medical coverage than his family\u2019s former plan. That plan left the family with large medical bills resulting from his son\u2019s diabetes.\n\nBarnes filed a hardship exemption about five or six weeks ago. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a final determination yet,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 900 athletes are eligible to receive exemptions through the program to avoid tax penalties.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "About 900 athletes are eligible to receive exemptions through the program to avoid tax penalties.", "title": "Olympic athletes\u2019 health plan fails to meet Affordable Care Act rules", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/olympic-athletes-health-plan-fails-to-meet-affordable-care-act-rules/2015/04/11/e78be924-dfa4-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/10/Health-Environment-Science/Images/149903932.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bylenasun"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/olympic-athletes-health-plan-fails-to-meet-affordable-care-act-rules/2015/04/11/e78be924-dfa4-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, Obamacare, Olympics, athletes, Affordable Care Act, health insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90"}, "news_keywords": "health, Obamacare, Olympics, athletes, Affordable Care Act, health insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "e78be924-dfa4-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf83a\"", "article_summary": "Olympic athletes\u2019 health plan fails to meet Affordable Care Act rulesIt might seem like common sense that top U.S. Olympic athletes would have excellent health insurance to cover potentially serious injuries and illnesses.\nBut it turns out that the health plan for about 900 elite athletes \u2014 provided through the U.S. Olympic Committee \u2014 fails to meet minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\nChris Barnes, 45, a professional bowler, has been on the USOC health plan for about a year.\nBut the USOC plan has a $25,000 deductible for sports injuries and a $7,500 lifetime cap on hospice care.\n[NFL rising star says head injury worries prompted retirement at 24]The health plan, known as the Elite Athlete Health Insurance Program, is a medical insurance plan offered only to TeamUSA\u2019s top athletes and their dependents."}
