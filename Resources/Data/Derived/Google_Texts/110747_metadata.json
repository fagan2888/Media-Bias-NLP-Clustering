There it rests. Solar cycle midpoint achieved.\n\nNow it starts over again, on the downhill of the 22-year solar cycle. Polarity flips roughly every 11 years, NASA tells us, which is what defines the solar cycle. This officially puts us at the midpoint of Solar Cycle 24, reported The Independent. The full 22-year cycle, in which the poles flip back again to their original positions, is depicted below.\n\n\u201cThis visualization shows the position of the sun's magnetic fields from January 1997 to December 2013,\u201d NASA said in a statement accompanying the video. \u201cThe field lines swarm with activity: The magenta lines show where the sun's overall field is negative and the green lines show where it is positive. Additional gray lines represent areas of local magnetic variation.\u201d\n\nIncreased solar activity, known as solar maximum, is what happens at the height of each magnetic flip, NASA said. That is what we have been seeing the past couple of years, though solar maximum has not delivered nearly as much as in past cycles.\n\nRELATED: Geomagnetic Storms, Southern Aurora: What Feisty Solar Maximum Has in Store\n\nVideo of NASA | The Sun Reverses its Magnetic Poles\n\nTo go more in-depth and see what effect this could have on the solar system, watch this interview with a NASA scientist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just in time to ring in 2014, the sun has apparently completed flipping its magnetic poles.The sun has finished flipping its poles, ending the 11-year solar cycle and beginning the next one as it starts to reverse the process.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/01/sun-rings-new-year-2014-new-polar-alignment-152931", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/03/LO-RES-AST-Photo-SUN-solar-flare-AP120309112155-e1333218849167.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Sun Rings in New Year 2014 With New Polar Alignment"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-01T10:30-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Sun Rings in New Year 2014 With New Polar Alignment"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/01/sun-rings-new-year-2014-new-polar-alignment-152931", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Solar, Solar Flare, Astronomy, Space, Sun, NASA, solar maximum", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Sun Rings in New Year 2014 With New Polar Alignment"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29aa\"", "article_summary": "That is what we have been seeing the past couple of years, though solar maximum has not delivered nearly as much as in past cycles.\nThis officially puts us at the midpoint of Solar Cycle 24, reported The Independent.\nNow it starts over again, on the downhill of the 22-year solar cycle.\nSolar cycle midpoint achieved.\n\u201cThe field lines swarm with activity: The magenta lines show where the sun's overall field is negative and the green lines show where it is positive."}
