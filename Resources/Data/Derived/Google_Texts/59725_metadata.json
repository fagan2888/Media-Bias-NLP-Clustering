Last year about 40 percent of Oregonians in the individual market used the health insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov, to receive credits that can be used to reduce monthly premiums.\n\nState regulators will accept public comment and review the rates before issuing a final decision. But the trend is not a positive one for consumers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care act requires most people have coverage or face a penalty in tax time.\n\n\u201cFor the next two months, we will analyze the requested rates to ensure they adequately cover costs without being too high or too low,\u201d said Insurance Commissioner Laura Cali. \u201cOur open process allows Oregonians to see everything we do and provide comments on the filings that affect them.\n\n\"For now, the specifics are daunting. Providence has proposed boosting its rates by an average 29.6 percent, coming on top of a 13.8 percent overall hike last year. As of February, Providence led the individual market with more than 100,000 Oregonians enrolled. A 40-year-old on a Providence silver plan pays $273 a month now.\n\nModa, meanwhile, has requested a market-leading average rate hike of 32.3 percent, coming on top of an average 25 percent rate hike approved last year. Moda reported about 60,000 members in Oregon\u2019s individual market, and a 40-year-old on a Moda silver plan pays $307 a month now.\n\nHealth Net Health Plan of Oregon is the only insurer located in the state not to propose raising its rates. The firm is being sold to an out-of-state for-profit insurer, Centene.\n\nOther rate hikes proposed by insurers range from about 15 percent by PacifiSource and Atrio Health Plans to 32 percent by Oregon\u2019s Health CO-OP. The latter company, along with Providence, offered what agents considered some of the more attractive plans in 2016, with a $274 premium for a 40-year-old on a silver plan.\n\nDriving insurers\u2019 rate hikes last year were massive losses due to unexpected claims costs.\n\nAccording to the state, people can search www.oregonhealthrates.org to submit comments and review rates.\n\nCopyright 2016 Pamplin Media Group", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Oregonians who buy their own health insurance face a second straight year of hefty premium hikes that could boost coverage costs by nearly a third.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ijpr.org/post/some-oregonians-face-big-health-insurance-hikes", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ksor/files/styles/medium/public/201311/doctor_examines_patient_s_ear__3_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oregonians who buy their own health insurance face a second straight year of hefty premium hikes that could boost coverage costs by nearly a third.", "title": "Some Oregonians Face Big Health Insurance Hikes"}, "story_id": 477809647, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "author": "Pamplin Media Group", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Some Oregonians Face Big Health Insurance Hikes"}, "nid": 51056, "datePublished": "2016-05-12", "wordCount": 712, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Health Net Health Plan of Oregon is the only insurer located in the state not to propose raising its rates.\nOregonians who buy their own health insurance face a second straight year of hefty premium hikes that could boost coverage costs by nearly a third.\nOther rate hikes proposed by insurers range from about 15 percent by PacifiSource and Atrio Health Plans to 32 percent by Oregon\u2019s Health CO-OP.\nDriving insurers\u2019 rate hikes last year were massive losses due to unexpected claims costs.\nLast year about 40 percent of Oregonians in the individual market used the health insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov, to receive credits that can be used to reduce monthly premiums."}
