No. Did they stand up and pledge to defend women\u2019s reproductive rights? No. Did they say anything at all surprising? No. And even though you knew it; you watched anyway.\n\nWith so many debaters and so many topics to cover, health care got relatively little attention. It seems clear that all the candidates oppose women\u2019s reproductive rights, that they are against funding for Planned Parenthood, and that they want the Affordable Care Act repealed and replaced. So, what did they say on the subject of public health? The full transcript is here. I\u2019ve summarized a few of their answers.\n\nOn Medicaid:\n\nWith the exception of Governor Kasich, who was asked about his support for extending Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, there was little discussion of this effort to extend health care coverage. Governor Kasich provided a spirited defense of Medicaid expansion, first by noting that President Reagan expanded Medicaid, and then by pointing out that it saves money by giving the mentally ill treatment rather than sending them to prison. He reported that it is keeping the working poor healthy and out of emergency rooms so they can go to their jobs. And, finally, he said it is saving the state money.\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u201cRepeal and replace\u201d is the favorite sound bite when the Affordable Care Act is mentioned. Trump, called it \u201ca disaster,\u201d and wants it repealed and replaced with \u201ca private system without artificial lines around every state.\u201d Governor Bush wants to \u201cget rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn\u2019t suppress wages and kill jobs.\u201d Governor Walker and Senator Rubio also favor repealing and in Rubio\u2019s case, replacing, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Reproductive Rights:\n\nWomen\u2019s reproductive rights brought a resounding chorus of \u201cno\u201d from the candidates who addressed this topic. Governor Walker affirmed his statement that he wanted to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, although he signed legislation in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother\u2019s life. In reply to one question on the topic, Walker said, \u201cI\u2019ve said many a time that that unborn child can be protected and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother.\u201d Governor Huckabee affirmed his support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion and stated he wants to go further, \u201cI think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother\u2019s womb is a person at the moment of conception.\u201d Challenged about his support for rape and incest as exceptions permitting abortion, Senator Rubio replied, \u201cI have never said that,\u201d adding \u201cWhat I have advocated is that we pass a law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.\u201d Trump reported evolving from his previous pro-choice position to being \u201cpro-life\u201d saying \u201cI hate the concept of abortion,\u201d and later, \u201cI am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.\u201d\n\nOn Planned Parenthood:\n\nGovernor Walker reported, \u201cI defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before those videos came out.\u201d In his closing remarks, Senator Cruz promised to \u201cinstruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations.\u201d\n\nWhat do they plan to do about health insurance?\n\nI went to the candidates\u2019 websites to find out how they planned to replace the Affordable Care Act. The statements are there in some cases, but none of the websites provide details about the funding of replacement plans or make clear just who or what will be covered under the plans. Many candidates offer no information about their health care plans. They have time to figure it out. The Republican National Convention is 11 months away (July 18-21, 2016 back in Cleveland). Perhaps we\u2019ll learn some details after the nominee is selected. The Democratic National Convention will be here in Philadelphia a few weeks later (July 25-28, 2016) We\u2019ll look to see what the Democratic Party candidates have to say after their debate.\n\nExcited about the coming election?
