In the early \u201990s they were blamed for youth corruption and school shootings, in the early 2000s people like Jack Thompson wrote them off as artless murder simulators, and these days, at least within the community, the debate focuses on the less-than-acceptable gender and racial representation in games. It\u2019s an industry that\u2019s been perpetually dominated by white men, making games for white boys. But things are changing. More than any year before, 2013 was a time of subversion, questioning and action. Developers have listened to the criticisms, and are making games filled with people of all sorts of dispositions. Here are a few characters from this year that show how video games have grown up.\n\nMichael, \u201cGrand Theft Auto V\u201d\n\nOn the surface, Michael looks like the stereotypical \u201cGTA\u201d antihero. He\u2019s angry, he\u2019s funny, he robs banks, and he stockpiles a lot of guns. It\u2019s the usual cartoonish fun, but there are some dark details that really make Michael tick. He\u2019s estranged from his wife, he has a deeply strained relationship with his children, and his return to crime is painted as a sad, depressing response to his wounded masculinity. Some of the most enlightening moments in \u201cGTA V\u201d happen when you take Michael to his psychologist, as he tries to understand the maniac he\u2019s become.\n\nLara Croft, \u201cTomb Raider\u201d\n\nSome people were displeased with the way Lara Croft was portrayed in this year\u2019s reboot of \u201cTomb Raider.\u201d It was a very violent, brutal game that put one of gaming\u2019s oldest heroines in some devastating situations. Within the first few seconds of controlling Lara, we\u2019ve already struggled out of an upside-down binding and have landed hard \u2013 really hard \u2013 on an ugly metal stake puncturing all the way through our hip. Scenes like that can read as exploitative \u2014 on the other hand, developer Crystal Dynamics finally allowed Lara Croft to build her own legacy. She became not a ridiculously proportioned, double-pistol wielding vixen, but a capable, if frightened, explorer attempting to salvage a really bad day. For the first time in her history, Lara Croft was a little bit human.\n\nThe Narrator, \u201cThe Stanley Parable\u201d\n\nI love the Narrator because he never sets any rules. You\u2019re nothing in \u201cThe Stanley Parable,\u201d just a mindless cubicle drone following (or not following) the instructions of a distant, guiding, vaguely sinister voice. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s charming, it\u2019s even a little bit scary here and there. Mostly though, The Narrator serves as excellent commentary on the very nature of interactive entertainment. We\u2019re always following someone\u2019s command, even when we don\u2019t want to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "These men and women (and teens) showed how much video games have grown this year", "title": "The 5 most compelling video game characters of 2013", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "These men and women (and teens) showed how much video games have grown this year", "title": "The 5 most compelling video game characters of 2013", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/24/the_5_most_compelling_video_game_characters_of_2013/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/video_game_characters.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These men and women (and teens) showed how much video games have grown this year", "title": "The 5 most compelling video game characters of 2013", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/video_game_characters.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Winkie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Best of 2013, Editor's Picks, games, Gaming, Grand theft auto, Video Games", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lara Croft, \u201cTomb Raider\u201dSome people were displeased with the way Lara Croft was portrayed in this year\u2019s reboot of \u201cTomb Raider.\u201d It was a very violent, brutal game that put one of gaming\u2019s oldest heroines in some devastating situations.\nScenes like that can read as exploitative \u2014 on the other hand, developer Crystal Dynamics finally allowed Lara Croft to build her own legacy.\nTopics: Best of 2013, Editor's Picks, games, Gaming, Grand theft auto, Video Games, Entertainment NewsVideo games have always come in for criticism.\nFor the first time in her history, Lara Croft was a little bit human.\nHere are a few characters from this year that show how video games have grown up."}
