The proposal places added emphasis on improving care quality and customer service--and up-to-date provider directors represent an important part of that mission, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nMedicare Advantage organizations, CMS said, \"are expected to establish and maintain a proactive, structured process that enables them to assess, on a timely basis, the true availability of contracted providers which includes, as needed, an analysis to verify continued compliance with applicable network access requirements.\" This includes contacting providers once every three months to verify contact information, as well as whether they accept new patients.\n\nCMS added that it will consider a requirement to provide such directories in a standardized, electronic format, as is already required of QHPs that sell on Healthcare.gov.\n\nIn both cases, plans with directories that do not comply with the new CMS rules face stiff penalties--a maximum of $100 per day per individual adversely affected by a non-compliant QHP or dental plan and up to $25,000 per day per Medicare Advantage beneficiary, according to Kaiser Health News.\n\nReaction from the insurance industry was mixed, KHN said. America's Health Insurance Plans said it can be difficult for payers to receive information from providers \"in a timely manner.\" Meanwhile, Aetna and Cigna told KHN that their Medicare Advantage directories are already updated more frequently than the new CMS rule requires.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the letter (.pdf) to insurers on Healthcare.gov\n\n- here's the letter (.pdf) to Medicare Advantage insurers\n\n- check out the Kaiser Health News article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS proposes slight decrease in Medicare Advantage rates for 2016\n\nReport: Marketplaces can do more to improve transparency\n\nOIG: Insurers' Medicaid provider directories are inaccurate\n\nInsurers: Clean up your provider networks\n\nSome ACA plan enrollees struggle to find docs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Starting next year, health insurers must provide up-to-date doctor lists for their\u00a0Medicare Advantage and Healthcare.gov policies, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Starting next year, health insurers must provide up-to-date doctor lists for their\u00a0Medicare Advantage and Healthcare.gov policies, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "title": "CMS tightens provider directory rules for 2016", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/cms-tightens-provider-directory-rules-2016/2015-03-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "HealthCare.gov,Medicare Advantage,Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP,Patient Care & Outcomes,provider directories,Provider Networks,qualified health plans", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Aetna and Cigna told KHN that their Medicare Advantage directories are already updated more frequently than the new CMS rule requires.\nMeanwhile, the second letter focused largely on the CMS proposal to slightly decrease Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates for 2016.\nStarting next year, health insurers must provide up-to-date doctor lists for their Medicare Advantage and Healthcare.gov policies, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\nCMS sent a letter to issuers of qualified health plans (QHPs) on the federal marketplace and a separate letter to insurers that issued Medicare Advantage plans at the end of last month.\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans said it can be difficult for payers to receive information from providers \"in a timely manner.\""}
