While 1 in 4 students is part of a racial or ethnic minority group, fewer than one in 10 teachers fit that description.\n\nState education managers say that\u2019s largely because the state has diversified rapidly in recent years, and it takes time for that to filter into the teaching ranks. An overall shortage of qualified teachers and relatively low salaries also play into the disparity, The Salt Lake Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1PzYInR).\n\nThe biggest gap is among Hispanics, according to the numbers provided by the Utah State Office of Education. While about 16 percent of public school students are Latino, only 2 percent of the 31,000 certified teachers and principals in the state meet that demographic.\n\nA diverse faculty is important because it gives students role models who look and speak like they do, said Bryant Middle School Principal and native Peruvian James Yapias. But good teachers can make an impact regardless of race.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is the instruction - the quality of instruction,\u201d Yapias said. \u201cWe hire the best for the school and for the student needs.\u201d\n\nStill, a diverse faculty exposes the entire student body to people of differing backgrounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for (students) to see the diversity so they know they live in a society that is comprised of more than one race,\u201d said Joyce Gray, who became Utah\u2019s first black school principal in 1984. \u201cNot one culture, but many, many ethnicities and many, many cultures.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia native says she\u2019s seen more diversity in Utah\u2019s education force over the course of her three decades in education, but it\u2019s still a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\n\nPart of the challenge is a decline in the number of teachers compared to the number of students, Deputy State Superintendent Sydnee Dickson said. If fewer people are choosing the profession overall, it becomes even harder to recruit minority faculty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing a teacher shortage on all fronts,\u201d she said. \u201cWithin that shortage, we\u2019re less likely to have teachers of color than if we had a robust teaching workforce.\u201d\n\nProspective teachers also face the double-whammy of strict employment requirements and low salaries. Those can be particular barriers for immigrants, even those who were teachers in their home countries.\n\nEvelyn Cabrera-Lopez worked in the data entry field after moving from Guatemala in 2006, until she landed a job with the Davis School District.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you come to the country, you need to start working,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are bills to pay.\u201d\n\nShe works as a computer lab manager at an elementary school, a job that doesn\u2019t require full teaching certification. She\u2019s working to complete the requirements but says for many people, the time and effort aren\u2019t worth the low salaries.\n\n\u201cWe could have more diversity, but teachers are not getting paid enough,\u201d Cabrera-Lopez said, \u201cso not a lot of people want to do it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah's public school teachers are less diverse than the students they teach, according to a review of state data.
