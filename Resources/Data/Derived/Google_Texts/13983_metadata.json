Especially with black voters. But with Dems in general.\n\nMajorities of Democratic voters in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia said they want a continuation of Obama\u2019s policies, along with more than 4 in 10 voters in Arkansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Texas. In each of those states, about a third of Democratic voters or less want a switch to more liberal policies.\n\nSo the change agenda is dead. Everyone has had more than enough change and few Dems really want a radical in office. Even Obama was smart enough not to run as a radical. Black voters, who make up a large share of Southern Democrats, want more Obama. And Hillary has promised to give it to them. The white Northeastern radical voters Bernie Sanders is popular with lack much standing here.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "title": "Polls Show Hillary's Strategy of Running as Obama II is Working", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262013/polls-show-hillarys-strategy-running-obama-ii-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/03/blackhillaryclinton36383.jpg?itok=JuXdNGq7", "updated_time": "2016-03-01T21:26:57-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262013/polls-show-hillarys-strategy-running-obama-ii-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/03/blackhillaryclinton36383.jpg?itok=JuXdNGq7", "card": "summary", "title": "Polls Show Hillary's Strategy of Running as Obama II is Working"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-01T21:26:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T21:26:57-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Which is Hillary's strategy of abandoning her own \"historic\" pitch or her moderate pitch to just run as Obama II is working.\nThe white Northeastern radical voters Bernie Sanders is popular with lack much standing here.\nIn each of those states, about a third of Democratic voters or less want a switch to more liberal policies.\nEven Obama was smart enough not to run as a radical.\nBlack voters, who make up a large share of Southern Democrats, want more Obama."}
