It\u2019s a system in which the government is the primary payer of care. Medicare, the federal health plan for those 65 and older, exemplifies a single-payer system.\n\nThe case Grimm and others make against the existing health system begins with the fact that the U.S. spends almost twice as much as other developed nations on care. However, the measurable results are at best the same, and problems persist with patient safety, poor access and coordination of care as patients move from one setting to another.\n\nThey argue that administrative waste consumes an enormous share of health spending and creates bureaucratic hassles, a problem studies have documented.\n\nThe existence of multiple private insurers, for instance, means hospitals and doctors must administer many different contracts with different coverage and policies.\n\nTo single-payer advocates, the Affordable Care Act maintains an inefficient, complicated and dysfunctional health system in which policy is influenced by powerful lobbies and medical decisions too often are dictated by financial issues.\n\n\u201cIt is very simple in medicine today: If there is a profit motive, you are going to do more,\u201dsaid Dr. Roberto Diaz Del Carpio, an internal medicine specialist.\n\n\u201cHealth care has become a commodity,\u201d he said. \u201cThat works if we we\u2019re talking about something like iPhones, and my product is better than someone else\u2019s. But everyone should have good insurance.\u201d\n\nAdvocates also criticize the health law for failing to cover millions of Americans while keeping an increasingly costly insurance system tied to employment.\n\n\u201cI see so many people who want to go back to work but fear losing their Medicaid coverage. Health insurance oppresses them,\u201d said Jessica Bauer Walker, executive director of the Community Health Worker Network of Buffalo.\n\nemail: hdavis@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Buffalo is any indication, the campaign for single-payer health insurance didn\u2019t die with the Affordable Care Act.Advocates in Western New York remain undaunted despite a discouraging history of defeat in the United States in the quest for a Medicare-for-all type health system....", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "If Buffalo is any indication, the campaign for single-payer health insurance didn\u2019t die with the Affordable Care Act.Advocates in Western New York remain undaunted despite a discouraging history of defeat in the United States in the quest for a Medicare-for-all type health system.... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Western New York physicians call for single-payer health system  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/medical/western-new-york-physicians-call-for-single-payer-health-system-20140128", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20140128/CITYANDREGION/140128864/AR/0/AR-140128864.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b6a\"", "article_summary": "Advocates in Western New York remain undaunted despite a discouraging history of defeat in the United States in the quest for a Medicare-for-all type health system.\nIf Buffalo is any indication, the campaign for single-payer health insurance didn\u2019t die with the Affordable Care Act.\nHealth insurance oppresses them,\u201d said Jessica Bauer Walker, executive director of the Community Health Worker Network of Buffalo.\nSingle-payer health care is not socialized medicine, in which doctors and hospitals work for the government.\nMedicare, the federal health plan for those 65 and older, exemplifies a single-payer system."}
