Bernie Sanders\u2019 economic policies and push back against growing criticisms from several leading numbers-crunchers.\n\nThe economists defending Mr. Sanders, including Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor in the Bill Clinton administration, said the Vermont independent\u2019s far-reaching plan, which calls for a single-payer healthcare, free college tuition, infrastructure investments and higher taxes, is \u201cabsolutely critical for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest reasons for this kind of success coming out of the Sanders plan has to do with the magnitude of the plan,\u201d Mr. Reich argued in a conference call organized by the Sanders campaign. \u201cThere is nothing unrealistic about it.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign was on the defensive after several economists criticized an analysis by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, that projected Mr. Sanders\u2019 policies would eventually boost middle class incomes and fuel economic growth at a stunning rate of 5.3 percent a year. The growth would provide the tax revenues for the Sanders administration\u2019s ambitions, according to Mr. Friedman, who said he actually supports Hillary Clinton for president.\n\nEconomists tied to the Obama administration wrote last week that \u201cno credible economic research\u201d supports Mr. Friedman\u2019s conclusions. \u201cMaking such promises runs against our party\u2019s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic,\u201d the former chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers wrote.\n\nThe signatories included President Obama\u2019s former CEA chair\u2014Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee and Christina Romer\u2014and one of President Bill Clinton\u2019s, Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson. While President Obama has remained neutral in the heated Democratic primary, many of his current and former aides support Ms. Clinton, his former secretary of state.\n\nFor Ms. Clinton, the well-timed letter was a validation of her critiques of Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist: he\u2019s a nice guy and a progressive, but he\u2019s in essence a pollyanna. The liberal economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has also been a persistent critic of Mr. Sanders on these grounds, to the delight of Clintonworld.\n\nGiven that economics is an inexact science, and often-politically infused, policy plans are almost always the subject of fierce debate. Mr. Friedman and his defenders say the critical economists failed to thoroughly vet his analysis, which they maintain used basic macroeconomic principals.\n\n\u201cFirst, very large position of this [Sanders] plan are desirable, period. They make the country a much better place,\u201d said William K. Black, an associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. \u201cThe second thing is, on the economics, people may assume from both the vituperative nature of the \u2026 letter and their complete dismissal that Gerald Friedman did something bizarre and obviously absurd. In fact, it\u2019s critical to understand the models he was using are precisely the models the Council on Economic Advisers use, precisely the models Paul Krugman uses.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan has come under attack from some on the left for underestimating the price tag, as well as the chaos that would ensue if America suddenly shifted from the Affordable Care Act to a government-run insurance program modeled on what\u2019s been implemented in many other industrialized nations. One issue Mr. Sanders seems to be underestimating is the furious opposition he would face from the pharmaceutical industry and medical doctors, who would see salaries decline and profits drop with cheaper drugs and lower reimbursements.\n\nStephanie Woolhandler, a professor at the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College and a lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said single-payer was ultimately necessary because America\u2019s healthcare system, even with Obamacare, is \u201cstill broken.\u201d\n\nShe argued administrative savings and cheap prices for consumers would offset the higher costs of running a single-payer system on such a large scale.\n\n\u201cDespite the Affordable Care Act\u2019s improvement of the healthcare system, the healthcare system is still broken,\u201d Ms. Woolhandler said. \u201cNearly 30 million people aren\u2019t insured in the United States.\u201d\n\nMr. Reich added that only ambitions of Mr. Sanders\u2019 scope could meet the economic challenges facing poor and middle class Americans.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t aim high, then what\u2019s the use of aiming at all?\u201d he asked.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-512015970.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-512015970.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "bernie sanders, robert reich, warren gunnels, hillary clinton, paul krugman, economists attack bernie, puppies and rainbows, south carolina primary", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-512015970.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "bernie sanders, robert reich, warren gunnels, hillary clinton, paul krugman, economists attack bernie, puppies and rainbows, south carolina primary", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Liberal Economists Defend Bernie Sanders Against a Chorus of Critics", "sailthru.byline_email": "rbarkan@observer.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ross", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-512015970.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "\"If we don\u2019t aim high, then what's the use of aiming at all?\"", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ross-barkan-headshot-e1402611381985.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@rossbarkan", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-02-24T22:44:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T13:02:35+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ross"}, "sailthru.description": "\"If we don\u2019t aim high, then what's the use of aiming at all?\"", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "\u201cIf we don\u2019t aim high, then what\u2019s the use of aiming at all?\u201d", "title": "Liberal Economists Defend Bernie Sanders Against a Chorus of Critics", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/02/liberal-economists-defend-bernie-sanders-against-a-chorus-of-critics/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-512015970.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 791}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ross Barkan is a national political reporter for The New York Observer.
