The bill for the technology, according to their calculations, was nearly $190,000. The automation technology (such as motion detectors and light controls) is among the lower cost items in the home, collectively costing about $500, with the bulk of the cost going toward a $172,000 escalator.\n\nRelated: 13 Smart Ways to Invest in Your House\n\nThe calculation does not factor in the cost of Barbie\u2019s hoverboard, another new product introduced by Mattel at the toy show. The pink hoverboard is a remote-controlled drone that will also soon be available for purchase.\n\nHaving a connected home makes sense for Barbie, who has recently gone high-tech herself. Wi-Fi-enabled Hello Barbie features speech recognition software and can hold a conversation with a child. It was one of the most popular Christmas gifts last year.\n\nHowever, the doll sparked an outcry from critics who have expressed concerns that the connected doll does not include privacy safeguards and that Mattel is inappropriately collecting data on users.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Mattel may be rolling out", "title": "Here\u2019s How Much Barbie\u2019s New High-Tech House Would Really Cost", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/22/Here-s-How-Much-Barbie-s-New-High-Tech-House-Would-Really-Cost", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Barbie-Dreamhouse3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/22/Here-s-How-Much-Barbie-s-New-High-Tech-House-Would-Really-Cost", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Barbie-Dreamhouse3.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Mattel may be rolling out", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The pink hoverboard is a remote-controlled drone that will also soon be available for purchase.\nRelated: 13 Smart Ways to Invest in Your HouseThe calculation does not factor in the cost of Barbie\u2019s hoverboard, another new product introduced by Mattel at the toy show.\nHowever, the doll sparked an outcry from critics who have expressed concerns that the connected doll does not include privacy safeguards and that Mattel is inappropriately collecting data on users.\nThe pink mansion retails for $300, but the folks over at Vocativ were curious how much it would cost to create such a smart home in real life.\nHaving a connected home makes sense for Barbie, who has recently gone high-tech herself."}
