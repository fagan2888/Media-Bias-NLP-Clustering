In 2010, it was 6.1%. By 2013, that figure was 3.6%.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe sharp decline in business ownership among young adults, even when taking into account the aging population, adds to worries about business formation heading into 2015,\u201d reports the Journal.\n\nDeclining net worths, access to capital due to tighter lending standards by banks, and \u201cstiffer competition in the Internet age\u201d were all cited as possible factors driving young entrepreneurship downward.\n\nGroups like the conservative Young America\u2019s Foundation (YAF) have responded by creating The Center for Entrepreneurship & Free Enterprise, an initiative designed to \u201creinvigorate the respect for free enterprise that so many around the world can only dream of by reaching young business leaders and budding entrepreneurs.\u201d The program includes seminars and training in free market and business principles, including hearing lectures from speakers like Steve Forbes, Stephen Moore, Dr. Walter Williams, and John Stossel.\n\nOthers, like libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, have created initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship to empower aspiring entrepreneurs even before they enter college. The Thiel Fellowship offers 20 young dreamers $100,000 over two years to not attend college. Fellows instead take immediate action on starting and launching their business endeavors.\n\nExperts say the downturn in young entrepreneurship runs counter to popular notions of tech whiz kids dreaming up the next social media juggernaut in their bedrooms and portends troubling trends if gone unchanged.\n\n\u201cWe need startups not only for employment, but also for ideas,\u201d Harvard Business School Professor John Davis told the Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the vitality of this country to have people starting new businesses and trying new things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An analysis by the Wall Street Journal finds that the number of private business owners under the age of 30 has hit a 24-year-low.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "An analysis by the Wall Street Journal finds that the number of private business owners under the age of 30 has hit a 24-year-low.", "title": "WSJ: Share of Young Entrepreneurs Lowest in 24 Years", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mark-Zuckerberg-Facebook.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-03T12:07:34-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/03/number-of-entrepreneurs-under-30-hits-24-year-low/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An analysis by the Wall Street Journal finds that the number of private business owners under the age of 30 has hit a 24-year-low.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mark-Zuckerberg-Facebook.jpg", "title": "WSJ: Share of Young Entrepreneurs Lowest in 24 Years", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Center for Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise, entrepreneurship, Jobs, Peter Thiel, Steve Forbes, Thiel Fellowship, Young America's Foundation, young entrepreneurs,Big Government, Economics, Education,entrepreneur", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-03T12:06:07-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-01-03T12:07:34-07:00", "tag": "young entrepreneurs", "categories": "Big Government,Education,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde19\"", "article_summary": "Others, like libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, have created initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship to empower aspiring entrepreneurs even before they enter college.\nThe Thiel Fellowship offers 20 young dreamers $100,000 over two years to not attend college.\nDeclining net worths, access to capital due to tighter lending standards by banks, and \u201cstiffer competition in the Internet age\u201d were all cited as possible factors driving young entrepreneurship downward.\nExperts say the downturn in young entrepreneurship runs counter to popular notions of tech whiz kids dreaming up the next social media juggernaut in their bedrooms and portends troubling trends if gone unchanged.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAn analysis by the Wall Street Journal finds that the number of private business owners under the age of 30 has hit a 24-year-low."}
