(Charles Dharapak/Associated Press)\n\nAs the final \u201cundecideds\u201d among Senate Democrats make known their position on the Iran deal, there is the curious spectacle in the presidential race of two candidates \u2014 Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2014 who have declared that simply policing the deal is sufficient for the next commander in chief.\n\nThis week, conservatives were praising Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, for rejecting the deal, explaining, \u201cThe JCPOA legitimizes Iran\u2019s nuclear program. After 10 to 15 years, it would leave Iran with the option to produce enough enriched fuel for a nuclear weapon in a short time.\u201d In addition, it affords Iran $150 billion, makes no demands of it with regard to human rights and does not require that it cease aggression in the region. It was such a good deal for Iran it could not say no. Cardin\u2019s action brought rare praise from a conservative group. David Brog executive director of Christians United for Israel, says via his spokesman, \u201cSenator Cardin has demonstrated what responsible leadership looks like. His statement opposing the disastrous Iran deal demonstrates that he \u2014 unlike so many of his colleagues \u2014 has actually read the text.\u201d While Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) denounced the deal and then said he would vote for it, Cardin, Brog pointed out, \u201cknows that making a speech about the deals\u2019 flaws does not eliminate these flaws. Senator Cardin has chosen to lead, not to cop out.\u201d\n\nYou see, saying the deal is terrible is not enough. If the deal cannot be blocked or undone (e.g. Congress passes a bill requiring Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA, which it fails to do) it must be ended by the next president. As many of them have pointed out, an executive agreement designed to get around the requirement for a treaty (ratification by 2/3 of the Senate) can be eviscerated by subsequent presidents.\n\nEspecially given that a veto will be upheld by Democrats, it is critical for any possible GOP nominee to pledge to undo it. It should be front and center in 2016, with Hillary Clinton vowing to keep it and \u201cpolice it\u201d (in other words let Iran get the bomb in 10 years) and the Republican vowing to get rid of it and return to a policy of credible military threats and severe sanctions.\n\nNot all GOP candidates are definitive on that, however. Trump and Kasich are with Clinton on this one. \u201cWhat too many fail to understand is that while, yes, Iran may cheat on its deal with Barack Obama, Iran doesn\u2019t need to cheat. This deal is so good for Iran, and so completely answers its own needs on building up a nuclear arsenal within 10-plus years, that there is no requirement for Tehran to sneak around,\u201d explains Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sakes, the deal even requires countries to help Iran on technical nuclear issues as if the Islamic Republic has never cheated on its NPT obligations. Policing the deal is just another version of what Hillary Clinton said in the last election, [namely] if they nuke Israel, there will be a retaliatory strike.\u201d\n\nCertainly many lawmakers rejected the deal because the Iranians can so easily cheat. But the problem, which informed critics of the deal including Cardin have been making, is that it is vital for American security and Israel\u2019s existence to end the policy of appeasement and chart a new course. That is not possible with the Iran deal, the pinnacle of appeasement. \u201cAll I would ask of the Republican candidates is they live up to the example that Senator Cardin has set,\u201d Brog says. \u201cTalking about tough enforcement of this deal misses the point. This deal \u2014 even if diligently enforced \u2014 still legitimizes Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. This deal \u2014 even if followed to the letter \u2014 still provides Iran with quick billions that it\u2019s already spending to send missiles into Israel. This deal is a disaster. Let\u2019s leave talk of disaster mitigation for after the Congressional debate.\u201d\n\nTrump and Kasich may toughen or completely reverse their language, but plainly they do not understand the fundamental problem with the deal. (Hugh Hewitt showed Trump understands practically nothing about foreign policy, in case you had any doubt.) That is going to be problematic in a GOP primary in which Republican voters overwhelming oppose the deal and want to get rid of it. Penny Nance, executive director of Concerned Women for America (with 500,000 members), says that just policing the deal \u201cisn\u2019t in line\u201d with the views of most conservatives. She says her members will press the candidates. \u201cIllogical promises can\u2019t go unexamined forever,\u201d she says.\n\nIt is not clear how hard opponents will hit Trump and Kasich for their weakness on Iran, or Trump for his demonstrated ignorance of foreign policy. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was one of the few who spoke out on Friday. The Hill reported:\n\n\u201cThis should be part of the reason why you are running, because you understand the threats that the world is facing, you have deep understanding and you understand what to do about it,\u201d [Rubio] said without naming Trump. \u201cAnd if someone doesn\u2019t, I think it is very concerning,\u201d added Rubio, himself a 2016 candidate for president. . .Rubio said Friday that the outspoken billionaire\u2019s criticism of Hewitt was invalid, given the responsibilities of the presidency. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he responded when asked if Hewitt\u2019s questioning was unfair. \u201cNational security is the most important obligation of the federal government. \u201cIf you are going to be a presidential candidate, you need to take this seriously,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cIt takes time and dedication and a natural curiosity and interest in these issues. And I think that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nIt is also critical to get the biggest question right. For most Republicans that means dumping the deal and embarking on a new policy. Candidates who evidence a lack of understanding or commitment may find themselves in serious trouble with voters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No half-measures for conservative friends of Israel.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "No half-measures for conservative friends of Israel.", "title": "Pro-Israel conservatives reject merely \u2018policing\u2019 the Iran deal", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/06/pro-israel-conservatives-reject-merely-policing-the-iran-deal/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/08/14/Outlook/Images/2015-03-02T155410Z_01_WAS911_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ISRAEL-613.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/06/pro-israel-conservatives-reject-merely-policing-the-iran-deal/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "iran and trump, iran and kasich, iran deal ending, iran and GOP presidential primary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "iran and trump, iran and kasich, iran deal ending, iran and GOP presidential primary"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42ee\"", "article_summary": "That is not possible with the Iran deal, the pinnacle of appeasement.\n\u201cWhat too many fail to understand is that while, yes, Iran may cheat on its deal with Barack Obama, Iran doesn\u2019t need to cheat.\nIt was such a good deal for Iran it could not say no.\nJohn Kasich \u2014 who have declared that simply policing the deal is sufficient for the next commander in chief.\n), the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, for rejecting the deal, explaining, \u201cThe JCPOA legitimizes Iran\u2019s nuclear program."}
