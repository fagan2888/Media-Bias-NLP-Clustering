Several southeast-side residents woke up Sunday morning to discover their vehicles had been vandalized overnight.

Deputy Tom Peine, a spokesman with the Pima County Sheriff's Department, confirmed that PCSD received nine vandalism reports from that area this morning.

Incredulous victims began posting photos to the closed Facebook group "Corona de Tucson Community Forum" when they discovered the damages.

Much of the activity was concentrated near South Houghton Road and Camino del Toro, with the first report coming in at 4:46 a.m., Peine said.

Anyone with information should call 911 or the 88-CRIME anonymous tip line.
