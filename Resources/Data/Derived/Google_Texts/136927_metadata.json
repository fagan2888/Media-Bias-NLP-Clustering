As Jonathan Chait noted, the estimate included wild assumptions that drastically overstate the costs, particularly because the actual rules are slightly more lenient than expected. Even so, the Chamber\u2019s estimate wasn\u2019t that dire: an extra $100 in energy costs per year for consumers and 224,000 fewer jobs. As Chait concluded, \u201cwhat the Chamber is actually demonstrating, in its attempts to frighten us, is that we hardly have anything to fear.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, that didn\u2019t stop Republican politicians from using those estimates in their press releases, but they couldn\u2019t even do that correctly. Senator Roy Blunt completely butchered the numbers in his release, as Roll Call\u2019s Steven Dennis found. Blunt\u2019s press release stated that the new regulations would cost Missouri consumers $11 billion a year. That\u2019s two-thirds of the Chamber\u2019s estimate of the costs to all U.S. consumers. That\u2019s not right. Dennis found that Blunt tabulated the costs using regional estimates that included parts of 25 states. As Dennis says, this was a \u201cspectacular math fail\u201d and one that Blunt\u2019s office had plenty of time to get right.\n\nThe rules won\u2019t make an impact on global warming.\n\nRepublicans have also loved to demonize the costs of the law while arguing that it has zero benefits, because it will not make a dent in global warming. This is technically right, but ignores the global impact of U.S. leadership. The goal of these regulations is not to stop global warming, but to prove to the international community that the United States is ready to pay additional costs to combat climate change. Just this morning, an adviser to the Chinese government announced that China would cap its carbon emissions starting in 2016. You never know what to believe from the Chinese in the media, but the ultimate goal of these regulations is to spur major polluters like China to follow the U.S.\u2019s lead. Republicans have chosen to ignore that possible benefit.\n\nThe rules are another Obama power grab.\n\nFinally, Republicans have added the EPA regulations to their list of lawless actions taken by Obama. \u201cThis is not about the environment,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon. \u201cThis is about a power grab.\u201d This is 100 percent wrong. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA is required to regulate pollution that poses a risk to public health. As The New Republic\u2019s Jonathan Cohn explained, then-EPA administrator Stephen Johnson told President Bush in 2008 that he was required by law to regulate greenhouse gases as they were a threat to public health. Current EPA administrator Gina McCarthy is following the word of the law. That doesn\u2019t mean different parts of the regulations won\u2019t be challenged in court, but unless Congress modifies or repeals the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to regulate greenhouse gases.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Republican midterm strategy of demonizing Obamacare hasn\u2019t worked out as planned. In turn, Republicans have scrambled to find new attacks against Obama and a new message for November, particularly one that would increase turnout. They have seemed to settle on the meme that Obama is a lawless president. That\u2019s why Salmon calls the new regulations a power grab: It fits into their new message, even if it is obviously untrue.\n\nBut these flimsy arguments only demonstrate the weakness of the Republican position, both politically and policy-wise. If Obamacare was the train wreck they predicted, Republicans would want to keep the focus on the health care law. They would criticize Obama for the EPA rules, but quickly turn their attention back to the Affordable Care Act. And if the rules were actually as grave a threat to the economy as they warn, they would have credible numbers to back up those warnings. Instead, they have neither\u2014and their desperate attempts to demonize the Democratic position are on full display.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Last December, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell met with Kentuckians to discuss the EPA\u2019s future regulations of greenhouse gases.
