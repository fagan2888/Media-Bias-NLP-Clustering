We had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place. It was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy, a mindset that put a premium on unilateral U.S. action over the painstaking work of building international consensus, a mindset that exaggerated threats beyond what the intelligence supported.\u201d\n\nObama, like Zarif, has also singled out Israel for its unified opposition to the deal. The President said earlier in August that \u201cevery nation in the world \u2013 with the exception of the Israeli government \u2013 has expressed support\u201d for the accord.\n\nAmerican Jewish leaders have criticized the President\u2019s comments, which the Anti-Defamation League said could be interpreted as \u201cfueling and legitimizing anti-Semitic stereotypes out there that Jews are warmongers.\u201d\n\nSeparately, during his speech on Saturday, Rouhani pledged to purchase and sell weaponry in direct violation of international sanctions against his country.\n\n\u201cWe will purchase weapons from wherever we deem necessary and we are not waiting for anyone\u2019s permission; if we deem necessary we will sell our weapons and we will do this without paying attention to any resolution,\u201d he said in his address.\n\nThe Tehran regime\u2019s President threatened war should the nuclear accord crumble under the weight of scrutiny. \u201cIran\u2019s strategy is based on defense and deterrence\u2026 Diplomats should be backed by generals. If they fail, it is the generals\u2019 turn to come forward,\u201d he stated.\n\nAs part of Defense Industry day, Rouhani unveiled a new ballistic missile, called the Fateh 313, which has a 300 mile range and features sophisticated guidance technology, Iran\u2019s state-run Sepah News reported. Regional officials have expressed concerns that the new missile technology could get into the hands of Iran\u2019s proxies, including the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terror group, which could use the ballistic technology to hit any target in Israel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said only \"Warmongers\" and \"Zionists\" oppose the nuclear deal with world powers.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said only \"Warmongers\" and \"Zionists\" oppose the nuclear deal with world powers.", "title": "Rouhani: Only \u201cWarmongers\u201d and \u201cZionists\u201d Oppose Iran Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/upi_IRAN-KHOMEINI.jpg", "height": 213}, "updated_time": "2015-08-23T09:20:07-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/08/23/rouhani-channels-obama-only-warmongers-and-zionists-oppose-iran-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said only \"Warmongers\" and \"Zionists\" oppose the nuclear deal with world powers.", "title": "Rouhani: Only \u201cWarmongers\u201d and \u201cZionists\u201d Oppose Iran Deal", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/upi_IRAN-KHOMEINI.jpg", "creator": "@JordanSchachtel", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Breitbart Jerusalem, Iran, Iranian Nuclear Program, jihad, Middle East, Nuke Deal, tehran, terrorism,Breitbart Jerusalem, Middle East, National Security,iran nuclear deal", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-23T09:05:42-07:00", "section": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "modified_time": "2015-08-23T09:20:07-07:00", "tag": "terrorism", "categories": "National Security,Middle East,Breitbart Jerusalem"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The Tehran regime\u2019s President threatened war should the nuclear accord crumble under the weight of scrutiny.\n\u201cOnly the Zionist regime (Israel) and warmongers in the US are against it.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRouhani\u2019s accusatory comments follow the same theme as the remarks uttered by President Obama in defense of the deal as of late.\nAs part of Defense Industry day, Rouhani unveiled a new ballistic missile, called the Fateh 313, which has a 300 mile range and features sophisticated guidance technology, Iran\u2019s state-run Sepah News reported.\n\u201cIran\u2019s strategy is based on defense and deterrence\u2026 Diplomats should be backed by generals.\nThe President said earlier in August that \u201cevery nation in the world \u2013 with the exception of the Israeli government \u2013 has expressed support\u201d for the accord."}
