The bad news was that the site and its identity-verification services weren\u2019t up to the task. So the Department of Health and Human Services apologized in a blog post\u2026a post that accepts user comments. These comments make interesting reading.\n\nHealthcare.gov, of course, is the federal government\u2019s portal site for states that didn\u2019t set up their own health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Consumerist\u2019s own informal test showed that New York\u2019s site was working just peachy last week, and we were able to shop for plans and get accurate prices, but we didn\u2019t go all the way through and enroll.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t vouch for the accuracy of these comments, and neither can the Department of Health and Human Services, but they do show a fascinating array of consumer issues and possible bugs.\n\nA reader named Maggie posted:\n\nI have been a vocal supporter of the ACA since it\u2019s passage and anxiously anticipated using the Michigan Exchange via healthcare.gov as my family of 4 must find a new policy before our current Aetna policy is eliminated as of 12/31/13. Of note, our current policy was eliminated because of the ACA. I didn\u2019t complain even though this is one of the detractors\u2019 favorite, now legitimate, complaints about the ACA. Further, we will not qualify for a subsidy, so I expected this process to be relatively simple. I am embarrassed, appalled and angry that we have not been able to even get on to apply at this late date. Excuses will no longer suffice. The site MUST be fixed and fully operational in the next month or a huge number of qualified people must be hired to enroll people like us so that the Admonistration [sic] doesn\u2019t lose the support of people like my family. FIX IT NOW!!!\n\nAnother commenter had a suggestion:\n\nAssuming each person using the healthcare.gov website is worth MINIMUM WAGE, give us an estimate \u2014 to the nearest $1M dollars \u2014 of how much citizen time YOU have wasted. Perhaps you and your kind might learn a little humility by cutting checks to the unsuccessful citizens (no fault of their own) to compensate them at Minimum Wage Rate \u2026 since NSA of course has the total logs of all attempts, successful and unsuccessful matched up to bank accounts and USPS mailing addresses.\n\nWe only know of one documented instance where something like that has happened, and it didn\u2019t involve the federal government.\n\nProPublica picked out a few illustrative gems, including Joanna, who managed to use the site to clone her daughter.\n\nIt appears that my daughter was added twice so that I now have two daughters with the same name and social security number. I am unable to delete one of them. Also, the drop down menu that relates to what relationship someone is to another is faulty. I choose that my husband is the father of our daughter and that my daughter is a dependant [sic] to me and my husband. What it actually shows though is that my daughter is a stepdaughter to her father and that my daughter is now both my husband and I\u2019s parent.\n\nThen there\u2019s Fred, the shopper whose dilemma we refer to in this post\u2019s title:\n\nWebsite said my wife and I were ineligible due to current incarceration. We have never been arrested in our lives, both 63!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nEven insurance agents and application counselors are flummoxed. John wrote:\n\nI am insurance agent also President of Insurance Agency (50+ Insurance Agents plus 30 employees) We have 1000\u2019s of customers who want to sign up for health insurance and most will be subsidized. We have tried everyday since 10-1-2013. Maybe 2 applications have been processed. I have spent well over 250K getting ready for the ACA roll-out. My agency has been writing individual and small group insurance for over 25 years. We have marketed the uninsured and lower income. We have held events to get pre-enrollment applications. We just want to help people get the insurance they need. What can you do to help me?\n\nDoing Better: Making Improvements to HealthCare.gov [HHS.gov Digital Strategy]\n\nHealthcare.gov\u2019s Users Speak Out: \u2018Clean This Mess Up\u2019 [ProPublica]\n\nHave health care reform questions?
