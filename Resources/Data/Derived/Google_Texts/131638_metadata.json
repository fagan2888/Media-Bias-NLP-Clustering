During those catastrophic moments five years ago, it was hard to imagine a silver lining. But an important benefit did emerge \u2013 one, in fact, that may have saved some lives this week after the Carnival tragedy.\n\nRELATED: Haiti Government Cancels Carnival After 16 People Die In Accident\n\nBefore the earthquake, emergency medicine in Haiti was unreliable at best. Sometimes unattainable.\n\n\u201cThere were many skilled physicians in Haiti,\u201d says Dr. Toni Eyssallenne, a Haitian-American who\u2019s an internal medicine and pediatrics specialist at the University of Miami and Bernard Mevs Hospital in Port-au-Prince. \u201cBut they were in a very frustrating, resource-poor setting.\u201d\n\nThe disaster gave rise to improved trauma care in the western hemisphere\u2019s poorest country. Today, if you suffer a heart attack or a bad road collision in Haiti, you have a better chance of getting proper treatment.\n\nAnd a big reason for that change can be found not in Haiti but 700 miles away in Miami \u2013 inside a conference room at Jackson Memorial Hospital\u2019s Ryder Trauma Center.\n\nOn a recent morning, Dr. Shailesh Garg, a trauma medicine fellow with Jackson and the University of Miami, sat in his scrubs surrounded by enough video screens on the wall to fill a sports bar. Through a webcam connection he was advising Dr. Kathleen Charles, a Haitian physician at Bernard Mevs.\n\nCharles was monitoring a Haitian woman who\u2019d sustained severe injuries in a car crash. But the patient was suddenly showing symptoms \u2013 \u201cThis morning she presented a high fever,\u201d Charles told Garg \u2013 that were hard to diagnose there given the relative lack of access to equipment like CT scans.\n\n\u201cThe fever might be from a pulmonary embolism,\u201d Garg said, meaning a blood clot in the lungs. He turned out to be right.\n\n\u201cIt helps a lot,\u201d Charles said later by phone from Haiti. \u201cHe gave us the right clue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed at how well they manage,\u201d Garg says of his Haitian colleagues. \u201cHere we have all the resources, we can get anything done. If I had to [work in Haiti], I\u2019d have such a tough time.\u201d\n\nHelping Haitian trauma doctors do more with what little they have is a central point of this \"telemedicine\" program, which the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine set up two months ago with Bernard Mevs \u2013 Haiti\u2019s only trauma and critical care hospital.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do is provide them with creative alternatives,\u201d says Dr. Barth Green, UM\u2019s head of neurosurgery. In the case of a brain injury, for example, Green says UM doctors can advise the Haitians to \u201cuse a drill that\u2019s used for orthopedics to open the skull\u201d if they don\u2019t have the \u201cspecially designed, super-duper 2015 drill we have here in Miami.\u201d\n\nGreen is also co-founder of Project Medishare, which UM started two decades ago to assist Haiti\u2019s threadbare medical system. Medishare\u2019s presence after the 2010 earthquake \u2013 especially the 300-bed tent hospital it erected \u2013 was crucial. And it\u2019s been no less important in helping Haitian clinics like Bernard Mevs build better trauma care.\n\nBut Green says it also became apparent that promoting Haitian doctors needed to be a stronger part of Medishare\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cTraining Haitians to take care of Haitians,\u201d he says, \u201cinstead of talking to ourselves about how good we are.\u201d\n\nREAL-TIME MED SCHOOL\n\nThat led to the telemedicine campaign. More than just collegial consultation, Green calls it \u201creal-time\u201d medical school for Haitian MDs. Eyssallenne, who helped developed the program, agrees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s raised the bar,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s demonstrated to Haitian medical staff members that more can be done for reversible traumas. And that fosters hope.\u201d\n\nThe University of Miami plans to carry that hope to other parts of Haiti soon by expanding telemedicine into the country\u2019s rural interior. Internet and other communications technology challenges will be even bigger there than they are in Port-au-Prince. But UM doctors say \u201ctelehealth\u201d technology \u2013 especially mobile tech \u2013 is advancing quickly.\n\nAnd remote First World locales like the Florida Keys are benefiting as much as developing countries like Haiti.\n\n\u201cWhen they have a trauma in Key West, we often advise them what to do,\u201d says Dr. Antonio Marttos, a trauma surgeon and head of UM\u2019s Global e-Health. \u201cLike if you have a patient who has a stroke in the Keys \u2013 they don\u2019t have any neurosurgery in the Keys.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a reminder that in the session that starts next month, the Florida legislature will take up several bills to expand telemedicine in the state.\n\nThe bills\u2019 supporters might now point to Haiti \u2013 where this week the UM-Bernard Mevs tele-connection is helping treat victims who were electrocuted or trampled during Tuesday\u2019s Carnival chaos.\n\nTim Padgett is Americas editor at WLRN in Miami.
