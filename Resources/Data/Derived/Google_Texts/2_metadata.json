The results from Iowa are hardly prophecy, and their significance is chronically overstated; nevertheless, Cruz\u2019s current leading status made me want to critically examine one of his chief differences with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIn particular, Cruz has pledged to \u201crepeal every word of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThis would be a disaster for millions of Americans. To fully comprehend what Cruz wants to repeal, remember that Obamacare ensures that:\n\nChildren are able to stay on their parent\u2019s health insurance plans until age 26\n\nHealth insurance companies cannot discriminate against people with \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d\n\nHealth insurance companies cannot charge women more than men\n\nMedicaid can be expanded to reach millions of Americans\n\nMillions of Americans are provided with subsidies to buy health insurance\n\nThese are great strides in our country\u2019s ability to provide basic healthcare access to our citizenry. In total, it appears coverage has been expanded to over 18 million people. There\u2019s also evidence that as of a little over a year ago, Obamacare had saved over 50,000 lives.\n\nCruz has made attacking Obamacare the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of his political career; he even drove the Republican party to shut down the government in a misguided attempt to defund the law. And to be fair, the law is far from perfect, and there\u2019s much about it that should be fixed or improved.\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s proposed alternatives are laughable. In the last Republican presidential debate before the primaries, he laid out a three-point plan for replacing Obamacare:\n\nAllow health insurers to sell plans across state lines Bolster health savings accounts Allow individuals to carry health insurance from job to job\n\nFox News\u2019 own Chris Wallace\u2013certainly not an Obama supporter himself\u2013pressed Cruz on this plan. Wallace pointed out that though conservative think tanks generally support these ideas, no one seriously thinks they would reduce the number of the uninsured:\n\nWallace also points out that, despite Cruz\u2019s insistence, there\u2019s no reason to think Obamacare has been a \u201cjob killer.\u201d Wallace fails to add that Cruz\u2019s plan would certainly lead to a sharp rise in the uninsured population, since it would undo all of Obamacare\u2019s progress.\n\nWorse still for Cruz, his own plan undermines his case against Obamacare. In the debate, Cruz describes people suffering who have \u201clost their health insurance, lost their doctors, [and] have seen their premiums skyrocket.\u201d\n\nCruzcare would do all this and more. Repealing Obamacare would strip millions of their healthcare, whether they gained access through Medicaid expansion or through subsidies on the exchanges. Without subsidies, premiums for millions of families would soar. Health insurance would again be out of reach for many who are economically vulnerable.\n\nSince the entire system is extremely complicated, it\u2019s difficult to be a well-informed consumer and to make rational decisions about health insurance plans. For this reason, many Americans were drastically underinsured prior to Obamacare; this is one of the fundamental failures of a health insurance market. But the first two parts of Cruz\u2019s healthcare plan rely on the market principles to reduce the cost of care, even though we know from experience that this doesn\u2019t help.\n\nMaking health insurance \u201cportable\u201d so employees could keep their plans even if they switched jobs sounds appealing. But this really means decoupling health insurance from employment; while this is a good idea in the abstract, practically speaking it would be extremely disruptive to the entire health care system.\n\nThis is disingenuous of Cruz, because he frequently attacks Obamacare for the disruptions it has caused. It\u2019s not clear if he\u2019s simply uninterested in actually working out a sound healthcare policy or if he is actively misleading his voters.\n\nTake a look at Cruz\u2019s website; you\u2019ll see that health policy does not feature prominently at all. If this is any evidence, it would seem that Cruz, like the rest of the Republican party, does not actually seem care about helping Americans access health care.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely unlikely that Obamacare will be repealed. It has too many popular provisions, and too many people are coming to rely on it for their essential health needs. Any president who tried to actively strip millions of Americans of their health insurance while driving up premiums and the uninsured rate would not just tank their own reputation but likely bring down their party in the process.\n\nBut there are countless ways in which Obamacare could be improved upon and expanded. Conservative voices can and should play an important part in the discussion over how to improve the law while not abandoning the progress we\u2019ve made. But given the GOP\u2019s deep repulsion to anything related to Obamacare, there\u2019s little room for the party members to engage in a constructive dialogue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Cruz has made opposing Obamacare a central part of his appeal, he's offered no feasible alternative plan.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3167/3166870.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "obamacare,ted cruz,republicans,insurance,healthcare,", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc936b\"", "article_summary": "Making health insurance \u201cportable\u201d so employees could keep their plans even if they switched jobs sounds appealing.\nBut given the GOP\u2019s deep repulsion to anything related to Obamacare, there\u2019s little room for the party members to engage in a constructive dialogue.\nSince the entire system is extremely complicated, it\u2019s difficult to be a well-informed consumer and to make rational decisions about health insurance plans.\nHealth insurance would again be out of reach for many who are economically vulnerable.\nBut the first two parts of Cruz\u2019s healthcare plan rely on the market principles to reduce the cost of care, even though we know from experience that this doesn\u2019t help."}
