(And a somewhat delicious irony.)\n\nOn Thursday, Lee and his fellow conspirators were sentenced to five years in prison. A request for leniency in light of his public service was denied by the judge.\n\nFormer state Sen. Leland Yee was sentenced by a federal judge in San Francisco today to five years in prison for his political corruption conviction. Yee's campaign fundraiser, political consultant and former school board president Keith Jackson was also sentenced today to nine years in prison by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer. Yee, 67, and Jackson, 51, pleaded guilty before Breyer on July 1 to one count of participating in a racketeering conspiracy to solicit bribes in the form of campaign contributions in exchange for political favors by Yee. They admitted that Yee received more than $40,000 in such payments, funneled to him by Jackson, and also admitted to plotting in a never-completed international arms deal in which weapons would be smuggled from the Philippines.\n\nOn Reddit, commenters noted how Yee once publicly fought against the video game Grand Theft Auto--\"probably because he lived it.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Goodbye. .05/27/2016 2:56:45AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Goodbye.", "title": "Anti-Gun California State Senator Sentenced to Five Years in Prison on Gun Trafficking and Racketeering Charges", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/02/25/antigun-california-state-senator-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison-on-gun-trafficking-charges-n2124467", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/55/93f32ebd-971b-475f-92e6-e89f95dcc7dd.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Goodbye.", "title": "Anti-Gun California State Senator Sentenced to Five Years in Prison on Gun Trafficking and Racketeering Charges", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/02/25/antigun-california-state-senator-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison-on-gun-trafficking-charges-n2124467", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/55/93f32ebd-971b-475f-92e6-e89f95dcc7dd.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Anti-Gun California State Senator Sentenced to Five Years in Prison on Gun Trafficking and Racketeering Charges, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Former state Sen.
