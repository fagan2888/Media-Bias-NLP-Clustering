But you can't always do that. I help them understand what to expect.\"\n\nChild life specialists work with children from birth to young adulthood, ranging from those with chronic conditions to those who are only visiting the emergency room. Although the primary goal is to minimize trauma for the children, \"there are secondary gains,\" according to Michael Towne, manager of child life services at University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Hospitals are changing how they think about child life. They're not just thinking about us as a pleasant addition for a positive experience,\" Towne told SFGate. \"If the child copes better, it's less of a struggle to treat them, it takes less time and it takes less medicine. It's more efficient care.\"\n\nChild life specialists have applications beyond patients as well. For example, they can help children cope with the loss of a loved one, according to Tara Monroe, child life specialist for the 192-bed Nemours/Alfred I. DuPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del.\n\n\"The big piece is explaining that I'm not walking in and then talking about emotional things,\" Monroe told Delaware Online. \"It's more like, 'Hi, I'm Tara. Let's play today.'\"\n\n\"The child life specialists are in between the medical world--and all the technology and the needles and the pointy things--and the child,\" Bernard Dannenberg, M.D., director of pediatric emergency at Stanford, told SFGate. \"The children know that this (child life specialist) is the only person who can't hurt me.\"\n\nMany children's hospitals have begun incorporating other strategies to make the experience less frightening, such as giving children pre-surgery tours of operating areas or providing goggles that allow them to watch movies during medical tests, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the SFGate article\n\n- read the Delaware Online article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nChildren's hospitals work to improve patient experience\n\nWhy adult hospitals should be more like children's hospitals\n\nChildren's hospital reaches out to parents\n\nBorrow pediatric strategies to improve patient experience", "article_metadata": {"description": "An increasing number of children's hospitals are turning to child life specialists to make child patients' experiences less traumatic and their treatment more efficient, SFGate reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "An increasing number of children's hospitals are turning to child life specialists to make child patients' experiences less traumatic and their treatment more efficient, SFGate reports.", "title": "More hospitals using child life specialists", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/more-hospitals-using-child-life-specialists/2014-01-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Child Life Specialists,children's hospitals,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Experience", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "An increasing number of children's hospitals are turning to child life specialists to make children's patient experiences less traumatic and their treatment more efficient, SFGate reports.\nChild life specialists have applications beyond patients as well.\n\"It's my job to home in on the child, see how they're coping at that moment,\" Kristen Beckler, a child life specialist with Stanford Hospital in California, said in the article.\nChild life specialists work with children from birth to young adulthood, ranging from those with chronic conditions to those who are only visiting the emergency room.\n\"The child life specialists are in between the medical world--and all the technology and the needles and the pointy things--and the child,\" Bernard Dannenberg, M.D., director of pediatric emergency at Stanford, told SFGate."}
