You know, when they were first thinking of the name Holly for the coming baby. Just a cold reminder of how far we\u2019ve come.\n\nOkay, poets, let\u2019s deconstruct. \u201cOzymandias\u201d refers to the Percy Bysshe Shelley poem about the inevitable decay of empires. Walt, who long ago proclaimed himself not just in the drug business but in the empire business, is about to see his empire crumble.\n\nHank is wounded, but, even as Walt pleads with Uncle Jack to save Hank\u2019s life, we know, \u201cThere\u2019s no scenario where this man lives.\u201d\n\nNot even the $80 million scenario? No, not even that.\n\nThe inevitable demise of Hank ends in deathly silence. (We knew it was coming since he celebrated his victory over Walt a tad too early, before last week\u2019s shootout; also because tragedy demands this consequence.) We\u2019re left with the indelible sight of Walt crying as he falls to the desert floor. The burial of federal agents Hank Schrader and Steve Gomez in what was the money\u2019s hiding place is just cleanup as usual for Uncle Jack\u2019s neo-Nazi crew.\n\nWalt knows a living Jesse Pinkman remains a threat. So he contracts for that death. First there will be torture.\n\nWalt finally told Jesse that he watched Jesse\u2019s girlfriend Jane (the tattoo artist played by Krysten Ritter) die, and did nothing. \u201cI watched her overdose and choke to death. I could have saved her but I didn\u2019t.\u201d The psychological torture is just the beginning. But the belated confession had less dramatic urgency than it should have.\n\nBetter was the Sysiphisean shot of Walt pushing his barrel full of cash uphill, to an Indian\u2019s hut in the desert.\n\nThinking that Hank has Walt under arrest, Marie pressures Sklyer to tell Junior (Flynn) everything.\n\nWhen she does R.J. Mitte turns in a beautifully distraught performance. \u201cWhy would you go along?\u201d Junior wants to know.\n\nMore lying and Walt packs, demanding the family follow suit. In perhaps the most climactic scene of the hour, after Walt and Skyler fight over a knife and Junior protects his mom from the madman who is his father, once again Walt invokes the idea of \u201cfamily.\u201d Heartbreaking, really. At long last, after so many dodges and lies, police and federal agents, it\u2019s Walt\u2019s own son who calls the cops on him.\n\nHaving abducted 18-month-old Holly, Walt phones Skyler with another ploy. He tells her she\u2019s ungrateful. He blames her for telling Junior the truth, he calls her a \u201cstupid bitch.\u201d Tearfully, she apologizes. All with the cops listening. This is Walt\u2019s way of leaving the family free of any responsibility for his acts. They can\u2019t be blamed if they where under threat of violence. He knows the police are on the line, he wants them to think Skyler was blameless.\n\nAfter an ironically tender scene of Walt changing a diaper and cooing to the baby, Walt\u2019s most evil-genius self beams through: \u201cToe the line,\u201d he warns Skyler, \u201cor you will wind up just like Hank.\u201d\n\nHe abandons the baby at a fire station. And he\u2019s off, presumably with help from Saul and a new identity.\n\nTwo episodes left and zero sympathy remaining for the desperate, sick, empire builder.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Breaking Bad,Hank,Jesse Pinkman,Krysten Ritter,R.J.
