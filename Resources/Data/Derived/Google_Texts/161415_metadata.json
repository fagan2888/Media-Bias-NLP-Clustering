Traditional is a dance that exemplifies dignity, grace and modesty.\n\nThe women can move in several ways. Some move in a bounce style, originated by the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota of the north. Some Traditional Women dancers zigzag or sidestep in a circle around the arena, always with a bounce movement.\n\nThe dress is usually elegant yet simple; the women always carry an eagle feather fan which they raise in the air from time to time as the songs indicate, with an honor beat to show respect and honor for the men and the drum. The women wear a shawl that is kept close to the body, often with very intricate beadwork in patterns that reflect the tribe and family, and they carry an awl and knife on their belt. Their feet never rise above the ground.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Women's Traditional Dance, Part 6", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/29/pow-wow-dance-style-origins-womens-traditional-dance-part-6-157097", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/womens_traditional_2005_national_pow_wow_smithsonian_institution_katherine_fogden_0.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Women's Traditional Dance, Part 6"}, "abstract": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Women's Traditional Dance, Part 6", "dc": {"title": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Women's Traditional Dance, Part 6"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/29/pow-wow-dance-style-origins-womens-traditional-dance-part-6-157097", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "pow wow, Women's Traditional Dance, dance style origins", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-29T10:06-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Pow Wow Dance Style Origins: Women's Traditional Dance, Part 6"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd98\"", "article_summary": "Traditional Women dancers are looked on with reverence as the elegant presence at a pow wow.\nSome Traditional Women dancers zigzag or sidestep in a circle around the arena, always with a bounce movement.\nTraditional is a dance that exemplifies dignity, grace and modesty.\nSome move in a bounce style, originated by the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota of the north.\nThe women wear a shawl that is kept close to the body, often with very intricate beadwork in patterns that reflect the tribe and family, and they carry an awl and knife on their belt."}
