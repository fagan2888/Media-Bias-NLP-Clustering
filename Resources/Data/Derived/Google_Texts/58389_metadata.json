Pohl was wanted for child pornography found WTSP-Tampa\n\nFather Stephen Pohl was arrested by the Pinellas County (Fla.) Sheriff's Department. (Photo: Pinellas County Sheriff's Department)\n\nLouisville priest Stephen Pohl was still in a Florida jail this weekend after being arrested on a federal warrant for possession of child pornography Friday by the Pinellas County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nThe arrest, prompted by an alert from the Louisville FBI office, came only hours after Louisville archdiocese leaders held a news briefing in which they outlined results of an FBI investigation of the former pastor of St. Margaret Mary parish.\n\nThey said the investigation found child porn on Pohl\u2019s computer and also found up to 200 digital photos of St. Margaret Mary schoolchildren. All of the students were clothed, but investigators deemed some of the photos inappropriate.\n\nPohl, 57, who had been pastor of the parish since 2008, was recently put on leave in connection with the investigation, and he informed the archdiocese Thursday that he was resigning as pastor of the church.\n\nHe was next found in Pinellas County near Tampa Bay, Fla., by county deputies. According to Channel 10 TV in Tampa Bay, the sheriff\u2019s department had been alerted by the FBI that Pohl was in the area and was wanted on a federal warrant.\n\nPohl was arrested and booked into the county jail shortly before 9 p.m. Friday on a single charge of possession of child pornography.\n\nLaw enforcement officials either could not be reached for comment Saturday or shared only basic information, and it was unclear why Pohl was in Florida or how the federal investigators were able to determine he was in Pinellas County.\n\nDuring a news briefing hours before the arrest, Louisville Archdiocese Chancellor Brian Reynolds said the FBI cyber crimes investigation \u2014 prompted after a child told a family member about a photo that was taken that \u201cbothered the child\u201d \u2014 is still ongoing and could take months. The information the archdiocese shared Friday was from an interim investigation report officials received a day earlier.\n\nArchdiocese officials haven\u2019t seen the photos of the students, or gotten a description of them, and couldn\u2019t say Friday who is in them, how far back they date or what about them is inappropriate. There were boys and girls, and they were apparently taken on parish grounds. Some parents have said some were taken with children\u2019s permission, Reynolds said.\n\nDuring the news briefing early Friday afternoon, Cecelia Price, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said she wasn\u2019t aware of any previous disciplinary issues facing Pohl. She declined to release Pohl\u2019s personnel file Friday but said he\u2019d previously held appointments at St. Monica, St. Thomas and Basilica of St. Joseph parishes in Bardstown, Ky., and St. Athanasius and St. Gabriel parishes in Louisville dating back to the mid-1980s.\n\nJeff Watkins can be reached at jwatkins@courier-journal.com and Kirsten Clark can be reached at kclark@courier-journal.com.
