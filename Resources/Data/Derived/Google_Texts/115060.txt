Republican U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers and her challenger, Democrat Clay Aiken faced off at an hour-long debate Monday in Pinehurst. They discussed a number of topics, ranging from ISIS to the Affordable Care Act to immigration. Ellmers referred to Aiken several times as an "entertainer," and did her best to connect her opponent to President Obama.

"There's a clear choice here," said Ellmers. "Myself, who believes in conservative principles, or my opponent, who would be nothing more than a rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama on so many issues."

For his part, Aiken made sure to connect Ellmers with John Boehner, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. He said he's frustrated by Ellmers and other Republicans not reaching across the aisle to resolve issues:

"I'm tired in general of this sending people back to Washington who say the same thing and then every two years come back and say it again and then go and don't do it."

The debate was held at a North Carolina Bankers Association conference. It will be televised tonight at 7 o'clock on WRAL and at 11 0'clock on WRAZ-TV.
