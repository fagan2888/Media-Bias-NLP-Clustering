(Republican Eagle photo by Kyle Stevens)\n\nKASSON \u2013 After steamrolling through its second- and third-round duals by a combined 109-20 score, Ellsworth faced two of Minnesota\u2019s top teams in No. 3 (Class 3A) Prior Lake and fifth-ranked, and defending Class 2A champion, Kasson-Mantorville.\n\nThe way to two duals ended, as well as the finish to the Lakers/KoMets match, made for an entertaining Swalla Duals Saturday at K-M High School.\n\nThe Panthers fell behind in both championship-round duals, slipping to deficits of 13-0 against the Lakers, and 10-0 against the KoMets.\n\nIn what could be described as a midterm, Ellsworth rebounded to defeat the Lakers 34-31, but fell to the KoMets, 33-30.\n\n\u201cFor team state, it\u2019s a really healthy thing, just simple things like letting guys get ready in back, not being seen, how to approach a match. It\u2019s totally different than when you approach it individually and you just have to worry about yourself,\u201d said Ellsworth head coach Chad Steldt. \u201cSo, in that aspect, the last two weekends for us have been very efficient for us that way. They\u2019ve been good.\u201d\n\nThe rally against Prior Lake started with Jens Lantz, Ellsworth\u2019s three-time defending state champion, and his dominating 19-7 major decision over Kenny O\u2019Neill at 126 pounds.\n\nAt 132, Prior Lake\u2019s Tyler Hanson pinned Riley Melstrom in 1 minute, 53 seconds but Braid Cain (138) responded and majored Wyatt Benson 11-0. Tristan Mueller took 58 seconds to pin his way to victory at 145, Josh Hines secured a 9-3 win at 152, Gable Frandsen eked out a 5-4 decision at 160 followed by Logan Kemmerer\u2019s fall over Robby Schultz. Dennis Schutz closed the impressive stretch of wins with a 5-4 decision at 182.\n\nThat left the score in the Panthers\u2019 favor, 29-19, with three weights remaining. And, combined, the final three bouts took less than three minutes.\n\nRylee Streifel and Alex Hart put the Lakers on top 31-28 with consecutive pins, as well as a one-point deduction for the Panthers for arguing with the official.\n\nThat left Brody Kemmerer, at 285, to win the dual.\n\nAnd Brody responded by using all of 38 seconds to put Jerrod Chambers on his back for a 34-31 victory.\n\n\u201cBrody\u2019s kind of coming back off an ankle injury, he\u2019s working hard and kind of nursing that,\u201d Steldt said. \u201cHe kind of fell into a nice toss there. It was good for him and good for the team.\u201d\n\nThe excitement had to be tempered, however, as mere moments after celebrating a final-weight win, Ellsworth was back on the mat against K-M in rematch of a Dec. 14 dual won by the KoMets, 39-22.\n\nIt would not be as easy this time.\n\nAnders (120) and Jens Lantz (126) got the Panthers on the board, and to within a point, with a 9-4 decision and a 49-second fall, respectively.\n\nEllsworth took and expanded a lead in similar fashion at 132 and 138 with Melstrom\u2019s 5-2 victory, and a pin from Cain.\n\nK-M came back at 145 with top-ranked Brady Berge, who earned five points with a 26-11 technical fall, and at 152, with Aaron Berge, a 9-4 decision that tied the dual 18-18.\n\nThe KoMets forfeited at 160, giving the Panthers a lead that grew to 12 with Logan Kemmerer and Schutz decisions. But K-M battled back with a fall at 195, and a controversial 3-2 decision that saw Kasson\u2019s Bryce Seljan earn two-thirds of his points on stalling calls, much to the delight of the KoMets fans that were screaming for it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the atmosphere that\u2019s good for wrestling. I wish it would have ended differently, but I think we\u2019ve got to get some guys doing some more offensive things, not being so defensive,\u201d Steldt said.\n\n\u201cAt 120, we had the same type of match, and we never saw any stalling calls,\u201d Steldt continued. \u201cThen, at the end of the dual, just because the fans got involved, we see a stalling call. A little immature reffing, a little inexperience, but it is what it is. Our guys still have to perform, it\u2019s not an excuse. Our guy didn\u2019t do anything offensive. It is what it is.\u201d\n\nThat left Ellsworth with a 33-30 lead, and the nation\u2019s No. 1 high school heavyweight on deck. Steldt chose to forfeit the match, giving the KoMets the dual victory.\n\nPrior Lake ended up as tournament champion after the Lakers defeated K-M, 43-22. The three-team tie \u2013 Ellsworth, Prior Lake and K-M all went 1-1 in the championship bracket \u2013 was broken by a total of team points. Prior Lake totaled 73 points, while Ellsworth ended with 67 and K-M 58, though, officially, the Panthers and KoMets tied for second place.\n\nThe Panthers will take their No. 1 ranking in Wisconsin\u2019s Division 2 into Thursday\u2019s Middle Border Conference dual at No. 5 Amery.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,wrestling,Ellsworth Panthers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kyle Stevens", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "KASSON \u2013 After steamrolling through its second- and third-round duals by a combined 109-20 score, Ellsworth faced two of Minnesota\u2019s top teams in No. 3 (Class 3A) Prior Lake and fifth-ranked, and defending Class 2A champion, Kasson-Mantorville.\r\nThe way to two duals ended, as well as the finish ...", "title": "Wrestling: Ellsworth ties for second at Swalla Duals", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/wrestling-ellsworth-ties-second-swalla-duals", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Brody%20Kemmerer.jpg?itok=MAChE5eC", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "KASSON \u2013 After steamrolling through its second- and third-round duals by a combined 109-20 score, Ellsworth faced two of Minnesota\u2019s top teams in No. 3 (Class 3A) Prior Lake and fifth-ranked, and defending Class 2A champion, Kasson-Mantorville.\r\nThe way to two duals ended, as well as the finish ...", "title": "Wrestling: Ellsworth ties for second at Swalla Duals", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/wrestling-ellsworth-ties-second-swalla-duals", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Brody%20Kemmerer.jpg?itok=DxEGy0Cv", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,high school,wrestling,Ellsworth Panthers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,high school,wrestling,Ellsworth Panthers", "modified_time": "2014-01-26T11:50:55-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Ellsworth's Brody Kemmerer, left, and his teammates celebrate after Kemmerer pinned Prior Lake's Jerrod Chambers in 38 seconds to give the Panthers a 34-31 victory over the Lakers at Saturday's Swalla Duals in Kasson.
