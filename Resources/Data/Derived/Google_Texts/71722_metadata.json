The IRS announced that the emails had gone missing on Friday, prompting House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp to fume, \u201cThere needs to be an immediate investigation and forensic audit by Department of Justice as well as the Inspector General.\u201d Cruz went further, tweeting out a call by Ron Fournier of National Journal for a special prosecutor.\n\nThe IRS\u2019 activity is surely criminal, under 26 US Code Section 7212 and 5 US Code Section 7323. As I write in my book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration, \u201cthe IRS and the Obama administration violated both the Hatch Act and the \u2018omnibus\u2019 provision of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBut here\u2019s the reality: the DOJ will not investigate, and the Obama administration will never sanction a special prosecutor. In March, Eric Holder denied Cruz\u2019s request for a special prosecutor on the IRS issue. Which means that, as usual, the executive branch is entirely unanswerable for its crimes.\n\nThe Obama administration knows that. Which is why the administration has no problem whatsoever abusing its power to grant access to the United States to Mexican gang members. As the Washington Times reported today, \u201cBorder Patrol officials are swamped by the number of minors crossing illegally into the United States and frustrated that they can\u2019t turn away known Mexican gang members.\u201d\n\nThis is a purposeful attempt by the Obama administration to shift the 2014 election conversation to immigration, as opposed to Obamacare \u2013 and the designed humanitarian crisis has been purposefully created, in violation of law, to give President Obama the supposed moral impetus for unilateral executive action, as I wrote back in early April.\n\nThe Obama White House\u2019s decision not to prosecute or deport the so-called DREAMers \u2013 illegal immigrants between the ages of 16 and 30 who arrived as minors in the United States \u2013 did not constitute an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It was pure obstruction of justice. As I write in the book:\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s obstruction of justice has been most egregious with regard to enforcement of federal and state immigration law\u2026.Nothing in the Constitution gave Obama the authority to allow selective prosecution of different types of illegal immigrants. If he wanted to push immigration reform, he could have done it throughout his presidency.\n\nSo, if the Obama administration routinely engages in illegal activity \u2013 which it does \u2013 what\u2019s the solution? It isn\u2019t to plead with Eric Holder to suddenly start policing himself, especially given the fact that Holder is probably the lead criminal in the administration. And it isn\u2019t impeachment, given that the entire Obama administration is honeycombed with criminality, and that impeachment has been used a grand total of 19 times by the House and only 8 Senate convictions have ever been reached \u2013 one every three decades or so.\n\nThe answer is to devolve authority to the people of the United States to sue members of the executive branch under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970. We must become, as the Supreme Court put it regarding RICO, \u201c\u2018private attorneys general\u2019 on a serious national problem for which public prosecutorial resources are deemed inadequate.\u201d The executive branch is the \u201cserious national problem.\u201d We are the solution. Want to do something about it? Call your congresspeople and push them to amend RICO to allow private suits against the executive branch.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
