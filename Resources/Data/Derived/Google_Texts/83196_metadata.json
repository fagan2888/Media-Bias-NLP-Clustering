Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, is spearheading the push, but there is serious skepticism within his leadership and in the House Republican Conference that he will be able to rally GOP lawmakers around a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force.\u201d\n\n--\u201cSome senior rank-and-file Republicans even wonder why he\u2019s bringing the issue back to the forefront, with just a year left in President Barack Obama\u2019s term \u2026 House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) will kick off the process in earnest Thursday when he begins a series of meetings with Republicans to gauge support \u2014 and potential tripwires \u2014 for a measure that would provide explicit congressional authorization for the battle against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, or ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a practical sense, there are two main points of contention: Whether to bar widespread use of U.S. combat troops in Syria and Iraq, and placing limits on the time for American military operations. Many Democrats would like to explicitly prohibit Obama from sending combat forces into battle.\u201d http://goo.gl/Vyv93R\n\n--Flashback to Dec. 11 in CQ Roll Call, from Niels Lesniewski: \u201cMitch McConnell: New War Authorization Not Happening Anytime Soon.\u201d http://goo.gl/GzKxpM\n\nOBAMACARE: THIS TIME, IT\u2019S FOR REAL \u2013 Hill Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare \u2013 stop us if you\u2019ve heard this before -- but now, it\u2019s actually getting sent to the White House. Not only was the repeal a key messaging exercise, but could lay the groundwork for actually dismantling the law in 2017 if Republicans retain control of Congress and win the White House, as Jennifer Steinhauer explains: \u201cWhile Democrats dismissed the bill \u2014 which would also remove funding for Planned Parenthood \u2014 as another ploy in the partisan drama that has played out in the Capitol since the law was enacted in 2010, the vote proved that a Republican congressional majority could deliver a measure that repeals the health law to a Republican president, even in the face of united opposition from Democrats.\u201d\n\n--\u201c \u2018This is a big deal,\u2019 said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington and a former longtime Republican staff member on the Senate Budget Committee \u2026 Even among Republicans, Mr. Hoagland said, \u2018there is a recognition that you may not do away with a number of the provisions that are popular.\u2019 But, he added, \u2018if you can push away the politics of it, you will find there are a number of provisions that Democrats would agree could be changed,\u2019 no matter who is president.\u201d http://goo.gl/MYaBLd\n\nLABRADOR: PAUL RYAN HONEYMOON \u2018OVER\u2019 \u2013 Honestly, this lasted longer than we thought it would. Lauren French for POLITICO: \u201cRep. Raul Labrador \u2014 a leader in the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 said on Wednesday that Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has not yet transformed the House in the ways he promised during last fall's speaker elections. But unlike past battles between conservatives and leadership, there are no immediate calls for Ryan to step down or be removed from his post.\u201d\n\n--\u201c \u2018It's too early to judge the speakership of Paul Ryan and I think it is fundamentally unfair to try and judge the speakership of Paul Ryan over the last month or so. But, as I have also said, the honeymoon is over,\u2019 said Labrador, an Idaho Republican \u2026 But Labrador added that Ryan has a year to push forward conservative legislation and further reform the House's rules and procedures before conservatives will really judge him.\u201d http://goo.gl/li0T3a\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY, Jan. 06, 2016 and you\u2019re reading The Huddle, a newsletter that will be free of any birther speculation. As always, I\u2019m at skim@politico.com or on Twitter at @seungminkim.\n\nMy new followers include @barrettmarson and @SternEverett.\n\nTODAY IN CONGRESS \u2013 The House is in at 10 a.m. with the sole series of votes around 3:15 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. On tap are the SCRUB Act and the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. The Senate is gone fishin\u2019.\n\nAROUND THE HILL \u2013 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will hold her weekly news conference at 10:45 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Speaker Paul Ryan will follow with his weekly presser at 11:30 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Ways and Means Committee Democrats will hold a forum on currency manipulation and trade starting at 12:30 p.m. in HVC-215. Ryan will host an enrollment ceremony for the Obamacare repeal bill at 4:30 p.m. in H-207.\n\nNOT AROUND THE HILL -- Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe may have got out over his skis this week while in Havana. The Democratic governor was quoted in the Washington Post (https://goo.gl/CxfDy2) saying he\u2019s coming to D.C. today to meet with Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other House and Senate leaders about the trade embargo with Cuba. One problem: The Senate isn\u2019t in session and McConnell isn\u2019t in Washington, according to an aide.\n\nINTEL OFFICIALS DENY NSA SNOOPING \u2013 Deirdre Walsh with the scoop for CNN: \u201cTop U.S. intelligence officials told the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday that the National Security Agency did not spy on any members of Congress during last year's contentious Iran nuclear debate.\u201d\n\n--\u201cThe testimony came in response to concerns raised by the panel about a Wall Street Journal report last month that said the U.S., while surveilling U.S. allies, also snooped on some members of Congress, according to members of the House Intelligence Committee who attended a classified briefing on the matter. \u2018They were not listening to or monitoring representatives or members of Congress,\u2019 Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart, who serves on the panel, told CNN.\u201d http://goo.gl/uvnkvj\n\nWALDEN SYMPATHIZES WITH OREGON PROTESTERS \u2013 Mike DeBonis for WaPo: \u201cRep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, represents the vast district where the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is and said he has known the now-jailed ranchers whose case brought the protesters to Oregon for the better part of two decades. On Tuesday night, Walden spent 20 minutes on the House floor \u2014 his voice cracking at times \u2014 saying that the protests should prompt a new look at federal land policies and their enforcement.\u201d\n\n--\u201c \u2018This is a government that has gone too far for too long,\u2019 Walden said. \u2018Now I\u2019m not condoning this takeover in any way, I want to make that clear. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. There\u2019s a right to protest. I think they\u2019ve gone too far. But I understand and hear their anger.\u2019\u201d https://goo.gl/D2sRy0\n\nBYRNE\u2019S EMOTIONAL GUN TESTIMONY \u2013 The Washington Post\u2019s Amber Phillips writes up Rep. Bradley Byrne\u2019s remarkable interview on C-Span about his family\u2019s experience with gun violence: \u201c\u2018This is not an abstract issue for me,\u2019 he said. \u2018My grandfather was shot and killed by a mentally ill person. And it devastated my family. It devastated my mother and grandmother and my two uncles. So when we talk about people who have been shot by mentally ill people, I understand it. I understand what it does do the victims.\u2019 The former state senator and one-time Alabama gubernatorial candidate, who won a special election to Congress in 2013, went on to say that, even though his family was brought to its knees by gun violence, he doesn't think Obama's curbing access to guns is the answer.\u201d https://goo.gl/O1T2se\n\n--More on guns: Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who chairs the Senate panel overseeing DOJ money, has asked Attorney General Loretta Lynch to testify Jan. 28. CQ Roll Call: http://goo.gl/mORMig\n\nDEMS RIP BENGHAZI PANEL AS PETRAEUS TESTIFIES \u2013 Rachael Bade with the latest twists and turns of the controversial committee: \u201cDemocrats said Wednesday marks the 609th day the Benghazi committee has been working since it started its investigation in the spring of 2014, \u2018surpassing the length of time the 9/11 Commission took to investigate the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.\u2019 \u2026 Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) in a gaggle with reporters Wednesday afternoon said there\u2019s nothing he can do about the timing because they\u2019re still waiting on several outstanding document requests from State Department, the CIA and the White House that are key to the investigation.\u201d\n\n--\u201cBehind the scenes, GOP sources say the panel is working toward a conclusion this spring and slow responses from the administration have bogged down the process. The committee asked for documents from Clinton\u2019s top aides, the White House, and intelligence and defense agencies, but only started receiving some of them in the past few months.\u201d http://goo.gl/55KFzX\n\nLIBERALS WANT TO OUST DWS \u2013 The Huffington Post\u2019s Samantha Lachman: \u201cThe progressive activist organization CREDO Mobile launched a petition Wednesday evening calling on the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), to resign from her post \u2026 Earlier on Wednesday, the DNC chair suggested in a New York Times Magazine interview that there is \u2018a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided.\u2019 The comment \u2026immediately angered reproductive rights activists.\u201d http://goo.gl/xKgXKD\n\nWEDNESDAY\u2019S TRIVIA WINNER \u2013 We gave it to Patrick Boland, because he quickly answered \u201csome hotel\u201d for the question of where the chairman of Standard Oil was held by Congress during the Teapot Dome scandal. Matthew Shapanka was the first to correctly chime in that it was the Willard Hotel. And yes, the first name of the chairman\u2019s name was incorrect \u2013 it was Robert, not David.\n\nTODAY\u2019S TRIVIA \u2013 Patrick has today\u2019s question: Harrison Ford, a.k.a.

This method is used to determine book income and tax liability.\n\nUnder some tax reform proposals, family-owned American wine and spirits wholesalers would be forced to pay massive retroactive taxes on their LIFO reserves. This tax on family businesses would result in a tax increase equivalent to $2,642 for every one of the industry\u2019s 65,000 employees.\n\nLIFO repeal results in higher future tax bills that are particularly burdensome for family companies and threatens wine and spirits wholesalers\u2019 ability to invest in new inventory, employees, training, equipment and technology.\n\nWSWA opposes the repeal of LIFO. http://www.wswa.org/facts-data **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "title": "POLITICO Huddle: RYAN TESTING THE AUMF WATERS \u2013 Obamacare repeal reaches White House \u2013 RYAN\u2019S HONEYMOON OVER? \u2013 Intel officials deny NSA snooping \u2013 DEMS RIP BENGHAZI PANEL, AGAIN", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/huddle/2016/01/politico-huddle-ryan-testing-the-aumf-waters-obamacare-repeal-reaches-white-house-ryans-honeymoon-over-intel-officials-deny-nsa-snooping-dems-rip-benghazi-panel-again-212041", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ways and Means Committee Democrats will hold a forum on currency manipulation and trade starting at 12:30 p.m. in HVC-215.\nPOLITICO Huddle: RYAN TESTING THE AUMF WATERS \u2013 Obamacare repeal reaches White House \u2013 RYAN\u2019S HONEYMOON OVER?\nSpeaker Paul Ryan will follow with his weekly presser at 11:30 a.m. in HVC Studio A.\nBut unlike past battles between conservatives and leadership, there are no immediate calls for Ryan to step down or be removed from his post.\u201d--\u201c \u2018It's too early to judge the speakership of Paul Ryan and I think it is fundamentally unfair to try and judge the speakership of Paul Ryan over the last month or so.\nHan Solo, has testified on the Hill has testified two times in front of both House and Senate panels."}
