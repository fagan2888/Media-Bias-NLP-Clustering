I\u2019ve worked with all sorts of people, institutions, and systems in education and with businesses, governments, and cultural organizations. I\u2019ve directed practical initiatives with schools, districts, and governments; taught in universities; and helped to set up new institutions.\n\nIn all of this, I\u2019ve been pushing for more balanced and individualized and creative approaches to education. In the last ten years especially, I hear people everywhere saying how exasperated they are by the deadening effects of testing and standardization on them, their children, or their friends. Often they feel helpless and say there\u2019s nothing they can do to change education. Some people tell me they enjoy my talks online but are frustrated that I don\u2019t say what they can do to change the system. I have three responses. The first is, \u201cIt was an eighteen-minute talk; give me a break.\u201d The second is, \u201cIf you\u2019re really interested in what I think, I\u2019ve published various other books, reports, and strategies on all of this, which you may find helpful.\u201d The third response is this book.\n\nI\u2019m often asked the same questions: What\u2019s going wrong in education and why? If you could reinvent education, what would it look like? Would you have schools? Would there be different types? What would go on in them? Would everyone have to go, and how old would they have to be? Would there be tests? And if you say I can make a difference in education, where do I begin?\n\nThe most fundamental question is, what is education for? People differ sharply on this question. Like \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201ceducation\u201d is an example of what the philosopher Walter Bryce Gallie called an \u201cessentially contested concept.\u201d It means different things to different people according to their cultural values and how they view related issues like ethnicity, gender, poverty, and social class. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t discuss it or do anything about it. We just need to be clear on terms.2 So, before we go on, let me say a few words about the terms \u201clearning,\u201d \u201ceducation,\u201d \u201ctraining,\u201d and \u201cschool,\u201d which are sometimes confused.\n\nLearning is the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills. Human beings are highly curious learning organisms. From the moment they\u2019re born, young children have a voracious appetite for learning. For too many, that appetite starts to dull as they go through school. Keeping it alive is the key to transforming education. Education means organized programs of learning. The assumption of formal education is that young people need to know, understand, and be able to do things that they wouldn\u2019t if left to their own devices. What those things are and how education should be organized to help students learn them are core issues here.\n\nTraining is a type of education that\u2019s focused on learning specific skills. I remember earnest debates as a student about the difficulty of distinguishing between education and training. The difference was clear enough when we talked about sex education. Most parents would be happy to know their teenagers had sex education at school; they\u2019d probably be less happy if they\u2019d had sex training.\n\nBy schools, I don\u2019t mean only the conventional facilities that we are used to for children and teenagers. I mean any community of people that comes together to learn with each other. School, as I use the term here, includes homeschooling, un-schooling, and informal gatherings both in person and online from kindergarten to college and beyond. Some features of conventional schools have little to do with learning and can actively get in the way of it. The revolution we need involves rethinking how schools work and what counts as a school. It\u2019s also about trusting in a different story about education.\n\nWe all love stories, even if they\u2019re not true. As we grow up, one of the ways we learn about the world is through the stories we hear.\n\nSome are about particular events and personalities within our personal circles of family and friends. Some are part of the larger cultures we belong to\u2014 the myths, fables, and fairy tales about our own ways of life that have captivated people for generations. In stories that are told often, the line between fact and myth can become so blurred that we easily mistake one for the other. This is true of a story that many people believe about education, even though it\u2019s not real and never really was. It goes like this: Young children go to elementary school mainly to learn the basic skills of reading, writing, and mathematics. These skills are essential so they can do well academically in high school. If they go on to higher education and graduate with a good degree, they\u2019ll find a well-paid job and the country will prosper too.\n\nIn this story, real intelligence is what you use in academic studies: children are born with different amounts of this intelligence, and so naturally some do well at school and some don\u2019t.\n\nThe ones who are really intelligent go on to good universities with other academically bright students. Those who graduate with a good university degree are guaranteed a well-paid\n\nprofessional job with their own office. Students who are less intelligent naturally do less well at school. Some may fail or drop out. Some who finish high school may not go any further in education and look for a lower-income job instead. Some will go on to college but take less academic, vocational courses and get a decent service or manual job, with their own toolkit.\n\nWhen it\u2019s put so baldly, this story may seem too much of a caricature. But when you look at what goes on in many schools, when you listen to what many parents expect of and for their children, when you consider what so many policymakers around the world are actually doing, it seems that they really believe that the current systems of education are basically sound; they\u2019re just not working as well as they should because standards have fallen. Consequently, most efforts are focused on raising standards through more competition and accountability. You may believe this story too and wonder what\u2019s wrong with it.\n\nThis story is a dangerous myth. It is one of the main reasons why so many reform efforts do not work. On the contrary, they often compound the very problems they claim to be solving. The include the alarming rates of nongraduation from schools and colleges, the levels of stress and depression\u2014 even suicide\u2014 among students and their teachers, the falling value of a university degree, the rocketing costs of getting one, and the rising levels of unemployment among graduates and nongraduates alike.\n\nPoliticians often scratch their heads over these problems. Sometimes, they punish schools for not making the grade. Sometimes, they fund remedial programs to get them back on track.\n\nBut the problems persist and in many ways they\u2019re getting worse. The reason is that many of these problems are being caused by the system itself. All systems behave in ways that are particular to them.
