This could drag the EMU core states into a recession and aggravate their own debt and ageing crises. The clear implication of the IMF paper is that Germany and the creditor core would do better to bite the bullet on big write-offs immediately rather than buying time with creeping debt mutualisation.\n\nThe magnitude of the debt problem is \"difficult to overstate,\" says the paper. \"The current central government debt in advanced economies is approaching a two-century high-water mark.\"\n\nThe IMF working paper said debt burdens in developed nations have become extreme by any historical measure and will require a wave of haircuts, either negotiated 1930s-style write-offs or the standard mix of measures used by the IMF in its \"toolkit\" for emerging market blow-ups.\n\n\"The size of the problem suggests that restructurings will be needed, for example, in the periphery of Europe, far beyond anything discussed in public to this point,\" said the paper, by Harvard professors Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.\n\nThe paper said policy elites in the West are still clinging to the illusion that rich countries are different from poorer regions and can therefore chip away at their debts with a blend of austerity cuts, growth, and tinkering (\"forbearance\").\n\nThe presumption is that advanced economies \"do not resort to such gimmicks\" such as debt restructuring and repression, which would \"give up hard-earned credibility\" and throw the economy into a \"vicious circle\".\n\nBut the paper says this mantra borders on \"collective amnesia\" of European and US history, and is built on \"overly optimistic\" assumptions that risk doing far more damage to credibility in the end. It is causing the crisis to drag on, blocking a lasting solution. \"This denial has led to policies that in some cases risk exacerbating the final costs,\" it said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/01/_imf_paper_warns_of_haircuts_and_massive_debt_write_offs.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog:  IMF paper warns of 'haircuts' and massive debt write offs"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ee2\"", "article_summary": "The clear implication of the IMF paper is that Germany and the creditor core would do better to bite the bullet on big write-offs immediately rather than buying time with creeping debt mutualisation.\nThe paper says the Western debt burden is now so big that rich states will need same tonic of debt haircuts, higher inflation and financial repression - defined as an \"opaque tax on savers\" - as used in countless IMF rescues for emerging markets.\nThis could drag the EMU core states into a recession and aggravate their own debt and ageing crises.\nThe magnitude of the debt problem is \"difficult to overstate,\" says the paper.\n\"This denial has led to policies that in some cases risk exacerbating the final costs,\" it said."}
