In a short week, we probably didn\u2019t do as good a job as we should have to prepare for that full-field action.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, fifth-seeded Denver nearly climbed out of a five-goal hole against the defending national champions. The Pioneers cut a 10-5 deficit to 11-10, in the process chasing Duke goalie Luke Aaron. The teams then swapped goals, with Zach Miller pulling Denver within 12-11 with 11:09 to play.\n\nThe Pioneers almost tied it with 10:08 to go when Berg tried to one-time a deftly placed pass at the goalmouth. However, he never controlled the pass, and the ball trickled into the crease, and Keenan scored less than two minutes later to re-establish a multigoal lead for Duke.\n\n\u201cThey had a phenomenal game plan and executed it well, but I thought we had our chances,\u201d Noble said. \u201cI thought offensively we had a chance to win the game. We hit a few pipes, dropped a couple passes. That was the difference in the game.\u201d\n\nDenver didn\u2019t enjoy nearly the same success against Duke backup goalie Kyle Turri, who made four stops in less than a quarter of work. The Blue Devils\u2019 defense also stiffened, especially after Duke rattled off three consecutive goals to establish a four-goal edge.\n\nTyler Pace chipped into that deficit with his score with 6:29 to go, but the Pioneers couldn\u2019t generate many quality chances after expending so much effort to make it a close game again.\n\n\u201cWe never felt out of it,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cWe felt we made that run. You get to one, you\u2019re either going to win if you score the next goal, or it might be too much having done that. That\u2019s what happened today.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils will face sixth-seeded Notre Dame (12-5), an 11-6 winner over No. 7 Maryland, in Monday\u2019s final.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU Pioneers lose to Duke in men\u2019s lacrosse semifinal", "title": "DU Pioneers lose to Duke in men\u2019s lacrosse semifinal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/24/du-pioneers-lose-to-duke-in-mens-lacrosse-semifinal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__68ff3a004b441b14550f6a706700c24ap1.jpg", "height": 508}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__68ff3a004b441b14550f6a706700c24ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-24T14:03:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:34:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd212\"", "article_summary": "Attackman Wesley Berg scored five goals for fifth-seeded Denver (16-3), which fell in the semifinals for the third time in the last four seasons.\nThe Pioneers cut a 10-5 deficit to 11-10, in the process chasing Duke goalie Luke Aaron.\nThe Blue Devils\u2019 defense also stiffened, especially after Duke rattled off three consecutive goals to establish a four-goal edge.\nBALTIMORE \u2014 Denver\u2019s latest trip to the lacrosse Final Four ended much the same way its first two did.\nThe Pioneers almost tied it with 10:08 to go when Berg tried to one-time a deftly placed pass at the goalmouth."}
