Missouri has no limits on political contributions or lobbyist-paid meals, entertainment and gifts.\n\nSome lawmakers want strict caps on both; others argue that faster, more precise reporting is enough.\n\nThe fate of ethics legislation was the first question posed to Webber and state Reps. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, and Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, during the meeting, which drew about 75 people to the Columbia Public Library.\n\n\u201cCampaign finance and campaign finance limits dominate everything else as the overriding concern of any ethics or anti-corruption bills in Missouri,\u201d Webber said. \u201cIf we do not stop that, if we do not address the issue of million-dollar checks, then everything else is window dressing.\u201d\n\nRowden has filed several bills addressing ethics issues. His legislation would ban lobbyist gifts, stop the \u201crevolving door\u201d of legislators taking jobs as lobbyists immediately after leaving office and open the books of not-for-profits involved in campaigns to reveal their donors.\n\nSix former House members who left office in December or January, including Kendrick\u2019s predecessor, Chris Kelly, are now working as lobbyists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t inherently believe that there is corruption. I don\u2019t believe that votes are being bought,\u201d Rowden said. \u201cBut I do believe the public perception that says there is something that needs to be done to shore up the confidence our constituents have in us as representatives.\u201d\n\nKendrick, who has been in office for about a month, said he already sees the need for stronger ethics laws. \u201cWe have to stop the major donations that are happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has eroded the trust of the general public.\u201d\n\nThe wide-ranging forum touched on many issues pending before lawmakers.\n\nWebber and Kendrick endorsed, as they have before, using federal funds provided by the 2010 Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid eligibility. Rowden, who has not explicitly endorsed expansion, said he\u2019s willing to discuss it, unlike many GOP lawmakers.\n\nKendrick and Webber were strongly opposed to right-to-work legislation being pushed by many Republicans, while Rowden said he had not decided how he would vote. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in any way that right-to-work is a silver bullet,\u201d Rowden said.\n\nWith dominant majorities in both chambers, Republicans can pass any legislation over Gov. Jay Nixon\u2019s vetoes if they remain united. Rowden said Republicans would prefer to write major legislation so it can become law with Nixon\u2019s support. Nixon has promised to be more engaged and to work more closely with the General Assembly, Rowden noted.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"description": "The wrong word is being used to describe the debate over lobbying and campaign finance laws, state Rep.
