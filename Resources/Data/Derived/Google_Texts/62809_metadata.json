Restrictions barring sex offenders from living within a certain distance of schools or playgrounds might make communities feel safer, and, as I\u2019ve found in my own experience, the registry can provide some solace for abuse survivors and their families. But the strings attached to sex offender registration are \u2014 like drug laws \u2014 numerous, generally non-specific and replete with lengthy, often unfit penalties.\n\nWhat I mean to say is: sex offenders frequently face mandatory minimums when they don\u2019t comply with any one of the innumerable restrictions placed on their lives, and mandatory minimums are something of which we should be skeptical.\n\nHere\u2019s an example to illustrate why: Joshua Gravens, a social justice scholar from Dallas, studies the impact of placing children on sex offender registries, the ramifications of which he understands firsthand. When he was 12, Gravens \u2014 who was raped by three high school students when he was a young boy and didn\u2019t tell anyone \u2014 touched his younger sister\u2019s vagina two times. As Lenore Skenazy at Reason tells it, then-adolescent Gravens quickly found himself in the hands of the criminal justice system, after his sister told their mother what happened and he told the truth:\n\nTheir mom called a counseling service for advice. The counsellor said Josh\u2019s mother was required to report his crime to the authorities and the next day, he was arrested. He spent the next four years in juvenile prison: the Texas Youth Commission, as it is officially called. The charge was \u201caggravated sexual assault,\u201d because any sex offense against a person under age 14 is automatically \u201caggravated.\u201d He got out at age 16 and was put on the sex offender registry, which, in Dallas, requires him to report in person to the authorities once a year, as well as anytime anything in his life changes.\n\nWell, 27-year-old Gravens\u2019s life did change recently \u2014 he, his wife and their children moved into a new home \u2014 which means he had to visit the registry to report the change within a week of it happening. Skenazy accompanied Gravens to the registry when he went to notify officials, but when they arrived, the unforeseen happened:", "article_metadata": {"description": "For sex offenders, at least.
