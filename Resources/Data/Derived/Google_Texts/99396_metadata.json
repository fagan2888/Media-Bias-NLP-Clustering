Coventry Telegraph\n\nBeing able to lick the ice cream off your own nose is a fine party trick, and it\u2019s one Stephen Taylor \u2014 the man with the world\u2019s longest tongue \u2014 has undoubtedly pulled. But such a feat comes with certain costs, one that Taylor bears daily and another he risks while he sleeps.\n\nTaylor\u2019s tongue is 3.8 inches long (9.8 centimeters), according to Guinness World Records\u2019 measure. By some accounts, it\u2019s still growing, thanks to the exercises Taylor performs to keep his record-breaking muscle from becoming inflexible. While entertaining \u2014 or revolting, depending on whom you ask \u2014 Taylor\u2019s risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) greatly increases because of the abnormality. He also speaks with a lisp, as his tongue crowds his mouth and makes enunciating more difficult.\n\n\u201cWhere a very, very large tongue could cause problems is if someone has, as a consequence of a very large tongue, a very narrow airway,\u201d said otolaryngologist Dr. Mike Papesch. \u201cAs a result of that, at night, particularly while they\u2019re lying flat, the tongue can move backward and they can get obstruction of their breathing, which is known as obstructive sleep apnea.\u201d\n\nTaylor says he hasn\u2019t faced OSA yet \u2014 despite it being particularly tricky to self-diagnose, as the patient is asleep when he suffers from it. Aside from the lisp, his only complaint is that he tends to bite the tongue on accident.\n\n\u201cI do tend to bite my tongue a lot, and it\u2019s usually when I\u2019m asleep at night,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t see any other problems with the tongue.\u201d\n\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs most often in the elderly and the obese, sometimes even in heavy users of cigarettes or alcohol, depending on how relaxed the muscles of the upper airway become. In obese sufferers, the buildup of tissue is what causes the obstruction. In the elderly, OSA typically results from a weakened set of muscles keeping the airway open.\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t cause Taylor or his partner, Rachel, any sleep troubles, the tongue isn\u2019t always met with the warmest of welcomes.\n\n\u201cWhen Steve kisses me I prefer him to just give me a pucker type of kiss, instead of a french kiss\u2026because of the length of his tongue,\u201d she said.\n\nUnfortunately for Rachel, her partner\u2019s tongue is still growing. Taylor originally had his tongue measured for the world record in 2009. At the time, his tongue measured 9.5 centimeters from \u201cthe tip of the tongue to the center of the closed lips,\u201d according to Marco Frigatti, of Guinness World Records. Since then, the body\u2019s strongest muscle pound for pound has increased in size by half of a centimeter.\n\n\u201cIt keeps growing, probably because of all the TV shows where I\u2019ve been sticking it out,\u201d he joked. \u201cI can actually get it to 10cm with a push, but that\u2019s a bit painful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stephen taylor tongue, world's longest tongue, osa, obstructive sleep apnea, lisp", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Stephen Taylor's tongue breaks records, but it also causes him a lisp and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.", "title": "Stephen Taylor\u2019s Record-Breaking Tongue Causes Lisp, Possible Sleep Apnea [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stephen-taylors-record-breaking-tongue-comes-lisp-and-risk-obstructive-sleep-apnea-video-256202", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/stephentaylor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stephen Taylor's tongue breaks records, but it also causes him a lisp and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.", "title": "Stephen Taylor\u2019s Record-Breaking Tongue Causes Lisp, Possible Sleep Apnea [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stephen-taylors-record-breaking-tongue-comes-lisp-and-risk-obstructive-sleep-apnea-video-256202", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/stephentaylor.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/stephentaylor.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-10T12:02:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T12:04:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Stephen Taylor's tongue breaks records, but it also causes him a lisp and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc687\"", "article_summary": "Stephen Taylor's tongue breaks records, but it also causes him a lisp and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.\nWhile entertaining \u2014 or revolting, depending on whom you ask \u2014 Taylor\u2019s risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) greatly increases because of the abnormality.\nTaylor\u2019s tongue is 3.8 inches long (9.8 centimeters), according to Guinness World Records\u2019 measure.\nAt the time, his tongue measured 9.5 centimeters from \u201cthe tip of the tongue to the center of the closed lips,\u201d according to Marco Frigatti, of Guinness World Records.\nHe also speaks with a lisp, as his tongue crowds his mouth and makes enunciating more difficult."}
