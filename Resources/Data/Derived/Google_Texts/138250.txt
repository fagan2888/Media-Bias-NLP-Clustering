The "Fancy" rapper got jeweled-up and struck a fierce pose for her new Billboard magazine interview, all while throwing some shade at fellow musicians Lorde and even, The Beatles?



When 17-year-old Lorde collaborated with the surviving members of Nirvana at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony on April 10 in Brooklyn, Iggy felt the whole setup was inappropriate.



"Nothing against her, but I think when you're doing a tribute to someone that's dead, generally it should be the person's peer," Azalea told the magazine. "Lorde is not Kurt Cobain's peer. No matter if she killed the performance or not, I just don't think it's appropriate."



Lorde, who has come to Iggy's defense over "spineless critics" in the past, has yet responded to the comment made by the rapper.



As for The Beatles comment, the Aussie star is the first act since the iconic 1960s band to have her debut Hot 100 hits ("Fancy" and "Problem") reach No. 1 and 2 on the chart simultaneously. Her response to the groundbreaking achievement?



"It doesn't mean anything," she said. "I'd rather be The Rolling Stones."
