Lucky for you (if you're living in Japan), you\u2019ll have a chance to order them from Burger King.\n\nStarting Sept. 19, Burger King Japan will offer the \u201cKuro Burger\u201d \u2014 a black cheeseburger in which the buns and cheese get their black hue from the bamboo charcoal and ketchup. Bamboo charcoal comes from bamboo plant parts and is burned at high temperatures in the oven. It also comes as a dust or powder, which is most popular to cook with in China.\n\nPatrons will have the chance to order a plain Kuro burger, called the Kuro Pearl, or they can order a Kuro Diamond with all the fixings: mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, onion, and ketchup. Both are served with fries and a drink.\n\nAccording to Kotaku, McDonald\u2019s China was the first to offer their customers black buns. And BK Japan first followed suit when they offered the Premium Kuro Burger back in 2012, promising customers it would \"punch them in the mouth with taste.\" It must have sold well if two new versions are on their way back.\n\nBut, black cheese? Why?\n\nBK has just been making all sorts of headlines lately. First, they sort-of got rid of Satisfries in the United States. And to celebrate, maybe, they acquired Canada-based Tim Hortons for a whopping $11 billion. Some have speculated it's all a grand effort to evade taxes, but the jury's still out on whether or not that's true.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "burger, king, new, black, japan, stores, offer, black, buns, and, cheese, limited, time", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Burger King Japan's limited edition burgers have black buns and cheese.", "title": "Actually, Burger King's Cheeseburger Is The New Black", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/burger-king-new-black-japan-stores-offer-black-buns-and-cheese-limited-time-302774", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/12/kuro-burger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Burger King Japan's limited edition burgers have black buns and cheese.", "title": "Actually, Burger King's Cheeseburger Is The New Black", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/burger-king-new-black-japan-stores-offer-black-buns-and-cheese-limited-time-302774", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/12/kuro-burger.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/12/kuro-burger.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-12T09:40:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-12T11:08:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Burger King Japan's limited edition burgers have black buns and cheese."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3243\"", "article_summary": "Starting Sept. 19, Burger King Japan will offer the \u201cKuro Burger\u201d \u2014 a black cheeseburger in which the buns and cheese get their black hue from the bamboo charcoal and ketchup.\nAccording to Kotaku, McDonald\u2019s China was the first to offer their customers black buns.\nBamboo charcoal comes from bamboo plant parts and is burned at high temperatures in the oven.\nHamburger buns made from bamboo charcoal and smothered in garlicky, squid ink ketchup sounds super delicious, right?\nLucky for you (if you're living in Japan), you\u2019ll have a chance to order them from Burger King."}
