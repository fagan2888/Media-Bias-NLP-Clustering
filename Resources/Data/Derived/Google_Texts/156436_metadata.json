That\u2019s because the chances have gone up that El Ni\u00f1o\u2014an atmospheric pattern driven by water temperature changes in the Pacific Ocean\u2014will develop during that time, according to the nation\u2019s leading climate experts. When El Ni\u00f1o settles in, it has major effects on weather conditions nationally and globally.\n\nScientists speaking at a press conference yesterday afternoon said the odds that El Ni\u00f1o will develop during the summer have risen from 65 to 70 percent. The prediction comes in a new monthly report from the U.S. National Weather Service and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. The experts also said there is up to an 80% chance that El Ni\u00f1o will develop during the fall and winter.\n\nRegions across the U.S. that are normally wet can dry out during El Ni\u00f1o conditions, while normally dry regions can flood. Worldwide expectations related to El Ni\u00f1o are not always accurate, however. \u201cThere is an expectation of drought, but not in every single El Ni\u00f1o event do we actually have drought,\u201d Lisa Goddard, director of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, said during the briefing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scientists anticipate extreme weather patterns nationally and globally", "title": "El Ni\u00f1o is going to make your 2014 miserable", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scientists anticipate extreme weather patterns nationally and globally", "title": "El Ni\u00f1o is going to make your 2014 miserable", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/el_nino_is_going_to_make_your_2014_miserable_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_144222931.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists anticipate extreme weather patterns nationally and globally", "title": "El Ni\u00f1o is going to make your 2014 miserable", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_144222931.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kevin Schultz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, El Nino, Extreme weather, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The experts also said there is up to an 80% chance that El Ni\u00f1o will develop during the fall and winter.\nRegions across the U.S. that are normally wet can dry out during El Ni\u00f1o conditions, while normally dry regions can flood.\nWorldwide expectations related to El Ni\u00f1o are not always accurate, however.\nWhen El Ni\u00f1o settles in, it has major effects on weather conditions nationally and globally.\nScientists speaking at a press conference yesterday afternoon said the odds that El Ni\u00f1o will develop during the summer have risen from 65 to 70 percent."}
