By posting the letter, she was merely re-emphasizing the rule to students and parents.\n\nNashua School District Superintendent Mark Conrad backs up Beaulieu in her decision to ban tag, telling The Telegraph that each school sets their own guidelines for appropriate recess play and that the policies vary at all the district\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cI think for something like playground games, it\u2019s really up to the discretion of the principal at each school to determine the rules that are appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cFor something like tag, you\u2019re looking at the size of the classes, the physical layout of the school grounds.\u201d\n\nNot everyone\u2019s on board with the new edict, however. Parent Bill Chisholm doesn\u2019t think that the potential for injury is a strong enough reason to ban the game at recess.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single childhood activity that any kid could participate in that doesn\u2019t have the risk of injury,\u201d he told The Telegraph. \u201cI think we\u2019re just to this point where if one person anywhere has an injury or if one person anywhere is offended, everyone has to stop.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "It's not just hard sporting balls and toy gun key chains that are being banned in schools...even games of tag have been forbidden on some playgrounds.", "title": "N.H. school bans games of tag on playground - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 594, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/10/Kids-playing-tag-594x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/10/11/n-h-school-bans-games-of-tag-on-playground/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "toy-gun-keychains", "published_time": "2013-10-11T11:45:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-11T12:29:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2e6d\"", "article_summary": "According to The Nashua Telegraph, Students at Charlotte Avenue Elementary School in Nashua, N.H. are no longer allowed to play during recess.\n\u201cWe want them running, we want them jumping and releasing the energy, but just in a safe way,\u201d Charlotte Avenue Elementary School Principal Patricia Beaulieu said.\n\u201cThe traditional recess game \u2018tag,\u2019 involves one or more players chasing other players in an attempt to \u2018tag\u2019 or touch them, usually with their hand,\u201d she wrote on Oct. 4, according to The Washington Times.\n\u201cI think for something like playground games, it\u2019s really up to the discretion of the principal at each school to determine the rules that are appropriate,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s not just hard sporting balls and toy gun key chains that are being banned in schools\u2026even games of tag have been forbidden on some playgrounds."}
