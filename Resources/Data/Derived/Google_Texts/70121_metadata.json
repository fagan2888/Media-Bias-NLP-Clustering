Jobs look good; wages look good; participation looks good; and revisions look great. The average monthly job creation over the last three months is at an 18-year high; the average over the last year is at a 20-year high; job creation overall is at a 15-year high.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Republicans and their media allies are desperately looking for bad news. Lis Power reported this morning:\n\nImmediately after the numbers were released, Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends hosts portrayed the news in a negative light. Host Elisabeth Hasselbeck introduced the segment saying, \u201cNicole Petallides from our sister network Fox Business has the numbers for you, beginning with an increase in the unemployment rate.\u201d After listening to Petallides run through the positive numbers \u2013 including her explanation that the increase in the unemployment rate is \u201cgreat news\u201d because it means more people are entering the workforce \u2013 host Steve Doocy closed the segment saying, \u201cSo the headline is unemployment rate ticks up to 5.7\u201d percent.\n\nSigh. After November\u2019s amazing jobs report, Fox News simply ignored the news , deeming it unworthy of coverage. This, however, is arguably better than what we heard this morning.\n\nThe top headline is not a slight uptick in the overall unemployment rate unless you are mindlessly rooting for a weaker economy and/or trying to discourage the public before they feel encouraged. (In this case, it\u2019s also incredibly misleading \u2013 the rate inched higher because more Americans entered the job market, which is good news, not bad.)\n\nThe New York Times added that Republicans are looking \u201cfor the dark side on the jobs report.\u201d The key, of course, is appreciating why.\n\nRemember, as far as the right is concerned, 2014 should have been a miserable year for the economy. Republicans predicted as much, and they were fairly specific in their case: the combination of the Affordable Care Act, higher taxes, and the Obama administration\u2019s federal regulations would necessarily drag the economy down.\n\nObviously, Republicans got all of this backwards \u2013 just as they did when they predicted the Recovery Act would fail; just as they did when they guaranteed the Bush/Cheney tax cuts would create an economic boom; and just as they did when they say Clinton\u2019s economic agenda would push the nation into a recession.\n\nAs Ben White noted, Republicans have been left \u201c grasping for ammo .\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The latest jobs news is amazing.
