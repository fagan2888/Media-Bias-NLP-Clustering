@realDonaldTrump has been a great friend for many years. We don't need another politician, we need a businessman like Mr. Trump! Trump 2016 — Dennis Rodman (@dennisrodman) July 24, 2015

Rodman appeared on Donald Trump’s NBC reality television show “The Celebrity Apprentice” in 2009 and was the fifth contestant fired, of 16 total contestants fired by the 2016 Presidential hopeful.

Trump, according to Rodman, once offered Rodman a plane ride to North Korea, which he declined. But the NBA Hall of Famer ended up going anyway and befriended its leader Kim Jong-Un, saying about the North Korean leader, “That little kid is changing North Korea for the better.”

Later, Trump denied that claim and tweeted out that North Korea is the “last place on Earth” he would want to go.

Crazy Dennis Rodman is saying I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Never discussed, no interest, last place on Earth I want to go to. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2014
