(Photo: News-Leader File Photo)Buy Photo\n\nCome January, fewer part-time employees at Chesterfield-based Mercy Health, which includes the Mercy Springfield division, will be eligible for benefits.\n\nCurrently, part-time employees need to work 32 hours during a two-week pay period to qualify for medical, dental and vision coverage, as well as paid time off, extended sick bank hours and other benefits. That mark will change to 48 hours \u2014 again, over a two-week pay period \u2014 with the start of 2016, Mercy Springfield spokesman Brad Haller confirmed Friday following a News-Leader inquiry.\n\nAbout 1,800 employees across Mercy's seven-state footprint will be impacted by the change, Haller said, in the sense that they currently work at least 32 hours but less than 48 in a two-week period. Of those, approximately 700 are in the Mercy Springfield division, which includes the hospital in Springfield and clinic operations that extend throughout the surrounding area.\n\nMercy said in a statement that the nonprofit Catholic health system \"is committed to providing a comprehensive benefits plan while also addressing the rising costs of benefits.\"\n\n\"We regularly review our benefits programs to ensure they are competitive within the industry and in our communities,\" the system said in the statement. \"This change is consistent across health care and other industries in the communities in which Mercy serves.\"\n\nImpacted employees are being notified by letter. Those wishing to work more hours in order to continue to receive benefits are encouraged to speak with their supervisor.\n\n\"Given the growing need for health care professionals, particularly in nursing, Mercy will make every effort to provide more hours to those co-workers who wish to take on additional shifts,\" Haller said.\n\nCoxHealth, the other predominant health care provider in the Springfield area, offers benefits to part-time employees who work at least 40 hours per two-week pay period, spokeswoman Kaitlyn McConnell said.\n\nMercy Springfield is the largest employer in the five-country Springfield metropolitan statistical area, with about 9,000 full-time-equivalent employees as of this spring. In June, Mercy eliminated 127 positions in the Springfield area, part of 347 eliminated systemwide.\n\n\"Financially, Mercy faces increasing challenges to our reimbursement structure as we adjust to reductions mandated by the Affordable Care Act and other budget cuts, as well as the lack of Medicaid expansion in most of our states,\" the system said in a statement in June. \"Clinically and culturally, there continue to be opportunities to further standardize care and operational practices, in order to support the highest levels of quality and safety, as well as minimize the cost of variation.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1RN4VxP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "About 1,800 employees will be impacted systemwide, with 700 of them in the Springfield area", "og": {"site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "description": "About 1,800 employees will be impacted systemwide, with 700 of them in the Springfield area", "title": "Come January, fewer part-time workers at Mercy will be eligible for benefits", "url": "http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/business/2015/10/16/come-january-fewer-part-time-workers-mercy-eligible-benefits/74070228/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-leader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "About 1,800 employees will be impacted systemwide, with 700 of them in the Springfield area", "title": "Come January, fewer part-time workers at Mercy will be eligible for benefits", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f711ab76f401a8d8047a84a2b24db4f3291c578/c=814-0-3926-3112&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Springfield/Springfield/635806074925877254-SNLBrd-08-19-2015-Nixa-1-A002--2015-08-16-IMG-IMG-Mercy.jpg-1-1-ED-1-1-DLBKATS3-L658940327-IMG-IMG-Mercy.jpg-1-1-ED-1-1-DLBKATS3.jpg", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "site": "@springfieldNL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805766992", "fb": {"app_id": 164654783578465}, "article": {"author": "facebook.com/tgounley"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "benefits, mercy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e71\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: News-Leader File Photo)Buy PhotoCome January, fewer part-time employees at Chesterfield-based Mercy Health, which includes the Mercy Springfield division, will be eligible for benefits.\nBuy Photo Come Jan. 1, part-time employees at Mercy Hospital Springfield (pictured) and other Mercy facilities will need to work 48 hours to be eligible for benefits, including medical coverage and paid time off.\nOf those, approximately 700 are in the Mercy Springfield division, which includes the hospital in Springfield and clinic operations that extend throughout the surrounding area.\nMercy Springfield is the largest employer in the five-country Springfield metropolitan statistical area, with about 9,000 full-time-equivalent employees as of this spring.\n\"This change is consistent across health care and other industries in the communities in which Mercy serves.\""}
