The BLM closed the path to motorized vehicles in 2007 in an emergency action after ATV riders attempted to widen the road and caused significant damage to 31 archaeological sites. The area is ancestral to the Hopi, Navajo, Utes, and other local tribes.\n\nRELATED: ATV Protest Rides Through Native American Sacred Sites\n\nThere are 2,800 miles of ATV trails in the area surrounding Recapture Canyon, which is the distance from New York to Los Angeles. Of that, only 1,870 acres of that land are closed off to ATVs by the BLM. Yet that small amount of land is being fought for by ATV riders who refuse to recognize the sacredness of the area, and are instead putting their fight for state\u2019s right ahead of the respect for the history and remains of the area\u2019s people.\n\n\u201cThere are burial grounds, human remains of the ancestors of people living and thriving there today. It is as much about preserving resources as it is about respect, and we have to respect that the canyon is a place of human remains,\u201d Megan Crandall, BLM Utah spokesperson, said, citing that Recapture Canyon holds an extraordinary amount of archaeological evidence.\n\nFrank White, a member of the popular ATV groups Tread Lightly and Blue Ribbon Coalition, said both organizations were opposed to the ride. \u201cI feel bad for what went on. To me they were down there to cause trouble, they wanted an incident.\u201d\n\nWhite said, \u201cCarrying guns and the flag, they were out here to cause a fight. I call them Freedom Fighters and they just don\u2019t want to be told what to do. It\u2019s embarrassing; and then on tribal land, it\u2019s just a big no-no. I don\u2019t believe motorcycles and ATVs need to be everywhere.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bureau of Land Management land is being fought for by ATV riders who refuse to recognize the sacredness of the area.
