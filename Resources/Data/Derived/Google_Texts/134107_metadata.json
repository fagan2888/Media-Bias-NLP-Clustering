As they did two years ago, the state\u2019s big hospital conglomerates are crying wolf, even as they keep buying up the state\u2019s health care system and driving up costs. The critical challenge we face is reining in the state\u2019s growing hospital monopolies\n\nTwo years ago, Connecticut Hospital Association CEO Jennifer Jackson claimed the budget would cause \u201cdevastating cuts to hospital staffing, services, and programs,\u201d with hospitals losing a total of $550 million over the biennium. Yale-New Haven Health Services Corporation (YNHSC) claimed it would lose $150 million, Hartford HealthCare $138 million. But the fact is that YNHSC generated $204 million in profits and Hartford $103 million last year \u2013 supposedly the year of the deepest cuts. That\u2019s more profit in one year than the entire industry claims it will lose in the coming two years.\n\nSome independent hospitals do need financial help, but the real issue is monopoly. While the state\u2019s biggest hospitals bemoan the budget, regulatory records and financial statements show that they are spending millions of dollars for mergers and acquisitions, driving up costs and reducing patient choice.\n\nTwenty years ago, Connecticut hospitals were all free-standing, independent non-profits. Today, most are either owned by large local systems that are \u201cnon-profit\u201d in name only, or are selling themselves to national chains. Hospitals are also taking over doctors\u2019 practices, sending prices soaring. Studies show that hospital mergers drive prices up between 20 percent and 50 percent, and that physician costs rise 30 percent when hospitals buy practices. Between them, Hartford and YNHSC own 9 hospitals, employ 738 doctors, and account for 48 percent of all hospital stays in the state.\n\nAnd they\u2019re still on the move:\n\n\u2022 \u201cNon-profit\u201d Hartford HealthCare has applied to turn a gastroenterology surgery center into a for-profit subsidiary. Hartford plans to borrow $6.1 million for the deal, for the purpose of \u201cenhancing alignment and integration,\u201d which means taking greater control of G.I. patient referrals and money.\n\n\u2022 Yale-New Haven has leased a floor at Milford Hospital, where it is moving its inpatient rehabilitation unit. At the same time, Milford has applied to close its Labor and Delivery service, because the doctors who used to deliver a majority of Milford\u2019s babies \u201cshifted their practice patterns to make YNHH their exclusive hospital provider.\u201d With Yale-New Haven destroying Milford\u2019s Labor and Delivery service and gaining a foothold in the building, can it be long before Milford becomes a Yale-New Haven satellite?\n\n\u2022 Now, Yale-New Haven is in talks to take over Lawrence and Memorial Health System in New London. The deal has nothing to do with the state budget or financial distress. L&M\u2019s finances are strong enough that they promised to make $36 million in capital investments when they bought Westerly Hospital in Rhode Island last year.\n\nThe important news in the legislature is the passage of SB 811, a bill to curb hospital monopoly. The bill makes hospitals disclose their top-secret prices, requires the state to publish up-to-date information on hospital quality, bans the outrageous facility fees that hospitals tack onto the cost of routine doctors\u2019 office visits when they take over, eliminates the \u201csurprise bills\u201d patients get when an out of network doctor treats them at a network facility, and creates a statewide system to allow patients to direct their electronic medical records securely to any provider. With tough consumer protections, SB 811 will help us start gaining control over runaway health care costs.\n\nSB 811 helps hospitals that really need it. Price transparency will allow independent hospitals to negotiate better rates once they can see what the big monopolies get, and the Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority is developing ways to get smaller hospitals access to bonding and other capital for things that patients actually need, like medical equipment.\n\nThanks to health care reform, 100,000 more people in Connecticut now have insurance to pay their hospital bills instead of needing charity care. Our big hospitals aren\u2019t going broke. The question is what they are spending their money on, and what does it mean for people \u2013 for their care and their wallets.\n\nTom Swan is the executive director of the Connecticut Citizens Action Group.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views, opinions, positions, or strategies expressed by the author are theirs alone, and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions, or positions of CTNewsJunkie.com.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/op-ed_theres_plenty_of_hospital_money_its_about_where_they_spend_it/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "If recent media reports on the impact of the state budget on our hospitals seem familiar, that\u2019s because they are.
