It cut roughly $5 billion a year in overly generous payments to farmers and land owners regardless of whether they grew crops or not. The payment program had flourished since the late 1990s, drawing sharp condemnation from the Obama administration and lawmakers of both parties for its wasteful ways.\n\nBut experts warned that Congress was playing a shell game with the subsidies \u2013 in effect, scrapping one unpopular program while greatly hiking spending on another and adding a couple of more programs for good measure. Their predictions have proven painfully accurate.\n\nA new report on the agricultural and biofuels market published last week by the University of Missouri\u2019s Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute confirmed the worst suspicions about the farm legislation. The 2014 farm bill will prove to be the most expensive ever, largely due to the two new subsidies and the expanded crop insurance coverage.\n\nRelated: How Stupid, Redundant, Obsolete Laws Are Paralyzing Us\n\nAgricultural producers, including farmers and ranchers, buy crop insurance to protect themselves against loss from natural disasters or from declines in agricultural commodities prices. Congress added two new crop subsidy programs \u2013 called Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC).\n\nARC and PLC provide revenue and price loss payments to eligible producers for the years 2014 through 2018, according to the Dept. of Agriculture. ARC payments are made when the actual county crop revenue of a covered commodity is less than the ARC county guarantee for that commodity.\n\nThe Univ. of Missouri Policy Research Institute estimates the two new types of coverage will generate more than $24 billion in payments over the 2014-2018 life of the farm bill, according to an analysis done by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), an advocacy group. Remarkably, that works out to $2.4 billion more than the direct payment subsidies the new plans replaced. Direct payments cost taxpayers $21.6 billion from 2009 through 2013.\n\n\u201cUnder the Risk Coverage program, most counties in Ohio, Iowa, Minnesota and Kansas are projected to receive payouts of between $60 and $200 an acre for corn alone,\u201d writes Anne Weir, a senior analyst with EWG. \u201cThis is a huge increase from the average $24 per acre formerly paid for corn under the direct payment program. Corn growers in other states are also predicted to receive ARC payments, but in lesser amounts.\u201d\n\nRelated: CHART: How Climate Change Is Affecting Your Region\n\nThe Institute also projects that crop insurance payouts will total almost $85 billion for fiscal years 2015-2024 \u2013 a 27 percent increase over the $67 billion paid out for crop insurance over the previous decade, Weir writes. \u201cEven under the previous farm bill, per-acre premium subsidies were larger than direct payments for most crops, and the new projections show that these subsidies will remain high in the coming years.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cMeanwhile, budget cuts to conservation and other important programs that helped underwrite the cost of the new farm subsidies have been very real. The Institute\u2019s projections make it painfully clear that last year\u2019s farm bill \u2018reform\u2019 was really more of the same.\u201d\n\nStabenow, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee since the Republican takeover of Congress in January, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last year there were a lot of self-congratulations by both Republicans and Democrats w", "title": "Aggie Bill Cuts = $24 Billion Windfall for Farmers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/16/Aggie-Bill-Cuts-24-Billion-Windfall-Farmers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06222012_Farming_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/16/Aggie-Bill-Cuts-24-Billion-Windfall-Farmers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06222012_Farming_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Last year there were a lot of self-congratulations by both Republicans and Democrats w", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is not your father\u2019s farm bill,\u201d Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), then-chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, boasted at the time.\nThe 2014 farm bill will prove to be the most expensive ever, largely due to the two new subsidies and the expanded crop insurance coverage.\nRemarkably, that works out to $2.4 billion more than the direct payment subsidies the new plans replaced.\nDirect payments cost taxpayers $21.6 billion from 2009 through 2013.\nRelated: How Stupid, Redundant, Obsolete Laws Are Paralyzing UsAgricultural producers, including farmers and ranchers, buy crop insurance to protect themselves against loss from natural disasters or from declines in agricultural commodities prices."}
