Animal abuse registry proposed for Cook County

hello

Cook County Commissioner John Fritchey of Chicago has introduced an ordinance that would make it a crime for convicted animal abusers to buy or adopt another animal for 15 years after their conviction -- or ever, if they are convicted of more than one offense. The Cook County Animal Abuser Registry would cover all Cook County municipalities, forcing convicted abusers to register on a database hosted on the sheriff's website. Failure to register would result in a fine up to $2,000. Pet shops, shelters and rescues would be required to check the registry prior to selling or adopting out an animal. It also prohibits people from obtaining animals on behalf of a convicted abuser, or if that person shares the same address with a registered abuser.
