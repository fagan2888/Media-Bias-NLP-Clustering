Pierre, SD

The record setting grain harvest in South Dakota has created a demanding environment for the agricultural industry.

Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad (RCPE) has added more resources to meet the demand.

RCPE has hired 180 people from South Dakota and has a locomotive fleet of 50 units. This means RCPE has 1,042 grain cars in service and will have over 2,000 railcars in service by the end of the year.

They currently operate seven trains per week and plan to expand to an additional three grain trains per week.
