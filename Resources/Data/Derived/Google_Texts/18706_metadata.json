Now the state is going to have a museum for the Grammy Foundation in Cleveland, Miss., and it\u2019s going to be built with federal and state taxpayer dollars.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., in his annual \u201cWastebook\u201d report on federal government waste, said the Grammy Museum played a sour tune as part of the list of 100 \u201csilly, unnecessary and low-budget\u201d projects, which add up to $25 billion.\n\nThe federal government gave Delta State University $1.25 million\u2014through the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Economic Development Administration\u2014to help build an access road and upgrade infrastructure in preparation for the 2015 opening of the $18-million Grammy Museum Mississippi.\n\nThe state contributed $6 million to the 280,000-square foot project, which also got money from private donations and is being built on Delta State\u2019s old golf course. The museum is scheduled to open Sept. 26.\n\nAllen Hammonds, a project consultant for the Cleveland Music Foundation and a board member for the nearby B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center, said the museum, which will be the first Grammy museum built outside Los Angeles, will be a big boost for the Cleveland area.\n\nThe music of the Mississippi Delta inspired hundreds of famous acts, such as Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones and others. But it seems also to have led to a bumper crop of museums. The Grammy Museum Mississippi would be the third in a 50-mile radius.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now the state is going to have a museum for the Grammy Foundation in Cleveland, Miss., and it\u2019s going to be built with federal and state taxpayer dollars.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Now the state is going to have a museum for the Grammy Foundation in Cleveland, Miss., and it\u2019s going to be built with federal and state taxpayer dollars.", "title": "Grammy Museum in Mississippi Gives U.S. Taxpayers More Blues", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Grammy-Night-Shot-DD-copy.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/102OOXg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Now the state is going to have a museum for the Grammy Foundation in Cleveland, Miss., and it\u2019s going to be built with federal and state taxpayer dollars.", "title": "Grammy Museum in Mississippi Gives U.S. Taxpayers More Blues", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Grammy-Night-Shot-DD-copy.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2014-10-29T13:26:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "taxpayer, wastebook, mississippi, museum"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6af\"", "article_summary": "The Grammy Museum Mississippi would be the third in a 50-mile radius.\nKing Museum and Delta Interpretive Center, said the museum, which will be the first Grammy museum built outside Los Angeles, will be a big boost for the Cleveland area.\nThe music of the Mississippi Delta inspired hundreds of famous acts, such as Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones and others.\nThe federal government gave Delta State University $1.25 million\u2014through the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Economic Development Administration\u2014to help build an access road and upgrade infrastructure in preparation for the 2015 opening of the $18-million Grammy Museum Mississippi.\nAllen Hammonds, a project consultant for the Cleveland Music Foundation and a board member for the nearby B.B."}
