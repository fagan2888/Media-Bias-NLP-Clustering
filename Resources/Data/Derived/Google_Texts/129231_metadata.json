Unlike non-healthcare employers, the recent modest growth in insurance premiums in employer-sponsored group plans has more impactful consequences for the healthcare employers\u2019 bottom line.\n\n\u201cAt the academic medical center, stand-alone facility and large integrated health system, they\u2019re all dealing with this balance between designing their medical plans and their cost sharing, along with population health management,\u201d said Judy Thorp, managing director for human resources practice at Huron Consulting Healthcare.\n\n[See also: Cost sharing may not cut health costs]\n\nPremiums have been held in check in part by a weak economy and stepped up cost sharing by employees, whether through high-deductibles, co-pays or co-insurance, but they\u2019re still going up.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage held to the recent moderate trend, climbing to $16,351 this year, or 4 percent more than last year. Workers paid $4,565 on average toward the cost of their family\u2019s health coverage, but their wages did not rise to keep up with even the modest rise in premiums, said Drew Altman, Kaiser Family Foundation president and CEO.\n\n\u201cYear after year premiums have gone up when wages have flattened or declined and they [employees] pay other forms of cost sharing. People still feel the pain of healthcare costs and worry about paying for health insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nEmployers are moving more costs to employees, which takes a bigger bite out of their finances. This year, 78 percent of all covered employees face an annual deductible (up from 72 percent in 2012), the survey said. Deductibles of at least $1,000 are common in employer-sponsored plans. Workers typically must pay this deductible before most services are covered by their health plan.\n\nHealthcare organizations are part of this trend, moving to where the employer is responsible for 70 percent of insurance cost and employees pay 30 percent, Thorp said.\n\n\u201cBut being a provider of healthcare throws a much more difficult situation into the mix. They have their own employees who are going to their specific facilities for healthcare,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen employee cost sharing escalates, it shows up as an increase on the charity care line of the provider\u2019s financial statement. \u201cIf you pull one lever, you have got to look at it holistically and see where else it could show up or have consequences,\u201d Thorp said. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s going to be on that charity line.\u201d\n\nHealthcare CFOs are concerned about seeing the charity care line on their financial statements increasing. \u201cAs a result, we are seeing policies on collections and billing being reviewed and modified so that the charity care line doesn\u2019t just absorb many employees\u2019 cost sharing increases,\u201d she said.\n\nIncreased cost sharing should not make collections more difficult if the healthcare organization \u201chas tight internal controls around their billing and collection processes as it pertains to their patients as well as employees who use their facilities,\u201d Thorp said.\n\nAt the same time, employees of healthcare organizations generally have higher utilization of their employer\u2019s facilities, such as the emergency department, than typical corporate employees because they are onsite and have quick access.\n\nProviders need to educate their employees and design their health plan to encourage use of less pricey facilities, such as an onsite clinic for employees or urgent care center nearby with convenient hours, she said.\n\nLike other employers, providers are beginning to use carrots and sticks to encourage their employees to take more control of their health to curb costs, including enrollment in wellness programs.\n\nHealthcare organizations are also watching as large employers are cutting costs and risk in other ways \u2013 by moving retirees older than 65 out of employer-sponsored group plans to the Medicare and Medicare Advantage individual market, a recent Aon Hewitt survey showed.\n\nSome larger employers are also redesigning their plans, such as Memphis-based FedEx, which will offer only a high-deductible plan starting in 2014.\n\n\u201cAs you see changes with large employers in corporate America, that is setting the tone for what the impact will be on healthcare organizations as well,\u201d Thorp said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/employee-cost-sharing-adds-pressures-healthcare-employers", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1013-HFN-IND-increase-Thorp.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "For healthcare employers, the recent modest growth in insurance premiums in employer-sponsored group plans has more impactful consequences for the their bottom line than it does for non-healthcare employers.", "title": "Employee cost sharing adds pressures for healthcare employers"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1013-HFN-IND-increase-Thorp.jpg"}, "title": "Employee cost sharing adds pressures for healthcare employers", "description": "For healthcare employers, the recent modest growth in insurance premiums in employer-sponsored group plans has more impactful consequences for the their bottom line than it does for non-healthcare employers.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Like non-healthcare employers, healthcare employers are adapting to and strategizing for increasing healthcare costs.
