Marco Rubio. Trump, who has been attacking Rubio on the stump for drinking too much water and, Trump claims, sweating too much, sent Rubio a case of Trump-branded bottled water. He also threw in some Trump towels, and some Trump campaign bumper stickers.\n\nAccording to CNN, which appears to have been first in reporting the story, the package came with a note that read, \u201cSince you're always sweating, we thought you could use some water. Enjoy!\u201d A Trump staffer confirmed the stunt originated with the campaign. The towels, the staffer confirmed, were \u201cfor him sweating.\u201d\n\nPause for a moment and consider that the man currently in the lead in the race to be a major party nominee for president is running a campaign that counts middle school-level taunting as a useful tactic.\n\nRelated: What Marco Rubio Said Could Help Him Win the White House\n\nPlaying Gunga Din is not his only tactic. Trump has spent time on the stump and in television interviews attacking Rubio for drinking too much water and, he says, sweating.\n\n\u201cI've never seen a young guy sweat that much. He's drinking water, water, water. I never saw anything like this with him with the water,\u201d he told a crown in South Carolina last week.\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern with Trump, who is frequently characterized as a bully, but might better be considered a \u201cmean girl.\u201d Trump\u2019s standard operating procedure when faced with a challenger is not to go after them on the grounds that their policies would be worse for the country than his, but rather to argue that there is some defect \u2013 physical or emotional \u2013 that ought to disqualify them.\n\nHe\u2019s attacked former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina on the basis of her looks, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush for being a \u201clow-energy\u201d candidate. He made fun of former Texas governor Rick Perry\u2019s glasses, and he publicly gave out the personal cell phone number of South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Is So Dangerous for the GOP in 2016\n\nHow long Trump will hang around in the GOP primary election is unknowable. By virtue of his wealth and ability to command media attention (like this article, admittedly) he can keep this going pretty much as long as he want.\n\nEventually, Republican voters are going to have to consider the possibility that under President Trump, the day might come when the red phone in the Kremlin rings, and a stressed out army colonel answers it to hear someone with a New York accent ask, \u201cIs your refrigerator running?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump, at this point, is probably just days away from calling Papa John\u2019s and ordering a dozen pizzas for the headquarters of each of his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination \u2013 with a promise of payment in cash, of course.", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Donald Trump Is the \u2018Mean Girl\u2019 of the GOP", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Here-s-Why-Donald-Trump-Mean-Girl-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Here-s-Why-Donald-Trump-Mean-Girl-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump, at this point, is probably just days away from calling Papa John\u2019s and ordering a dozen pizzas for the headquarters of each of his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination \u2013 with a promise of payment in cash, of course.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce87e\"", "article_summary": "He's drinking water, water, water.\nHe also threw in some Trump towels, and some Trump campaign bumper stickers.\nRelated: Why Trump Is So Dangerous for the GOP in 2016How long Trump will hang around in the GOP primary election is unknowable.\nTrump, who has been attacking Rubio on the stump for drinking too much water and, Trump claims, sweating too much, sent Rubio a case of Trump-branded bottled water.\nTrump has spent time on the stump and in television interviews attacking Rubio for drinking too much water and, he says, sweating."}
