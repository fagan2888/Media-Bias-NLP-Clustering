He also served as a councilman from 2000 to 2006. He returned to the council and served as mayor pro tem in 2008, but was recalled in November 2011 along with four other council members.\n\n\u201cThat was a trying time in our city\u2019s past,\u201d Cosper said. \u201cUnfortunately, we were in a situation that had no good answers. ... We did what we thought was best at the time and we have moved forward.\u201d\n\nCosper said the city\u2019s biggest challenge is water capacity.\n\n\u201cWe are very close to triggering a mandate with (the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) to have to construct a new water plant and provide additional capacity,\u201d he said. \u201c... I know the city has plans that are currently in progress to address that issue, but we need to go all the way into finalizing the agreements with (Bell County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1) and get the plant under construction.\u201d\n\nCosper said he believes his accomplishments make him the best candidate to fulfill the city\u2019s mayoral duties.\n\n\u201cI am certain that I have the ability to lead the city,\u201d he said. \u201cI am excited about the opportunity to continue moving our community forward with (its) great low cost of living and the opportunity for people to live the American dream right here in Killeen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "Killeen mayoral candidate Scott Cosper said the biggest challenge facing the city is its water capacity.", "title": "Killeen mayoral race: Cosper concerned about water capacity", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/news/politics/killeen-mayoral-race-cosper-concerned-about-water-capacity/article_8f14499e-914e-11e3-b9e9-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/b4/db4fbd3e-914e-11e3-992c-001a4bcf6878/52f718bf50dec.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C411", "height": 411}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@NatalieLStewart"}, "description": "Killeen mayoral candidate Scott Cosper said the biggest challenge facing the city is its water capacity.", "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "keywords": "politics,election 2014,killeen election,killeen mayor,scott cosper,killeen,mayor,mayoral race,mayoral candidate,politics,top_story", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "news_keywords": "politics,election 2014,killeen election,killeen mayor,scott cosper,killeen,mayor,mayoral race,mayoral candidate,politics,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c5e\"", "article_summary": "Killeen mayoral candidate Scott Cosper said the biggest challenge facing the city is its water capacity.\n\u201cThat was a trying time in our city\u2019s past,\u201d Cosper said.\n\u201cWe are very close to triggering a mandate with (the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) to have to construct a new water plant and provide additional capacity,\u201d he said.\n...
