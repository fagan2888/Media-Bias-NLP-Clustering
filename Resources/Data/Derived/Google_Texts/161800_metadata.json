Subpoenas should not be necessary to gather basic information about $5 billion in unlawful payments to insurance companies, but the Obama administration has left no choice despite our repeated, good faith efforts,\u201d the chairmen said in a joint statement. \u201cAfter almost a year of repeated excuses and stonewalling, the public deserves better. At the end of the day, the American public will get answers.\u201d\n\nRepublican members in the upper chamber applauded the congressmen\u2019s efforts to obtain the documents.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing about stonewalling: At some point the facts will come to light. Unfortunately, when it comes to ObamaCare, it\u2019s clear that this administration feels bound neither to the letter of the law nor to the spirit of transparency,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe same bureaucrats who unlawfully paid insurance companies billions of dollars are refusing to answer basic questions. Chairmen Upton and Brady deserve nothing less than the complete and full cooperation of these agencies.\u201d\n\nBrady and Upton wrote a letter with similar demands to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell last week demanding answers on why the Obama administration funded its Basic Health Program for six months without congressional approval. Burwell has since agreed to a phone call to brief Upton in the issue.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
