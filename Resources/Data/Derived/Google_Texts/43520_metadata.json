Turnout was more than 62 percent, the highest for a referendum in Switzerland since 1992, said Claude Longchamp of the gfs.bern research and polling institute.\n\nBLACK SHEEP\n\nThe SVP, which has built up support on a wave of anti-foreigner feeling, collected the 100,000 signatures needed to start the referendum under Switzerland's system of direct democracy.\n\nUnder the plans, foreigners would have been deported after completing sentences for serious crimes like murder, rape and armed robbery, or for two lesser offences committed within a 10-year span such as speeding or burglary.\n\nParticularly unpalatable to opponents was the proposal to impose the automatic expulsion of \"Secondos\", as the Swiss refer to Swiss-born but non-citizen children of immigrants.\n\n\"Today the majority of voters delivered an affirmation to the foreigners in our country and most notably to the Secondos,\" Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference.\n\nThe SVP campaigned for the motion with posters showing a white sheep kicking a black sheep out of Switzerland.\n\nActivists countered by putting up posters depicting the cross on the Swiss flag as a swastika.\n\nOpponents had argued that the move would violate the European Convention on Human Rights, which Switzerland has signed, particularly by exposing deportees' families to financial hardship.\n\nIn one of three other referendums on Sunday, voters backed the construction of a second tunnel through the Gotthard mountain range, a main north-south transit route. They rejected a proposal to ban trading in agricultural derivatives.\n\nIn the day's closest result, voters very narrowly rejected a proposal to abolish a tax disadvantage for married couples and civil partnerships.\n\n(Reporting by Joshua Franklin and Paul Arnold; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Ros Russell)", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Joshua Franklin  ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss voters rejected a right-wing proposal to deport foreign law-breakers in a referendum on Sunday, handing a defeat to the country's dominant anti-immigration Swiss People's Party (SVP).
