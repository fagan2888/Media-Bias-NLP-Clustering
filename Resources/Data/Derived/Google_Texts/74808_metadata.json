She said 62,021 of those applications have been approved.\n\nThe private option, officially called the Arkansas Health Care Independence Program, is open to people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The plan is Arkansas\u2019 alternative to the state Medicaid expansion that was proposed under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nState Medicaid Director Andy Allison said applicants who are found to be eligible for the program are encouraged to visit its website, www.insureark.org, to register, although the process also can be completed by phone or by mail. About 15,000 people have visited the site, he said.\n\nAbout 28 percent of the people who have registered have been found to be medically frail and therefore are eligible for Medicaid rather than the private option, Allison said.\n\nThe panel also heard from state Insurance Commissioner Jay Bradford, who said 71 health insurance plans are available across the state through the marketplace, but the number available in each of seven service areas ranges from 11 in southwestern and southeastern Arkansas to 41 in Central Arkansas and Northwest Arkansas.\n\nOf the 71 plans, 23 are gold plans estimated to cover 80 percent of medical costs, 16 are silver plans covering 70 percent of costs, 24 are bronze plans covering 60 percent of costs and eight are catastrophic plans which cover very high medical costs for people who are under 30 or qualify for a hardship exemption.\n\nCynthia Crone, director of the state Insurance Department\u2019s Health Benefits Exchange Partnership Division, answered questions about the Arkansas Health Connector website, which provides information about the marketplace and sends visitors to the federal marketplace website to enroll \u2014 although the federal site has been plagued with technical problems since its Oct. 1 launch.\n\nCrone said the Arkansas Health Connector site is not being updated because the state Legislative Council declined to review a $4.5 million contract for services to promote the marketplace, including web services. Information such as the names and contact information of the latest marketplace guides to be licensed has not been posted to the site, she said.\n\nRep. John Burris, R-Harrison, chairman of the House public health committee, said that \u201csurely there is somebody at the Insurance Department that can do that. Now that the contract is not renewed, I don\u2019t think the answer is to twiddle our (thumbs).\u201d\n\nCrone said the information is being updated on the Insurance Department\u2019s website, although it is more \u201ccumbersome\u201d for visitors to find it there.\n\nCrone also said that activity on the Arkansas Health Connector site \u201chas dropped way down. People who had come are not coming back because it\u2019s not updated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not coming back for other reasons that are well documented,\u201d Burris said, apparently referring to the technical problems with the federal marketplace site.\n\nCrone said visits have \u201cbumped up\u201d briefly each time the Insurance Department has conducted an outreach effort, such as its booth at the state fair.\n\n\u201cWhen information is out, the activity increases,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, asked how much money the Insurance Department would need just to maintain the website. Crone estimated that it would need about $500,000.\n\n\u201cWould that finish the job?\u201d Hammer asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would finish the job,\u201d Crone said. \u201cWe also need social media and other pieces. Would I be totally happy? I\u2019d be happy to have that (but) I think we need more. I think that states that are doing this effectively and getting a response from people are investing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 More than 66,000 Arkansans have applied for health insurance coverage under the state\u2019s plan to use federal Medicaid money to provide private insurance the working poor, a state Department of Human Services official told a legislative panel Thursday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau", "og": {"site_name": "Pine Bluff Commercial", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 More than 66,000 Arkansans have applied for health insurance coverage under the state\u2019s plan to use federal Medicaid money to provide private insurance the working poor, a state Department of Human Services official told a legislative panel Thursday.", "title": "More than 66,000 have applied for private option", "url": "http://pbcommercial.com/news/more-66000-have-applied-private-option", "image": "http://pbcommercial.com/sites/pbcommercial.com/files/field/media/web1_thumb2_healthcare-expansion_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://pbcommercial.com/news/more-66000-have-applied-private-option", "image": {"src": "http://pbcommercial.com/sites/pbcommercial.com/files/field/media/web1_thumb2_healthcare-expansion_1.jpg"}, "creator": "@pbcommercial", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 More than 66,000 Arkansans have applied for health insurance coverage under the state\u2019s plan to use federal Medicaid money to provide private insurance the working poor, a state Department of Human Services official told a legislative panel Thursday.", "title": "More than 66,000 have applied for private option"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "pbcommercial://?eid=393808", "app_name": "pbcommercial", "package": "com.stephensmedia.pinebluffcommercial"}, "ios": {"url": "pbcommercial://?eid=393808", "app_store_id": 983957200, "app_name": "pbcommercial"}}, "keywords": "News,State,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-24T20:34:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf09\"", "article_summary": "The private option, officially called the Arkansas Health Care Independence Program, is open to people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\nLITTLE ROCK \u2014 More than 66,000 Arkansans have applied for health insurance coverage under the state\u2019s plan to use federal Medicaid money to provide private insurance the working poor, a state Department of Human Services official told a legislative panel Thursday.\nCrone also said that activity on the Arkansas Health Connector site \u201chas dropped way down.\nLawmakers also peppered a state Insurance Department official about her comments that the program has been hindered by the Legislature\u2019s refusal to endorse renewal of a contract for outreach.\nJoni Jones, director of DHS\u2019 Division of County Operations, told a joint meeting of the House and Senate committees on public health, welfare and labor that 66,094 people had applied for the co-called \u201cprivate option\u201d by Oct. 19."}
