Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi are wasting state tax dollars and behaving shamefully by supporting water polluters in a legal action in the Chesapeake Bay region.\n\nHe says they have filed a brief supporting polluters that are challenging enforcement of clean-water laws. Big agricultural and development interests recruited them to supporting their position.\n\nWhy would Florida officials support polluters in an appellate case hundreds of miles away? Hiaasen's theory is that Scott and Bondi want to attract big-money donors for their re-election campaigns.\n\nApologies to those who live around Chesapeake Bay are in order, he says.\n\nMore information on the legal case can be found in the Washington Post.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Opinion", "description": "Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen says Florida Gov.
