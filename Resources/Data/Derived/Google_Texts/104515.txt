A graphic image was sent in an email to students at Fremd High School in suburban Palatine earlier this week, prompting a police investigation.

The email was sent to students Tuesday night and contained a "graphic and offensive image," according to a letter sent to parents from Fremd principal Kurt Tenopir. Students at Palatine High School also received a statement regarding the email.

Police were immediately contacted after the message was sent, and they are investigating the incident, Tenopir said.

Tenopir urged parents to remind their children to use caution when receiving unsolicited emails.
