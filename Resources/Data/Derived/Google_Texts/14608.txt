Paul cites high cigarette taxes in death

Republican Sen. Rand Paul says that politicians and taxes are to blame for the police chokehold death of Eric Garner.

“Obviously, the individual circumstances are important, but I think it’s also important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes, so they’ve driven cigarettes underground by making them so expensive,” the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Hardball with Chris Matthews.”

He continued, “But then some politician also had to direct the police to say, ‘Hey, we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette.’”

A New York City grand jury decided Wednesday not to return an indictment in the July death of Garner. The 43-year-old father of six died after being placed in a chokehold by a city police officer who was arresting him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. The grand jury’s decision sparked protests in New York City and an announcement from Attorney General Eric Holder that the Justice Department is launching as separate federal investigation into Garner’s death.

Paul said police are put in “a difficult situation,” but added there is “no excuse” for Garner’s death.

“For someone to die over breaking that law, there really is no excuse for it,” Paul said. “But I do blame the politicians. We put our police in a difficult situation with bad laws.”
