Two Oklahoma men have died in a single-vehicle crash in northeast Kansas.

Police said the accident occurred late Thursday in Bonner Springs when the pickup they were in veered off a road and struck several trees.

The Kansas City Star reports that police identified the two men killed in the crash as 35-year-old William Joshua Henderson, of Yukon, and 29-year-old Michael Was Jr., of Oklahoma City.

Police say the men were relatives.
