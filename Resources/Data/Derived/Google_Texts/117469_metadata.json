Louie Gohmert, Texas Republican.\n\nPHOTOS: Awesome rifles: The best and the baddest\n\nCongress is still waiting for information from the Justice Department about the scandal, and Mr. Gohmert questioned whether the contempt vote meant anything to Mr. Holder.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, buddy\u201d a visibly upset Mr. Holder said, waving his finger at Mr. Gohmert. \u201cYou should not assume that is not a big deal to me.\u201d\n\nMr. Gohmert replied that Congress is trying to get to the bottom of the scandal and that he didn\u2019t need any lectures from Mr. Holder on what contempt meant to him.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t need lectures from you, either,\u201d the attorney general replied.\n\nMr. Holder came under fire as members of the House committee questioned him on the legality of executive overreach, noting the Justice Department\u2019s stance on the legalization of marijuana in some states, its universal decision to reduce prison sentencing for low-level drug offenders, and the Obama administration\u2019s continual delays in implementing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department has the responsibility to provide legal advice, including constitutional analyses, to the executive branch,\u201d said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican and committee chairman. \u201cI find it ironic, then, that the department has chosen on multiple occasions to act in contravention of the Constitution and congressionally-enacted federal law.\u201d\n\nMr. Goodlatte cited the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in states that have legalized the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana, which remains an illegal drug under federal law. He also noted Justice\u2019s directive to federal prosecutors to decline charging an offender with an illicit drug quantity that would trigger a mandatory minimum sentence if the defendant meets certain criteria.\n\nOther members of Congress cited President Obama\u2019s unilateral decision to delay aspects of his signature health care law as a constitutional violation.\n\nIn defending the administration, Mr. Holder said he has leeway in deciding what cases the department will prosecute.\n\n\u201cThere is a vast amount of discretion that a president has \u2014 and more specifically that an attorney general has,\u201d Mr. Holder said. \u201cBut that discretion has to be used in an appropriate way so that your acting consistent with the aims of the statute but at the same time making sure that you are acting in a way that is consistent with our values, consistent with the Constitution and protecting the American people.\u201d\n\nMr. Holder told lawmakers interested in knowing the legal basis for Mr. Obama\u2019s delay of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate \u2014 despite a clear enactment date set in the law \u2014 to ask the Treasury Department for its rationale.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury Department had looked at it and determined that there was a legal basis [for the mandate delay],\u201d Mr. Holder told Rep. Steve Chabot, Ohio Republican, during another testy exchange in the hearing. He said the Justice Department doesn\u2019t generally disclose the legal analyses it provides to the president.\n\nRepublicans asked why the Justice Department decided to investigate people such as conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza, while former IRS official Lois Lerner, who headed the agency\u2019s tax-exempt division while it was unfairly targeting conservative and libertarian groups, is unlikely to face a criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cI will simply say that we have followed the facts of the law in making our prosecutive determinations and making our investigatory decisions,\u201d Mr. Holder said. \u201cThis is an administration \u2014 this is a Justice Department that I have run and I am proud of.\u201d\n\nRep. James Sensenbrenner, an architect of the Patriot Act, asked Mr. Holder why he isn\u2019t pursing a prosecution of Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper for perjury for his testimony to a Senate committee last year denying that U.S. intelligence agencies were gathering massive amounts of data about Americans\u2019 electronic communications.\n\n\u201cWhat more do you need besides an admission from Gen. Clapper that he lied?\u201d Mr. Sensenbrenner, Wisconsin Republican, asked referring to Mr. Clapper\u2019s later admission that his remark was \u201cthe least untruthful\u201d answer he could give.\n\nMr. Holder declined to say whether the Justice Department is pursuing an investigation, and Mr. Sensenbrenner said the department\u2019s inaction raises doubts about whether Congress will try to pass any new intelligence bills.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorney General Eric Holder blamed \u201cthe gun lobby\u201d for being behind his 2012 contempt vote in Congress, in one of many heated exchanges with House Republicans Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Attorney General Eric Holder blamed \u201cthe gun lobby\u201d for being behind his 2012 contempt vote in Congress, in one of many heated exchanges with House Republicans Tuesday.", "title": "Holder blames gun lobby for contempt of Congress vote", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/8/holder-blames-gun-lobby-contempt-congress-vote/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/08/holder-justice-jpeg-06162.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/08/holder-justice-jpeg-06162.jpg", "description": "Attorney General Eric Holder blamed \u201cthe gun lobby\u201d for being behind his 2012 contempt vote in Congress, in one of many heated exchanges with House Republicans Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Holder blames gun lobby for contempt of Congress vote"}, "Author": "Kelly Riddell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Eric Holder, Department Of Justice, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ef5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, buddy\u201d a visibly upset Mr. Holder said, waving his finger at Mr. Gohmert.\nAttorney General Eric Holder blamed \u201cthe gun lobby\u201d for being behind his 2012 contempt vote in Congress, in one of many heated exchanges with House Republicans Tuesday.\n\u201cThere is a vast amount of discretion that a president has \u2014 and more specifically that an attorney general has,\u201d Mr. Holder said.\nIn an oversight hearing Tuesday of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Holder said his contempt vote was \u201call about the gun lobby,\u201d during a heated exchange with Rep.
