Karl Rove, current Fox News contributor and former George W. Bush staffer who wrote The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters (Simon & Schuster, 2015), sees parallels between the current election campaigns and those of 1896, when Ohio Governor McKinley fashioned a Republican majority that continued for decades.

Rove criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying it "discombobulated" the healthcare system, raised premiums dramatically, and left between 1.5 and 3 million fewer people insured.

On Donald Trump, who has been outspoken in his bashing of Rove, he said: "He's entertaining. I'm amused that he wastes all this time on me...but it's a mark of distinction that he's this publicly weird." He also assured: "His support is not going away."
