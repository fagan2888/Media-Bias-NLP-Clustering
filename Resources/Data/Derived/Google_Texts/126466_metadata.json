The billboard, boasting a bright yellow background, read, \u201cVA is lying, veterans are dying.\u201d\n\nGagnon asserted, \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, I\u2019m all set. This is about the people who are in the service and the ones who are fixing to go in the service.\u201d He said of the VA, \u201cThey got that last nerve of mine that I just got to the point where I said, \u2018I\u2019ll eat Ramen noodles for a month, but I\u2019m going to let them know that I\u2019m upset.'\u201d\n\nGagnon pointed out what he said are spurious claims from the VA and Barack Obama that wait times for veterans\u2019 doctor appointments have been radically cut. Gagnon argued that the VA is lying, saying that his experiences with the veterans he knows have led him to a starkly different conclusion. He offered, \u201cNow they come on the news and said we fixed things. They\u2019re lying. Nothing has changed.\u201d\n\nImages of the billboards can be found on the \u201cVA is lying group\u201d Facebook page, which has over 12,000 members.\n\nGagnon concluded, \u201cI want the public to finally realize this is totally unacceptable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two billboards in Central Florida paid for by a Marine vet say Veterans Affairs is lying about their improved service for veterans.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Two billboards in Central Florida paid for by a Marine vet say Veterans Affairs is lying about their improved service for veterans.", "title": "Marine Vet Pays for Billboards Saying VA Is Lying - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Vet-VA-Billboard-Fox-35-News.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/08/marine-vet-pays-for-billboards-saying-va-is-lying/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two billboards in Central Florida paid for by a Marine vet say Veterans Affairs is lying about their improved service for veterans.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Vet-VA-Billboard-Fox-35-News.jpg", "title": "Marine Vet Pays for Billboards Saying VA Is Lying - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Billboards, Lying, Marine, Veterans Affairs,Big Government,Marine", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Veterans Affairs", "published_time": "2015-09-08T13:53:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The billboard, boasting a bright yellow background, read, \u201cVA is lying, veterans are dying.\u201dGagnon asserted, \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, I\u2019m all set.\nNothing has changed.\u201dImages of the billboards can be found on the \u201cVA is lying group\u201d Facebook page, which has over 12,000 members.\nGagnon argued that the VA is lying, saying that his experiences with the veterans he knows have led him to a starkly different conclusion.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTwo huge billboards in Central Florida paid for by a Marine veteran are advertising the message that the Veterans Affairs Administration is lying about their improved service for veterans.\n'\u201dGagnon pointed out what he said are spurious claims from the VA and Barack Obama that wait times for veterans\u2019 doctor appointments have been radically cut."}
