House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling for the declassification of 28 pages from a congressional report into the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, ahead of President Obama’s trip to Saudi Arabia.

“As the former Ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and top the House Democrat on the Joint Congressional investigation looking into the 9/11 attacks, I agree with former Senator Bob Graham that these documents should be declassified and made public, and that the Bush Administration’s refusal to do so was a mistake,” the California Democrat said Sunday in a statement. “I have always advocated for providing as much transparency as possible to the American people consistent with protecting our national security.”

Former Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who chaired the panel that conducted the investigation, has long called for the redacted pages to be declassified. The Florida Democrat believes Saudi Arabia supported the 9/11 hijackers.

Obama will travel to Saudi Arabia on April 21.
