John Jenkins, Notre Dame\u2019s president, said the school is looking into allegations the players had course work done for them.\n\nThe news comes a season after quarterback Everett Golson was suspended for the 2013 season for academic impropriety and after Daniels was suspended for the spring semester.\n\nThe Irish finished 9-4 behind Tommy Rees last season, but coming off an appearance in the BCS title game in 2012 it was a step back.\n\nGolson has returned, but now coach Brian Kelly could be scrambling to fill holes before opening his fifth season in South Bend at home against Rice on Aug. 30.\n\nAthletic director Jack Swarbrick said Kelly was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the news.\n\nJenkins and Swarbrick expressed support for Kelly.\n\n\u201cWe have great confidence in Brian and his staff,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThey have been nothing but supportive.\u201d\n\nJenkins said the investigation shows Notre Dame\u2019s honor system works, saying it was started when someone on the university staff became suspicious of papers and homework turned in by the players.\n\n\u201cAt any university you\u2019re dealing with young people. The vast majority of them make good decisions. But young people sometimes make bad decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to hold them accountable and to use those incidents as ways to educate them. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nJenkins said Notre Dame has notified the NCAA about the inquiry. Because of potential violations, the four players can\u2019t compete until the conclusion of the investigation and the university honor code process.\n\nJenkins said during a news conference that no student has been judged responsible for \u201cacademic dishonesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody has been dismissed,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nJenkins said there is no timetable regarding how long the investigation will take.\n\n\u201cWe will take as long as it takes to have a thorough and fair investigation and proceed through our academic honor code process,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nHe added that such investigations at Notre Dame aren\u2019t common \u201cbut it happens.\u201d\n\nThe university also is investigating if other students are involved. Jenkins said it was too early to say if the four players acted together.\n\nJenkins said if it is found they violated the school\u2019s honor code the penalties could range from an F on an assignment, to an F in the course, to dismissal from school. The penalty would be decided by an honor committee.\n\nSwarbrick said the players haven\u2019t been suspended. He said they remain grant-in-aid students and have access to athletic facilities and resources.\n\nJenkins said he didn\u2019t want to speculate on possible NCAA punishment, while Swarbrick said the NCAA usually defers to a university when it comes to academic integrity.\n\n\u201cThere are a few narrow instances where that triggers an NCAA concern, but I must stress we have no evidence of most of those here. No involvement by a member of the coaching staff, no transcript impropriety, those sorts of things,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it has NCAA consequences, we\u2019ll let them know.\u201d\n\nJenkins said the school would vacate victories if it is determined players have been ineligible during past competition. All four were members of the 2012 team that played for the BCS national championship.\n\nThe investigation is the latest in a series for the Irish in the past 15 months involving academics, starting with Golson.\n\nJerian Grant, the leading scorer on the basketball team at the time, was suspended in December for the spring semester because of an academic violation. Daniels was suspended two weeks later for the spring semester and was recently reinstated.\n\nSwarbrick said the previous cases were different.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not confuse academic probation, where you don\u2019t make grades in a semester, with academic dishonesty. They are very different things,\u201d he said.\n\nJenkins said he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a sign Notre Dame has to make changes in the student-athletes it admits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that the students we admit have the capacity to be successful,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The university on Friday barred KeiVarae Russell, the team's best cornerback, leading returning receiver DaVaris Daniels, defensive end Ishaq Williams, and backup linebacker Kendall Moore from practice and games while it investigates \"suspected academic dishonesty.\"", "Author": "Tom Coyne", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The university on Friday barred KeiVarae Russell, the team\u2019s best cornerback, leading returning receiver DaVaris Daniels, defensive end Ishaq Williams, and backup linebacker Kendall Moore from practice and games while it investigates \u201csuspected academic dishonesty.\u201d", "title": "Notre Dame shelves 4 players in academic misconduct probe", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/16/notre-dame-shelves-4-players-academic-misconduct-p/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/notre-dame-academic-m_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/notre-dame-academic-m_lanc.jpg", "title": "Notre Dame shelves 4 players in academic misconduct probe", "description": "The university on Friday barred KeiVarae Russell, the team's best cornerback, leading returning receiver DaVaris Daniels, defensive end Ishaq Williams, and backup linebacker Kendall Moore from practic", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, John Jenkins, Jack Swarbrick, Everett Golson, Brian Kelly"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde783\"", "article_summary": "John Jenkins, Notre Dame\u2019s president, said the school is looking into allegations the players had course work done for them.\nBecause of potential violations, the four players can\u2019t compete until the conclusion of the investigation and the university honor code process.\nJenkins said he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a sign Notre Dame has to make changes in the student-athletes it admits.\n\u201cWe will take as long as it takes to have a thorough and fair investigation and proceed through our academic honor code process,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not confuse academic probation, where you don\u2019t make grades in a semester, with academic dishonesty."}
