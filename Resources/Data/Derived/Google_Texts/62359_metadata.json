It couldn't get any stranger.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama shares a smile with the crowd at the Warfield Theater in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 2015.

That's crazy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the leader of the free world and Yeezy never actually shared the stage Saturday, because Obama left the building before the rapper's performance. First, however, Obama gave a fairly standard stump speech covering his administration's accomplishments -- from job creation to the Affordable Care Act and more -- while attacking GOP intransigence on issues like climate change and gun control as well as GOP negativism about the state of the nation.\n\n\"There's almost no measure by which we're not better than when I took office,\" he said, which begs the question of why so many Republican candidates are \"down on America... Why are they so grumpy?\"\n\nListening to them, one might think that things were rosy back in 2008, when the economy was tanking, Osama bin Laden was still at large and so on, he said. \"Those were the golden years, and then I came in and messed it up. I mean, you've got to give them credit for chutzpah,\" he said. \"The fact-checkers just can't keep up.\"\n\nObama was preceded on stage Saturday by Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who introduced the NBA championship-winning Golden State Warriors. Point guard and MVP Stephen Curry, clutching the championship trophy at the podium, likened the teamwork and unity that powered his team to victory to that among Democrats at Saturday's events.\n\nTickets for Saturday's fundraiser cost $100 each for students, $250 for general admission, $1,000 for premium seating, $5,000 for a photo with the president and $10,000 to greet Obama in a small VIP \"clutch.\" Obama had spent the night at the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill after a Friday night fundraiser that was closed to the press; after Saturday's event, he flew to Los Angeles for more fundraisers.\n\n\"The latest swing through the Golden State proves once again that President Obama only cares about causing traffic jams for fundraising for the failed Democrat agenda,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Ninio Fetalvo said. \"But regardless of whether Democrats nominate Clinton or Biden, the American people have made it clear they want a change from the policies of the Obama era -- an era both candidates would continue.\"\n\nThere were a few protest signs held outside the Warfield Theater as President Barack Obama made an appearance in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 2015. (Dan Honda/Bay Area News Group/Pool)\n\nObama and West are an interesting pair. The rapper performed at one of the president's inaugural balls back in 2009, but after West seized Taylor Swift's microphone at that year's Video Music Awards -- the \"imma let you finish\" incident that lives on in memedom -- Obama called him \"a jackass.\" Obama said the same thing again in 2012, though qualifying that West also is \"smart, he's very talented.\"\n\nWest downplayed that in 2013 but his wife, Kim Kardashian, shot back in a GQ interview in 2014. \"I don't think it's very appropriate for the president of the United States to be commenting really on pop culture,\" she said. \"I mean, calling people 'jackass'? ... I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion -- even him.\"\n\nThen, in March at Oxford University, West claimed the president occasionally dials him up to chew the fat: \"Obama calls the home phone, by the way.\" Obama told Jimmy Kimmel days later that he has met West only twice and \"I don't think I've got his home number.\" Yet West soon doubled down on his claim to TMZ: \"I love Obama. He called our house before. He knows that. Don't try to pit us against each other.\"\n\nJosh Richman covers politics. Follow him at Twitter.com/Josh_Richman.
