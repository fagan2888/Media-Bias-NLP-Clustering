As LifeNews previously reported, in 2009, Obama started his presidency with a bang by giving China, one of the worst countries in the world for sex-trafficking, millions of dollar to fund their brutal one-child policy. Then he promised the American people that his health care policy, Obamacare, would not fund abortion. However, four years later, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that showed that Obamacare plans cover abortion and receive taxpayer subsides.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nOf course, Obama has also rallied behind Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion business in America. In 2013, Marjorie Dannenfeiser, the president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said the following about Obama\u2019s support for Planned Parenthood: \u201cThere is no industry that President Obama is more willing to protect than the abortion industry and particularly Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s biggest abortion provider, which in a single year performed more than 333,000 abortions. The president has defended federal funding for Planned Parenthood to the point of being willing to shut down the government over the continuing resolution battle, and in return they spent a record amount to reelect him in November.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in 2013, he praised the abortion giant and said he wanted God to bless them. He said, \u201cAs long as we\u2019ve got to fight to make sure women have access to quality, affordable health care, and as long as we\u2019ve got to fight to protect a woman\u2019s right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you\u2019ve also got a president who\u2019s going to be right there with you, fighting every step of the way. Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you.\u201d\n\nMost recently, President Obama has showed his extreme abortion views by threatening to veto the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would protect babies after 20-weeks from abortion based on the concept that they can feel pain. In January, the Obama administration said in a press release: \u201cThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 36, which would unacceptably restrict women\u2019s health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman\u2019s right to choose. Women should be able to make their own choices about their bodies and their health care, and Government should not inject itself into decisions best made between a woman and her doctor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Irony: Obama Says \u201cEvery Human Being, Made in the Image of God, Deserves to Live in Dignity\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "On June 9, President Barack Obama spoke before the Catholic Health Association and said that his first job out of college taught him that \u201cevery human being,", "title": "Irony: Obama Says \u201cEvery Human Being, Made in the Image of God, Deserves to Live in Dignity\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/06/10/irony-obama-says-every-human-being-made-in-the-image-of-god-deserves-to-live-in-dignity/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/barackobama10.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "irony: obama says \u201cevery human being,made in the image of god,deserves to live in dignity\u201d", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb168\"", "article_summary": "Thank you, Planned Parenthood.\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.comOf course, Obama has also rallied behind Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion business in America.\n36, which would unacceptably restrict women\u2019s health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\u201cBut despite these challenges, I saw how kindness and compassion and faith can change the arc of people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\nIn January, the Obama administration said in a press release: \u201cThe Administration strongly opposes H.R."}
