Twitter: @TabooVideo\n\nIs the pressure to perform well in bed driving some consumers to put their health at risk to increase their sexual stamina? According to recent reports, the answer is a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\"I didn't want to look like a schmuck and underperform,\" one man in his early 30s told the Daily News. \"It's a lot of pressure for a guy, you know?\"\n\nThe Daily News reports that despite known health risks, New Yorkers are still taking sex supplements, which are sold at bodegas, delis, and sex shops across the city. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued several warnings about sex supplements and male enhancement products that purport to be \u201call natural,\u201d but in fact contain traces of prescription-strength medication.\n\n\u201cConsumers should stop using this product immediately and throw it away. Consumers who have experienced any negative side effects should consult a health care professional as soon as possible,\u201d the FDA said in a warning notice. \u201cFDA laboratory analysis confirmed that [a sex supplement] contains the undeclared ingredient sulfoaildenafil. Sulfoaildenafil is structurally similar to sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, an FDA-approved prescription drug for erectile dysfunction (ED).\"\n\n\"This interaction may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take prescription drugs that contain nitrates,\" the FDA added.\n\nAccording to Harvard Medical School\u2019s Dr. Pieter Cohen, the FDA has identified about 400 products that are \u201cspiked\u201d with prescription medication. That\u2019s about one-third of the entire sex pill market.\n\nStore owners, who placed the sex pills among candy and trail mix in their shops, said that they did not know the supplements were potentially harmful to customers. When approached by cameras from New York\u2019s WPIX11 News, many of the owners told the reporter that they would discontinue their sale of the items.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, natural sex supplements, male enhancement pills, new york city", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA warned that many 'natural' sex supplements and male enhancement pills contain traces of prescription-strength medication \u2014 but that doesn't stop New York shops from selling them.", "title": "Stiff Competition: Sex Pill Market Flourishes In NYC Despite FDA Warnings [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/natural-sex-supplements-deemed-unsafe-fda-still-being-sold-marketed-new-york-city-shops-video-255511", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/buckram-male-enhancement.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA warned that many 'natural' sex supplements and male enhancement pills contain traces of prescription-strength medication \u2014 but that doesn't stop New York shops from selling them.", "title": "Stiff Competition: Sex Pill Market Flourishes In NYC Despite FDA Warnings [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/natural-sex-supplements-deemed-unsafe-fda-still-being-sold-marketed-new-york-city-shops-video-255511", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/buckram-male-enhancement.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/buckram-male-enhancement.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-04T15:14:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T15:14:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA warned that many 'natural' sex supplements and male enhancement pills contain traces of prescription-strength medication \u2014 but that doesn't stop New York shops from selling them."}, "article_summary": "The Daily News reports that despite known health risks, New Yorkers are still taking sex supplements, which are sold at bodegas, delis, and sex shops across the city.\nThe FDA warned that many 'natural' sex supplements and male enhancement pills contain traces of prescription-strength medication \u2014 but that doesn't stop New York shops from selling them.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued several warnings about sex supplements and male enhancement products that purport to be \u201call natural,\u201d but in fact contain traces of prescription-strength medication.\nMen with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take prescription drugs that contain nitrates,\" the FDA added.\nStore owners, who placed the sex pills among candy and trail mix in their shops, said that they did not know the supplements were potentially harmful to customers."}
