Too many of them were eager to nationalize the nation\u2019s healthcare system, ignore or rewrite inconvenient laws, control the Internet and political speech, implement new regulations that imposed enormous costs for few or illusory benefits, and shut down oil, gas and coal in favor of expensive, unreliable, heavily subsidized wind, solar and biofuel energy.\n\nWe voters and citizens were supposed to \u201ctip our hats to the new Constitution\u201d and \u201ctake a bow for the new revolution,\u201d as The Who put it in their classic song, \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again.\u201d\n\nBut now people seem less inclined to \u201csmile and grin at the change all around.\u201d They increasingly grasp the enormous costs of this ruling class totalitarian anarchy, refuse to get fooled again, and are telling Mr. Obama, \u201cYour states and your citizens are beyond your command,\u201d as Bob Dylan might say. Perhaps \u201cthe times are a-changing\u201d once again, and \u201cthe losers now will be later to win\u201d \u2013 in 2016 and beyond.\n\nPervasive signs certainly portend a newer revolution. Indeed, the reactions of some previous cheerleaders respond to the disdain the president often seems to show for their jobs and well-being. The energy and environment arena is only part of the total picture, but it\u2019s a vitally important one.\n\nOzone. EPA is determined to implement stringent new ozone regulations \u2013 even though US ozone levels and overall air quality have improved steadily for decades, and the already tough 2008 ozone standards have not yet been fully implemented. This action would turn hundreds of cities and counties into nonattainment areas, impair manufacturing and transportation, cost up to $140 billion per year, and increase unemployment \u2013 for health benefits that are inflated or even fabricated.\n\nA Small Business Entrepreneurship Council study found that EPA\u2019s proposed rules would put numerous jobs at risk in a six-county Chicago area that is home to 65% of Illinois\u2019 population, over 60% of its Latinos and 80% of its blacks, 73% of its GDP and 70% of its employment. With the unemployment rate already at 12% for Latinos and 25% for blacks, elected officials and business owners are alarmed.\n\nThe US Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Association of Counties, National Association of Regional Councils \u2013 Democrats and Republicans representing 19,000 cities, 3,000 counties and 500 councils \u2013 have all expressed deep concern and asked EPA to retain the 2008 ozone standards. So have the National and Illinois Black Chambers of Commerce, US Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nThey worry that the new rules would stifle economic growth and investment, and cause major job losses across the country. The rules set ozone standards lower than naturally occurring in many national parks. Thus far, EPA is ignoring the pleas, though Inside EPA says the agency may grant a one-year extension for some areas to comply with the 2008 standards, before slapping them with the newer diktats.\n\nCoal-fueled electricity generation. The Obama EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan (CPP) will force still more coal mines and power plants to close, imposing higher electricity costs on businesses and families, and causing lost jobs, lower incomes, higher poverty rates, reduced living standards, and diminished health and welfare. It will hit blacks and Hispanics especially hard and require families to pay $1,225 more per year for electricity, heating and air conditioning in 2030 than in 2012.\n\nA dozen states have already sued EPA to prevent it from implementing the plan. They and other experts note that the CPP will bring no climate benefits, even if carbon dioxide actually is a major factor in global warming. In fact, even EPA admits it would prevent merely 0.03 degrees F of warming \u2013 because China, India, Germany and other countries are planning or building nearly 2,200 coal-fired power plants. That and increasing natural gas and gasoline use worldwide will raise atmospheric CO2 levels still higher.\n\nImpacts on people. EPA\u2019s rules are devastating coal-reliant communities. By 2020, they will cost 75,000 direct jobs in coal mines, power plants and railroads, a union study estimates; by 2035, job losses will reach 152,000. When secondary employment is included, the total impact will be some 485,000 lost jobs. This will also affect state tax revenues and funding for company pensions and retirement health care benefits, putting hundreds of thousands of current and future retirees in harm\u2019s way.\n\nEPA ignores the huge toll that job losses have on people\u2019s health and welfare. Unemployed families find it harder to buy food, pay for doctor visits and medicine, give to churches and charities, save for college and retirement, and make mortgage, rent and car payments. They face less sleep, worse nutrition and more stress, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, spousal and child abuse, strokes and heart attacks.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) says \u201ca lot of people on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum are going to die,\u201d because of the CPP. Liberal constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe (who once hired Barack Obama as a legal research assistant) says the EPA plan is unconstitutional. National Black Chamber of Commerce President Harry Alford calls it \u201ca slap in the face to poor and minority families.\u201d\n\nTrade unions. Once strong supporters of President Obama, the United Mine Workers of America, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and other unions have come out in strong opposition to the administration\u2019s job-killing actions on the Keystone XL pipeline and other initiatives.\n\nWind power. States are reducing or terminating Renewable Portfolio Standards and programs. Kansas, West Virginia and Indiana repealed their mandate, Ohio froze its standard at 2.5% renewable electricity, and North Carolina may freeze its RPS. Wildlife groups are finally recognizing and objecting to the serious habitat destruction and bird and bat slaughter that is a hallmark of wind and solar facilities.\n\nCollusion. There is growing concern about the cozy ties and private meetings between EPA officials and eco-activists, their sue-and-settle deals, and EPA payments to advisory committees and environmental pressure groups that propagandize for agency actions. Far too many regulations have their origins in collusion, collaboration, and secretive input and \u201creports\u201d from radical anti-hydrocarbon groups.\n\nThe Secret Science Reform Act would compel EPA to develop regulations and scientific studies in the open, and allow truly independent experts to examine and challenge data, evidence and studies that supposedly support EPA dictates that could cost billions of dollars and millions of jobs. It is long overdue.\n\nThe Supremes. Even if it must ignore the clear intent or language of laws like ObamaCare, the US Supreme Court has often been another reliable Obama rubberstamp. Yet it recently ruled in Michigan v. EPA that EPA violated the law by failing to consider monetary costs in deciding to regulate air pollution from power plants. The agency\u2019s refusal to recognize the damage its regulations inflict on human health and welfare is a far more serious offense, and the agency must not be allowed to continue doing that.\n\nDwindling overseas support. Countries once enamored with \u201crenewable\u201d energy are now reexamining those policies, as they realize wind and solar energy kills four to six jobs for every \u201cgreen\u201d job created via unsustainable subsidies \u2013 and the electricity costs families and businesses up to 36-40 cents per kilowatt-hour (without counting taxpayer subsidies), compared to 8-9 cents per kWh in coal-reliant US states.\n\nThe African Development Bank says it will no longer tolerate policies that prevent construction of coal-fired power plants needed to bring electricity to 730 million Africans who do not yet enjoy the countless blessings that this miracle energy brings. About the only reason poor countries support a new climate treaty is that they (or at least their ruling elites) expect to share in the $100 billion per year that they claim developed nations must pay them for supposed global warming \u201creparation, mitigation and prevention.\u201d\n\nFar too many EPA and other environmental regulations are wrong for workers, families, states and the overall \u201cquality of the human environment.\u201d That\u2019s why \u201cthere\u2019s a battle outside raging.\u201d Free, responsible citizens do not want or need to be \u201cfundamentally transformed\u201d by deceit, collusion and decree.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/07/take-a-bow-for-the-new-revolution/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/The_Who_Hamburg_1972.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Take a Bow for the New Revolution"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d24\"", "article_summary": "Yet it recently ruled in Michigan v.
