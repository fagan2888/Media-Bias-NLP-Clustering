Rick Perry spoke to the Republican Society at the Citadel on Monday, telling cadets the proposed nuclear treaty with Iran is flawed and should be scrapped.\n\nSpeaking Monday at The Citadel, likely Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said he would throw out President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran if he makes it to the White House.\n\nFor a map tracking visits to the Palmetto State from announced or prospective presidential candidates, go to postandcourier.com/candidate-visits.

And no agreement is better than a bad agreement.\u201d\n\nFollowing his speech, some cadets said they liked Perry\u2019s bluntness. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to make his points,\u201d said senior Ben Heckman of Tampa, Fla.\n\nThe Citadel has been a high-profile stop for Republicans looking to highlight their hawkish credentials, including several before Perry who have used the venue to air foreign policy views before a receptive audience.\n\nMitt Romney, Rand Paul, Newt Gingrich, Donald Trump, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal have all made stops there during the current and previous election cycles. Monday\u2019s address was to the school\u2019s Republican Society, the largest club on campus.\n\nDuring his 40-minute address, Perry played up his military exposure, first as a member of the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M University, and then as a captain in the Air Force and as governor of Texas.\n\nHe accused the Obama administration of fumbling foreign policy around the globe, while military budgets face being cut following two long wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIt is time for a debate about the state of our military, and its historic underfunding,\u201d Perry said. \u201cIt is time to tell the truth to the American people that leaders of both parties have gutted our defenses because they refused to impose spending discipline on other areas of government.\u201d\n\nSome of his comments were directed at the schools Corps of Cadets, pointing to the 20 Citadel graduates lost in the war on terror.\n\n\u201cAt no time in the last 25 years has the world been more dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because of it, some of you will be called upon to put your lives at risk.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Perry told The Post and Courier that one of several flaws in what\u2019s been pursued so far is that Iran still remains the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, something not addressed in the agreement\u2019s outline announced last week.\n\nPerry specifically mentioned Iran\u2019s support for Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which have a common enemy in Israel.\n\n\u201cUntil they get out of the terrorism business, I wouldn\u2019t have any negotiations with them at all,\u201d Perry said during a tour of The Citadel campus.\n\n\u201cAnd I would up the ante, so to speak, on the sanctions and literally, economically bring them to their knees.\u201d\n\nPerry\u2019s comments echo the calls for readdressing the deal by Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail.\n\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who also is a potential 2016 candidate, on Sunday said the entire nuclear agreement process with Iran should be bumped until 2017, when there is a new occupant in the White House.\n\nPerry is expected to decide by June whether he will formally enter the race for the GOP nomination. Later Monday evening he was scheduled to meet with a group of ministers in Charleston.\n\nReach Schuyler Kropf at 937-5551.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Rick Perry vows to scrap Iran nuclear deal if he\u2019s elected president, News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nElections, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Iran,nuclear agreement,Rick Perry,The Citadel", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Speaking Monday at The Citadel, likely Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said he would throw out President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran if he makes it to the White House.", "title": "Rick Perry vows to scrap Iran nuclear deal if he\u2019s elected president", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150406/150409545/rick-perry-vows-to-scrap-iran-nuclear-deal-if-he-x2019-s-elected-president", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150406/PC1603/150409545/AR/0/AR-150409545.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150406/PC1603/150409545/AR/0/AR-150409545.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaking Monday at The Citadel, likely Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said he would throw out President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran if he makes it to the White House.", "title": "Rick Perry vows to scrap Iran nuclear deal if he\u2019s elected president", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150406/PC1603/150409545/AR/0/AR-150409545.jpg?201504061917", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150409545}}, "keywords": "Rick Perry vows to scrap Iran nuclear deal if he\u2019s elected president , News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nElections, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Iran,nuclear agreement,Rick Perry,The Citadel", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-06T15:20:14Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T19:17:00Z", "author": "Schuyler Kropf"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Speaking Monday at The Citadel, likely Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said he would throw out President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran if he makes it to the White House."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb131\"", "article_summary": "Speaking Monday at The Citadel, likely Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said he would throw out President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran if he makes it to the White House.\n\u201c(Obama) says it prevents a nuclear Iran,\u201d he continued.\nRick Perry spoke to the Republican Society at the Citadel on Monday, telling cadets the proposed nuclear treaty with Iran is flawed and should be scrapped.\n\u201cShould I run for president and be so fortunate to be elected, one of my first actions in office would be to invalidate the president\u2019s Iran agreement, which jeopardizes the safety and security of the free world,\u201d Perry said.\nPerry is expected to decide by June whether he will formally enter the race for the GOP nomination."}
