Jay Nixon\u2019s desk, one of the first bills to make it that far this session. Touted by sponsor Rep. Bill Reiboldt, R-Neosho, as the Dairy Revitalization Act, the measure earned a second nickname Thursday: \u201cObamacow.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason for that. As the AP report explained, the main purpose of Missouri\u2019s Dairy Revitalization Act is to \u201csubsidize federal dairy insurance for up to 70 percent of farmers\u2019 premium payments.\u201d\n\nIt passed the state House with relative ease, 110 to 49, and fared even better in the state Senate, where the vote was 31 to 2. After clearing the Republican-led legislature, the bill heads to Gov. Jay Nixon (D), who\u2019s expected to sign it into law.\n\nAnd for dairy farmers in the state, it\u2019s no doubt good news to hear that the cost of insuring their cows is about to improve. But state Sen. Ryan Silvey, a Kansas City Republican, questioned why the GOP-led legislature is eager to provide subsidies to insure cows, while those same Republicans remain fiercely opposed to providing subsidies to insure human families.\n\nOr as state Rep. Jeremy LaFaver (D-Mo.) put it , under the \u201cAffordable Cow Act,\u201d insurance subsidies for cows are fine, but \u201cnot for people.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the timing of the \u201cObamacow\u201d vote coincided with protests from Missouri citizens, urging GOP lawmakers to embrace Medicaid expansion, as most other states have already done. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported overnight:\n\nHundreds of people calling for Medicaid expansion encircled the Senate chamber Thursday, delaying the state\u2019s upper chamber about an hour. Just before senators began their last minutes of debate before the Legislative spring break begins, the Capitol\u2019s third floor filled up with a sea of red-shirted Missourians calling for what Republican leaders have called a non-starter. Office doors of Republican lawmakers, normally open and inviting, were tightly shut as those rallying sang songs, chanted \u201cthis is what Democracy looks like\u201d and held signs demanding the Legislature \u201chave the debate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "You've heard of \"Obamacare.\" But how about \"Obamacow\"?", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/missouri-tackles-the-affordable-cow-act", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "You've heard of \"Obamacare.\" But how about \"Obamacow\"?", "title": "Missouri tackles the Affordable Cow Act", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/missouri-tackles-the-affordable-cow-act", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/wip_0038_h_51818042.jpg?itok=3z65OB3T", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/missouri-tackles-the-affordable-cow-act", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/wip_0038_h_51818042.jpg?itok=C6koJwxZ", "height": 553}, "title": "Missouri tackles the Affordable Cow Act", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "You've heard of \"Obamacare.\" But how about \"Obamacow\"?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-20T10:59:02-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "agriculture,health,health-care-reform,medicaid,missouri,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Missouri tackles the Affordable Cow Act", "published": 1, "date": "03/20/2015 10:59:02 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/missouri-tackles-the-affordable-cow-act"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "You've heard of \"Obamacare.\" But how about \"Obamacow\"?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Agriculture, Medicaid, Missouri"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ac2\"", "article_summary": "[Missouri state lawmakers] on Thursday sent a bill aimed at spurring growth in Missouri\u2019s dairy industry to Democratic Gov.\nTouted by sponsor Rep.
