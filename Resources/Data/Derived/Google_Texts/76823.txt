CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - The bookkeeper for a Charleston soccer team has been accused of taking $100,000 over the past four years.

Multiple media outlets reported that a police report released Tuesday shows that the bookkeeper of the Charleston Battery is accused of taking the money.

Police spokesman Charles Francis says the bookkeeper has not yet been charged. The person’s name has not been released. Francis says the investigation is continuing.

The police report says an officer was told Aug. 11 that the bookkeeper had opened an unauthorized debit card on one of the team’s bank accounts. The person took about $100,000 between 2011 and 2015.

The police report says the person has been fired.
