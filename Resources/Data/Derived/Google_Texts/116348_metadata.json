Yet for runners, the idea of balance could not be more critical, because running is, after all, an actual balancing act.\n\n\u201cWhen you run, you never have both feet on the ground at the same time,\u201d said Ian Hankins, head men\u2019s cross-country and track and field coach at the Catholic University of America. \u201cEverything needs to line up at the center of your body so you don\u2019t fall over. When your core and posterior chain are aligned and you\u2019re not tipping forward or leaning back, as a runner, you are more efficient and use less energy.\u201d\n\nIn addition to coaching his athletes through such running warm-ups as A-skips and carioca, or grapevine \u2014 drills that teach the body how to run in the correct way \u2014 Hankins incorporates Olympic lifts to strengthen core muscles.\n\n\u201cMost distance runners don\u2019t think about the importance of weight training to strengthen the core and upper body for the purpose of running more efficiently,\u201d Hankins said. \u201cYou need to have strong upper-body muscles to balance and hold the body in the proper position over a long period of time and during high intensity.\u201d\n\nRunners who have an impaired sense of balance are at an increased risk of injury by tripping and falling, said physical therapist Kevin McGuinness, who practices at Washington Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine. Imbalances also cause overuse injuries when certain muscles are forced to overcompensate for others.\n\nHe noted that we derive our sense of balance from information collected by the muscular skeletal system, the visual system and the vestibular system inside the inner ear. All these tell the body where it is in space and how fast our limbs are moving.\n\nOftentimes, motor control coordination gets lost in the mix, McGuinness said. Runners have been known to focus on nutrition, mileage and strength, which are all important, but at the expense of balance training.\n\nSo how do we know if we\u2019re off balance when we run?\n\nElite runner Tina Muir, who holds a half-marathon personal record of 1:13 and a marathon personal record of 2:41, found herself dealing with one injury after another, including hamstring strain, plantar fasciitis and calf strain, before she and her coach took a hard look at her running form.\n\n\u201cLooking at photos of myself, I could tell I was wasting energy,\u201d Muir said. \u201cMy upper body was moving side to side instead of forward, so most of my energy was pushing sideways instead of ahead.\u201d\n\nAge can also be a factor affecting sense of balance, McGuinness said. Age-related changes to the visual and the vestibular system, in addition to muscle weakness and stiffness as we get older, can affect the brain\u2019s ability to make these kinds of adjustments as we run or, in some instances, walk, he said.\n\n\u201cBalance, like anything else, requires practice,\u201d McGuinness said. \u201cThe good news is you can train the balance system by incorporating exercises that physically coordinate what the limbs are doing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/08/1003343596-FL_SAR_HFFIT11.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe good news is you can train the balance system by incorporating exercises that physically coordinate what the limbs are doing.\u201d\nYet for runners, the idea of balance could not be more critical, because running is, after all, an actual balancing act.\n\u201cMost distance runners don\u2019t think about the importance of weight training to strengthen the core and upper body for the purpose of running more efficiently,\u201d Hankins said.\n\u201cMy upper body was moving side to side instead of forward, so most of my energy was pushing sideways instead of ahead.\u201dAge can also be a factor affecting sense of balance, McGuinness said.\nHe noted that we derive our sense of balance from information collected by the muscular skeletal system, the visual system and the vestibular system inside the inner ear."}
