An iFixit teardown of the latest developer version of the Oculus Rift shows it uses the smartphone display.\n\nIt even has its touchscreen capability still intact. iFixit jokes about the potential of an eyelash controller in the future. There is at least one notable difference with the Oculus display. It\u2019s capable of a 75 Hz refresh, compared to the display\u2019s original 60 Hz refresh rate.\n\nA Samsung display in the latest version of Oculus Rift isn\u2019t too surprising. An Engadget report from late May says the two companies are working together. In exchange for early access to Oculus\u2019 mobile software development kit, Oculus will get early access to Samsung\u2019s next OLED screens that will have resolutions higher than 1080p.\n\nA CNET report from late July corroborates the Engadget report.\n\nSamsung is believed to be working on its own VR device that may be unveiled later this year. This device is said to use your phone as the headset. That seemed far-fetched until the recent teardown by iFixit.\n\nThe wearable tech space is about to explode. The Oculus Rift has been praised as a game-changing experience to first-person games. Other tech companies don\u2019t want to miss the VR train either with Sony working hard on its own device. Samsung\u2019s entry into the media aspect of VR is sure to be followed by other companies.\n\nPlus, Apple is reportedly jumping into the wearable space with its iWatch, or whatever the tech blogs are dubbing it these days. It will be interesting to see how the general consumer reacts to the slew of wearable tech devices coming in the next year or two.
