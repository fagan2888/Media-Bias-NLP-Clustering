Conspicuously absent: America\u2019s biggest gas producer, Exxon Mobil The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been wondering why.\n\nThe energy behemoth became America\u2019s biggest natural-gas producer when it bought XTO Energy Inc. for $25 billion in June 2010. At the time, gas sold for just shy of $5 per million British thermal unit, but since then the price has hovered well below that level \u2013 dipping under $2 per Btu in 2012 \u2013 until this winter.\n\nExxon chief executive Rex Tillerson even said in 2012 that the company was making \u201cno money\u201d on shale gas.\n\nThe SEC quoted Mr. Tillerson when it wrote to Exxon in September, according to correspondence the commission made public on Monday. The regulators asked whether the company had tested the value of its shale reserves and why it had taken no write-downs.\n\nAs a nationwide gas glut pushed down prices, many companies \u2013 including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BHP Billiton Ltd. \u2013 concluded some of their shale properties were worth billions of dollars less than what they paid, prompting them to take write-downs.\n\nFor energy companies, the reserves of oil and gas they control are a measure of the cash they can bring in the future. When the value of those reserves falls below their internal price tag, they recognize it as a charge to income.\n\nExxon\u2019s answer to the SEC boils down to this: Yes, low gas prices hurt in 2012, but the pain was fleeting and the future looks a lot better.\n\nTo put a value on wells that pump oil and gas for decades, Exxon argued in its response to the SEC, it has to factor in things that haven\u2019t happened yet. For instance, Exxon pointed out that the U.S. is poised to export a significant amount of natural gas overseas, which could boost prices for the fuel.\n\nExxon also told the SEC it didn\u2019t test the value of its shale holdings in 2012, because low commodity prices in the short term don\u2019t justify such an exercise. Last month, natural-gas prices rose to their highest level since June 2010.\n\nIt can be embarrassing for CEOs to admit they overpaid. The chief executive of BHP Billiton forfeited a bonus in 2012 after the Australian conglomerate took a $2.84 billion write-down on some of its U.S. shale-gas properties. A few months later he left the company. Shell took a $2 billion write-down on North American shale assets last August, just weeks after naming a new chief executive.\n\nWriting down asset values can help reduce income taxes and make a company look more profitable, but first \u201csomebody has to bite the bullet,\u201d Oppenheimer & Co analyst Fadel Gheit said. That\u2019s easier for a new CEO than one already in place, like Exxon\u2019s Mr. Tillerson.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to take the write-off on his watch,\u201d Mr. Gheit said, adding that Exxon has long resisted writing down the value of assets.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Energy companies have written down the value of shale gas assets by billions of dollars in recent years, but Exxon has stuck by its valuation, prompting questions from regulators.", "title": "Regulators Ask Exxon: Why No Write-Downs?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/02/03/regulators-ask-exxon-why-no-writedowns/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CB053_CMDGAS_P_20140130212942.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Regulators Ask Exxon: Why No Write-Downs?", "description": "Energy companies have written down the value of shale gas assets by billions of dollars in recent years, but Exxon has stuck by its valuation, prompting questions from regulators.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Daniel Gilbert", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Energy companies have written down the value of shale gas assets by billions of dollars in recent years, but Exxon has stuck by its valuation, prompting questions from regulators.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-02-03T22:17:37-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/02/03/regulators-ask-exxon-why-no-writedowns/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-3646", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Energy companies have written down the value of shale gas assets by billions of dollars in recent years, but Exxon has stuck by its valuation, prompting questions from regulators.", "title": "Regulators Ask Exxon: Why No Write-Downs?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/02/03/regulators-ask-exxon-why-no-writedowns/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CB053_CMDGAS_P_20140130212942.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-3646", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-03T22:20:33-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson even said in 2012 that the company was making \u201cno money\u201d on shale gas.\nThe regulators asked whether the company had tested the value of its shale reserves and why it had taken no write-downs.\nConspicuously absent: America\u2019s biggest gas producer, Exxon Mobil The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been wondering why.\nThe SEC quoted Mr. Tillerson when it wrote to Exxon in September, according to correspondence the commission made public on Monday.\nThe energy behemoth became America\u2019s biggest natural-gas producer when it bought XTO Energy Inc. for $25 billion in June 2010."}
