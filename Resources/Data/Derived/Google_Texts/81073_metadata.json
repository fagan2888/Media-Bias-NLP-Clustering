Conservative groups have decried the $4.2 million project as an \u201cabortion super center,\u201d while reproductive health advocates have maintained that it\u2019s an important resource for women in the region, who face high rates of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThe fight intensified last winter, when the New Orleans Archdiocese declared a boycott against all of the businesses that are assisting in the construction and financing of the clinic. \u201cAll citizens of the New Orleans area must stand together for a peaceful community, not one with more abortion and more Planned Parenthood,\u201d Archbishop Gregory Aymond wrote in January in the official newspaper of the Archdiocese.\n\nBut the Rev. Walter Baer \u2014 who serves as the priest-in-charge at the Episcopal Church of the Annunciation, located across the street from the new Planned Parenthood location \u2014 has a different perspective on the controversy. In a letter entitled \u201cPeople of Faith Support Reproductive Rights\u201d published this weekend in the New Orleans Advocate, Baer argues it\u2019s a good thing that his congregation is getting a new neighbor.\n\n\u201cI write to express my support for the right of the clinic to be there and to serve the reproductive needs of our community\u2026 I also write to make clear that there are many Christians, Christian denominations and many other people of faith who support the reproductive rights of women,\u201d Bear explains. \u201cI am very disappointed with some fellow Christian people and churches who have made threats of exclusion and boycotts to congregants who wish to work with the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe Episcopal Church has supported the use of hormonal contraception for decades, and opposes any efforts to limit women\u2019s access to safe reproductive care. While the church only supports abortion in very rare circumstances, noting that it should be a last resort, it does recognize women\u2019s legal right to end a pregnancy.\n\nEpiscopalians aren\u2019t alone; many denominations don\u2019t condemn abortion outright and affirm that the procedure is a personal decision for each family. In fact, religious leaders have long advocated for legal abortion care to protect women\u2019s lives. Before abortion was legalized in the United States, a group of 1400 faith leaders formed the \u201cClergy Consultation Service\u201d to help refer women to safe options, believing it was their ethical responsibility to prevent women from dying from back alley abortions.\n\n\u201cAs a parish church that is named for the most wondrous conception in history, we welcome the Planned Parenthood clinic to the neighborhood. It will serve a very important role in education, health screenings, contraception and, when necessary, a safe place for the termination of pregnancy,\u201d Baer concludes.\n\nPro-choice faith groups have become more vocal in recent years, as they\u2019ve observed reproductive rights being chipped away in the name of religion. After the Supreme Court ruled that some for-profit companies can drop coverage for birth control on religious grounds, for example, some clergy protested by passing out condoms in front of Hobby Lobby stores. \u201cFor too long, the extreme Religious Right has dominated the public conversation about religion and sexuality,\u201d Rev. Harry Knox, the president of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, told ThinkProgress earlier this year.\n\nIn New Orleans specifically, there have been particularly contentious clashes between the people of faith who oppose abortion and the more progressive religious communities that feel differently. Earlier this summer, a group of abortion protesters interrupted a local church service to tell the Unitarian Universalist congregants that they don\u2019t have a \u201ctrue faith\u201d because their denomination supports reproductive rights. That was widely condemned as a disrespectful move.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "There's been a contentious battle over a new Planned Parenthood clinic being constructed in New Orleans, but at least one congregation is happy to have a new neighbor.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "There's been a contentious battle over a new Planned Parenthood clinic being constructed in New Orleans, but at least one congregation is happy to have a new neighbor.", "title": "Priest Speaks Up For Planned Parenthood: \u2018People Of Faith Support Reproductive Rights\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/22/3570435/priest-planned-parenthood-letter/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_147830009.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's been a contentious battle over a new Planned Parenthood clinic being constructed in New Orleans, but at least one congregation is happy to have a new neighbor.", "title": "Priest Speaks Up For Planned Parenthood: \u2018People Of Faith Support Reproductive Rights\u2019", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_147830009-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_147830009.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_147830009.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-22T15:49:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6dd\"", "article_summary": "Health Priest Speaks Up For Planned Parenthood: \u2018People Of Faith Support Reproductive Rights\u2019 CREDIT: ShutterstockAn Episcopal priest in New Orleans is sending a strong message to the religious community in his state: I welcome a new Planned Parenthood clinic opening its doors in my community, and you should, too.\n\u201cAs a parish church that is named for the most wondrous conception in history, we welcome the Planned Parenthood clinic to the neighborhood.\nPro-choice faith groups have become more vocal in recent years, as they\u2019ve observed reproductive rights being chipped away in the name of religion.\nIn a letter entitled \u201cPeople of Faith Support Reproductive Rights\u201d published this weekend in the New Orleans Advocate, Baer argues it\u2019s a good thing that his congregation is getting a new neighbor.\nOver the past year, a bitter conflict has been raging over the construction of a Planned Parenthood clinic in New Orleans; since it\u2019s the first Planned Parenthood clinic in the state of Louisiana that will offer abortion services, it\u2019s become a flash point in the larger debate over the procedure."}
