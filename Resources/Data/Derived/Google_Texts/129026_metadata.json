Bush-appointed judge in Pennsylvania declared President Obama\u2019s recently announced immigration policy unconstitutional on Tuesday. Because the policy \u201cmay\u201d apply to a defendant who was awaiting sentencing of a criminal immigration violation, Judge Arthur Schwab decides that he must determine \u201cwhether the Executive Action is constitutional.\u201d He concludes that it is not.\n\nSchwab spends just five pages discussing his rationale for this conclusion, an unusually short amount of legal analysis for a complex question regarding the scope of the executive branch\u2019s power to set enforcement priorities. Notably, Schwab also spends nearly three pages discussing quotes from President Obama which, the judge claims, indicate that Obama once thought his present actions are illegal \u2014 even though Schwab eventually admits that these quotes are \u201cnot dispositive of the constitutionality of his Executive Action on immigration.\u201d\n\nHalf of Schwab\u2019s analysis of the Executive Action\u2019s constitutionality is devoted to a strawman. Noting that Obama cited Congress\u2019s failure to act on immigration in his speech announcing the new policy, Schwab devotes half of his analysis of the policy\u2019s constitutionality to explaining that \u201cInaction by Congress Does Not Make Unconstitutional Executive Action Constitutional.\u201d He\u2019s right on this point, just as Schwab would be correct if he argued that President Obama\u2019s authority to create this new policy does not come from a magic hat that Obama keeps in the Oval Office. But it\u2019s somewhat curious that the judge feels the need to present Obama\u2019s political rhetoric as if it were a constitutional argument and then tear that non-argument down.\n\nThe remainder of Schwab\u2019s brief constitutional analysis concludes that the new policy \u201cGoes Beyond Prosecutorial Discretion \u2014 It is Legislation.\u201d Notably, however, Schwab cites no judicial precedents of any kind to support this conclusion.\n\nOne case that Schwab does not cite is Arizona v. United States, where the Supreme Court said that the executive branch has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in matters of deportation and removal. As Arizona explains, a \u201cprincipal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.\u201d Executive branch officials, moreover, \u201cmust decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.\u201d\n\nNotably, Arizona also indicates that this broad discretion flows from federal immigration law \u2014 i.e. laws that were enacted by Congress. This matters because Schwab\u2019s opinion concludes that Obama\u2019s \u201cunilateral\u201d policy \u201cviolates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause.\u201d In essence, Schwab concludes that the president lacks the authority to act in the absence of authorization by Congress. Schwab does not even discuss the possibility that Obama\u2019s actions may actually be authorized by Congress. Thus, even if Schwab\u2019s reading of the Constitution is correct \u2014 itself a questionable proposition \u2014 the judge does not even discuss another major source of law that can justify the president\u2019s actions.\n\nAnother problem Schwab does not address in his constitutional analysis is how, exactly, the executive branch is supposed to deport the many millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States if it is not allowed to set enforcement priorities among them. As the Justice Department explained in a memo discussing the legality of Obama\u2019s policy, \u201cthere are approximately 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country,\u201d but the executive only \u201chas the resources to remove fewer than 400,000 such aliens each year.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Congress only provided sufficient resources to the Obama administration to remove a small fraction of the undocumented immigrants within the United States is itself a legislative judgment that most of these immigrants should not be removed. As the Supreme Court explained in Heckler v. Chaney, because federal agencies typically lack the resources to \u201cact against each technical violation of the statute it is charged with enforcing,\u201d they necessarily must set enforcement priorities. Moreover, these priorities generally should not be second-guessed by judges because \u201c[t]he agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.\u201d\n\nSo Schwab\u2019s legal analysis is thin. He spends nearly as much time making what appear to be political attacks on the president as he does evaluating actual legal matters. And what little legal analysis he does provide fails to cite key Supreme Court decisions that seem to contradict his conclusion. Judge Schwab traveled far along a very thin branch to reach this decision, and he anchored his decision with little grounding in legal authorities.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s not clear what effect, if any effect at all, this decision will actually have. The judge does not issue an injunction halting the new immigration policy. Nor does he even state with certainty that the actual defendant in the case before his court will benefit from an order declaring the immigration policy unconstitutional.\n\nYet, despite these weaknesses in his opinion, immigrant families would be wrong to write off the threat his decision could present. There was a time when the constitutional challenges to the Affordable Care Act were widely dismissed by legal experts \u2014 Ronald Reagan\u2019s former solicitor general said he would \u201ceat a hat which I bought in Australia last month made of kangaroo skin\u201d if the Supreme Court struck the law down \u2014 yet these challenges rapidly gained momentum after a few Republican judges reached out to strike the law down. The same can be said about the legal theory in King v. Burwell, a lawsuit currently before the Supreme Court that seeks to gut much of Obamacare.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Schwab\u2019s opinion \u2014 thin though its reasoning may be \u2014 will also grant legitimacy to the case against the president\u2019s immigration policy.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Judge Schwab's legal analysis is thin.
