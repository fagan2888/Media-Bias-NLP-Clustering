Chris Christie\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Catholic, but I\u2019ve used birth control, and not just the rhythm method, OK,\u201d Christie said as he roved a New Hampshire diner with microphone in hand. \u201cDoes that make me an awful Catholic because I believed and practiced that function during part of my life? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThe too-much-information moment made plenty of people cringe. But it also succeeded in getting some talking about something other than Donald Trump.\n\nYet, one person who stayed conspicuously silent was Archbishop John J. Myers of the Newark Archdiocese, the state\u2019s most powerful Catholic prelate, who has the stature to scold a highly visible member of his flock who publicly flouts Catholic doctrine. Myers hasn\u2019t been afraid to play the role of the doctrinal enforcer before, issuing a well-timed letter that put pressure on Catholic officials who supported abortion rights, or lobbying against same-sex marriage or fighting provisions in Obamacare, citing government infringement on religion.\n\nBut this time, Myers is remaining on the sidelines \u2013 and mum.\n\nA spokesman for Myers said it was simply \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment on what Governor Christie \u2013 or what any other 2016 presidential candidate, for that matter \u2013 has to say.\n\n\u201cWe understand that he has an opinion,\u2019\u2019 said James Goodness, the spokesman. \u201cThat\u2019s a personal issue that may be dealt with individually. We are not going to comment.\u201d\n\nTo a certain extent, Myers\u2019 reticence is surprising, given how he didn\u2019t hesitate in 2004 to use his doctrinal muscle to scold Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. And he had plenty to say about last year\u2019s public battle over a provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to offer contraception coverage in their health insurance. Yet, Christie\u2019s declaration \u2013 and Myers\u2019 reticence \u2013 over birth control reflects the shifting realities of Catholic politics.\n\nFor one thing, Christie\u2019s views on birth control are hardly out of the mainstream \u2013 most American Catholics have used birth control and view the church\u2019s ban on artificial contraceptives as antiquated. Nearly 76 percent of U.S. Catholics say the church should lift its ban on artificial birth control, according to a Pew Research study in March. And nearly 82 percent of Catholic voters polled by Gallup in 2012 said birth control is \u201cmorally defensible.\u201d\n\nThomas J. Reese, a senior analyst at National Catholic Reporter, said he\u2019s not surprised at Myers\u2019 reluctance to stay silent about Christie\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cThese bishops are caught between the rock and hard place on this issue,\u2019\u2019 Reese said. \u201cIf they lay down the law, and go after someone like Christie, what do they say to the other 90 percent of Catholics doing the same thing?\u201d\n\nAnother factor may be Pope Francis, who has set a new, inclusive tone since his election in 2012. Francis has called for more tolerance and acceptance of divorced and gay Catholics, and has warned that the church\u2019s obsession with issues such as abortion and gay marriage could alienate millions of ordinary worshipers and weaken the church\u2019s role in the world.\n\nGiven those realities, it may not be in Myers\u2019 long-term interests to pick a fight with Christie over birth control. In addition, it makes no sense alienating Christie at a time when he\u2019s evolved into a strident foe of abortion.\n\nChristie, the first New Jersey governor to address the annual antiabortion rally on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, has emerged into an antiabortion foe, casting his budget cuts to Planned Parenthood clinics as evidence of his antiabortion convictions, and challenging Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to answer questions about Planned Parenthood\u2019s practice of selling fetal tissue for medical research.\n\nChristie and Myers have forged a friendship over the years. Myers conducted the inaugural Mass for Christie in 2009. And Christie avoided criticizing Myers when his office came under fire over the supervision of a priest who had violated a lifetime ban on ministering to children in 2013.\n\nGoodness denied that polls or other strategic concerns played any role in Myers\u2019 decision not to comment on the birth control issue. And as to Myers\u2019 friendship with Christie: \u201cThey are friends, they\u2019ve been friends and they are going to continue to be friends.\u2019\u2019\n\nMyers hasn\u2019t been entirely silent on the issue of birth control. He was a visible figure in the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 campaign to block the Affordable Care Act provision that initially required employers \u2013 including Catholic-affiliated schools and hospitals \u2013 to provide health insurance that covered birth control costs.\n\nBut in that flap, Myers and the other bishops were focused on the larger constitutional issues as they argued that the law, popularly known as Obamacare, was an attack on religious liberty.\n\nMyers flexed his clout on other political issues. In 2004, Myers issued a strongly worded pastoral statement declaring that Catholics who supported abortion rights are being \u201cobjectively dishonest\u201d when they seek Communion.\n\nAlthough it never mentioned James McGreevey, then the governor, by name, Myers\u2019 letter \u2013 coupled with similar criticisms from other bishops who did name him directly \u2013 prompted McGreevey to announce that he would stop receiving Communion.\n\nGoodness said Myers was simply trying to offer some clarity for parishioners \u2013 a similar debate was percolating in the presidential contest that year between Democrat John Kerry and Republican incumbent George W. Bush.\n\nIn past interviews, Myers has cast himself as a champion of Catholic tradition orthodoxy. In a 2013 interview, he expressed confidence in the \u201cnew evangelization,\u2019\u2019 a kind of back-to-basics in church teaching that will \u201cstrengthen people as they hear, understand and embrace the faith.\u2019\n\nBut this time, the public is hearing Christie\u2019s own views.
