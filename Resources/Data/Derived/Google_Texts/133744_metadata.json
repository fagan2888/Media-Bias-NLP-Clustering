Despite Cuban leaders\u2019 view of such meetings as interference in the island\u2019s internal affairs, Rhodes said there was no reason to believe the government would block any invitees from participating.\n\n\u201cIf there are any impediments to that meeting we would be very clear about this,\u201d Rhodes said. He declined to name any of those who would attend.\n\nObama will arrive just days after unveiling sweeping new measures to make it far easier for Americans to visit Cuba and for the island\u2019s government to conduct international trade.\n\nObama\u2019s critics have accused him of giving up too much in return for too little from Cuban leaders and of now taking a premature \"victory lap.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration insists that engagement will benefit the Cuban people and open up the island to U.S. business \u2013 though Cuban leaders have been slow to make economic reforms. At the same time, the decades-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains, with little chance Congress will lift it anytime soon.\n\nRhodes said Obama\u2019s speech \u201cwill be a very important moment in the president\u2019s trip, an opportunity for him to describe the course that we\u2019re on, to review the complicated history between our two countries \u2026 but also to look forward to the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe very much want to make the process of normalization irreversible,\u201d he told reporters on a conference call.\n\nObama\u2019s aides hope that getting more U.S companies invested in Cuba and loosening up travel to the island will make it almost impossible for traditionally pro-business Republicans to roll back the thaw if they win the White House in November.\n\nTraveling with first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Sasha and Malia, the president plans to start his visit late on Sunday with a tour of the cultural sites of Old Havana. He will also meet Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a key role in the U.S.-Cuba diplomatic breakthrough in December 2014, at Havana's cathedral, Rhodes said.\n\n(Reporting by Matt Spetalnick and Jeff Mason; Editing by Chris Reese and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama plans to lay out his vision for U.S.-Cub", "title": "Obama's trip aims to make Cuba opening 'irreversible'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/16/Obama-address-Cuban-people-speech-Tuesday-White-House", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama-women_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/16/Obama-address-Cuban-people-speech-Tuesday-White-House", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama-women_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama plans to lay out his vision for U.S.-Cub", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Obama will arrive just days after unveiling sweeping new measures to make it far easier for Americans to visit Cuba and for the island\u2019s government to conduct international trade.\nObama\u2019s meeting with Cuban dissidents on Tuesday will include prominent activists of his own choosing, Rhodes said.\nAt the same time, the decades-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains, with little chance Congress will lift it anytime soon.\nDespite Cuban leaders\u2019 view of such meetings as interference in the island\u2019s internal affairs, Rhodes said there was no reason to believe the government would block any invitees from participating.\n\u201cIf there are any impediments to that meeting we would be very clear about this,\u201d Rhodes said."}
