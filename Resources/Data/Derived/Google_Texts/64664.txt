In today’s edition of The Heartland Daily Podcast, we listen in to the Milt Rosenberg Podcast as he speaks with Heartland Senior Fellow James Taylor and author and environmental researcher Steve Goreham. In this segment, Rosenberg plays the opposing perspective in a debate about the legitimacy of the man-made global warming theory.

Because of the alarmists refusal to debate, Rosenberg stands in as the opposing voice to Taylor and Goreham’s skepticism. In Part 2 of this podcast, Taylor, Goreham and Rosenberg take email questions and explain the “sustainability” movement.
