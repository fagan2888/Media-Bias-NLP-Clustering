First Edge Solutions Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert "Bobby" Kraft, who last month took the Milwaukee firm into receivership, is part of a group that now wants to buy the company.

An affiliate of World Marketing Inc., which Kraft and other investors acquired last fall, has submitted a bid for First Edge, according to a statement released Friday by Kraft.

The new group would offer jobs to "substantially all" of First Edge's employees, the statement said.

First Edge, 1301 W. Canal St., employs 52 people here and 23 in Arizona, according to the receivership petition.

In its petition for receivership protection July 9, First Edge listed $12.3 million in debts. The company's assets were valued at $2.4 million on the books, but would be worth less on the open market, the petition said.

First Edge's operations include printing, fulfillment, direct mail and marketing.

Joshua Morby, a spokesman for Kraft, said the company was hurt by changes in the health insurance industry following the Affordable Care Act. Among the company's major clients was Assurant Health, a Milwaukee insurance firm that is going out of business.

First Edge got into health-insurance-related work heavily when it acquired another Milwaukee company, Proven Direct, Morby said.

"The changes to the printing industry with the changes in the federal health insurance law were more dramatic and profound and quicker than anyone could have predicted," he said.

First Edge bought Proven in the spring of 2014.

Morby said the core business of First Edge remains profitable. "They still believe in the base business," he said.

Any sale of First Edge would have to be approved by Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Glenn Yamahiro, who is hearing the receivership case. Morby wouldn't say how much the World Marketing affiliate is bidding for First Edge. With Yamahiro on vacation Friday, documents in the court file were not available.
