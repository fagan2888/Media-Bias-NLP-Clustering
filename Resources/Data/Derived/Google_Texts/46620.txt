Four members of Congress are scheduled to speak at today’s March for Life: Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, Missouri Republican Vicky Hartzler, and Dan Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois.

As our Jonathan Strong noted back in November:

The morning of March 21, 2010, Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois was one of 34 House Democrats to vote against the final iteration of Obamacare. Many who joined him that day are no longer serving in Congress, but unlike them, Lipinski did not, and does not, represent a district that continually places him in mortal political peril. He won reelection in 2012, for example, with about 70 percent of the vote. Today Lipinski is leading the charge among House Democrats to delay Obamacare. He introduced a bill this week that would indefinitely extend the exchange market’s enrollment period and suspend the individual mandate until a neutral third party certified Healthcare.gov is up and running.

Lipinski was the only pro-life Democrat to address Congress in the run-up to the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, according to Life News.

Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Representative James Langevin of Rhode Island, Representative Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, and Representative Nick Rahall of West Virginia are on the federal advisory board of Democrats for Life of America. McIntyre announced his retirement at the end of this term; former members Jerry Costello of Illinois and Health Shuler of North Carolina are also members of that board, but they did not seek reelection in 2012.
