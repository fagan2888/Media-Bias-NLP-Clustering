I never thought it was going to be like this. The real game is (Saturday), and I hadn\u2019t imagined that there was going to be this many people. I was sitting on the bench looking around, first at my teammates and then all around. Not a whole lot of people get to experience this.\u201d\n\nThe opening goal of the game also was a flashback to when Valeri Kamensky, Forsberg and Claude Lemieux were linemates.\n\n\u201cI got a nice pass from Lemieux and I got to dish it to Kamensky, and we got the win, so you couldn\u2019t beat that,\u201d Forsberg said.\n\nNearby in the clubhouse for the Colorado Rockies \u2014 the baseball team, not the hockey team \u2014 Forsberg\u2019s teammates also were winding down from the on-ice experience.\n\n\u201cIt took awhile before we could start feeling the energy and hearing the noise,\u201d said Lemieux. \u201cIt was great, the temperature was perfect. Nobody wants to be embarrassed, and they played us hard and it could have been 4-0 or 5-0 early, and (Patrick Roy) played amazing, like old days.\u201d\n\nSaid winger Mike Keane: \u201cI played alumni games at Boston and Montreal, and just like this one, it\u2019s fun, then it gets a little more competitive and a little more competitive and then you don\u2019t want to lose. They were the same way, too.\u201d\n\nEvery time I see Keane, I\u2019m reminded of when he stood at a stall in the visiting dressing room in Joe Louis Arena on March 26, 1997, and to wave after wave of media members accused the Red Wings of being \u201cgutless\u201d for waiting for a home game to attempt to exact revenge on Lemieux for his hit on Kris Draper in Game 6 of the 1996 Western Conference finals.\n\nKeane, now an assistant director of player development for the Winnipeg Jets, laughed when I told him that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all behind,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still have a healthy respect, but back in the late \u201990s, you had a healthy dislike for each other. \u2026 But now you see a lot of each other \u2014 they\u2019re in the business, in development or scouting \u2014 and bump into each other at rinks. That was a long time ago, so it\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there were so many NHL team employees playing in the game, I wonder if conversations in Denver on Thursday or Friday might come into play leading up to the Monday trading deadline. Among them were (Avs general manager) Joe Sakic, Roy, Craig Billington (Avalanche assistant GM), Rob Blake (Kings assistant GM), Brendan Shanahan (Maple Leafs president) and Steve Yzerman (Lightning GM).\n\nNathan MacKinnon\u2019s Halifax Mooseheads linemate Jonathan Drouin still is suspended and sitting around after refusing to continue playing for the Lightning\u2019s AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. Roy\u2019s QMJHL experience again could come into play there, since the Mooseheads \u2014 with Drouin scoring the deciding goal \u2014 knocked off the Roy-coached Quebec Remparts in the league finals in 2013. MacKinnon went first overall and Drouin third in the 2013 draft.\n\nTFrei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nAdam Deadmarsh, former Avalanche forward\n\nWhen: Deadmarsh acted as the coach for the Avalanche alumni Friday night at Coors Field.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Because of concussion issues, Deadmarsh\u2019s career ended prematurely. When he played his last game in December 2002, he was only 27. He was in the NHL for nine seasons, including six and part of a seventh with Colorado before he went to Los Angeles as part of the Rob Blake trade in early 2001. After spending a stint with the Avalanche as a video coach, he is back living in Idaho.\n\nBackground: \u201cI\u2019m doing OK,\u201d Deadmarsh said Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an ongoing battle for me. It\u2019s something I have lived with and learned to deal with. There are some days I don\u2019t feel great, but I\u2019ve learned over the years how to kind of manage any kind of symptoms I have and get through the day. I have a very supportive family and friends.\u201d\n\nDeadmarsh\u2019s concussion issues seemed to start after he was hit in a November 2000 fight against Canucks defenseman Ed Jovanovski. They went at it again seven weeks later when Deadmarsh drew an instigator minor and fought as a matter of honor.\n\nDeadmarsh said he didn\u2019t regret fighting Jovanovski.\n\n\u201cListen, anyone can get hit hard, and he\u2019s a big, tough guy,\u201d Deadmarsh said. \u201cI think it\u2019s bound to happen sooner or later. I don\u2019t regret the way I played. That came with the territory.\u201d\n\nDeadmarsh isn\u2019t part of a concussion lawsuit filed by former players against the NHL.\n\nFrei\u2019s take: Sorry, Peyton. When I think of No. 18, I think of Deadmarsh \u2014 a real warrior on the ice. Since Deadmarsh, by the way, wearing that number for the Avalanche has been like being a drummer for Spinal Tap \u2014 it hasn\u2019t gone well, and the stints have been short. Chris Drury and Alex Tanguay switched to that number and were traded, and the track record for others hasn\u2019t been good, either.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: The Forsberg awakens, as do others", "title": "Frei: The Forsberg awakens, as do others", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/27/frei-the-forsberg-awakens-as-do-others/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160226__SP27HKNAVALANCHE_2JL1239xp1.jpg", "height": 487}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160226__SP27HKNAVALANCHE_2JL1239xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T20:42:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:36:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "TFrei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFreiSpotlight on \u2026Adam Deadmarsh, former Avalanche forwardWhen: Deadmarsh acted as the coach for the Avalanche alumni Friday night at Coors Field.\nNot a whole lot of people get to experience this.\u201dThe opening goal of the game also was a flashback to when Valeri Kamensky, Forsberg and Claude Lemieux were linemates.\n\u201cI got a nice pass from Lemieux and I got to dish it to Kamensky, and we got the win, so you couldn\u2019t beat that,\u201d Forsberg said.\nThe real game is (Saturday), and I hadn\u2019t imagined that there was going to be this many people.\nThey went at it again seven weeks later when Deadmarsh drew an instigator minor and fought as a matter of honor."}
