Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Our roundtable today to analyze the third Republican presidential debate\u2014it took place in Boulder, Colorado\u2014is John Nichols of The Nation; Jamil Smith of The New Republic; David Cay Johnston of Al Jazeera and Newsweek, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist; and Imani Gandy of RH Reality Check, is joining us from Washington, D.C.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: During Wednesday\u2019s Republican debate hosted by CNBC, Ben Carson defended his flat tax proposal, saying it wouldn\u2019t shortchange government coffers.\n\nDR. BEN CARSON: Let me just say, if you\u2019re talking about an $18 trillion economy, you\u2019re talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product, you\u2019re talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that\u2019s not by any stretch pie-in-the-sky.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: That was Ben Carson speaking last night at the third Republican presidential debate. So, Jamil Smith, could you respond to what he said about his tax plan and also about his rather confusing healthcare plan?\n\nJAMIL SMITH: Well, as far as his tax plan goes, I feel like, you know, he doesn\u2019t account for the fluctuations of the market, and certainly he\u2019s depending upon the success of the overall populace to make up for any deficiencies that his numbers create in the budget. And when he was called upon it, he simply refused to acknowledge that that\u2019s actually true, that it\u2019s going to\u201440 percent, you know, of the funding for the government is going to have to be made up, if in fact his tax plan was implemented. Now, what you have there is a tax plan that\u2019s based upon, as he has said, the model of tithing in churches. And I just don\u2019t understand how that is necessarily applicable to government.\n\nUnderlying his entire plan, though, is a philosophy of \"I\u2019m going to be the, you know, head of a system that is based upon making sure that people are able to succeed, and whoever succeeds, they deserve it.\" And when you\u2019re Ben Carson and you\u2019re a world-famous neurosurgeon, life has worked out for you. And so, you can have that point of view. It\u2019s not quite so easy when you\u2019re talking about people on the ground, though.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And what about his healthcare plan, this thing of slashing funding for Medicare and everybody having their own individual health savings plan?\n\nJAMIL SMITH: Yes, he\u2019s proposed to slash\u2014he\u2019s proposed not to slash, but to end Medicare, end Medicaid, in favor of creating health savings accounts that are funded by the government to the tune of $2,000 per year. Now, that is, of course, a politically suicidal idea, to say nothing of financially ludicrous. So, I just think that, you know, he\u2019s, first of all, not accounting for growth in population. He\u2019s not accounting for a growth in healthcare costs, certainly, and when he was asked about the growth in healthcare costs last night, in a substantive question from Jim Cramer, he deflected and actually said that government should be less involved with regulating the extraordinarily high spikes in drugs, in specialty drugs. So, everything I heard from him with regards to health plans and in his\u2014with regards to pricing was very discouraging last night.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You\u2019ve written about him. You\u2019ve profiled Ben Carson. Tell us who he is.\n\nJAMIL SMITH: Ben Carson is a man who has been a hero, specifically to black Americans. I remember, certainly in my church growing up, we had copies of Gifted Hands handed out to most of us. And it\u2019s something that everybody read. And, you know, he\u2019s been a man who\u2019s lionized for his Horatio Alger-like narrative. That said, it\u2019s tailor-made for the Republican view of race in this country, is a man who\u2019s perceived to have grown out of poverty and made a success of himself, and all the while espoused Christian values.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And explain the Gifted Hands idea, as a neurosurgeon, his accomplishments.\n\nJAMIL SMITH: Yes, yes. Gifted Hands was the title of his 1990 book, that was\u2014you know, it\u2019s a classic. It\u2019s widely read. It\u2019s his life story. It tells how he came up from the ghettos of Detroit to be the\u2014you know, one of the foremost neurosurgeons in the world. That said, I think what he\u2019s doing is completely damaging his legacy right now. Right now, I mean, especially the younger folks that have not read Gifted Hands and don\u2019t know that man, they know him now as an incompetent presidential candidate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And on his tax plan, David Cay Johnston? You have analyzed many tax plans.\n\nDAVID CAY JOHNSTON: His tax plan won\u2019t work at all. It\u2019s in the same league as Donald Trump\u2019s plan. These are just fantasies for voters. And significantly for Carson, tithing is not a simple 10 percent concept. I actually teach this in the law school and the graduate business school at Syracuse. It is a very complex issue with all sorts of rules. And the poor were beneficiaries of the tithing system in the ancient world, not payers into that system.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: One issue not raised at last night\u2019s debate was abortion, but it has been a major issue for the Republicans and Democrats. On Sunday, in an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Dr. Carson said abortion should be illegal in all cases, including rape and incest. He responded to a question from Chuck Todd.\n\nCHUCK TODD: What if somebody has an unwanted pregnancy? Should they have the right to terminate?\n\nDR. BEN CARSON: No. Think about this. During slavery\u2014and I know that\u2019s one of those words you\u2019re not supposed to say, but I\u2019m saying it. During slavery, a lot of the slaveowners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave\u2014anything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionists had said, \"You know, I don\u2019t believe in slavery. I think it\u2019s wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do\"? Where would we be?\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So that is Ben Carson on Sunday. Imani Gandy, RH Reality Check, can you respond?\n\nIMANI GANDY: I think it\u2019s\u2014setting aside the fact that it is, I think, fundamentally creepy and weird to compare human sentient people\u2014slaves, black Americans\u2014to fetuses, setting that aside, I think when he talks about abolitionists saying, \"Well, I\u2019m against slavery, but you can do whatever you want,\" that\u2019s sort of the position that he held, himself, in the '90s, when he was a practicing neurosurgeon. He would routinely refer women to abortion providers, should they need one, whether it be because the pregnancy was unwanted, or specifically he spoke about referring women whose fetuses had genetic anomalies to abortions. And I've reported on a lot of abortion providers, a lot of anti-choice abortion providers, and it\u2019s hard to reconcile his current staunch, quote-unquote, \"pro-life\" stance with his prior comments and behavior with respect to acknowledging that women deserve to have a choice and should make that choice with their doctors, and actually advocating for abortion, not by performing them himself necessarily, but by referring women to other providers. So I think there\u2019s a fundamental hypocrisy there and a disconnect between his current position and his prior positions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Let\u2019s go back to 1992, Ben Carson, then a renowned neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, appearing in an ad urging Marylanders to vote against Question 6, a ballot initiative to preserve the right to choose in the state should Roe v. Wade get struck down. Here\u2019s a clip from that ad.\n\nDR. BEN CARSON: Life is hectic, and it\u2019s sometimes easy to let important decisions be made for us. Ballot Question 6 could be like that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: After the commercial ran, Dr. Carson found himself in the center of a political firestorm and reversed course. He asked the pro-life Vote kNOw Coalition, which sponsored the ad, to pull the commercial, and he then held a news conference organized by Maryland for Choice.\n\nDR. BEN CARSON: My message is not to vote for or against Question 6, but to educate yourself. I did not understand that the tagline \"Vote against Question 6\" would be included in the ad. I don\u2019t believe it is appropriate for a public figure of my nature to try to tell people how they should vote. ... Subsequent to doing that ad, I have had an opportunity to do quite a bit of background research, and it became quite apparent that there were things that could easily be misconstrued.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ellen Curro of the Vote kNOw Coalition said Dr. Carson appeared to have bowed to political pressure.\n\nELLEN CURRO: He may have said that today, but when he agreed to do the spot, he had signed off with approval to encourage people to vote against Question 6. And I think he\u2019s just gotten tremendous pressure from the other side because of the political nature of this argument.\n\nSTACIE SPECTOR: I see it as a victory for Dr. Carson to be able to thoughtfully and legitimately explain how he feels about the issue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The second speaker was Stacie Spector of Maryland for Choice. Imani Gandy, that controversy was 23 years ago. What does that tell you about today\u2019s Dr. Ben Carson?\n\nIMANI GANDY: I think it tells you that he doesn\u2019t really have a solid position on abortion. I think that he has been driven to say more extreme things about abortion, to devolve into extremist rhetoric about abortion, because he\u2019s a Republican presidential nominee. I also think that given that\u2014there\u2019s a lot of question in the anti-choice community about Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to life, quote-unquote, \"life,\" and I think that sort of opens up a hole or a\u2014there\u2019s an opening there for Ben Carson to tack to the right of Donald Trump on abortion and to appear to be far more extreme than I actually believe that he is. I mean, even as recently as August, his communications director, Douglas Watts, as reported in Politico, said that Ben Carson believes that you shouldn\u2019t\u2014you shouldn\u2019t legislate morality. He believes that abortion is going to have to be won in the hearts and minds of Americans, and he believes that women should be able to make a choice based on the medical evidence, and he believes that patients should have medical evidence. That doesn\u2019t jibe with this current \"I think Roe v. Wade should be overturned; I believe in banning abortion in all instances, including incest and rape.\" So I think it\u2019s just there\u2019s going to\u2014he\u2019s going to have a problem, I believe, with the anti-choice community, should it come down to him and Trump or him and Rubio, for example, who has been very staunchly anti-choice, including in instances of rape and incest. So I think it shows that he hasn\u2019t quite solidified his position, and he\u2019s going to be attacked, I think, based on that.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Jamil Smith, I want to ask you about other recent statements that Ben Carson has made. He said the Affordable Care Act, for example, is the worst thing since slavery, which is a rather odd claim for a doctor to make. And after the mass shooting in an Oregon community college recently, he said the Holocaust would have been less\u2014wouldn\u2019t have been as likely if Jewish people had had firearms to fight back. So what do you think\u2014I mean, given these statements, which seem at least bizarre a little bit, what accounts for his rising popularity?\n\nJAMIL SMITH: Well, as I wrote, I feel like Ben Carson is saying all the right things\u2014for the right. I think, you know, to Imani\u2019s point, I feel like whatever he\u2019s\u2014whatever is coming out of his mouth is really tailored for the Republican electorate that, you know, we\u2019re encountering in 2015. So, I think this is more\u2014speaks more to who is voting for Republicans rather than the Republicans themselves. I feel like what Carson is saying is\u2014you know, it\u2019s kind of extremist stuff that gets headlines. I mean, there should be a Carson\u2019s law similar to Godwin\u2019s law, \"Don\u2019t invoke Hitler\": Don\u2019t invoke slavery, either, unless you\u2019re actually talking about slavery. I feel like when you also talk about his position on guns and his reference to the Holocaust, that\u2019s actually historically inaccurate. So, these are the kind of things that he eventually will be caught on and will, I think, matter should he magically, mystically become the nominee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Democracy Now!", "description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has surpassed Donald Trump in most polls to become the new Republican front-runner.
