The Schapiro Group poll, commissioned by the Healthcare Georgia Foundation and released today, shows that almost half of Georgia residents believe their health care costs will increase under the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare), while the quality of their care will decrease.

One of the questions in the telephone survey asked: "Under the healthcare reform law, do you think you and your family will pay more for healthcare overall, pay less, or it won't make much difference?" The results are as follows:

47% - pay more

33% - no difference

11% - pay less

9% - don't know/refuse to answer

According to the survey, Georgians also don't expect for the quality of care to improve as a result of ACA implementation.

"Under the healthcare reform law, do you think you and your family will receive higher quality healthcare, lower quality, or it wonâ€™t make much difference?" Results:

54% - no difference

32% - lower quality

7% - higher quality

7% - don't know/refuse to answer

Perhaps surprisingly, Georgians appear to be happy with the cost and care they receive under the current, pre-Obamacare, health care laws.

When asked if they are satisfied with what they currently pay, the results show:

63% - at least somewhat satisfied

33% - dissatisfied

28% - very satisfied

15% - very dissatisfied

In addition, 75 percent of Georgians are satisfied with the "overall value of healthcare that they receive in relation to the amount that they pay for it," including 40 percent who are very satisfied.

The survey was conducted in October and November 2013. The Schapiro Group talked to 400 adults, including 100 cell-phone only households. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent.
