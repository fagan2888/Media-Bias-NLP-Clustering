When asked about his attacks against her refugee policy, the chancellor said: \"I don't see any reason why I should reply to him.\"\n\nAt the same time, Merkel said of Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton: \"I value her long political experience, her commitment for women's rights, family issues and health care.\n\n\"I value her strategic thinking and that she is a strong supporter of the transatlantic partnership. Whenever I had the chance to work together with Hillary Clinton, it was a great pleasure.\"\n\nGermany does not face a federal election until next year. But a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkel's conservatives. The AfD wants Germany to shut its border to migrants and use force to repel them if necessary.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Ralph Boulton)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has branded leading U.S.", "title": "German minister calls Trump a threat, Merkel lauds Clinton", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/06/German-vice-chancellor-says-Trump-poses-threat-peace-and-prosperity", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/06/German-vice-chancellor-says-Trump-poses-threat-peace-and-prosperity", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has branded leading U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"We have to make the effort to explain how we want to shape globalization in a fair way,\" Gabriel said.\nBERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has branded leading U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump a threat to peace and prosperity while Chancellor Angela Merkel said it had always been a pleasure to work with Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nBut a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkel's conservatives.\nWhenever I had the chance to work together with Hillary Clinton, it was a great pleasure.\"\nMerkel told Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview she did not know Trump personally."}
