It is enough for Reich to merely lob ad hominem attacks when the targets are Texas conservatives.\n\nWhat really gets Reich\u2019s goat is that historically independent Texas distrusts the Federal government. Reich cites recent polls that showed 57 percent of Texans view the Feds unfavorably and then launches into a dishonest attack on the recent request for federal disaster relief after floods devastated parts of the state. Reich writes:\n\nTexas dislikes the federal government so much that eight of its congressional representatives, along with Senator Ted Cruz, opposed disaster relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy \u2013 adding to the awkwardness of their lobbying for the federal relief now heading Texas\u2019s way.\n\nReich wants to paint Republicans \u2014 Texans specifically \u2014 as cruel, heartless hypocrites and turns a blind eye to the wasteful, irrelevant spending that Democrats (and a few Republicans) snuck into the Hurricane Sandy bill.\n\nThe real reason that over thirty GOP Senators, including Cruz, actually opposed the Hurricane Sandy bill was not cruelty or opposition to fair Federal help. The opposition was based on the fact that the huge relief bill was packed with more pork than you would find in a warehouse full of jalape\u00f1o cheddar sausage.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported after the Hurricane Sandy bill passed:\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Senate passed a $60.4 billion bill that contains expenditures for areas that were unaffected by the storm, including $2 million roof repairs for Smithsonian Institution museums, $150 million for Alaskan fisheries disasters, and $58 million in taxpayer dollars to plant trees on private property in areas where Sandy never touched down. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) attempted to remove the $150 million fisheries \u201cpork\u201d spending from the bill, but his amendment was defeated.\n\nFinally, Reich turns to climate change and launches into Rep. Lamar Smith for calling United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as \u201cmore political than scientific.\u201d\n\nEven though Reich admits he can not prove any connection between this latest round of Texas weather and the Democrat\u2019s current trope on climate change, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to mention it anyway.\n\nGiven this, you might also think Texas would take climate change especially seriously. But here again, there\u2019s cognitive dissonance between what the state needs and how its officials act.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that Reich would talk about topics like hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, since this is the same Robert Reich who recently wrote the following about his former boss Bill Clinton\u2019s wife Hillary Clinton, without any apparent irony:\n\nHillary Clinton should make the moral case about power: for taking it out of the hands of those with great wealth and putting it back into the hands of average working people.\n\nThe Clinton\u2019s combined net worth is estimated to be over $100,000,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Clinton Cabinet Secretary Uses Floods to Attack Texas and Ted Cruz", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Former Clinton Cabinet Secretary Uses Floods to Attack Texas and Ted Cruz", "title": "Former Clinton Cabinet Secretary Uses Floods to Attack Texas and Ted Cruz", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4800, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/ap_ap-photo2037.jpg", "height": 2999}, "updated_time": "2015-06-02T08:18:11-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/06/02/former-clinton-cabinet-secretary-uses-floods-to-attack-texas-and-ted-cruz/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Clinton Cabinet Secretary Uses Floods to Attack Texas and Ted Cruz", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/ap_ap-photo2037.jpg", "title": "Former Clinton Cabinet Secretary Uses Floods to Attack Texas and Ted Cruz", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-06-02T08:17:49-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas,2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-06-02T08:18:11-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The real reason that over thirty GOP Senators, including Cruz, actually opposed the Hurricane Sandy bill was not cruelty or opposition to fair Federal help.\nThe opposition was based on the fact that the huge relief bill was packed with more pork than you would find in a warehouse full of jalape\u00f1o cheddar sausage.\nIt is enough for Reich to merely lob ad hominem attacks when the targets are Texas conservatives.\nWhat really gets Reich\u2019s goat is that historically independent Texas distrusts the Federal government.\n\u201cIt is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed upon,\u201d he said."}
