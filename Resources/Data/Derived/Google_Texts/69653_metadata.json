And it\u2019s not too much of a stretch to assume that those carriers paying out the highest MLR rebates may also be those who best reward producers.According to a report from SNL Insurance, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida paid the largest refund to policyholders, with $10.1 million in refunds in its home state. The insurer reported a medical loss ratio of 78.6% on small-group business in 2013, down from 79.3% in 2012.Other carriers stung by the MLR provision last year include:1. Health Options Inc. (Florida): $9.1 million2. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina (South Carolina): $6.5 million3. Aetna Health Inc. (DC): $6.4 million4. Anthem Insurance Cos. Inc. (Indiana): $6.2 million5. Neighborhood Health Plan Inc. (Massachusetts): $6.1 million6. UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co. (Oklahoma): $5.5 million7. Time Insurance Co. (Texas): $4.5 million8. Anthem Health Plans of Kentucky (Kentucky): $4.4 million9. United HealthCare Insurance Co. (North Carolina): $4.4 millionSNL Insurance, which analyzed publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, also found geographic anomalies.On average, health insurance consumers in Florida and Maryland received the highest levels of refunds statewide, while Vermont brought up the rear.However, when considering the largest ratio of refunds to health premiums earned, Montana took the top slot.California was not considered \u201cbecause most companies in the state do not file with the NAIC,\u201d SNL added, stating that the data is not comparable.In total, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates that carriers will send out $330 million in rebates to policyholders this summer. Those carriers have already returned about $9 billion to consumers since the ACA was passed in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/these-10-carriers-paid-the-most-in-mlr-rebates-19129.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "The divisive medical loss ratio requirements in the ACA saw these nine major carriers paying the largest consumer rebates.", "title": "These 10 carriers paid the most in MLR rebates"}, "twitter": {"description": "The divisive medical loss ratio requirements in the ACA saw these nine major carriers paying the largest consumer rebates.", "title": "These 10 carriers paid the most in MLR rebates", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/these-10-carriers-paid-the-most-in-mlr-rebates-19129.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The divisive medical loss ratio requirements in the ACA saw these nine major carriers paying the largest consumer rebates.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef0a\"", "article_summary": "The insurer reported a medical loss ratio of 78.6% on small-group business in 2013, down from 79.3% in 2012.Other carriers stung by the MLR provision last year include:1.\nThose carriers have already returned about $9 billion to consumers since the ACA was passed in 2010.\nAnd it\u2019s not too much of a stretch to assume that those carriers paying out the highest MLR rebates may also be those who best reward producers.According to a report from SNL Insurance, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida paid the largest refund to policyholders, with $10.1 million in refunds in its home state.\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina (South Carolina): $6.5 million3.\nHealth Options Inc.
