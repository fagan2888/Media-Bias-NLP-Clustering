Update at 5:25 p.m.: State Fair of Texas spokesperson Karissa Condoianis says the Midway worker has been treated and released from Baylor. It’s still not clear how long the ride will be closed.

Update at 2:20 p.m.: State Fair of Texas spokesperson Karissa Condoianis says “everyone is down safely” from the Crazy Mouse. But there is still no word about the Midway worker’s condition.

Original post at 2 p.m.: A Midway worker at the State Fair of Texas was injured at about 1:30 Monday afternoon after being struck by a wheel that came off one of the rides.

That ride was the Crazy Mouse, a small roller coaster with spinning cars that carry four riders each. Karissa Condoianis, spokesperson for the State Fair, says two cars are still on the ride, and that Fair workers are taking the passengers water. They appear to be fine.

“We are trying to get people down as soon as possible,” she says, “and keeping them hydrated and taken care of.”

The Midway worker has been taken to the hospital, says Condoianis. The worker’s condition is unknown. Emergency workers, as well as police, are on the scene.

Updates to come. Meanwhile, of course, the ride is closed for the forseeable future.
