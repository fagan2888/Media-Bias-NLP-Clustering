To understand the impact of contact on those groups and their chances of survival, Hamilton and his colleagues sifted through census data from the past 50 years and population estimates going as far back as a century.\n\nAfter contact, \u201cyou always see crash events in these populations,\u201d said Hamilton, lead author of a paper about the study that was published April 1 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\n\u201cEither you see the crash events in census data, or you see that they are recovering from very small populations.\u201d\n\nBut that raised a question, he said: \u201cAfter they go through these crash events, are they doomed to extinction, are they struggling along at very low numbers, or do you see population growth?\u201d\n\nBrazil has 238 contacted Indigenous Peoples, but dozens of isolated groups still live in the Amazon basin, shunning contact with outsiders. The largest concentration is along the border between Brazil and Peru.\n\nThe census data showed that the result of contact was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d loss, with populations plummeting by more than 80 percent in some cases, reaching the lowest point an average of eight and a half years after contact.\n\nOften, however, that was followed by a turnaround.\n\n\u201cWe were very surprised to see that after 10 years or so after contact, they seem to be growing relatively rapidly, in terms of human population growth rates,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nThat does not change the harsh reality of European contact with Amazonian peoples. About three-fourths of those societies vanished altogether, and the others suffered what the researchers call \u201ccatastrophic\u201d losses.\n\nOnce populations began to recover, however, they grew quickly, Hamilton said. Many have increased by more than 4 percent per year, well above Brazil\u2019s average population growth rate. Although the researchers cannot be sure whether that is entirely from births or whether decimated groups join others, if they live in a territory large enough to provide for their needs and those of future generations, they could survive the catastrophic collapse, Hamilton said.\n\nSurvival is not guaranteed, however, especially if the group was small to begin with.\n\n\u201cContact can very easily wipe out a small group,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the history of the contact process, that happens very predictably. If the population is reduced to below about 100 individuals, it seems to be very unlikely that the population will survive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study from Brazil shows that some of the uncontacted indigenous groups managed to recover within a decade after contact.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/13/after-contact-isolated-groups-recover-high-cost-154417", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/default/files/uploads/the_expansion_of_the_camisea_gas_projects_would_threaten_the_lives_of_uncontacted_tribes_in_the_nahua-nanti_reserve_-_survival_international.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "After Contact, Isolated Groups Recover\u2014But at High Cost"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-04-13T09:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "After Contact, Isolated Groups Recover\u2014But at High Cost"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/13/after-contact-isolated-groups-recover-high-cost-154417", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Uncontacted Tribes, Indigenous Peoples, Amazon Forest, Brazil, Logging, Gold Mining, Recovery After Contact", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "After Contact, Isolated Groups Recover\u2014But at High Cost"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe104b\"", "article_summary": "Brazil is one of the few countries with enough census data to piece together a picture of the impact of indigenous societies\u2019 contact with outsiders.\nFor half a millennium, contact with outsiders has meant death for indigenous groups living in isolation in the Amazon forest, but a new study from Brazil shows that some of those groups managed to recover within a decade after contact.\nIf the population is reduced to below about 100 individuals, it seems to be very unlikely that the population will survive.\u201d\nThe census data showed that the result of contact was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d loss, with populations plummeting by more than 80 percent in some cases, reaching the lowest point an average of eight and a half years after contact.\nThat does not change the harsh reality of European contact with Amazonian peoples."}
