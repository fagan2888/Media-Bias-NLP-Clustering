Frontotemporal dementia is a disease that changes frontal lobe function, affecting regions associated with moral behavior \u2014 these changes also emerge with Alzheimer\u2019s, but later on in the disease\u2019s progression. ALS, meanwhile, is commonly associated with the loss of motor control.\n\nThe participants were asked about the severity of symptoms for their partner\u2019s conditions (ranging from none to severe), as well as how much the conditions affected their relationships since symptoms of the disease began to appear. They found that Alzheimer\u2019s disease and frontotemporal dementia altered a person\u2019s identity more than ALS, with the latter causing the greatest disruptions. According to the study, no other symptoms, such as depression, amnesia, or changes in personality had as much of an impact on identity change as moral traits did.\n\n\u201cContrary to what you might think, and what generations of philosophers and psychologists have assumed, memory loss itself doesn\u2019t make someone seem like a different person,\u201d said Nina Strohminger, lead researcher and postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Management, in a statement. \u201cNor do most other factors, such as personality change, loss of higher-level cognition, depression, or the ability to function in daily activities.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the level to which participants felt their relationships with the patients had deteriorated affected how they perceived the patients\u2019 identities \u2014 this also correlated with the severity of change in moral traits. This was important, Strohminger said, because \u201ccontinuing to see a loved one as the same person they\u2019ve always been is crucial to the health of the social bond.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 36 million people around the world live with some form of neurodegenerative disease. according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. The findings of this study can provide insight into a way to target treatments for moral dysfunction, rather than, say, motor skills, for people with neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\u201cMost of us know someone with neurodegenerative disease or some form of cognitive decline,\u201d Strohminger said. \u201cWhether a loved one\u2019s self disappears or persists through the progression of this condition depends very much on which parts of the mind are affected.\u201d\n\nSource: Strohminger N, Nichols S.
