The company bought land in Estero about a decade ago. It was originally intended to be an 80-bed facility. But, the state denied its plans. Now, the plans have changed.\n\n\n\nThe campus will be called Lee Memorial Health System at Coconut Point. It will have primary and specialty care physicians, an emergency room and a healthy life center \u2013 among other things.\n\nBut, no beds for admitted patients.\n\nDirector of Special Projects Suzanne Bradach said the state denied Lee Memorial\u2019s original plan because it said they needed to use their current campuses to their fullest extent.\n\nBradach said with the emergency room, most people can be treated and released. Lee Memorial is also talking with EMS.\n\n\u201cSo that they know when they do their assessment in the field if the patient needs to go directly to a hospital or can come directly to the free-standing emergency department,\u201d she said.\n\nBradach said they also want to use technology to improve their processes like allowing patients to access their records from home.\n\nShe said although the center will have no beds, they\u2019re designing it in such a way that it would still be an option to add them.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Note: Audio to come.
