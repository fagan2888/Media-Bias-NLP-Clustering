It was sponsored by the Department of Economics as part of its programming during MIT\u2019s Independent Activities Period, which runs between semesters.\n\nGruber, a longtime specialist in health-care research, worked with then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney on the development of the state\u2019s novel health-care program, and then consulted for the Obama administration about the similar federal plan; few other people have worked so closely with leaders in both major political parties on the issue.\n\n\u201cI am totally biased, I am about the least objective observer of this law you could find in the world,\u201d Gruber quipped about his advocacy of the Massachusetts program. \u201cNonetheless, if you look at the facts, I think it\u2019s been, by the objective facts, a success.\u201d He noted that about two-thirds of formerly uninsured residents are now covered, while premiums for individual insurance have dropped by about 50 percent. About two-thirds of Massachusetts residents support the system, according to polls.\n\nStill on the table: Medicaid adoption \u2014 or rejection\n\nGruber also emphasized that states\u2019 adoption of Medicaid expansion is an important facet of the plan to monitor. The Affordable Care Act offers full federal funding of Medicaid (an expense that is normally split 50-50 between the federal government and the states) for three years, an amount that declines to about 90 percent thereafter. Yet governors in 26 states have declined to accept the funding, a stance made possible by a 2012 Supreme Court ruling \u2014 and one Gruber labeled as \u201cpolitical malpractice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no citizen in a state like Florida that is worse off if they expand Medicaid,\u201d Gruber suggested. \u201cNone. All of the [uninsured] get health insurance. Everyone else gets enormous federal stimulus injected into their economy.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s another thing to keep an eye on: How long are states going to hold out?\u201d\n\nGruber also discussed what he sees as a vital part of health care in general: controlling future costs. The Affordable Care Act attempts to do this through a variety of measures, some of which attempt to evaluate the efficacy of care.\n\n\u201cCost control is a ton harder than [expanding] coverage,\u201d Gruber observed. Overall health-care spending has increased from around 4 percent of the nation\u2019s GDP in 1950 to about 17 percent today. Gruber said the improved quality of health care in that time has probably made that increased spending a sound investment, but suggested that a similarly large increase over the next half-century would probably not be subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.\n\nStill, Gruber argued, the value of the legislation can be seen in moral and practical terms, by limiting the catastrophic financial problems uninsured Americans have faced when dealing with serious illness: \u201cWe joined the league of industrialized nations who guarantee our citizens cannot be bankrupted by medical costs,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MIT expert weighs in on health plan\u2019s status as legislation becomes reality.", "og": {"site_name": "MIT News", "description": "MIT expert weighs in on health plan\u2019s status as legislation becomes reality.", "author": "Peter Dizikes, MIT News Office", "url": "http://news.mit.edu/2014/gruber-outlines-key-upcoming-moments-in-affordable-care-act-rollout-0110", "image": "http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/og/public/images/2014/20140110123424-0_1.jpg", "title": "Gruber outlines key upcoming moments in Affordable Care Act rollout", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@mit", "id": 15460048}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"page_id": 126533127390327}, "keywords": "Health care, Economics, Medicine, Medicaid/Medicare, Faculty, Special events and guest speakers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Health care, Economics, Medicine, Medicaid/Medicare, Faculty, Special events and guest speakers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8046\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act attempts to do this through a variety of measures, some of which attempt to evaluate the efficacy of care.\nThe closely watched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which provides health insurance for all U.S. citizens, will face at least three key mileposts in 2014, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber said in a public talk on campus Thursday afternoon.\nBipartisan advocateThe Affordable Care Act mandates all uninsured Americans to acquire health insurance in the private markets, while providing subsidies and tax credits; it also expands Medicaid, the program to help poor citizens afford health care.\nAll of the [uninsured] get health insurance.\n\u201cIf insurers come and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to raise rates 5, 7, 8 percent, then that\u2019s a huge victory,\u201d Gruber asserted."}
