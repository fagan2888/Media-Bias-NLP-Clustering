Saddling universities with enforcement restrictions aimed at \u201cpatent trolls\u201d could put a damper on that.\n\nFor university licensees and start-ups, patents are often the only collateral they can use to secure venture capital funding. If those patents were riskier to defend in court, many start-ups would never get off the ground.\n\n\u201cIf companies think universities or their licensees aren\u2019t willing to enforce their patents by filing infringement lawsuits when those lawsuits are necessary, they\u2019re much more likely to infringe on those patents,\u201d Sebeok said. \u201cAnd investors are much less likely to invest in patented university discoveries and bring them to the public if they perceive them as weak patents that other companies can ignore.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Patent law changes could stack the deck for big business\n\nBusiness coalition United for Patent Reform \u2013 whose membership includes influential allies of the Obama Administration like Google, Amazon and General Motors \u2013 and other supporters of HR 9 seek to stop patent trolling by making it riskier to file patent infringement suits and imposing additional costs of plaintiffs, but AAU argues this would put undue pressure on legitimate patent holders.\n\n\u201cNon-practicing entities have been given a bad name,\u201d she added, \u201cbut there are very good reasons for universities to be not practicing their patents. You don\u2019t want universities to be in the business of creating products and services; what they\u2019re good at is doing the research.\u201d\n\nHR 9 and the Senate\u2019s PATENT Act could, by starting from the assumption any non-practicing entity is likely a \u201ctroll,\u201d limit the development of inventions from legitimate patent holders.\n\nAt the same time, several of United for Patent Reform\u2019s stated priorities \u2014 such as limiting costly court discovery processes and making it easier for judges to make losing plaintiffs pay defendants\u2019 attorney fees \u2014 are already happening without sweeping new legislation.\n\nStreamlining patent infringement cases and improving the consistency of issued patents were two of the key goals of the America Invents Act of 2011. AAU and other skeptics of comprehensive reform argue that AIA should be given time to work.\n\nUniversities, Sebeok said, think it\u2019s \u201cearly to make yet more changes to the patent system,\u201d with courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office still adjusting to changes imposed by AIA. But it\u2019s not all bad news from the university group\u2019s perspective.\n\nSebeok said the Senate has taken \u201ca more measured approach\u201d with the PATENT Act than the House has with HR 9, indicating that concerns about weakening patent protections have been heard by some members of Congress.\n\nAAU believes Congress rushed through the 2011 law, but is now \u2014 especially in the Senate \u2014 doing a better job of considering how patent holders in different industries are affected by federal policy.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Clarified in final two paragraphs that AAU is more optimistic about the Senate bill than the House bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proposed patent law changes could result in fewer partnerships between universities and tech startups, experts in academia warn.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Proposed patent law changes could result in fewer partnerships between universities and tech startups, experts in academia warn.", "title": "Proposed patent law changes prompt concern at universities - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/shutterstock_101844928.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-14T09:51:02+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/261290/proposed-patent-law-changes-prompt-concern-universities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Proposed patent law changes could result in fewer partnerships between universities and tech startups, experts in academia warn.", "title": "Proposed patent law changes prompt concern at universities - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/shutterstock_101844928.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "published_time": "2016-04-06T04:00:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T09:51:02+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "patent reform, intellectual property, ip, ip law, ip reform, patent law changes, patent law reform, association of american universities,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf295\"", "article_summary": "Proposed patent law changes could result in fewer partnerships between universities and tech startups, experts in academia warn.\nUniversities, Sebeok said, think it\u2019s \u201cearly to make yet more changes to the patent system,\u201d with courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office still adjusting to changes imposed by AIA.\nFor university licensees and start-ups, patents are often the only collateral they can use to secure venture capital funding.\nThe measure would treat all non-practicing entities \u2014 a term for patent holders who aren\u2019t actively using their patented technologies \u2014 as \u201cpatent trolls\u201d out to game the system.\nSebeok said the Senate has taken \u201ca more measured approach\u201d with the PATENT Act than the House has with HR 9, indicating that concerns about weakening patent protections have been heard by some members of Congress."}
