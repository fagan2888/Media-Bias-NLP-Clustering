A gigawatt is equal to 1 million kilowatts, a more familiar metric for residential electricity users.\n\nThe study found about 65 gigawatts of potential hydropower nationwide, with about 12 gigawatts coming from adding turbines to existing dams that were created for something else, such as flood control or a drinking water reservoir. Much of the remainder came from small-scale facilities that depend on the flow of a river instead of storing a large amount of water, according to a news release from the Department of Energy.\n\nHydropower accounts for about 7 percent of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That was about twice as much as wind energy provided that year, but significantly less than coal, natural gas and nuclear energy, which accounted for 37 percent, 30 percent and 19 percent of generation, respectively.\n\nDavid Barfield, chief engineer with the Kansas Department of Agriculture\u2019s Division of Water Resources, said the report doesn\u2019t go into detail about the technology that might allow new hydropower development in Kansas, but adding turbines to existing dams might be the best bet.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s realistic and something that\u2019s being examined,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kansas River doesn\u2019t have much potential for additional hydropower, Barfield said. The Missouri River is more promising. The report also showed high potential for hydropower growth in the Arkansas River, but that doesn\u2019t seem likely because the area is flat and the river often doesn\u2019t flow above ground, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to downplay the value of looking at hydropower, but I\u2019m puzzling over the numbers,\u201d he said.\n\nBuilding new dams can be difficult from a permitting standpoint, Barfield said. They raise river levels in the immediate area, meaning the dam owner needs easements from all affected property owners. Along the Missouri River, owners also would need permits in two states, he said.\n\nDams also need water use rights, but those wouldn\u2019t be as difficult to get for hydropower as for some other uses, because most of the water simply flows through the turbine, Barfield said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really affect downstream users,\u201d he said.\n\nGina Penzig, spokeswoman for Westar Energy, said the utility has sought bids for renewable energy projects five times in the past decade, but no one has come forward with an idea to develop hydropower in the area.\n\n\u201cThe cost is not competitive with other forms of renewable energy,\u201d she said.\n\nKatie Ingels, spokeswoman for the Kansas Water Office, said none of Kansas\u2019 reservoirs were built with hydropower as their primary purpose. The state\u2019s rivers don\u2019t have the flow or elevation changes in most places to support large-scale hydropower, she said, but small \u201clow-flow\u201d projects could use minimum releases from reservoirs to supply a few homes or businesses.\n\n\u201cSince the reservoirs in Kansas were built to serve other purposes, namely flood control, water supply and recreation, low-flow projects could use existing operations of the projects without significant change that would jeopardize existing primary purposes,\u201d she said.\n\nSarah Hill Nelson, owner and operator of Bowersock Dam on the Kansas River in Lawrence, said she thought adding hydropower to existing dams would be the best strategy because it doesn\u2019t involve flooding much additional land and requires fewer permits.\n\n\u201cBuilding hydropower on an existing dam is much more attainable,\u201d she said.\n\nBowersock boosted its capacity from 2.35 megawatts to 4.65 megawatts by adding a new powerhouse and turbine to an existing spillway, Hill Nelson said. It took more than two years to bring the project to fruition, but that was unusually quick, because projects often take six to seven years, she said.\n\nThe Kansas City Board of Public Utilities purchases all of the power, she said.\n\nHill Nelson said she was surprised at the amount of energy the report found could be generated by hydropower in Kansas, but she doesn\u2019t think the state will run on hydropower alone any time soon.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of that report was to say what\u2019s possible, not what\u2019s politically or fiscally attainable,\u201d she said.\n\nKansas also isn\u2019t likely to build new dams because of the difficulty of keeping existing ones from filling with silt, Hill Nelson said. Adding hydropower to those that are already here might be helpful in that regard because some of the money from selling the electricity could go toward paying for dredging, she said.\n\nHydropower has some variation depending on the flow in a river, but it can be predicted two or three days out based on flows and precipitation upstream, Hill Nelson said. It doesn\u2019t vary much within a single day, making it more stable than wind and solar power, she said.\n\nIt also has fewer environmental impacts on the Plains than in areas where fish like salmon swim upriver to spawn, Hill Nelson said. In some parts of the Northeast and Northwest, communities have moved away from hydropower because of concern about fish, she said.\n\n\u201cOf all the places you could develop hydropower, I think the Midwest has the lowest impact,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, News, State, Megan Hart, Local business", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A report from the U.S. Department of Energy showed Kansas has enough untapped hydropower to power the entire state, but that isn't likely to happen due to physical and legal challenges.", "title": "Report shows high hydropower potential, some Kansans skeptical", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/business/2014-05-17/report-shows-high-hydropower-potential-some-kansans-skeptical", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "A report from the U.S. Department of Energy showed Kansas has enough untapped hydropower to power the entire state, but that isn\u2019t likely to happen due to physical and legal challenges.A study from Oak Ridge National Laboratory showed Kansas has about 2.4 gigawatts of potential hydropower that isn\u2019t being used.
