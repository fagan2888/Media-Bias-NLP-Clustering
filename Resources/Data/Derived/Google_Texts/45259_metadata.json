Especially child rape.\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Film was about child rape (Spotlight), the Best Actress winner starred in a movie about abduction and rape (Room), and Vice President Joe Biden showed up and spoke about campus rape (as if it's more prevalent than off-campus rape, which it's not). Then rape survivors were featured on stage, and Lady Gaga sang about rape for a documentary about rape. And when ABC cut to commercials, often it was to advertise its own new show, The Family, which is about a child kidnapped and held captive for 10 years. Maybe there was no rape involved. Maybe it was just a wholesome stranger abduction.\n\nThe thing is, since no one is for rape, you have to wonder why the entertainment industry is so invested in showing us how against rape it is.\n\nNancy McDermott, author of the forthcoming book, The Problem with Parenting, turned a lightbulb on for me with this thought:\n\nWith the #OscarsSoWhite issue hanging over them, \u201cthe only way the Academy could get back any moral authority was to fixate on child abuse.\u201d\n\nHer analysis reminded me of a wonderful essay by Fred Clark that talked, in part, about the flood of letters to the editor a newspaper received following an article on a kitten burning:\n\nThose letters and comments were uniformly and universally opposed to kitten-burning. Opinion on that question was unanimous and vehement. But here was the weird part: Most of the commenters and letter-writers didn\u2019t seem to notice that they were expressing a unanimous and noncontroversial sentiment....[T]hey seemed to think they were exhibiting courage by taking a bold position on a matter of great controversy.\n\nWhen our whole society is at odds about everything else\u2014immigrants, the economy, education\u2014perhaps the one thing we can all agree on (even while congratulating ourselves for being so evolved) is that we hate rape, especially the rape of children. This shared revulsion could be the glue still holding us together.\n\nThe problem with this particular glue is that we have poured it all over everything, to the point where it sticks to almost every aspect of our lives. It's not just all over the Oscars, and TV, and the news. It's part of our everyday lives. When we consider giving our kids even an ounce of unsupervised time, we can't get the door open because it, too, is glued shut with fear. As I wrote in The Post:\n\nWhen the entire entertainment world starts to look like \u201cLaw & Order SVU,\u201d all of us \u2014 but especially parents \u2014 become terrified. And that has a direct impact on how we raise our kids. As you might have noticed, most kids don\u2019t walk to school anymore. Safe Routes to Schools puts the figure at 13 percent. And most kids don\u2019t play in the park after school either, unless they\u2019re doing organized, supervised sports. The Child and Nature Network says only 6 percent of kids age 9 to 13 are playing outside on their own each week. Of course, technology plays its part in keeping kids inside, but another part of the reason is parental fear. Recent studies of parents\u2019 top five fears found kidnapping was No. 1 and \u201cStranger Danger\u201d No. 4.\n\nObviously we all want our kids to be safe. Obviously, this is not a pro-rape blog post. It is a post that insists we look at the damage done by fixating on child abduction and rape. Why do people call 911 the second they spot a child outside? Because in everything they watch, see, and hear, an unsupervised child is about to be kidnapped.\n\nWhen we overestimate danger, we are compelled to overprotect kids. The results are empty parks, empty streets, empty playgrounds, and lots more time spent staring at screens.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "This year's awards went all-out promoting unnecessary fear.", "title": "The Oscars Wanted Parents to Worry About Child Abduction and Rape", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/03/01/the-oscars-wants-parents-to-worry-about", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14568526951468.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14568526951468.jpg", "description": "This year's awards went all-out promoting unnecessary fear.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Oscars Wanted Parents to Worry About Child Abduction and Rape"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Free-Range Kids", "published_time": "2016-03-01T17:40:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/lenore-skenazy"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Especially child rape.\nBecause in everything they watch, see, and hear, an unsupervised child is about to be kidnapped.\nThe Academy Award for Best Film was about child rape (Spotlight), the Best Actress winner starred in a movie about abduction and rape (Room), and Vice President Joe Biden showed up and spoke about campus rape (as if it's more prevalent than off-campus rape, which it's not).\nThen rape survivors were featured on stage, and Lady Gaga sang about rape for a documentary about rape.\nIt is a post that insists we look at the damage done by fixating on child abduction and rape."}
