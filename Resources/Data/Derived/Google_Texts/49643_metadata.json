In 2010, the county paid just less than $6 million to cover its full-time employees, but by 2016, that price tag rises to almost $9 million.\n\n\u201cOur county is one of the few counties that continues to pay 100 percent of the premium,\u201d Parke said. \u201cAnd we pay that for every employee, even if the employee\u2019s spouse is already covered under somebody else\u2019s insurance.\u201d\n\nCoupled with the premium benefit package, the county offers lower than market-rate wages, making it difficult to attract and retain workers.\n\n\u201cSo you have people who come in and see a $12 to $13 starting salary when they\u2019re making $16 right now, and they\u2019re forgetting that they\u2019re paying for their own health insurance and have to save their own money for a 401K,\u201d Parke said.\n\nThe bottom line, Parke added, is that five years down the road, the county will either need to start spending down its healthy fund balance \u2014 kept in place in case of emergencies \u2014 or raise taxes.\n\nStory continues below graphics.\n\nIn addition, the county\u2019s two main sources of revenue \u2014 property and sales tax \u2014 have been slightly anemic. While new property values grew by seven percent in 2007, that growth plummeted to one percent by 2014. Sales tax revenues rose from $8 million in 2010 to just over $10 million in 2015. That steady four percent increase each year is good to see, Parke said, but sales tax revenue can also be very volatile depending on the economy, making it \u201ca scary source to count on.\u201d\n\nThe tentative 2016 budget contains no cost of living or merit increases for employees.\n\nCommission Chairman Kerry Gibson largely blamed the Affordable Care Act for the county\u2019s rising health insurance costs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really killing us. The Obamacare increases have made it very hard for our budget to handle, so we have to figure out a plan forward in future years as to how we\u2019ll deal with that,\u201d Gibson said.\n\n\u2022 RELATED: Republican states that expanded Medicaid have stuck with it\n\nBrad Dee \u2014 a state lawmaker and head of Weber County\u2019s Administrative Services division \u2014 said the county employs 961 full-time staff and about 85 part-time workers.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons for those (premium) escalations,\u201d Dee said by phone, pointing to medical inflation that typically runs about eight to 10 percent every year. That is coupled with a three- to four-percent annual increase the past two years related to insurance entities covering themselves for additional enrollees and growing risk pools under the Affordable Care Act\n\nOne of the bigger factors, Dee added, would be pharmaceuticals, drug costs and new drugs that become available through research and development.\n\n\u201cThose are usually extremely costly drugs,\u201d Dee said. \u201cLastly, I think usage \u2014 in Weber County we\u2019ve found that our loss ratios have been fairly good, but sometimes we have spikes . . . which means that our rates will escalate a little bit.\u201d\n\nEden resident Jan Fullmer attended Tuesday\u2019s budget meeting and said she retired from the health care industry.\n\n\u201cHealth care costs, especially for insurance premiums, have far exceeded the cost of living,\u201d Fullmer said, suggesting the county consider cutting back on funding gold and platinum policies for employees and instead boost salaries and allocate an extra pocket of money for merit increases based on performance.\n\nCommissioner James Ebert said that ongoing discussions revolve around balancing taxed wages with nontaxed benefits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re walking that line and those will be decisions that we\u2019ll continue to look at over this next year as to what works best for our staff and employees,\u201d Ebert said.\n\nThe County Commission is scheduled to approve the final 2016 budget Dec. 22.\n\nContact reporter Cathy McKitrick at 801-625-4214 or cmckitrick@standard.net.
