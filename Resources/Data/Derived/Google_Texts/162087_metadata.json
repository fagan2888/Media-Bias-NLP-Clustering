Really? Have the American people not judged the corrupt tree for what it is and the fruit it has borne (Luke 6:44)? Is it that Americans cannot see the Bush family for who they are after years of corruption?\n\nNow, the state-controlled media, namely the conservative outlets, are trying to convince us that Jeb Bush is the number one pick through polls that are clearly skewed, as well as fraudulent.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nPresident Hilary Clinton? Really? Who is attempting to legitimize this criminal? Do I need to say anything about Hilary and her crime-strewn past? To latch on to the fact that she is a legitimate pick for the presidency of the United States is far beyond comprehension.\n\nIsn\u2019t everyone across the board (and I mean everyone) talking about how sick and tired they are of the establishment? Yes, they are! Yet, this exhibits the media\u2019s willingness to stay persistent regardless of what the American people are really calling for. In other words, shove it down their throats until they accept that we (the establishment) are the ruling class, like it or not! This is becoming more apparent every day in this country.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWhen did this all go wrong?\n\n\u201cKings become tyrants through policy when subjects have become rebels from principles.\u201d (Psalm 18:21, Exodus 20)\n\nThere is no doubt that the state-controlled media are pushing the talking points of the day, which get the American people to ask the wrong questions in order to create debate in an attempt to implement illegal legislation through their propaganda. And propaganda it is. Yet, it does not go forward without the ignorance of the people who have allowed it to go on.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFor example, the American people are led to believe that the Supreme Court can redefine God\u2019s definition of marriage (Genesis 2:24).\n\nAmericans are now waiting for a very radical and corrupt court to make a decision on the definition of marriage. Let me tell you plainly that government did not create marriage and, therefore, has no business redefining it. So, why are Americans awaiting a decision from the high court? They are to discover God\u2019s Law and apply God\u2019s Law. Who gave the Supreme Court permission to redefine anything? The ignorance of the American people has done this (Hosea 4:6).\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of what the Constitution says, then we have ceased to be our own rulers (Under God), and the Supreme Court is our ruler.\u201d -President Andrew Jackson\n\nAmericans have been, for years, talking about Obamacare. Yet, Obamacare is unconstitutional and, therefore, illegal, according to Article 1, Section 8 of The United States Constitution. Instead of the state-controlled media doing their job, by exposing its unconstitutionality and putting the question to this administration as to where they derived their authority to enact an unconstitutional agenda, they divide the people into opposing groups to debate what is illegal. Who gave corrupt government permission to violate constitutional law? Ignorance has (Hosea 4:6)!\n\nThese useful idiots lead Americans on with a cycle of rhetorical talk day after day with the same backward flow of information through a system that corruption means to destroy. It is like giving bad medicine to a healthy body. But rest assured \u2013 the body can only take so much before it will fail.\n\nThe good news is that it all stops when the American people have had enough!\n\nThe American People and the AK-47\n\n\n\nFreedom to Break the Law?\n\n\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Do you really want this guy as president?", "author": "Bradlee Dean", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Do you really want this guy as president?", "title": "Is The Liberal Media Forcing An Ignorant Populace To Debate What Is Illegal?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeb-bush.jpg", "height": 1348}, "updated_time": "2015-04-14T11:30:42-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/is-the-liberal-media-forcing-an-ignorant-populace-to-debate-what-is-illegal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Do you really want this guy as president?", "title": "Is The Liberal Media Forcing An Ignorant Populace To Debate What Is Illegal?", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeb-bush.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-13T14:44:27-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "The Bible", "published_time": "2015-04-13T14:44:27-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-14T11:30:42-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton, jeb bush, marriage, obamacare, same sex marriage, the bible, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde71e\"", "article_summary": "Now, the state-controlled media, namely the conservative outlets, are trying to convince us that Jeb Bush is the number one pick through polls that are clearly skewed, as well as fraudulent.\nWho gave the Supreme Court permission to redefine anything?\nInstead of the state-controlled media doing their job, by exposing its unconstitutionality and putting the question to this administration as to where they derived their authority to enact an unconstitutional agenda, they divide the people into opposing groups to debate what is illegal.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowFor example, the American people are led to believe that the Supreme Court can redefine God\u2019s definition of marriage (Genesis 2:24).\nYet, this exhibits the media\u2019s willingness to stay persistent regardless of what the American people are really calling for."}
