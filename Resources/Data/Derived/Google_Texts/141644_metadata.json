Court papers show Davis admitted to pulling Denver St. Clair's underwear over the his back and head -- allowing the elastic band to wrap around St. Clair's neck.\n\n1/8/2014 Related Story: Documents Say McLoud Man Admits Killing Stepdad With \"Atomic Wedgie\"\n\nProsecutors introduced the medical examiner's report stating blunt-force trauma and asphyxiation were St. Clair's cause of death.\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was James Allen Howell, a longtime family friend. Howell said he hung out at St. Clair's house growing up. Howell said Davis and St. Clair always seemed to get along with each other.\n\nHowell testified he got a text from Davis on December 21, 2013, the night of the homicide, saying Davis was going to \"f$&!\" Denver up.\" Howell said he texted Davis not to do it because it was \"not worth it\".\n\nHowell testified the next call he received was Davis saying \"help me, help me, help me.\"\n\nHowell said when he arrived at the house located at 4 Shadow Lake Drive near McLoud, he found St. Clair on the ground in a pool of blood and Davis yelling, \"help me\" over and over again.\n\nHe testified Davis even bowed up to him but did not fight him. Howell said that is when he went outside and flagged down a passing police officer.\n\nHowell testified that days later, Davis and him were splitting wood together, and said Davis told him St. Clair started the fight with him.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Howell testified Davis told him he never meant for the death to happen.\n\nDavis will appear in court again later this summer.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A friend testified he got a text from Brad Davis on December 21, 2013, saying Davis was intending to do harm to his stepfather.", "author": "Adrianna Iwasinski", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/25880862/stepson-accused-of-killing-father-using-atomic-wedgie", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25880862_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A friend testified he got a text from Brad Davis on December 21, 2013, saying Davis was intending to do harm to his stepfather.", "title": "Testimony Begins In McLoud 'Atomic Wedgie' Murder Trial"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25880862_SA.jpg", "description": "A friend testified he got a text from Brad Davis on December 21, 2013, saying Davis was intending to do harm to his stepfather.", "card": "summary", "title": "Testimony Begins In McLoud 'Atomic Wedgie' Murder Trial"}, "wnreadableurl": "stepson-accused-of-killing-father-using-atomic-wedgie", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/06/26", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "owner": "KOTV", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS17", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda727\"", "article_summary": "During cross-examination, Howell testified Davis told him he never meant for the death to happen.\nCourt papers show Davis admitted to pulling Denver St. Clair's underwear over the his back and head -- allowing the elastic band to wrap around St. Clair's neck.\nDavis is facing a first-degree murder charge and is accused of killing his stepfather, Denver St. Clair, by beating him and giving him an \"atomic wedgie,\" which officials say strangled him.\n1/8/2014 Related Story: Documents Say McLoud Man Admits Killing Stepdad With \"Atomic Wedgie\"Prosecutors introduced the medical examiner's report stating blunt-force trauma and asphyxiation were St. Clair's cause of death.\nHowell testified the next call he received was Davis saying \"help me, help me, help me.\""}
