Governors were barred from making many executive appointments, and judges could never forget that on a single day in 1935 the General Assembly sacked the entire Supreme Court.\n\nWithout constitutional checks and balances, citizens suffered under single party control. Republicans ruled during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; Democrats held sway from the 1930s into the twenty-first century. In their eras of unchecked control, both parties became corrupt.\n\nH Philip West's SECRETS & SCANDALS tells the inside story of events that shook Rhode Island\u2019s culture of corruption, gave birth to the nation\u2019s strongest ethics commission, and finally brought separation of powers in 2004. No single leader, no political party, no organization could have converted betrayals of public trust into historic reforms. But when citizen coalitions worked with dedicated public officials to address systemic failures, government changed.\n\nThree times\u2014in 2002, 2008, and 2013\u2014Chicago\u2019s Better Government Association has scored state laws that promote integrity, accountability, and government transparency. In 50-state rankings, Rhode Island ranked second twice and first in 2013\u2014largely because of reforms reported in SECRETS & SCANDALS.\n\nEach week, GoLocalProv will be running a chapter from SECRETS & SCANDALS: Reforming Rhode Island, 1986-2006, which chronicles major government reforms that took place during H. Philip West's years as executive director of Common Cause of Rhode Island. The book is available from the local bookstores found HERE.\n\nPart One: DePrete, RISDIC\n\nChapter Eleven, Right Now (1991)\n\nOn December 11, 1991, precisely at 10:30, church bells pealed across Providence. The clanging rang from all directions: from belfries of the First Baptist Church in America and the cathedral of St. John, from Gloria Dei Lutheran and the Armenian Church of Saints Sahag and Mesrob. Thick State House walls seemed powerless to block their reverberation, a palpable clangor that evoked history.\n\nTelevision lights flooded the House lounge. Behind a podium studded with microphones hung a white banner with the RIght Now! logo. Deep crimson walls held the oversized portraits of former House speakers in gilded frames. Each in his turn had been arguably the most powerful politician in Rhode Island, often going on to lucrative state jobs. Those who gazed down at the crowd of legislators, reporters, and coalition leaders, would have been flabbergasted by the twenty-eight point platform that the RIght Now! Coalition was about to unveil.\n\nAlan Hassenfeld stepped to the bank of microphones, framed by the RIght Now! logo behind him. \u201cLet the bells ring for a new dawn\u201d he began, his public voice rich with the cheerful intimacy of a conversation among friends. \u201cMy business is toys, but we\u2019re here today \u2014 half way between the first day of Hanukkah and Christmas \u2014 to give Rhode Islanders a different kind of holiday gift. Today, we announce the formation of what we think is the broadest coalition in the history of Rhode Island.\u201d\n\nHe called reporters\u2019 attention to a handout that listed the groups whose leaders comprised the steering committee. \u201cWe call this coalition \u2018RIght Now!\u2019 Our goal, very simply, is to make Rhode Island right again and do it right now.\u201d\n\nHassenfeld said there was no need to revisit the bank closings, fiscal crises, and political scandals that had made Rhode Islanders despondent. It was obvious, he said, that RIght Now! could not turn back the clock. Instead, our goal was to make Rhode Island right for the future. \u201cWe cannot wait any longer. We must enact lock-tight reform measures that will serve as a model for every other state in America.\u201d Then he announced that our organization would work toward three goals: tougher ethics laws, effective campaign finance reforms, and a constitutional amendment to establish four-year terms, with recall and a two-term limit, for the five statewide general officers.\n\nOutlining our platform, I highlighted twenty-eight specific reforms. We welcomed bills already announced by Gov. Sundlun and leaders of the General Assembly, but added that we wanted substantially more than we had seen so far. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to close a few loopholes. We have to make a tight seal. When we\u2019re trying to keep hot air in our house and cold air out, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to weather-strip the doors if we leave the windows open.\u201d\n\nI added that RIght Now! was determined to stop senators and representatives from trading their votes for state jobs when they left the legislature. A Providence Sunday Journal story had identified forty-nine legislators who, during the last ten years, had moved directly from their seats in the General assembly to judgeships or other permanent, well-paid state jobs. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying never,\u201d I said, \u201conly for one year. But make no mistake, we are passionate about this.\u201d\n\nStreamlining the Ethics Commission and opening up its adjudicative hearings was another goal. I wanted to add that the day before I had heard former Gov. DiPrete and his son testify, but the law kept their testimony secret. My list ended with our proposal for four-year terms for the governor and other statewide general officers. \u201cNo matter who wins, we\u2019re putting that person in charge of a $2 billion-a-year corporation. With two-year terms, we\u2019re saying: \u2018Recruit great staff and produce flashy results in a hurry, because your next campaign starts in earnest only twelve months from now. And by the way, you\u2019d better start raising $40,000 a week so you can get re-elected in two years.\u2019\u201d\n\nNews outlets loved the story. Cartoonists showed Hasbro\u2019s G.I. Joe storming the State House. Editorials welcomed the effort, although several columnists wondered whether this unlikely coalition could hold together through the inevitable battles ahead.\n\nEven as the klieg lights cooled, RIght Now! faced both internal stress and outside attack. Without consulting the steering committee, Alan Hassenfeld announced a moratorium on campaign contributions. He pledged to Providence Journal reporter G. Wayne Miller that he would not give to political campaigns or parties until meaningful reform was enacted. \u201cI will call upon my colleagues at Hasbro to do the same, and I will implore all the people to tighten their belts and stop feeding the machine.\u201d Once he went out on that limb, how could his moratorium not also become the coalition\u2019s policy?\n\nI stood in awe of Alan Hassenfeld. I wished we had discussed his idea for a moratorium before he declared it, but how could I criticize his bold move? A freeze in contributions made little difference for me, since national Common Cause barred staff from endorsing candidates or making campaign contributions, but I still feared its effect. A moratorium that dried up campaign contributions would hurt challengers while money flowed as usual from professional lobbyists to legislative leaders and their loyalists.\n\nAt our next steering committee meeting, I timidly raised my concern. If the moratorium dragged on for months, it could have unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d Hassenfeld said graciously, \u201cbut I think we have to send a strong message to everybody in that building that we can\u2019t continue with business as usual. They simply must pass campaign finance reform with teeth.\u201d He did not sound angry or bitter. \u201cThe real litmus test is: \u2018are you willing to sign on to the moratorium?'\"\n\nI nodded and said no more.\n\nThroughout the fall, those of us who were organizing the coalition had reached in every way we could to two major powers: the Roman Catholic Diocese and organized labor. Only days after we unveiled the coalition with pealing church bells, Bishop Louis E. Gelineau announced that he supported RIght Now!\u2019s goals.\n\nGary Sasse and I had presented the RIght Now! platform to the ALF-CIO Executive Council at their headquarters, only a block from the State House. We left with a sense that the unions would not support our proposals. On the sidewalk afterward, Sasse said it was still important that we had reached out to labor. \u201cMost of them will protect the legislative status quo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019ll be less vehement after our visit. If we can keep them out of the fight, that helps us.\u201d\n\nSince 1935, when Democrats broke the Yankee Republican stranglehold on Rhode Island\u2019s government, unions had become a dominant force. Lobbyists for teachers, social workers, firefighters, police, correctional officers, and other public employees constituted the most disciplined and professional force at the State House. Unions for teamsters, electricians, machinists, pipefitters, and longshoremen had lost membership when traditional industries fled the state, but their solidarity endured.\n\nAs Sasse predicted, ALF-CIO President Edward McElroy announced that labor would not join the Right Now! Coalition on the grounds that some of its proposals were \u201cantidemocratic.\u201d Promoting them would lead to an unnecessary \u201cbashing\u201d of lawmakers. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our own thing in choosing those issues we choose to support and opposing those we feel are not wise policy,\u201d McElroy said.\n\nGeorge Nee, the ALF-CIO secretary-treasurer, spoke of labor\u2019s objection to strengthening the governor\u2019s position with a four-year term while leaving lawmakers with two-year terms. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t get caught up in such a bandwagon of reform that we start upsetting the balance between branches of government,\u201d Nee told the Providence Business News. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t harm these institutions in our quest to get rid of every injustice.\u201d\n\nWhile organized labor found RIght Now! too disruptive of the General Assembly\u2019s dominant role in state government, an array of militant depositor and reform groups declared our new coalition not radical enough. Since RISDIC\u2019s collapse, protesters had sorted themselves around differences over substance, tactics, and leadership. Besides Citizens for Depositors\u2019 Rights, other new groups had coalesced: the Government Accountability Project, the Rhode Island Taxpayers Association, Reform 92, and Operation Clean Sweep.\n\nMaurice \u201cMo\u201d Guernon of Operation Clean Sweep told the Providence Journal he had considered joining existing reform groups but none had the \u201csweeping\u201d approach needed. \u201cWith the current crew in the state legislature,\u201d Guernon said, \u201cyou\u2019re not likely to get any fundamental reform that has teeth in it.\u201d On talk radio and in public statements, Guernon declared it time for ordinary citizens \u201cto strip corrupt politicians of their special privileges.\u201d Press releases warned that Operation Clean Sweep would \u201ctarget corrupt public officials for removal.\u201d Like Jack Kayrouz of Citizens for Depositors\u2019 Rights, Guernon laced his comments with sarcasm.\n\nAs we organized the RIght Now! Coalition, I asked the steering committee if we could draw these grassroots groups in, but business leaders cringed. \u201cYou can\u2019t deal with those people,\u201d said Jim Hagan, who led the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey tar everybody with the same brush. Even their name says they think they can sweep corrupt politicians out \u2014 as if they can tell by just looking who\u2019s crooked and who\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nFrom the head of the table, Hassenfeld asked for candid comments. \u201cHere\u2019s the question,\u201d he said. \u201cWould they moderate their position at all? Could we bring them in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat bugs me about Mo Guernon and his crowd,\u201d said Jim Miller in his turn, \u201cis that they constantly condemn public officials across the board. A lot of politicians have feathered their own nests, but no one will simply sweep them all away. Until the election next November, we have to work with the current senators and reps. We have a brief window to persuade the General Assembly to act. I\u2019m all for being firm, but punching them in the gut will only make them resist our bills.\n\n\u201cI believe our message has to be that all of us \u2014 elected officials and ordinary citizens alike \u2014 need to repent for tolerating such corruption. Once we repent for letting corruption fester so long, then we can demand that legislators also repent and fix the political system.\u201d\n\nNorman Orodenker spoke for the Jewish Federation. \u201cI\u2019m obviously not a Baptist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I agree wholeheartedly with Jim. These \u2018clean sweep\u2019 people may mean well, or they may not mean well. Frankly, I have no way of knowing, but I don\u2019t believe that bringing them to this table will moderate their behavior. It may even embolden them.\u201d\n\nGary Sasse agreed. \u201cA crisis like this attracts people who enjoy the politics of personal attack. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll temper their militancy for the sake of passing genuine reforms. I\u2019m not even sure they want reforms to pass, since that would undercut their case for sweeping all the incumbents out.\n\n\u201cIn answer to Alan\u2019s question,\u201d Sasse said, \u201cI agree with Jim and Norman that we would make a mistake by inviting Operation Clean Sweep into this coalition. Partners in a coalition don\u2019t need to agree on every point, but they\u2019ve got to be pragmatic and respect differences, which I don\u2019t see.\u201d He paused, as if to reflect. \u201cI also need to say that if Operation Clean Sweep joins this coalition, my board would probably pull RIPEC out.\u201d\n\nHassenfeld had said nothing while he listened to opinions around the table. He asked if anyone wanted to say more. He waited for the silence to work and then spoke. \u201cSounds like we\u2019re in agreement. We may wish there were a way to invite Operation Clean Sweep onto this steering committee, but we can\u2019t handle their belligerence. We can\u2019t expect a leopard to change its spots.\u201d\n\nHe scanned the table again. \u201cAnd, hey, we\u2019re no less committed than they are to making serious change in this messed-up state that we love. We\u2019re simply admitting that you can\u2019t achieve real reform through personal ad hominem attacks. So we reaffirm our position that we will fight to the death on principle, but we will never attack people.\u201d\n\nWeather forecasts predicted heavy rain for the first Sunday of 1992, and a cold drizzle fell from leaden skies. Thousands were expected for an interfaith rally on the broad plaza below the State House. The decision whether to move into a nearby auditorium rested on Jim Miller, who decided to risk the rain. Throngs gathered in cathedrals, churches, and synagogues of their choosing. Those not affiliated with any religious institutions could use a specified parking lot where parking would be free.\n\nProcessions stepped off with banners aloft. From Saints Sahag and Mesrob Armenian Cathedral bearded priests in black robes carried ancient icons across a bridge over I-95 to the beat of drums and the clanging of church bells. They met and mingled with the Lutherans who had gathered at Gloria Dei Church on nearby Hayes Street. Marchers tramped up Smith Hill from the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John, across from the Roger Williams National Memorial, while Roman Catholics from the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on Weybosset Hill wound their way through downtown Providence, merging with streams of Protestants from Beneficent Congregational and Mathewson Street United Methodist churches. Unitarians came from several directions. Processions flowed together up Francis Street, over the Woonasquatucket River, and toward the State House. American Baptists, who had gathered at the First Baptist Church in America, crossed a bridge over the Moshassuck River near the spot where Roger Williams had founded Providence and their congregation more than three and a half centuries earlier.\n\nA year earlier, low-flying military planes and artillery rounds had punctuated Bruce Sundlun\u2019s inauguration. The new governor interrupted festivities by announcing the collapse of RISDIC. Since then, bitter protesters had come by the thousands, shouting for their money, but now church bells pealed across the city, a wild clanging cacophony of high chimes and deep gongs.\n\nStreams of marchers flooded onto the State House grounds from all directions with triumphant music of fifes and drums, trumpets and bagpipes. They mingled on brick walkways under bare winter trees. A cheerful multitude filled the broad south plaza and overflowed onto wide swaths of soggy grass. Waves of people flowed up broad staircases and crowded the white marble terraces. A man and woman appeared on horseback representing Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, exiles from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As if turning a new page, this vast ecumenical throng seemed to have left bitterness behind. As their numbers swelled, the sky cleared, and sunshine bathed the scene.\n\nI watched Jim Miller, in a black preaching robe, make his way to a pulpit that held a single microphone. Nearby, an Orthodox icon portrayed a dark-skinned Jesus with gold halo. Behind Miller, the bold RIght Now! banner fluttered. Farther back, white marble pillars rose to a broad lintel engraved with words from the royal charter: \u201cTo hold forth a lively experiment that a most civil state may stand and best be maintained with full liberty in religious concernment.\u201d\n\nMiller welcomed the throng and thanked them for risking rain. He promised a gathering different from any ever held on this historic ground. \u201cOur theme today,\u201d he said, \u201cis repentance. We want those who work in this building to repent of decisions made in this splendid structure, and we must repent of our indifference. We must repent for allowing so much that was wrong to go on for so long.\u201d\n\nRabbi Wayne Franklin from Temple Emanu-El stepped forward in a white prayer shawl. He explained the ancient blowing of a ram\u2019s horn for repentance at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Then he lifted a shofar of polished onyx and gray to his lips. He blew, but no sound came. He put his lips to the horn and blew again but only sputtered. The rabbi drew a deep breath and blew again. This time, an eerie wail rose through and over the crowd, its pitch soaring like nothing heard in this space before. Then a cantor sang Psalm 15 on speaking truth from the heart, doing no harm to the neighbor, keeping oaths amid pain, and not accepting bribes against the innocent.\n\nBishop Louis E. Gelineau appeared in simple black cassock and red cap. He spoke from a pastoral letter he had published in the diocesan newspaper a few days earlier, lamenting those who took advantage of their positions to commit crimes: \u201cWere not some of them raised in good catholic homes? Do they not see a relationship between their faith and their moral duties?\u201d In a solemn liturgical voice, Gelineau called for \u201ca renewed sense of public morality.\u201d He told the crowd, \u201cIn the end, we shall each stand before God to be judged. I pray that when your moment and mine comes to give an accounting, we shall not be found wanting.\u201d\n\nRabbi David B. Rosen, president of the Rhode Island Board of Rabbis, picked up the same themes. \u201cWe are not here to condemn state government as a whole,\u201d he told the crowd, \u201cfor we know there are thousands of hardworking, dedicated and honest men and women in every branch of government who deserve our admiration and respect. But we cry out for repentance.\u201d\n\nMiller had made the event truly catholic and inclusive. Rev. Dietra C. Bell, from the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in the neglected West End of Providence, asked God to soften the hearts of public officials. Then she sang with power that set hands clapping and bodies swaying.\n\nThe chief Narragansett medicine man, Lloyd Wilcox, called out in a booming baritone, \u201cBrothers and sisters, we gather in the presence of the great spirit.\u201d With a beaded headband across his brow, he embodied the state\u2019s paradoxical history of respect and cruelty toward its indigenous people. His voice reverberated across the city: \u201cBroken promises, broken treaties, broken hearts, and broken bodies are echoed in this present time due to the abuse of leadership in government for selfish gain. Once again, trust between brothers and sisters is shattered and denied, and human dignity violated.\n\n\u201cGreat Spirit, renew our trust!\u201d Wilcox called and waited, then called again: \u201cGreat Spirit, renew our trust!\u201d\n\nThis time, the crowd shouted back: \u201cGreat Spirit, renew our trust!\u201d\n\nHe boomed again: \u201cGreat Spirit, renew our trust!\u201d\n\nThousands responded: \u201cGreat Spirit, renew our trust!\u201d\n\nAs if voices were not enough, Miller invited the crowd to climb the broad white marble stairs and march around the State House. The crowd surged upward behind rabbis blowing shofars. Once on the pedestal, they joined hands, forming a ring around the entire building. With church bells clanging from all directions, the line of marchers clasped hands to form a second circle around the iconic structure, and then a third. People cheered, and many danced.\n\nI watched the rally on television news that night, flipping from channel to channel. Reporters expressed surprise \u2014 they had not heard a word of personal attack from the speakers or the crowd. The weather report showed a satellite photo of rain clouds swirling over southern New England. In time-lapse images, a clear eye of the storm opened up over Westerly and tracked northeast across Providence. As in ancient times, many took that patch of clear sky as a sign of God\u2019s favor or, as Roger Williams might have said, of divine and merciful providence.\n\nFrom the start of the 1992 legislative session, RIght Now! proved powerful and provocative. Publicity from newscasts and newspaper stories lent heft to our lobbying efforts. Volunteers arrived at the State House and cleaned out the stocks of RIght Now! buttons that I brought in my briefcase. They pinned the badges on proudly and went to find their senators and representatives. A few legislators asked for buttons and wore them for a day or two below legislative lapel pins, while others merely peered at the one on my jacket. \u201cWould you like one?\u201d I would ask as we shook hands.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d some would say but then assure me they would give our bills every consideration.\n\nIncreased visibility also made RIght Now! a target. Near the end of January, the Rhode Island Black Caucus of State Legislators convened a press conference to demand that we add their issues to the RIght Now! platform. With the caucus were leaders of the NAACP, several smaller civil rights groups, and the president of the largely African-American Ministers\u2019 Alliance of Rhode Island. Rep. Joseph E. Newsome, who represented the district where Anne and I lived on the South Side of Providence, declared that the debate must be broadened beyond \u201cthe Common Cause agenda. That agenda is very narrow.\u201d Newsome insisted that any reform must also help children in poverty, increase funds for education, and make corporations socially responsible.\n\nNewsome\u2019s words stung. He and I had worked locally together to end apartheid in South Africa and to help refugees from Liberia\u2019s civil war. We had been allies in streamlining voter registration, which increased voting in our neighborhood. He knew that the executive director of the Urban League, B. Jae Clanton, served on the RIght Now! steering committee. I began to sense that the real target of this press conference was Thomas J. Skala, the president of Fleet National Bank. Newsome insisted that banks needed to commit more to low-income neighborhoods, calling it \u201cobscene and unethical\u201d for corporate leaders with huge salaries and bonuses to lay off workers in poor neighborhoods.\n\nRep. Harold M. Metts, who chaired the Black Caucus, also weighed in. \u201cEthics reform, to be truly meaningful, needs to be all-inclusive,\u201d he declared. While he spoke, I noticed Jim Miller\u2019s name on the list of speakers on the list. The unprecedented racial inclusiveness of the January rally for ethics reform had been Miller\u2019s doing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to speak here today,\u201d Miller began gently. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the concerns of our youngest and poorest and weakest must truly be our own. We must be attentive to all who bear the legacy of America\u2019s deep original sin. We must all redress the wrongs and injustices perpetrated against persons of color. I want you to know that the Council of Churches is fully committed to addressing these concerns.\u201d\n\nMiller turned a page in a tiny notebook. \u201cBut I need to say that \u2014 as important as these issues are \u2014 RIght Now! cannot suddenly add them to its agenda. There are narrower anti-corruption issues that it must deal with first if we hope to get Rhode Island back on its feet. I hope this caucus in its wisdom will recognize that political reality.\u201d\n\nMiller was a newcomer in Rhode Island and the only Caucasian invited to speak, so he took a great risk in challenging the Black Caucus\u2019s demand. He spoke carefully but firmly. \u201cTo push all these things in 1992 will mean that none will get done. With RISDIC\u2019s collapse, our urban centers have suffered as much or more than any other parts of the state. Our inner-city neighbors will not trust state government until it is cleansed of corruption that bleeds the poor.\u201d\n\nI understood the anger behind this press event. Year after year, I had testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Common Cause legislation to widen the circle of those who could not benefit directly from family members who held public office. In prior years Metts had listened to testimony about the harm nepotism inflicted, and once, as I left the hearing room, he followed me into the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m against your so-called nepotism bill,\u201d he declared. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with your supposedly righteous reasons. Do you want to know why?\u201d\n\nWith lobbyists and other representatives around, I wanted a space for a private conversation, but he clearly meant to make his point in public.\n\n\u201cDo you want to know why?\u201d Metts demanded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why. When the Yankees were in power, they got jobs for their relatives, and that was okay. When the Irish got power and doled out jobs for their kinfolk, nobody raised a ruckus. When the Italians came along, they took their turn. Where was Common Cause in those days to say that doing for their kin was wrong?\u201d His voice grew louder. \u201cSo, what happens now that our community finally gets a few seats in the General Assembly? What happens when we finally get a foot in the door? All of a sudden you push to say no more nepotism. You say that\u2019s good ethics. I say it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nAs he turned and stalked back into the hearing room, his anger made complete sense to me. From his perspective, we were trying to outlaw family patronage just when African Americans could finally dispense a few government jobs.\n\nOn a rainy March day, the Episcopal Bishop of Rhode Island, George N. Hunt, faced a different attack. He signed a list of more than fifty witnesses and waited his turn to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Dressed in a black suit, purple shirt, white clerical collar, and a RIght Now! button, he stepped to the witness box.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks,\u201d Hunt began in his resonant baritone, \u201cI have had a number of occasions to be reminded by members of the General Assembly that we who represent the larger religious community have little or no expertise in the writing of legislation or in the processes of government. This is certainly true. However, please permit me to claim a modest expertise in the matter of ethics and morality and honesty and integrity in human affairs.\u201d\n\nCalm and unhurried, Hunt declared support for the ethics bills listed on the committee\u2019s agenda: legislation to streamline the Ethics Commission, trim its size, and open its adjudicative hearings to the public. He explained the concepts and illustrated the need for each bill. At the end of his prepared statement Hunt urged passage of bills that would close the revolving door and outlaw nepotism.\n\nFrom his nearby perch behind the polished mahogany fa\u00e7ade, Sen. Gregory J. Acciardo of Johnston challenged the bishop about the larger circle of relatives that our bill would place out of bounds for favored treatment. \u201cHow can you draw those lines?\u201d Acciardo asked. \u201cI read through this list, and it gets down to pretty fine detail. It says no official action to help a \u2018nephew, niece, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother or half-sister.\u2019\u201d Acciardo made the whole task sound exhausting. \u201cHave you thought about all those relatives you\u2019d have to keep track of?\u201d\n\nThe bishop smiled. \u201cI grant you, Senator, it\u2019s an exhaustive list, but we both know that legal language must be precise to be enforceable.\u201d\n\nAcciardo teased: \u201cDo we really have to go from \u2018spouse and dependent child\u2019 to this humongous list?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable list, Senator,\u201d Hunt replied. \u201cI hope putting those family members off limits for favors will restore public trust that you\u2019re here to do the people\u2019s business and not your own.\u201d\n\nAcciardo drew back momentarily. \u201cWhat about my nephew\u2019s wife?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI mean, shouldn\u2019t she be included, too? When you come right down to it, isn\u2019t everybody related?\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, there\u2019s room for negotiation on the details.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you agree we could leave nephews, nieces, and their spouses off the list?\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, that\u2019s not for me to negotiate with you here. The point is that those in authority should never be in a position to hire or supervise their own relatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever? Are families so evil?\u201d He struck a pose of astonishment.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll permit me a personal example,\u201d the bishop replied. \u201cMy son was recently ordained a priest.\u201d He gazed at Acciardo, who had begun whispering to the senator seated beside him.\n\nHunt stopped speaking until Acciardo again made eye contact. Then he continued, \u201cMy son phoned recently to ask whether there were any churches open in Rhode Island. The first thing that came to my mind was what a joy it would be to have him and his wife and our grandchildren close by, and I told him that.\u201d\n\nThe bishop paused again. Everyone in the hearing room was riveted. \u201cBut I explained to him that no matter how fair I tried to be, people would inevitably wonder how I could supervise my son\u2019s work without favoritism. I told my son that I loved him and his wife and their children, but that to avoid any appearance of impropriety, I had to ask them to look elsewhere.\u201d\n\nWhile lawmakers resisted making ethics and campaign finance laws more stringent, RIght Now! began taking fire from a new coalition that called itself the Public Interest Alliance. The new group included Operation Clean Sweep, the Government Accountability Project, the Coalition for Consumer Justice, and the Rhode Island Taxpayers Association.\n\nNone of these groups had promoted ethics or campaign finance legislation in previous years, but they lambasted the RIght Now! proposals as too soft. Where RIght Now! called for a one-year hiatus between service in the General Assembly and state jobs, including judgeships, the Alliance called for a two-year ban. Where RIght Now! proposed reducing the top individual contribution to any candidate from $2,000 to $1,000, the Alliance demanded that political donations be capped at one hundred dollars. At an early February press conference, leaders of the new coalition blasted our efforts at reform as \u201ca total capitulation to and appeasement of the leadership of the House and its speaker, Joseph DeAngelis.\u201d Nancy St. Lawrence, chairperson of the coalition for consumer Justice, completely dismissed the RIght Now! platform: \u201cWhat they wanted was just so weak, we didn\u2019t want to pursue it.\u201d\n\nI told reporters of my deep personal sorrow that we had not been able to bring all of those who wanted reform into the same tent. I tried to put a positive face on an increasingly divisive situation, reminding them that we had earnest people \u201cworking together or on parallel tracks toward similar goals of reform.\u201d But I did not say how much I feared that these differences over details might play into the hands of lawmakers who wanted no reform at all.\n\nIn February, word leaked that a key player in the RIght Now! Coalition had undercut Alan Hassenfeld\u2019s moratorium on campaign contributions. Scott MacKay reported that the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce was quietly soliciting large contributions for pro-business legislative candidates. Paul J. Choquette Jr., the CEO of Gilbane Building Co. and head of the Chamber\u2019s political action committee, had mailed a letter to chamber members asking for contributions of up to $1,000 to elect senators and representatives who would be \u201cresponsive to the needs of the business community.\u201d\n\nChoquette claimed to see no conflict between building the pro-business war chest and supporting campaign reform, since the money would all be collected before our proposed new law could be enacted. Jim Hagan, executive of the Greater Providence Chamber, insisted that the business leaders were \u201coperating within the parameters of the existing law.\u201d It looked hypocritical or worse \u2014 a major group in the coalition was collecting corporate cash that would be banned under the proposed new campaign finance law it claimed to support. George Nee, the head of the state ALF-CIO, told MacKay: \u201cIt looks like an effort to raise as much money as they can before the law takes effect.\u201d\n\nWhen Scott MacKay called me for a comment, I answered evasively. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said lamely. \u201cYou could probably argue it both ways.\u201d He used my comment to end his story. Reading it the next morning over breakfast, I felt chagrined. How had I so badly underestimated the forces \u2014 both internal and external \u2014 that seemed to be tearing RIght Now! apart?\n\nH.
