Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told the Journal Sentinel Monday he will not run for president in 2016 and instead focus on his role as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Credit: Journal Sentinel files\n\nAll Politics Blog From Milwaukee, Madison and beyond, a daily dose of political news and glimpses behind the scenes SHARE\n\nBy of the\n\nThere will be no 2016 presidential campaign for Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Monday, saying he wants to devote his undivided attention to his new and influential role as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\n\u201cI am where I am. I like where I am,\u201d Ryan said in an interview Monday. \u201cI feel like I can have a huge impact on the course of the debate in this country.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s decision removes one big name from a very long list of potential GOP candidates and provides a little more space in the race for fellow Wisconsinite Scott Walker, the second-term governor who appears to be increasingly serious about running for president in 2016.\n\nAs the party\u2019s 2012 vice-presidential nominee and its most prominent voice on economic and fiscal issues, Ryan had several potential assets as a candidate for his party's nomination: higher name recognition than many presidential aspirants in his party, fundraising ability, and good standing with party activists and the conservative media.\n\nBut he had not signaled a burning desire to run and had passed up opportunities to run in 2012. In that sense his decision is not a huge surprise.\n\nRyan said in the interview that he came to the conclusion late last year that simultaneously running for president and chairing the Ways and Committee was not something he wanted to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big job and it deserves my undivided attention,\u201d Ryan said of his leadership of a committee that writes legislation on taxes, entitlements and health care policy. He said his agenda as chairman includes tax reform, \u201crepealing and replacing Obamacare, preventing a debt crisis, and moving people from welfare to work.\u201d\n\nRyan said it was too early for him to talk about GOP candidates he might support for the nomination, but he said that the work a Republican Congress does on the kinds of issues under the domain of his committee could help his party\u2019s 2016 nominee.\n\n\u201cIf we get it right in Congress, I think that can also help us win the presidency,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cIn the intervening two years, Republicans need to show who we are.\u201d\n\nThe Janesville Republican, who has three children under high-school age, said family considerations were not the reason for his decision.\n\n\u201cMy family was supportive of whatever choice I made. My family liked the 2012 experience,\u201d he said of his place on the GOP ticket with presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nHad he decided to run for president, Ryan would have had to seek a waiver from fellow House Republicans from a new rule requiring committee chairs to vacate their position to run for other office, such as senator or president. Ryan said he was confident he would have received the waiver, but said he was also convinced it would be a mistake to try to do both things at once.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can do justice to both,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think there are a number of very capable (presidential) candidates. I think I would have been on the top of the list,\u201d he said, when asked whether he thought he could have won the nomination. \u201cI made my decision solely on my desire to be chairman of Ways and Means and my ability to have a huge impact where I am.\u201d\n\nThe committee chairmanship has been a long-stated ambition of Ryan\u2019s, and a reason he passed up the chance in the past to run for the U.S. Senate in Wisconsin and for a House leadership position.\n\n\u201cI always believed chairman of Ways and Means was the right place for me. Now that I have it, I\u2019m very happy with where I am,\u201d said Ryan, who said he made his decision against a 2016 bid in the final weeks of last month.\n\nRyan said he had shared his decision with Gov. Walker. In Walker and Ryan, Wisconsin had two potential GOP presidential candidates, making it somewhat improbable that both would run. Walker has talked more and more openly about a White House bid in recent weeks, and begun taking steps toward a candidacy. Walker will be appearing with other possible Republican candidates in Iowa this month, and is a featured speaker Thursday at the winter meetings of the Republican National Committee in San Diego.\n\nRyan chairs his first meeting of the House Ways and Means committee Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get off on the right foot,\u201d said Ryan of the Ways and Means panel. \u201cI wanted to make the announcement before we get rolling\u201d with the committee.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Paul Ryan won't run for president in 2016", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/288313811.html", "image": {"width": 1833, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99384576z.1_20141104211358_000_gs28iitd.1-0.jpg", "height": 1325}, "type": "article", "description": "U.S. Rep.
