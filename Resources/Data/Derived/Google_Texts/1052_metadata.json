Yes, more people say raise the debt ceiling and fight the health care debate somewhere else, but you have Republican lawmakers going home, most of them to safe Republican districts. And they're being told by many of their constituents not to worry about it ,' you don't have to raise the debt ceiling',\" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said.\n\nThe survey also indicates independents are split.\n\n\"Here's a sales problem for the president. Even among independents, a pretty even divide on whether raising the debt ceiling is a good or bad thing,\" King added.\n\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 27-29, with 803 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nWhat do you think? Here's your chance to weigh in below.\n\nWhich do you think is more important for Congress to do?\n\nRaising the debt ceiling to make sure the government has enough money to pay its debts\n\nDelaying the date on which major provisions in the new health care law will take effect\n\nOr are both equally important?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Surveys indicate that most Americans didn't think shutting down the government in an attempt to dismantle the new health care law was a good idea.", "pubdate": "2013-10-02T10:01:29Z", "author": "By  Paul Steinhauser, CNN Political Editor", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Surveys indicate that most Americans didn't think shutting down the government in an attempt to dismantle the new health care law was a good idea.", "pubdate": "2013-10-02T10:01:29Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/02/politics/cnn-poll-debt-ceiling/index.html", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/02/politics/cnn-poll-debt-ceiling/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, CNN Poll: Majority says raise debt ceiling - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2013-10-02T17:33:04Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c90\"", "article_summary": "By a 51% to 43% margin, the public said it is more important to raise the debt ceiling than to delay Obamacare.\n\"You have bipartisan consensus among economists that not raising the debt ceiling would be a disaster, but politically you have a divide.\nAnd they're being told by many of their constituents not to worry about it ,' you don't have to raise the debt ceiling',\" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said.\n\"Among most other major demographics groups, failure to raise the debt ceiling is seen as a bad thing.\"\nThe government faces a debt ceiling crunch around October 17, when it expects to run out of options to keep below the legal cap on federal borrowing."}
