The Denver district attorney’s decision last week not to bring charges against a deputy who punched an inmate was an unsettling end to a disturbing episode.

From a legal standpoint, we understand the argument DA Mitch Morrissey makes. But from a moral standpoint, it’s hard to reconcile his decision with surveillance video that shows the deputy coldcocking the inmate seemingly without provocation.

At a time when there is intense concern about Denver jail operations and the sheriff’s department, this decision won’t go over well.

The controversy began when a video surfaced showing Denver Sheriff Deputy Thomas Ford striding up to an inmate in the jail and striking him in the face.

The description of the July altercation, included in Morrissey’s letter about the case to interim Sheriff Elias Diggins, bears little resemblance to how the incident looks to have unfolded.

Ford said he intended to move the inmate, Kyle Askins, from the bench where he was sitting and put him in a cell. The deputy walked purposefully toward Askins, who stood up.

According to the letter, Ford said he felt threatened: “I had no intention of getting into a physical altercation with this guy. … He popped up off the bench in an aggressive manner.”

The inmate certainly doesn’t look aggressive to us, arms at his side, holding what looks to be some papers.

To be sure, Morrissey had evidence beyond the video, including witness statements and a description of the profane and ugly threats Askins was making at the time.

Morrissey said Colorado law gives deputies the right to defend themselves before they are struck, so long as they believe force is about to be used against them and the deputy’s use of force is reasonable. The DA said prosecutors would have had to prove Ford wrong in order to get a conviction.

Morrissey’s decision may be legally justified, but we’re pretty sure it won’t pass muster in the court of public opinion.
