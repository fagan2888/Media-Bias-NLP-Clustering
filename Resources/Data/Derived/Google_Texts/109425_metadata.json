Pooler for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. Other cases are still pending.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, religious nonprofits that object on religious grounds to providing contraception can opt out by completing a one-page form. Then, a third party, either an insurance company or a health insurance administrator, takes over providing and coordinating payments for the employees\u2019 contraceptives.\n\nThe four New York groups \u2014 a Catholic high school in the Bronx and another on Staten Island, as well as two Catholic health care systems \u2014 argued that the opt-out sheet imposed a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on their religious freedom. Either they had to offer \u201caccess to products and services they find objectionable,\u201d as Judge Pooler summarized it, or they faced high fines.\n\nJudge Brian M. Cogan of Federal District Court in Brooklyn upheld that argument in 2013, agreeing that the opt-out provision itself violated the employers\u2019 religious freedom. Judge Cogan granted an injunction requiring the to employees pay for their contraceptives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, Judge Pooler wrote that the opt-out form was, in fact, \u201ca modicum of paperwork\u201d that \u201crelieves, rather than imposes, any substantial burden\u201d on the plaintiffs\u2019 religious freedom.\n\n\u201cEligible organizations are provided the opportunity to freely express their religious objection to such coverage as well as to extricate themselves from its provision,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the same time, insured individuals are not deprived of the benefits of contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\nThe health care law requires employers to cover contraceptives for female employees.\n\nReligious groups, though, can \u201copt out of paying for objectionable medical services without denying these services to employees who may or may not share the religious beliefs of their employer,\u201d Judge Pooler wrote.\n\nThe four groups are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.\n\nAs an alternative to the opt-out form, which is sent to the federal Labor Department, religious groups may send a letter to the federal Department of Health and Human Services \u201cdetailing their religious objections in their own words,\u201d and the government would then notify insurance administrators.\n\nIf an organization is self-insured, as the four groups are, the administrator may get payments for contraceptives directly from the government, leaving the organization out of the process. Even when the administrator contacts employees who want contraceptives, it has to \u201cmake clear that the eligible organization is neither administering nor funding the contraceptive benefits,\u201d Judge Pooler wrote.\n\n\u201cViewed objectively, completing a form stating that one has a religious objection is not a substantial burden,\u201d she wrote.\n\nJudge Pooler compared the completion of the form to a conscientious objector\u2019s alerting the military to his position. \u201cThere must be some method by which the government can be notified of the objection,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOtherwise there is no way that the government can know which organizations it needs to accommodate. Here, the government has provided flexible, largely effortless and essentially cost-free options for notification.\u201d\n\nBecause the contraceptive coverage was provided under federal law, she wrote, the groups\u2019 argument that their completion of the form triggered contraception coverage was incorrect.\n\nBrigitte Amiri, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed an amicus brief in the case, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge victory for all the female employees who work at the organizations. The scorecard is really 7-0 in the Courts of Appeals on this issue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, said its lawyers were reviewing the decision.
