If we trash or pollute a creek upstream, it could affect downstream conditions as well.\n\nThat\u2019s why the newly proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency and Corps of Engineers to restore the coverage of the Clean Water Act is so important to Colorado\u2019s quality of life.\n\nFor more than 30 years, the Clean Water Act has helped to ensure that America\u2019s waters are clean, fishable and healthy. But a few years ago, a pair of Supreme Court rulings left more than 60 percent of America\u2019s streams without assured protection under the Clean Water Act. Specifically, the rulings brought into question CWA coverage for many smaller seasonal and headwater streams that may not flow year-round.\n\nColorado is a headwaters state and we understand that these headwater creeks, while small, are vital to the health of our watersheds, wildlife, and water supply. Their health shapes the condition of everything else downstream. They serve as the lifeblood of Colorado\u2019s recreation economy.\n\nIn Colorado alone, about 75 percent of rivers and streams-some 76,000 miles of waterways-are seasonal or ephemeral in nature and thus could fall outside the net of CWA protection, putting them at the mercy of filling and dredging operations, oil spills, toxic industrial waste and unregulated development.\n\nFor hunters, anglers and other outdoors enthusiasts, supporting the Clean Water Act is a no-brainer. Trout Unlimited is a science-driven organization, and it\u2019s clear that healthy headwaters mean healthy fisheries and better fishing and outdoor opportunities.\n\nIn the arid West, so many of our watersheds are characterized by these smaller headwater and temporary streams. They might not look like much, but they have immense biological and habitat value, including as critical spawning and rearing habitat for native trout. Even those that are at times dry play a critical role in the larger ecosystem.\n\nSome critics have raised fears that this rule is a federal power grab that would lead to heavy-handed regulation of every agricultural ditch and puddle. Those fears are unfounded. The move simply restores the original intent and longstanding practice of the CWA, leaving intact exemptions for regular farming activities.\n\nTrout Unlimited works closely with farmers, ranchers and landowners across the West, including here in Colorado, on projects that improve ranch operations and stream habitat. We understand the need to protect our agriculture economy-and that\u2019s true, as well, of Colorado\u2019s outdoor recreation industry, which generates more than $13 billion in consumer spending each year and directly supports 125,000 Colorado jobs. Our urban water supplies, too, depend on healthy watersheds that are fed by these headwater streams and creeks.\n\nAs Colorado and the region struggle with drought and water scarcity, it\u2019s never been more evident that all of us depend on clean, healthy sources of water.\n\nOur waters, large and small, are interconnected-and to pretend otherwise is to invite disaster. When we allow polluters to dump toxins or trash upstream waters, we can expect pollution and devastation downstream, in our most prized rivers and streams.\n\nLet\u2019s support the Clean Water Act\u2019s commonsense protection of our most precious heritage-our home waters.\n\nDavid Nickum is executive director of Colorado Trout Unlimited.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Why Colorado\u2019s headwaters matter", "title": "Why Colorado\u2019s headwaters matter", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/03/why-colorados-headwaters-matter/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140603__20140604_Z00_OP04G_NICKUMp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140603__20140604_Z00_OP04G_NICKUMp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T14:20:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:11:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac22\"", "article_summary": "Specifically, the rulings brought into question CWA coverage for many smaller seasonal and headwater streams that may not flow year-round.\nFor more than 30 years, the Clean Water Act has helped to ensure that America\u2019s waters are clean, fishable and healthy.\nFor hunters, anglers and other outdoors enthusiasts, supporting the Clean Water Act is a no-brainer.\nThat\u2019s why the newly proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency and Corps of Engineers to restore the coverage of the Clean Water Act is so important to Colorado\u2019s quality of life.\nOur urban water supplies, too, depend on healthy watersheds that are fed by these headwater streams and creeks."}
