Billy Jonas was an 8-year-old kid at a summer camp in Michigan when he fell in love with the sound of guitar, harmonica and buckets all coming together in harmony.

Billy Jonas The musician will perform at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Ventura Center for Spiritual Living, 101 S. Laurel St., Ventura. Tickets in advance are $20 adults, $18 seniors. Tickets at the door are $25 adults, $23 seniors. Call 643-1933 or visit venturacsl.org/node/1544. For information, visit http://ptgo.org.

“We would make music around the campfire, and I loved the neo-tribal embrace of that context,” recalled the Asheville, North Carolina, musician, now 50. “There was no thought involved; it was just a pure feeling of wonder, excitement and inspiration.”

From that initial experience, he wanted more.

“As I grew I realized that the intimacy of the folk song form would allow me to include other people,” Jonas said.

Today, the singer and songwriter is known as an interactive performer who makes music with innovative “found objects,” including buckets, water bottles, pots, pans and a 35-gallon industrial liquid container he uses as a bass drum.

Highlighting his clear tenor voice, Jonas’ CD, “What Kind of Cat are You?!” received multiple awards, including a First Place/Gold from the American Federation of Independent Musicians and a Parent’s Choice Gold. His videos have also earned acclaim, including Parents Choice Awards and a New York Times “Best” listing.

In 2010 he was invited to play at the White House.

“I always invite people to participate in one way or another, so my favorite instrument is the audience,” he said. “It’s all about accessibility and inspiring people … to feel invited and welcomed.”

On Saturday, Jonas will perform at the Ventura Center for Spiritual Living as part of a fundraiser to benefit the center and a local nonprofit, Performances to Grow On. The acoustic concert will feature original songs by Jonas, including music from his latest CD, “Build It Back Again.”

“I want to help (the audience) connect with something greater than their individual selves … through the joy of song,” he said. “I want to inspire them to pursue their own creativity — and have fun.”

Bonnie Rose, senior minister at the center, recognized Jonas’ talent when she first heard a recording of his song, “God Is In.”

“His lyrics can make you laugh, cry, think and fall in love with the absurdities of living,” said Rose, of Santa Paula. “I don’t know of any other songwriter with that kind of gift.”

Although it’s a fundraiser, “I think the immediate power of this event will be held in the sense of community it will bring forth,” Rose continued. “I like to imagine that many lives will be changed in small, subtle ways — ways that ultimately help make the world a better place.”

His performance is a great fit for the center, she added.

“We call ourselves a fun place for serious spiritual growth,” Rose said. “I am excited about the sense of community this event will bring — not to mention, it will be fun.”

Concert proceeds will help the center continue to provide services and events. Performances to Grow On, based in Ojai, was picked as the second beneficiary because of its focus on youths and its involvement in the Ojai Storytelling Festival.

“Performances to Grow On helps us get in touch with what is magical in life,” Rose said. “It’s a perfect fit for us because we believe that God is not limited to church but can be appreciated in all kinds of wholesome, heart-expanding activities.”

The Ojai nonprofit presents performances from various artistic and cultural traditions that are educational, imaginative and engaging, said founder Brian Bemel.

“We have a very large educational component for arts education, and the funds will be used to bring students from low-income schools to the storytelling festival,” said Bemel, of Ojai. “We believe that the arts are a powerful tool to bring people from diverse backgrounds together in community.”

Jonas believes music can happen anywhere, anytime, with anyone and anything.

“Recyclable and homemade instruments are a fun and integral part of making my music accessible and inspiring,” he said. “But the initial spectacle of the instruments becomes overshadowed by the energy, feelings and glorious sound generated by interaction with the audience.”
