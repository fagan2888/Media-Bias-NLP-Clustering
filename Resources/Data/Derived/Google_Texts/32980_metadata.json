There are some great deals to be had out there for sure. But the savviest shoppers know that getting those deals on the busiest shopping day of the year requires some serious prep work and strategy.\n\nRelated: Black Friday 2014 Comes Early: 7 Great Deals\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nONE: Start now.\n\nThe holiday decorations already adorning many favorite stores (some of which went up the moment Halloween was over) might be your first clue that the start of the holiday shopping season has steadily crept up earlier than Black Friday in recent years.\n\nMany of the biggest stores are already offering discounts this week that you can grab without worrying about the lines and crowds that will hit the day after Thanksgiving. Wal-Mart, for example, began its pre-Black Friday sales on Friday.\n\n\u201cBlack Friday is more of a season than a day now,\u201d said Matthew Ong, Nerdwallet\u2019s senior retail analyst. \u201cRetailers want to extend the whole holiday shopping extravaganza, so that they can squeeze more money out of a shopper.\u201d\n\nTWO: Make a plan.\n\nWrite down the people you need to presents for, along with gift ideas or a specific budget for each item. Having a written list makes you less likely to overspend or blow money on impulse purchases.\n\nRelated: 10 Unexpected Black Friday Deals\n\nThen see where you can get the best price for the items you need. The Black Friday circulars for most big retailers have already been \u201cleaked.\u201d You can find them on the site of your favorite retailer, or browse thousands of ads at BlackFriday.com/flyers.\n\nLook through them to see which stores are offering the best deals for items on your list. Then plan out which stores you\u2019ll hit, and in what order. That way you\u2019re more efficient and less likely to forget an important purchase.\n\nTHREE: Give up your email address.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer enough to \u201clike\u201d a brand or store on Facebook and follow them on Twitter. Your email address is valuable information to retailers, since it lets them market directly to you all year long. Signing up for their email list is your best bet for getting exclusive discount codes and printable coupons. \u201cEmail is still king for retailers,\u201d says Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation.\n\nIf you can\u2019t take the inbox clutter or don\u2019t want them to have your personal email, consider setting up a separate email address just for retailers and other \u201cjunk mail.\u201d If you use gmail, such correspondence often goes directly into your \u201cpromotions\u201d tab.\n\nRelated: November Deals to Know About Before Black Friday\n\nFOUR: Put your smartphone to use.\n\nShopping apps are vital to smart shoppers throughout the holiday season. Use PriceGrabber, which lets you price compare any item with a barcode, and Shopular uses geotargeting to notify you of deals at your favorite stores when you\u2019re near them. The app aisle411 provides searchable maps for more than 13,000 stores, so you can instantly find an item without wasting time scanning the shelves or trying to flag down a store associate.\n\nFIVE: Go online early.\n\nCyber Monday may still get all the attention online, but plenty of retailers make their Black Friday deals available online starting on Thanksgiving Day, or sooner. An Adobe analysis found that online prices would be lowest on Thanksgiving Day, with an average discount of 24 percent.\n\nBefore heading out to the stores, see if you can save yourself a trip by picking an item online. One note: You\u2019ll have to spend an average of more than $80 to qualify for free shipping. If your purchase amounts to less, the deal may not be worth it. See if the retailer has an in-store pickup option.\n\nBefore completing a purchase, do a quick search for online coupons. If you can\u2019t find any, see if the site offers a live chat instant message feature with a customer service rep, and ask him or her if they have a code that could help you. \u201cSometimes the operators are just sitting there with a list of coupon codes that they\u2019re ready to hand out to people who ask for them,\u201d said Kyle James, founder of Rather-Be-Shopping.com.\n\nRelated: 13 Great Holiday Office Gifts\n\nSIX: Be wary of the store credit card.\n\nOpening a store credit card often seems like an easy way to save 20 percent or more off a big purchase. Think carefully before you sign on the dotted line, however, since the inquiry can ding your credit score, and such cards often carry a high interest rate. The card may make sense if you shop frequently at the store and plan to pay off the balance right away. If you plan on applying for a mortgage or other loan in the next few months, however, this savings probably isn\u2019t worth it. Almost half of consumers who open a store credit card told Credit.com that they later regretted it.\n\nSEVEN: Price match.\n\nAs the retail landscape gets more competitive, more than 25 percent of big stores, including Wal-Mart, now price match their competitors, according to DealScience. Before making a purchase, see whether a product you\u2019d like to buy is listed for sale at a better price somewhere else. Show that price to a cashier, and chances are good he\u2019ll match it. Some credit card companies also offer price-matching guarantees that can protect you if you purchase an item that drops in price later in the season.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kicking off your holiday shopping on Black Friday (or increasingly, in the days and we", "title": "7 Ways to Get the Best Black Friday Deals Without Going Crazy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/21/7-Ways-Get-Best-Black-Friday-Deals-Without-Going-Crazy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_Black_Friday_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/21/7-Ways-Get-Best-Black-Friday-Deals-Without-Going-Crazy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_Black_Friday_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Kicking off your holiday shopping on Black Friday (or increasingly, in the days and we", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda534\"", "article_summary": "Related: 10 Unexpected Black Friday DealsThen see where you can get the best price for the items you need.\nCyber Monday may still get all the attention online, but plenty of retailers make their Black Friday deals available online starting on Thanksgiving Day, or sooner.\nLook through them to see which stores are offering the best deals for items on your list.\n\u201cBlack Friday is more of a season than a day now,\u201d said Matthew Ong, Nerdwallet\u2019s senior retail analyst.\nRelated: November Deals to Know About Before Black FridayFOUR: Put your smartphone to use."}
