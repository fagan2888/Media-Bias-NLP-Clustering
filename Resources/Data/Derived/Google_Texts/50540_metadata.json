That didn\u2019t do a lot for costs,\u201d Miller says.\n\n\"The [Affordable Care Act] did a lot with coverage and making sure people were covered. That didn't do a lot for costs.\" - Lawrence Miller, health care reform chief\n\nIf Vermont is going to tackle that cost problem, then Miller says it needs to eliminate the \u201cperverse incentives\u201d he says are driving up the cost of care.\n\nBlue Cross officials say the rising cost of care is responsible for about half the proposed increase. They blame higher-than-expected claims from people getting policies on the exchange during the first two years of Vermont Health Connect for the remainder of the hike.\n\nBut the rate request from Blue Cross for plans sold on Vermont Health Connect might not be as bad as it sounds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually quite good, compared to what we\u2019re expecting to see across the country,\u201d says Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy organization in Washington, D.C.\n\nPlans in Oregon are slated for average increases of nearly 30 percent, for instance. Al Gobeille, chairman of the Green Mountain Care Board, and a business owner himself, says the proposed rate increase from Blue Cross isn\u2019t sustainable in the long run. But he says rates are generally trending in the right direction.\n\n\"That's actually quite good, compared to what we're expecting to see across the country.\u201d - Cynthia Cox, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation\n\n\u201cTen years ago in my company I was seeing 15-percent rate increase. These are basically half that,\u201d Gobeille says.\n\nGobeille and Miller stress that the rate requests will now undergo a review process; the Green Mountain Care Board, as it did last year, might end up reducing those rates if it determines they aren\u2019t justified.\n\nGobeille says the state ultimately needs to bring rate increases in line with inflation. To get there, Gobeille says the state needs a successful payment reform initiative. He says the state also needs to do something about an underfunded Medicaid system. Every year, about $400 million in private insurance premiums are used to prop up government-subsidized insurance programs that don\u2019t cover the cost of care for patients covered by them.\n\nSo long as private insurance holders\u2019 premiums are used to subsidize government programs, Gobeille and Miller say it will be difficult to deliver rate relief.\n\nBetsy Bishop, executive director of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, says rate increases of the sort Blue Cross is proposing will hurt the business community.\n\n\"An 8-percent increase is not sustainable.\" - Betsy Bishop, Vermont Chamber of Commerce executive director\n\n\u201cWe need to understand what is driving the costs that are driving those premium rates for businesses. An 8-percent increase is not sustainable,\u201d Bishop says.\n\nBishop says one of the surest ways to lower those costs is to give companies a wider range of insurance products to choose from.\n\n\u201cAnd Vermont has a pretty strong track record for narrowing those choices for businesses and individuals,\u201d Bishop says.\n\nThe Green Mountain Care Board has 90 days to review Blue Cross\u2019 rate request.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "The state\u2019s two main health insurance providers are seeking a more than 8-percent increase in rates next year, and state officials say the requests", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "VPR News", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/vermont-health-connect-customers-likely-see-rate-hikes-higher-last-year", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/styles/medium/public/201605/health-costs-istock-simarik.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The state\u2019s two main health insurance providers are seeking a more than 8-percent increase in rates next year, and state officials say the requests", "title": "Vermont Health Connect Customers Likely To See Rate Hikes Higher Than Last Year"}, "story_id": 477852416, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@vprnet"}, "author": "Peter Hirschfeld", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Vermont Health Connect Customers Likely To See Rate Hikes Higher Than Last Year"}, "nid": 37859, "datePublished": "2016-05-12", "keywords": "Health, Health Care, Government & Politics, Lawrence Miller, The Vermont Economy, VPR News", "wordCount": 685, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The requests from Blue Cross Blue Shield and MVP will affect plans sold on Vermont Health Connect, and they\u2019re significantly higher than the increases that policyholders experienced last year.\nBut the rate request from Blue Cross for plans sold on Vermont Health Connect might not be as bad as it sounds.\nThey blame higher-than-expected claims from people getting policies on the exchange during the first two years of Vermont Health Connect for the remainder of the hike.\nThe Green Mountain Care Board has 90 days to review Blue Cross\u2019 rate request.\nThe state\u2019s two main health insurance providers are seeking a more than 8-percent increase in rates next year, and state officials say the requests underscore the need for comprehensive health care reform."}
