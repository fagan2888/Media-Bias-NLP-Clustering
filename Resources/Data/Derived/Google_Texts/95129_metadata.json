(AP) \u2014 Fifteen health and human services offices around Michigan would be closed or consolidated under a budget plan approved by a legislative conference committee.\n\nNine Michigan Department of Health and Human Services offices and six Michigan Rehabilitation Services offices would be affected under the plan approved Tuesday. Department spokesman Bob Wheaton says there will be no layoffs as part of the changes.\n\nWheaton says the department would still have a local presence in every county and the plan will allow more staff members to be in the field rather than in an office setting.\n\nThe state House and Senate are expected to give final approval to the plan along with other departmental budget bills by the end of next week.\n\nA list of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services offices around Michigan that would be affected under a proposed budget plan:\n\nHealth and Human Services closures or changes:\n\nAlger office\n\nMontmorency office\n\nPresque Isle office\n\nGenesee McCree office\n\nFort Wayne office\n\nRedford office\n\nGlendale/Trumbull office in Wayne County\n\nA centralized intake office in Kent County that\u2019s proposed to close, but that office does not see residents. Workers there field phone calls from around the state.\n\nAn office in Dickinson County would vacate one of its two floors.\n\nMichigan Rehabilitation Services impacts:\n\nOffices in Genesee, Isabella, Ottawa and Tuscola counties would close, along with two in Wayne County.\n\nDHS spokesperson Bob Wheaton told 24 Hour News 8 the centralized intake program in Kent County has been a success. He said it has led to an increase in reports and more consistent handling of cases. The Kent County location is the only intake center in the state. The proposal to close this location is financially motivated.\n\nWheaton said the state currently leases the facility. The state believes they can save money by moving the office to another location, such as building already being used or owned by the State of Michigan. The location has not yet been identified but it is possible it could remain in West Michigan.\n\n\u201cOut intent is to do our best to reassign centralized intake staff members to remain in Kent County,\u201d said Wheaton.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifteen health and human services offices around Michigan would be closed or consolidated.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "Fifteen health and human services offices around Michigan would be closed or consolidated.", "title": "Human services department to close, consolidate 15 offices", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2015/05/28/human-services-department-to-close-consolidate-15-offices/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/generic-department-of-humans-services-generic-dhs.png", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fifteen health and human services offices around Michigan would be closed or consolidated.", "title": "Human services department to close, consolidate 15 offices", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/generic-department-of-humans-services-generic-dhs.png?w=640"}, "creator": "@woodtv", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2015-05-28T18:01:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-29T19:20:57+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf969\"", "article_summary": "Nine Michigan Department of Health and Human Services offices and six Michigan Rehabilitation Services offices would be affected under the plan approved Tuesday.\nLANSING, Mich.
