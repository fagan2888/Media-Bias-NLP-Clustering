They have vowed to strip the funding for the EPA\u2019s efforts.\n\nClimate change may be just one of many issues, from immigration to government spending, where the administration will hit resistance from Congress, and Podesta acknowledged McCarthy may run into some bumps.\n\n\u201cWe face a challenge in Congress, but I think that is the result of other factors [than the climate change initiative]. But we\u2019re going to just have to deal with that,\u201d Podesta told POLITICO shortly before he departed the White House.\n\nOn top of the fight with Congress, McCarthy has drawn a backlash from more than a dozen states and resistance from the entrenched power sector \u2014 challenges not unlike the ones that former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius faced when rolling out Obamacare, another White House policy that threatened to upend a major slice of the U.S. economy.\n\nNevertheless, even many of her opponents agree that McCarthy is particularly well-suited for the job. She\u2019s no wallflower and often pulls laughs from even the most antagonistic crowds. Her history working for Republican governors like Mitt Romney and her straight-talking demeanor create an easy rapport with some of EPA\u2019s detractors, and her affinity for the details of regulatory policy can keep her grounded in the practical rather than the political issues.\n\nUnlike Sebelius, the former governor of Kansas who was chased out of her HHS position after the disastrous early rollout of the Affordable Care Act, McCarthy earned her policy wonk credentials at state environmental agencies in Connecticut and her home state of Massachusetts before she came to Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not somebody who wasn\u2019t in the field before they took a position like this,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think I\u2019m challenging to work for, because I make sure that everybody knows it as well as I know it, and I try to know it as well as the level below me knows it.\u201d\n\nObama unveiled his Climate Action Plan in 2013 after telling Congress in his State of the Union address that if lawmakers wouldn\u2019t address climate change, the administration would act on its own.\n\nThat main component of Obama\u2019s push is the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, a set of regulations built off the Clean Air Act that will drive the biggest change in the nation\u2019s power supply since Washington moved to end the utility industry\u2019s dependence on oil in the 1970s.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s regulatory efforts also provide leverage for the administration in its diplomatic efforts to reach an international pact at the Paris climate change summit late this year, showing that the U.S. is willing to take the same type of action at home that it\u2019s seeking from other nations.\n\nOpponents have ripped into EPA\u2019s plans, warning the power plant regulations would kill the coal industry, drive electricity prices up and put the power grid at risk of failing as the rules forced power plants offline. They warn that the agency is trying to do too much too fast and that the unintended consequences could be costly and long-lasting.\n\nStill, critics refrain from criticizing McCarthy. She wins praise from even EPA\u2019s staunchest opponents, including lawmakers from coal-heavy states, such as Kentucky Rep. Ed Whitfield, who said he has great respect for McCarthy.\n\n\u201cHowever, I completely disagree with her and this administration on their climate agenda and will continue to do everything I can to overturn these policies,\u201d the House Energy and Power Subcommittee chairman said.\n\nOther powerful agency opponents include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who made support of coal and attacking EPA a centerpiece of his reelection campaign in Kentucky last year, as well as Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, who has regularly targeted the agency and has accused it of collaborating with green groups to create overreaching policies.\n\nAnd Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who now heads the Environment and Public Works committee, has long butted heads with the EPA. He\u2019s accused the agency\u2019s \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d of making \u201cunreasonable assumptions\u201d about the state of climate change science. He\u2019s decried the Clean Power Plan, saying recently it would \u201ccost billions; it will increase our energy bills \u2026 [and] it still is not going to reduce the CO 2 emissions worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe Senate leaders have made it clear that they intend to go after EPA in appropriations later in the year. They\u2019ll hold votes trying to repeal the regulations once they are final, and there will be a barrage of bill amendments that aim for the proposals to suffer a death by a thousand cuts.\n\nIn the House, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the Science Committee chairman, has led much of the opposition to EPA, contending the agency hasn\u2019t been open with its scientific data.\n\nThe final power plant regulations that EPA will release this summer will generally leave it up to states to decide how to meet individual CO 2 reduction targets set by the agency. The plans are varied, and some of the proposed targets are likely to change in the final rule. Just last week, McCarthy hinted to utility commissioners that the agency is seriously reconsidering what cuts it will require by 2020. Many states have said EPA is asking for too much, too soon.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex undertaking, one that requires the agency McCarthy leads to get the technical details just right and avoid any legal mishaps, all while conducting a difficult, behind-the-scenes effort to apply political pressure to reluctant state governments.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order for the hard-charging McCarthy, whose accent is a quick tip-off that she hails from South Boston. Her husband and three grown children still reside there, as does her dog, Emma, and she often breaks out of the Beltway for weekends at home, where she loves bike rides around her Jamaica Plain neighborhood.\n\nMcCarthy came to EPA during Obama\u2019s first term to head the air office under previous EPA chief Lisa Jackson before undergoing a grueling confirmation fight to join the Cabinet. Prior to that, she worked under then-Gov. Mitt Romney in her native Massachusetts before heading up Connecticut\u2019s environmental agency.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really only one place to get any kind of real experience for running EPA,\u201d and that\u2019s by directing a state environmental agency, said Carol Browner, a Clinton administration EPA administrator and former Obama climate adviser.\n\nMcCarthy agrees her background is a major asset in running the agency that\u2019s not only responsible for the carbon rules but is developing proposals to cut ozone pollution, reduce methane leaks from oil and gas wells and expand EPA\u2019s reach over new waterways and wetlands.\n\nShe\u2019s steeped in the technical details and legal mechanisms of the carbon-cutting plan that would require states to lower the emissions from their existing power plants and force any new coal-fired power plants to use costly and still largely unproven carbon capture technology.\n\nBut she sees her role as turning the goals of the Obama administration into a workable policy more than directing her team on how to navigate the precedents of existing law.\n\n\u201cI tend not to read the rule language because I rely on the lawyers to make sure where commas go, but I really like reading the preamble because I think it\u2019s important for us to speak to everyday people about what it means, what the law tells us to do, what the science is, that we understand it, and how to apply it, and what that means to them,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI think it\u2019s enormously important.\u201d\n\nShe may be more policy wonk than politician, but McCarthy\u2019s begun playing a more visible public role to try to help sell Obama\u2019s environmental initiatives.\n\nIn the past month, she\u2019s talked climate change with X Games snowboarders in Aspen, delivered a speech about the threats posed by pollution at a World Health Organization meeting in Geneva and met with Pope Francis\u2019 top advisers at the Vatican.\n\nComplicating her task is the departure of Podesta, who exited the White House this month to join Hillary Clinton\u2019s nascent presidential campaign.\n\nPodesta was widely viewed as a key strategist at the White House, keeping the issue at the forefront of Obama\u2019s agenda and steering the release of the proposed rules last year. But it\u2019s McCarthy and EPA who must draft the regulations to fulfill the policies and implement the rules that will require each state to submit a plan to meet their carbon goals.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s a tremendous amount of work, and she\u2019s a great leader and she\u2019s got a great team working for her,\u201d Podesta said.\n\n\u201cI think what has made this effort successful to date, and obviously there\u2019s a ways to go, is that she\u2019s a great listener and [has] been all over the country talking to stakeholders, from governors to utilities to environmentalists to state regulators, and she incorporates that ability to listen into kind of practical solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House officials say they are in regular contact with the EPA administrator, although turnover in the West Wing has increased. In addition to Podesta\u2019s departure, acting head of the White House\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality Michael Boots is leaving after holding the position for the year since Nancy Sutley left the job.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got EPA\u2019s back here at the White House,\u201d said Dan Utech, a White House energy and climate adviser. Still, while it was Obama who directed EPA to cut carbon emissions from power plants, EPA is \u201cdriving the program in terms of the details,\u201d he added.\n\nSo far, 13 states have joined in a lawsuit filed by Ohio coal producer Murray Energy to challenge EPA\u2019s carbon rule-making in a state-federal battle that\u2019s not unlike the disputes around Obamacare.\n\nBut there are some crucial differences between the health care law and the climate change initiative, which could benefit EPA in the end.\n\nFor one, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act was a new law,\u201d said Browner, and the Clean Air Act is not.\n\nEPA has been implementing the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments for 25 years, and there\u2019s a long list of court decisions that has come to guide the agency, Browner said.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court has already issued several rulings in recent years that support EPA\u2019s power to regulate greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, and specifically to do so for power plants.\n\nBut it won\u2019t be easy to force some states to do what they don\u2019t want to do. EPA has taken over in the past when states balked at its pollution efforts, but never a program so complicated, and individually tailored to states\u2019 widely varied situations.\n\nFor Obama, who sees addressing the threats of climate change as a legacy issue, McCarthy is his closer. She\u2019s tasked with bringing the federal government\u2019s efforts to curb climate-changing pollution over the finish line and making sure they last into the future.\n\n\u201cI think we are now in a plan that\u2019s very mature, and that we are months away from delivering some of the major pieces,\u201d McCarthy said. EPA is due to release a trio of final greenhouse gas regulations \u2014 for existing, modified and future power plants \u2014 midsummer. \u201cSo I\u2019m incredibly confident.\u201d\n\nBut with Republicans in Congress preparing to put EPA and its regulations under the microscope in the coming months \u2014 and potentially using their control over funding for the agency to fight the rules \u2014 the political battle over the climate change policy is only beginning. And that\u2019s certain to put an even brighter spotlight on McCarthy.\n\n\u201cYou know, I learned a long time ago not to take these things personally,\u201d she said, asserting that she wasn\u2019t surprised by partisan battles. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the Hill a lot, and as long as I get treated with respect, I don\u2019t mind differing opinions, and I will always treat everybody else with respect.\u201d\n\nAnd while criticism on the Hill about Obama administration officials can veer into personality complaints, that\u2019s not the case with McCarthy.\n\n\u201cI was on a plane recently with half a dozen or so House representatives,\u201d some in leadership, Browner remarked. \u201cAnd they all without solicitation commented on how much they liked her. I think being liked is important\u201d for dealing with Congress, Browner said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so down to earth. She\u2019s just very reasonable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is in the forefront of President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda.", "title": "Obama's climate change wonk", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/barack-obamas-gina-mccarthy-climate-change-wonk-115372.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/20/150220_gina_mccarthy_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Carbon Emissions,Kathleen Sebelius,Energy,Climate Change,EPA,John Podesta,Environment,Gina McCarthy", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is in the forefront of President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe face a challenge in Congress, but I think that is the result of other factors [than the climate change initiative].\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s plan to combat greenhouse gases is entering its final lap, and now, with White House climate change hawk John Podesta gone, the baton has been handed to Gina McCarthy.\nHe\u2019s accused the agency\u2019s \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d of making \u201cunreasonable assumptions\u201d about the state of climate change science.\nFor Obama, who sees addressing the threats of climate change as a legacy issue, McCarthy is his closer.\nBut there are some crucial differences between the health care law and the climate change initiative, which could benefit EPA in the end."}
