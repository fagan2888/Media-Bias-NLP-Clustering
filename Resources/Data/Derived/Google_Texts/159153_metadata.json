This was while he spent those eight years actually living at the VA facility!\n\nThis story is curious in light of Phillip Longman\u2019s explanation for the VA wait-times scandal. Longman is the author of the book Best Care Anywhere: Why VA Health Care Is Better Than Yours that is partially to blame for the scandal.\n\nLongman claims the scandal isn\u2019t due to the VA but from failure by Congress to spend enough money on VA facilities with the most need. He states that the scandal\n\nresults from large migrations of aging veterans from the Rust Belt and California to lower-cost retirement centers in the Sun Belt. And this flow, combined with more liberal eligibility standards that allow more Vietnam vets to receive VA treatment for such chronic conditions as ischemic heart disease and Parkinson\u2019s, means that in some of these areas, such as, Phoenix, VA capacity is indeed under significant strain.\n\nHe argues that the standard of a maximum 14-day wait for seeing patients that the VA is supposed to meet might make sense in areas such as New England, but \u201ctrying to do the same in Phoenix and in a handful of other Sun Belt retirement meccas is not workable without Congress ponying up for building more capacity there.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Belt Isn\u2019t The Problem However, Brockton is not in the Sun Belt. Indeed, neither are many of the VA facilities that have had problems with wait-times.\n\nAdministrators won\u2019t address concerns that Congress and the administration don\u2019t have. The states that are generally considered to comprise the Sun Belt include Alabama, Arizona, California (Southern), Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. But even using a more expansive definition that includes Arkansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Virginia and Utah doesn\u2019t lend support to Longman\u2019s argument.\n\nFor example, the VA\u2019s Access Audit cleared a number of facilities of wrongdoing. But pages 38-40 of the audit list 81 facilities that require \u201cfurther review.\u201d Forty-one of those facilities are in the Sun Belt, while the other 40 are not.\n\nA review of Government Accountability Office and VA Office of the Inspector General reports that examine wait times shows a similar pattern. Examining reports from 2000-2014 that contained wait-time data on specific locales reveals 21 in the Sun Belt and 22 located elsewhere.\n\nBureaucracies don\u2019t get their funding from the people who are seeking their services. In short, the evidence shows that the problem is one that infects the entire VA system regardless of geography. Factors inherent in the VA cause wait-times, and not lack of money or migration patterns.\n\nYet Best Care Anywhere suggests this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Longman gives much of the credit for the great strides the VA supposedly made in improving care during the 1990s to its undersecretary of health, Ken Kizer. One of Kizer\u2019s reforms was pushing\n\nbudget and policy making authority away from the [Veterans Health Administration] central headquarters in Washington. As part of this decentralization plan, he created a series of twenty-two regional administrative districts\u2026Decentralization, combined with the VHA\u2019s state-of-the-art information systems\u2026meant that it became possible to hold regional administrators accountable for a wide range of performance measures.\n\nThe administrative districts\u2014called Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs)\u2014now number 23. According to the VA\u2019s Access Audit, 20 VISNs contained VA facilities that needed \u201cfurther review.\u201d So why were the administrators of the VISNs unable to stop wait times from proliferating?\n\nWhen In Doubt, It\u2019s Bureaucracy\u2019s Fault Bureaucracies behave in certain way regardless of how they are structured. Even if authority is dispersed, as it is in the VA, the administrators are still only accountable to Congress and the presidential administration since those are who provides the funding. If Congress and the administration believe the VA provides great healthcare\u2014as many of them did due to Longman\u2019s book\u2014they\u2019re less inclined to worry about wait times at the VA, if they hear about them at all. Administrators won\u2019t address concerns that Congress and the administration don\u2019t have.\n\nThe incentive to manipulate the data is much higher when manipulators can\u2019t be fired. Another problem with bureaucracies is they don\u2019t get their funding from the people who are seeking their services. In the private sector, those people are generally called \u201ccustomers,\u201d although in the healthcare sector they are usually referred to as \u201cpatients.\u201d If customers have to wait too long to receive a service from \u201cBusiness A,\u201d they will take their money to businesses that offer shorter wait times. Business A will see its revenues decline and either have to shape up or go under. Like most bureaucracies, the VA has no such \u201cfeedback loop,\u201d since the people seeking their services aren\u2019t the same ones paying for it. In short, there is no financial consequence for poor customer service.\n\nFinally, most government employees have a greater incentive to cheat, since most have civil-service protections that make it exceedingly difficult to fire them. In the case of the VA, many employees manipulated wait times data so their facilities appeared to meet the 14-day waiting standard. When employees have goals they can\u2019t meet and not meeting them means they don\u2019t receive promotions, raises and bonuses, the incentive to manipulate data is much higher when they can\u2019t be fired. We\u2019d like all people to be honest, even those who have civil-service protection, but the odds are on honesty going down the drain when there are few consequences for dishonesty. Thus, it\u2019s little wonder VA employees created false data on wait times.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 02 Jul 2014 06:26:57 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Veterans Affairs wait-time scandal has nothing to do with geography, and everything to do with bureaucracy.", "title": "Veterans Face Further Scandals If Bureaucrats Run Their Healthcare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4401962126_cabdd274db_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-03T06:44:57+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/07/02/veterans-face-further-scandals-if-bureaucrats-run-their-healthcare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The Veterans Affairs wait-time scandal has nothing to do with geography, and everything to do with bureaucracy.", "title": "Veterans Face Further Scandals If Bureaucrats Run Their Healthcare", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4401962126_cabdd274db_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Best Care Anywhere,Phillip Longman,Sun Belt,Veterans,Veterans Affairs,Veterans Health Administration", "published_time": "2014-07-02T06:26:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T06:44:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Veterans Affairs wait-time scandal has nothing to do with geography, and everything to do with bureaucracy."}, "article_summary": "Indeed, neither are many of the VA facilities that have had problems with wait-times.\nIn the case of the VA, many employees manipulated wait times data so their facilities appeared to meet the 14-day waiting standard.\nLongman claims the scandal isn\u2019t due to the VA but from failure by Congress to spend enough money on VA facilities with the most need.\nA review of Government Accountability Office and VA Office of the Inspector General reports that examine wait times shows a similar pattern.\nOne of Kizer\u2019s reforms was pushingbudget and policy making authority away from the [Veterans Health Administration] central headquarters in Washington."}
