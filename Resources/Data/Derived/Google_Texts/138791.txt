Pantex is on strike since a contract could not be negotiated between Consolidated Nuclear Security and the union.

As a taxpayer, I pay for the operation of Pantex (the employees’ wages and benefits) and would like to see the detailed proposal CNS has made, what the unions are demanding and be able to compare them to what the union members have now that caused the strike.

Why is this information not available to the public? Why are the conditions each side is seeking so hush-hush? In my opinion, these details should be part of the public record, but they are not.

All concerned parties speak in generalities and not specifics. One that has been mentioned is a 3 percent pay raise per year for the next four years. That is more than I get as a retired government employee, or even when I was working. What was in the old contract concerning wage increases? Also — increased employee cost for medical coverage? Welcome to Obamacare.

I think I just read about Randall County having to raise property taxes to cover its portion of the Obamacare mandates.

The American taxpayers foot the bill, so we should be privy to all the information (pro and con) concerning the contract proposal and demands of the unions. Do not speak in generalities; let us know the specifics.
