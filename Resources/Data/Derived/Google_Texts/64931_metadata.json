In recent weeks, both received letters signaling the township\u2019s intention to terminate them, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the cases.\n\nEach officer is entitled to defend himself at a departmental hearing, akin to a trial, where evidence will be presented, according to the law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the moves.\n\nSarni, 39, a 10-year veteran, could not be reached for comment. Pedana, 34, who has been on the force 13 years, did not respond to a telephone message left at his home.\n\nSarni is accused of returning to the scene of an emergency call after his shift ended to proposition a woman for sex, authorities told The Star-Ledger in October.\n\nThe officer was still in uniform when he drove to see the woman at an Extended Stay America hotel in the Raritan Center, the officials said. Sarni met the woman while responding to a disturbance there earlier in the night.\n\nThe woman rejected his advances and filed a complaint.\n\n\"She felt he was being inappropriate and using his authority as a police officer to coerce her,\" one of the officials said at the time.\n\nSarni was charged administratively with lying about the incident and engaging in inappropriate conduct, among other departmental counts.\n\nThe case against Pedana grew out of the department\u2019s biggest scandal in recent years: The arson and attempted murder charges against Edison officer Michael Dotro, who allegedly set his captain\u2019s home on fire in May of last year.\n\nLooking to determine if other officers had knowledge of Dotro\u2019s alleged plans, the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office seized cell phones belonging to numerous officers, Pedana among them.\n\nWhile the investigators found he was in no way connected to the fire, Pedana\u2019s phone contained text messages riddled with racial epithets, including some directed at other officers, the law enforcement officials said.\n\nSeveral of Pedana\u2019s colleagues, none of whom would speak for attribution, called him an exemplary cop who has shown no sign of racist behavior on the job. Nonetheless, the law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case said the text messages were too blatant to address with a lesser punishment.\n\nMayor Thomas Lankey, who has called reform of the department one of the top priorities of his first year in office, did not respond to a request for comment. Lankey serves as Edison\u2019s public safety director, responsible for all final decisions on hiring and firing.\n\nPolice Chief Thomas Bryan and the presidents of the department\u2019s two unions, the Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association and the Superior Officers Association, declined to comment.\n\nThe move to fire Sarni and Pedana continues a tumultuous run for the Edison Police Department, which has seen a drumbeat of misconduct cases in recent years. The charges against Dotro, however, are the most serious.\n\nAuthorities have said he was angry at his captain, Mark Anderko, for ordering him to undergo a psychological evaluation after the officer received his 11th excessive force complaint in a decade. Dotro allegedly set fire to Anderko\u2019s house while he and his family slept inside. All escaped unharmed.\n\nIn another offshoot of the Dotro case, two more Edison officers were criminally charged in late March with conspiring to help him retaliate against a North Brunswick police officer who had cited one of Dotro\u2019s relatives for drunken driving.\n\nPatrolman Victor Aravena, 42, and acting Lt. William Gesell, 45, were suspended without pay following their arrests. Aravena faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted. Gesell faces up to five years if convicted.\n\nThe lengthier sentence reflects the allegation that Gesell illegally accessed the department\u2019s database to collect information about the North Brunswick officer \u2014 a third-degree crime.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Edison cop charged with propositioning woman for sex after responding to 911 call\n\n\u2022 Lame-duck mayor in Edison draws fire for police promotions, $1M legal settlement\n\n\u2022 Prosecutor outlines trove of evidence against cop in firebomb attack on captain's home\n\n\u2022 Possible motive emerges in Edison cop's alleged arson attack on captain's home\n\n\u2022 Edison cop charged with attempted murder in firebomb attack on supervisor's home\n\n\u2022 Betraying the badge: Edison police produce astonishing record of misconduct\n\n\u2022 Law and disorder: Edison's police force plagued by infighting, lawsuits\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@middlesex-county','@mobile','@river','@starledger','edison','edison-police','middlesex-county','middlesex-county-prosecutor'", "title": "Edison police move to fire two cops over allegations of sexual misconduct, racist text messages", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Edison police move to fire two cops over allegations of sexual misconduct, racist text messages\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/05/edison_police_move_to_fire_two_cops_over_misconduct_allegations.html\", \"image_url\": \"\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13018019\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-05-25T11:32:24Z\", \"author\": \"Mark Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@middlesex-county\",\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"edison\",\"edison-police\",\"middlesex-county\",\"middlesex-county-prosecutor\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "creator": "@MarkJMueller", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Anthony Sarni was accused of propositioning a woman for sex.
