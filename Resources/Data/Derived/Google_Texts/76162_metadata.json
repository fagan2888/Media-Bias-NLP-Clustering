But the number of participating providers has grown sharply in recently years, and drug companies argue that some providers are not using savings and revenue from the program to improve care for the low-income populations the program was designed to help.Millions of dollars are at stake as HRSA revises hospital eligibility criteria, requirements for contract pharmacies and the program\u2019s definition of patient, which is currently described as a patient with an \"established relationship\" with the provider. Only those patients are supposed to receive the discounted drugs. The rule is currently under review at the Office of Management and Budget.\u201cSignals point to a reining in of the program and the most visible way for HRSA to do that is through the definition of \u2018patient,\u2019 \u201d said Billy Wynne, a partner at the lobbying firm Thorn Run Partners in Washington.In 2007, HRSA issued proposed changes to the program but never finalized them after receiving critical public comments. At that time, the Safety Net Hospitals for Pharmaceutical Access, a trade group for hospitals enrolled in 340B, expressed concern about a provision that required hospitals to document whether they expected covered patients to come back within a year.\u201cIt could be that (HRSA) will come out again with something similar,\u201d said Maureen Testoni, general counsel for the group.Hospital enrollment in the 340B program has nearly doubled, from 1,143 participating hospitals in April 2007 to 2,111 as of last month. Much of that growth stems from a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanding 340B eligibility to children\u2019s hospitals, free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers, and sole community hospitals.The drug industry-backed Alliance for Reform and Integrity is lobbying for a tighter definition of \u201cpatient\u201d that would require 340B providers to use savings directly for low-income and uninsured patients. Those providers would have to \u201cdemonstrate that the benefits of the program are going to the patients and not to other spending issues,\u201d says Stephanie Silverman, the alliance\u2019s spokeswoman.Hospitals note, however, that the 340B law allows them to use savings from the program to improve their overall financial and operational health to better serve all patients.Follow Jaimy Lee on Twitter: @MHjlee", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "New federal rules are expected soon that may narrow the reach of the drug discount program for hospitals that serve lots of low-income and uninsured patients.", "title": "Expected 340B drug discount rule may tighten program", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "New federal rules are expected soon that may narrow the reach of the drug discount program for hospitals that serve lots of low-income and uninsured patients.", "title": "Expected 340B drug discount rule may tighten program", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140515/NEWS/305159940", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140515/NEWS/305159940/AR/0/AR-305159940.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "New federal rules are expected soon that may narrow the reach of the drug discount program for hospitals that serve lots of low-income and uninsured patients.", "title": "Expected 340B drug discount rule may tighten program", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140515/NEWS/305159940/AR/0/AR-305159940.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140515/NEWS/305159940", "published_at": "2014-05-15", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140515/NEWS/305159940/AR/0/AR-305159940.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde09e\"", "article_summary": "The purpose of the 340B program is to help safety net providers stretch their resources.\nOnly those patients are supposed to receive the discounted drugs.\nThose providers would have to \u201cdemonstrate that the benefits of the program are going to the patients and not to other spending issues,\u201d says Stephanie Silverman, the alliance\u2019s spokeswoman.Hospitals note, however, that the 340B law allows them to use savings from the program to improve their overall financial and operational health to better serve all patients.Follow Jaimy Lee on Twitter: @MHjlee\nMuch of that growth stems from a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanding 340B eligibility to children\u2019s hospitals, free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers, and sole community hospitals.The drug industry-backed Alliance for Reform and Integrity is lobbying for a tighter definition of \u201cpatient\u201d that would require 340B providers to use savings directly for low-income and uninsured patients.\nThe rule is currently under review at the Office of Management and Budget.\u201cSignals point to a reining in of the program and the most visible way for HRSA to do that is through the definition of \u2018patient,\u2019 \u201d said Billy Wynne, a partner at the lobbying firm Thorn Run Partners in Washington.In 2007, HRSA issued proposed changes to the program but never finalized them after receiving critical public comments."}
