Syracuse (WSYR-TV) - Imagine losing a limb and then being told there were restrictions on how many times you can replace the prosthetic device that's allowing you to live a normal life?That's what's happening to thousands of New Yorkers, under the insurance available in New York State as part of the Affordable Care Act.Amputees are being told their insurance will not cover the replacement of prosthetic limbs.Linda Dixon lost her leg in a motorcycle accident two years ago."I ended up with a mangled leg and a dislocated shoulder at the time," says Dixon.At first she thought her life was over. Then, she was fitted with a prosthetic leg and she discovered she could do it all.Linda has already replaced her prosthetic leg twice. The clinical director at Syracuse Prosthetic Center says that's normal and, she will have to replace it again."This is something you wear 12 to 16 hours per day, seven days a week. They wear out," says John Tyo, clinical director at Syracuse Prosthetic Center.Tyo says the average lifespan of a prosthetic device is three to five years. He says by capping coverage at one prosthetic device, per limb, per life -- thousands of New Yorkers will be devastated."Our job would be impossibly difficult of trying to get people into normal lifestyles, if we could only fit one limb per lifetime. It would end up, we would not be able to fit patients," says Tyo.A number of agencies have started an online petition , with hopes of changing the "One limb for life" rule in New York.Linda's insurance covers her for now, but she turns 65 in February, and she'll be switching to a Medicare plan.As it stands now, she will not be able to replace her prosthetic leg once she switches plans."Changes need to be made and this petition needs to be signed," says Linda.NewsChannel 9 reached out to the state. The deputy director of the health department says:"We are aware of the issue and carefully evaluating and working on options to ensure that New Yorkers in need of prosthetics have the care they deserve, as well as that the state is in full compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations." -Marci Natale, Deputy Director, NY State Department of Health
