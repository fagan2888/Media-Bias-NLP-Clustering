Today show host Matt Lauer pressed Senator and now-presidential candidate Ted Cruz (R-TX) on whether the no-compromise style Cruz has developed as a dissenting senator could make the transition to the Oval Office.

“In your short-time in the Senate, you’ve developed a reputation as a guy who won’t back down,” Lauer said, noting Cruz’s intransigence has even angered members of his own party. “Will you bring that brand of no compromise to the White House?”



“I’ve never said I won’t compromise,” Cruz said.

“Shortly after elected, you said, ‘I don’t think what Washington needs is more compromise,'” Lauer objected.

“Because what Washington does often is compromise backwards,” Cruz said. “I’m perfectly happy to work with anyone…if they’re shrinking the size of government, if they’re turning around the debt, if they’re expanding liberty.”

Cruz contrasted this with the CRomnibus spending bill Congress passed last fall. “That’s not a good compromise, because it’s not fixing the problems in this country,” Cruz said.
