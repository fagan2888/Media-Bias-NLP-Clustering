Kaden, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a motor neuron disorder that affects muscle control, was confined to a wheelchair when he was just seven months old.\n\n\u201cAt home he doesn\u2019t have much room to explore, so we\u2019re there almost every day because, to Kaden, it\u2019s like his playground,\u201d Katie Myers told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s big and has smooth, concrete floors. It\u2019s his own accessible little paradise.\u201d\n\nOn this occasion, the other boy started to play and interact with Kaden, treating him not at all differently from how he would treat any other kid. The boy helped Kaden pick up a ball off the floor and turn a lever on an interactive exhibit, never once questioning what might be wrong with the child.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not used to someone seeing Kaden just for who he is and not for his disability,\u201d Myers told TODAY.com.\n\nSMA, a genetic disorder and the number-one killer of children under 2, will cause Kaden\u2019s muscles to progressively weaken. Capturing every moment she can with Kaden, Myers snapped a photo as her son put his hands above his head, something he normally cannot do.\n\nMyers posted the photo to Facebook and thanked the mystery boy for playing with her son. The photo received 10 million views.\n\nTo the little boy at the science museum, I don\u2019t know who you are, but thank you for being amazing. You let my son play\u2026 Posted by Kaden\u2019s Cure for Spinal Muscular Atrophy on Thursday, August 13, 2015\n\n\u201cTo the little boy at the science museum, I don\u2019t know who you are, but thank you for being amazing,\u201d she captioned the photo. \u201cYou let my son play and engage with you. You helped him pick up balls from the floor when you saw that he could not. You didn\u2019t ask what was wrong with him or why he couldn\u2019t walk, you just saw him. Kaden is a lot like you, he is very curious and wildly smart. He wants to know how everything works. Thank you for helping him turn the lever when you noticed he was too weak to do it himself. You will probably never see this but just by being you, you make this world better.\u201d\n\nShe woke up the next morning to see that her post had gone viral, with many likes, shares, and comments.\n\n\u201cWhen given the opportunity, kids see each other for kids,\u201d Myers told the Huffington Post. \u201cThey don\u2019t see any differences.\u201d\n\nThose with SMA have the disease in varying severity. Kaden has Type 2, which means that he is still able to sit up, but not walk or stand on his own.\n\nTypically, as SMA progresses, the ability to walk, stand, eat, swallow, and breathe can be affected. More than half of the babies diagnosed do not live to see their second birthday. One in 40 people unknowingly are carriers of the disease.\n\n\u201cEvery parent I have ever met has learned about SMA on the same day they were told their baby would die from the disease,\u201d Myers wrote Wednesday on the Kaden\u2019s Cure Facebook page. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay and hopefully things are starting to change.\u201d\n\nIn Kaden\u2019s case, he was born healthy. After doctors brushed off little issues, Myers began to seek answers on her own.\n\n\u201cI had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that something was seriously wrong and couldn\u2019t take \u2018new mommy syndrome\u2019 for an answer,\u201d Myers wrote on the Kaden\u2019s Cure website. She went online and read about SMA.\n\n\u201cI felt a part of myself die inside because every symptom and characteristic sounded exactly like our Kaden,\u201d she wrote.\n\nToday, Myers remains hopeful, working to raise awareness for the disease.\n\n\u201cHopefully doctors will stop feeding parents false information about the need to terminate pregnancies affected with SMA when they can\u2019t even predict its severity, or let nature take its course with the children that are here,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cThey will tell you that life with SMA in its most severe form is not a life at all, but in every one of these remarkable children, we see life, not lack.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cTo the little boy who started all of this, I\u2019m sure your parents have told you the impact you are making on this world. People are questioning the way that they view disability, and that is priceless.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI'm not used to someone seeing Kaden just for who he is and not for his disability.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cI'm not used to someone seeing Kaden just for who he is and not for his disability.\u201d", "title": "Viral Note From Mom Thanks Boy for Showing Kindness to Disabled Son", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150821_Kaden.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-27T14:56:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LnXiLH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cI'm not used to someone seeing Kaden just for who he is and not for his disability.\u201d", "title": "Viral Note From Mom Thanks Boy for Showing Kindness to Disabled Son", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150821_Kaden.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-28T03:01:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T14:56:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Katie Myers, Kaden's Cure, spinal muscular atrophy, viral note"}, "article_summary": "Though it may not sound like much, the young boy helped Kaden play with an exhibit.\nTo the little boy at the science museum, I don\u2019t know who you are, but thank you for being amazing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not used to someone seeing Kaden just for who he is and not for his disability,\u201d Myers told TODAY.com.\n\u201cWhen given the opportunity, kids see each other for kids,\u201d Myers told the Huffington Post.\n\u201cYou let my son play and engage with you."}
