The issue of illegal immigration has become a flashpoint in Louisiana\u2019s U.S. Senate race. (Photo: Eduardo Verdugo, AP )\n\nWith Election Day less than eight weeks away, candidates for Louisiana\u2019s Senate seat are working to prove they\u2019re tougher than their rivals on illegal immigration, a hot-button issue in the closely watched race.\n\n\u201cIt seems to resonate with folks I talk to,\u201d said retired Air Force Col. Rob Maness, a tea party favorite. \u201cIt comes up at every town hall. And we get standing ovations when I say that I\u2019m opposed to amnesty or a pathway to citizenship \u2014 every time.\u201d\n\nManess and others in the race, including Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, have ramped up their rhetoric on immigration, outlining their positions at town halls, online and on the air. Landrieu and Cassidy recently launched ads accusing one another of being soft on border security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of starting to catch the public\u2019s attention here,\u201d said Jeffrey Sadow, a political scientist at Louisiana State University at Shreveport. \u201cMaybe in an election like this where it\u2019s looking pretty close \u2014 then anything helps.\u201d\n\nImmigration became an even higher-profile issue in the Senate race after President Barack Obama\u2019s recent announcement that he will delay executive action on immigration reform efforts until after the November elections.\n\nLandrieu\u2019s opponents say Obama made the decision to protect her and other vulnerable Senate Democrats, several of them in the South.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama made his political calculation the other day, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Sen. Landrieu has supported his agenda in the past and needs to be held accountable or needs to be judged based off that support,\u201d said Ben Voelkel, communications director for the Republican National Committee in Louisiana.\n\nBut Bernie Pinsonat, a Louisiana pollster and political consultant, said Obama\u2019s delay probably won\u2019t help Landrieu. That\u2019s because Obama probably will take action on immigration before the Louisiana election is decided. Under the state\u2019s election system, if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote on Nov. 4, the top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff in December.\n\n\u201cIt certainly won\u2019t help her cause if there\u2019s a runoff,\u201d Pinsonat said. \u201cIf she\u2019s still running and the president does that, it\u2019s another cross to bear for Landrieu related to Obama. She\u2019s already got a head full of thorns.\u201d\n\nJosh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said Obama didn\u2019t want to \u201cinject\u201d an executive order into the \u201chyper-partisan, hyper-political environment shortly before the midterms.\u201d\n\nMark Krikorian with the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank that opposes legalizing undocumented immigrants, said any executive action by Obama before November would be \u201cChristmas in September\u201d for Republicans running against vulnerable Democrats, including Landrieu.\n\n\u201cI think that significantly limited his political maneuvering,\u201d he said.\n\nLandrieu and other vulnerable Democrats have distanced themselves from Obama\u2019s plan to take executive action on immigration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all frustrated with our broken immigration system, but the way forward is not unilateral by the president,\u201d Landrieu said in a statement. \u201cThe House needs to pass or amend the bipartisan Senate bill that would secure our borders and make reforms the business community needs to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nImmigration became more of a campaign issue in Louisiana this summer after federal officials reported that 1,275 unaccompanied children who had crossed the Southwest border illegally had been sent to Louisiana.\n\nImmigration is a particularly \u201cbad issue\u201d for Democrats in Louisiana, Pinsonat said.\n\nLouisiana, unlike Texas, doesn\u2019t have a significant Hispanic population that supports the comprehensive immigration changes Obama has proposed, experts say.\n\n\u201cRelaxing immigration laws, the way he\u2019s doing it, is not popular in Louisiana, period,\u201d Pinsonat said.\n\nConservative groups are attacking Landrieu and Cassidy on immigration, complaining that neither is tough enough. Sadow said he expects Maness will try to get the most mileage out of the issue.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so desperate to show that he\u2019s different than any other candidate,\u201d Sadow said. \u201cThat\u2019s something where he could... use his outsider credentials (to say) he\u2019s not part of Washington, which created this unworkable immigration regime.\u201d\n\nManess calls himself the true conservative on the issue, arguing that Congress and the administration should focus first on securing the border. He doesn\u2019t support programs that offer a path to citizenship for immigrants who illegally came to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe comprehensive legislation does much good,\u201d Maness said, offering the 2010 Affordable Care Act as an example. \u201cI believe we should take it one piece at a time, but only after we secure the border and enforce our laws.\u201d\n\nManess is particularly critical of Cassidy\u2019s positions on immigration.\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s his weakest area,\u201d Maness said. \u201cThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is running an ad for him trying to make him look strong on immigration... He\u2019s all over the map.\u201d\n\nThe ad launched last week features Cassidy calling the border a \u201cmess\u201d and claiming that Obama and Landrieu would make the problem worse because they support a citizenship option for undocumented immigrants. Cassidy and other Republicans refer to that prospect as \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI oppose amnesty,\u201d Cassidy says in the ad. \u201cWe must secure that border now.\u201d\n\nEarlier this summer, Cassidy and other Louisiana Republicans urged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, to call the Senate back from recess to vote on an immigration bill.\n\nIn July, Cassidy introduced legislation to speed up the deportation process for unaccompanied children who illegally entered the U.S. The bill has no co-sponsors and no action has been taken on it.\n\n\u201cThis highlights how President Obama\u2019s failure to secure the borders and properly enforce our immigration laws has impacted Louisiana,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement.\n\nLandrieu has begun running her own ad about her votes on legislation to increase patrols at the border, block measures offering undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship, and support funding for more fences at the border.\n\n\u201cOn border security \u2014 I\u2019ll put my record up against anyone, especially Bill Cassidy,\u201d Landrieu says in the ad.\n\nLandrieu also voted against Obama\u2019s request that Congress approve $3.7 billion in emergency funding to deal with the unaccompanied minors, saying it didn\u2019t include enough accountability.\n\n\u201cI cannot support spending significant taxpayer money without strong accountability and clear goals to ensure that we get the results we all want,\u201d Landrieu said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the proposal before the Senate does not go far enough to ensure that these children are reconnected in the countries of origin with safe and protective families.\u201d\n\nImmigration issues are expected to only become more of a flashpoint in the Senate race.\n\n\u201cThe question is, can Landrieu get out from under it?\u201d said Pinsonat. \u201cIf there is a runoff... it certainly will be something she\u2019ll have to deal with.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/state/2014/09/13/immigration-hot-issue-louisiana-senate-race/15586899/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "An issue that used to seem far away hits close to home in a competitive election campaign.", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "An issue that used to seem far away hits close to home in a competitive election campaign.", "title": "Immigration a hot issue in the Louisiana Senate race", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/state/2014/09/13/immigration-hot-issue-louisiana-senate-race/15586899/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An issue that used to seem far away hits close to home in a competitive election campaign.", "title": "Immigration a hot issue in the Louisiana Senate race", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2145be6d5f2a09de56d5768fa7c6962dfdc08b6/c=430-0-2571-2141&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Opelousas/2014/09/13/la.immigration", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1dba\"", "article_summary": "The issue of illegal immigration has become a flashpoint in Louisiana\u2019s U.S. Senate race.\nImmigration is a particularly \u201cbad issue\u201d for Democrats in Louisiana, Pinsonat said.\n\u201cThis highlights how President Obama\u2019s failure to secure the borders and properly enforce our immigration laws has impacted Louisiana,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement.\nLouisiana, unlike Texas, doesn\u2019t have a significant Hispanic population that supports the comprehensive immigration changes Obama has proposed, experts say.\n\u201cRelaxing immigration laws, the way he\u2019s doing it, is not popular in Louisiana, period,\u201d Pinsonat said."}
