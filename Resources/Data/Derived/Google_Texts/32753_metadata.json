He reached out to one of his best buddies, the king of right-wing radio: Rush Limbaugh.\n\nAccording to Sherman, however, Limbaugh turned down Ailes\u2019 offer to join the Fox News team, telling a friend at the time, \u201cRoger is really trying to get me to come back. Why would I do this?\u201d\n\nBeyond being close friends, Limbaugh and Ailes had worked together previously. From 1992 to 1996, Limbaugh had a syndicated TV show for which Ailes was an executive producer. Yet the shared history was evidently not enough to convince the talk radio legend to get in front of the television cameras once again and join the Fox News team.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Fox News' ratings sagging in 2006, Ailes hoped to reinvigorate his network by adding the talk radio giant", "title": "Book: Roger Ailes tried to bring Rush Limbaugh to Fox News", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With Fox News' ratings sagging in 2006, Ailes hoped to reinvigorate his network by adding the talk radio giant", "title": "Book: Roger Ailes tried to bring Rush Limbaugh to Fox News", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/13/book_roger_ailes_tried_to_bring_rush_limbaugh_to_fox_news/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/rush_limbaugh6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Fox News' ratings sagging in 2006, Ailes hoped to reinvigorate his network by adding the talk radio giant", "title": "Book: Roger Ailes tried to bring Rush Limbaugh to Fox News", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/rush_limbaugh6.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Fox News, Gabriel Sherman, Richard Nixon, Roger Ailes, Ronald Reagan, Rush Limbaugh, The Huffington Post, the loudest voice in the room", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbfe\"", "article_summary": "He reached out to one of his best buddies, the king of right-wing radio: Rush Limbaugh.\nAccording to Sherman, however, Limbaugh turned down Ailes\u2019 offer to join the Fox News team, telling a friend at the time, \u201cRoger is really trying to get me to come back.\nWhy would I do this?\u201dBeyond being close friends, Limbaugh and Ailes had worked together previously.\nFrom 1992 to 1996, Limbaugh had a syndicated TV show for which Ailes was an executive producer.\nYet the shared history was evidently not enough to convince the talk radio legend to get in front of the television cameras once again and join the Fox News team."}
