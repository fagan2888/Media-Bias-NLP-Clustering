Boehner ignored protests by the administration and Democrats, later calling the speech one that \u201cthe American people needed to hear, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nRelated: Netanyahu Congressional Appearance Courtesy of Big Donor Money\n\nThen Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), freshman Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and 45 other GOP senators sent an extraordinary open letter to Iran\u2019s leadership. They said that any deal struck with the Obama administration over Iran\u2019s nuclear program could be cancelled by a future president or Congress.\n\nCotton said he had no regrets about the letter despite the Democratic furor and added, \u201cIran\u2019s leaders need to hear the message loud and clear.\u201d Boehner, meanwhile, is leading a Republican congressional delegation to Europe and Israel this week to add support to Netanyahu\u2019s campaign to tank any nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell also cautioned other countries against entering into a climate control agreement with the U.S. that may be \u201cunattainable\u201d given the GOP-dominated Congress\u2019 determination to block it. \u201cConsidering that two-thirds of the U.S. federal government hasn\u2019t even signed off on the clean-power plan and 13 states have already pledged to fight it, our international partners should proceed with caution before entering into a binding, unattainable deal,\u201d McConnell wrote.\n\nRelated: Boehner, Heading to Israel, Slams Obama\u2019s Treatment of Netanyahu\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Senate has the constitutional authority to advise and consent on foreign policy and to ratify international treaties \u2013 but it is far less common for lawmakers to go over the president\u2019s head influence policy with foreign leaders.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 aggressive style stems in part from a profound disagreement with Obama over whether Iran can be trusted to keep an agreement that prevents them from developing a nuclear weapon that would threaten Israel and further destabilize the Middle East. It also stems from an ongoing feud between the two branches of government over Obama\u2019s extensive use of executive orders. He has weighed in on air pollution, immigration and other politically charged issues to circumvent congressional authority.\n\nAlthough 59 percent of Americans would like to see a deal with Iran that limits their nuclear capability, an equal number don\u2019t believe that any deal would stop them. Republicans say Obama has far exceeded his executive authority \u2013 while the White House says Obama had no choice, given the GOP\u2019s determination to destroy his programs and policies.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s statement yesterday closely followed Obama\u2019s announcement of an ambitious plan to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 28 percent over the coming decade. It was part of an international agreement brokered by the United Nations.\n\nRelated: 11 Things You Should Know About Mitch McConnell\n\n\n\nAdministration officials said that most of the carbon reductions that are closely linked to global warming would come from regulations already approved or proposed. Those include tougher fuel-economy standards for vehicles and proposed curbs on carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\n\nMcConnell, whose state of course has a large coal-mining industry and numerous coal-fired power plants, has vowed to block Obama\u2019s clean air initiatives. That includes, if necessary, torpedoing the nascent global warming accord. Earlier this month McConnell urged individual states to defy the EPA\u2019s proposed rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants \u2013 and he provided extensive legal research to help back up their case.\n\nSo far 30 countries responsible for about 60 percent of greenhouse gas emissions have made pledges to the United Nation\u2019s Framework Convention. Others may do so over the next seven months ahead of an international climate change conference in Paris on a proposed climate treaty. \u201cEven if the job-killing and likely illegal Clean Power Plan were fully implemented, the United States could not meet the targets laid out in this proposed new plan,\u201d McConnell said in his statement.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Given the diplomatic directives from the GOP-controlled Congress these days, Capitol H", "title": "Republicans Are Playing the Overreach Game on Foreign Policy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/Republicans-Are-Playing-Overreach-Game-Foreign-Policy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042013_mcconnell_boehner_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/Republicans-Are-Playing-Overreach-Game-Foreign-Policy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042013_mcconnell_boehner_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Given the diplomatic directives from the GOP-controlled Congress these days, Capitol H", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90de\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEven if the job-killing and likely illegal Clean Power Plan were fully implemented, the United States could not meet the targets laid out in this proposed new plan,\u201d McConnell said in his statement.\nThey said that any deal struck with the Obama administration over Iran\u2019s nuclear program could be cancelled by a future president or Congress.\nThose include tougher fuel-economy standards for vehicles and proposed curbs on carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\nOthers may do so over the next seven months ahead of an international climate change conference in Paris on a proposed climate treaty.\nIt also stems from an ongoing feud between the two branches of government over Obama\u2019s extensive use of executive orders."}
