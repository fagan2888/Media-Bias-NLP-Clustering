Federal payments through Medicare and Medicaid for electronic health records implementation hit $29.1 billion as of February, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently said, with $19.9 billion coming from Medicare and $9.2 billion coming from Medicaid. The amount is for incentives paid between January 2011 and this February.

The amount highlights how incentives have become a major income source for healthcare providers, as various government programs can either add or take away revenue from a health system's bottom line. In addition to showing meaningful use with electronic health records, hospitals are also earning credits or fines based on readmissions or hospital-acquired conditions. Some are even joining federal accountable care organization programs to share in the financial risk of value-based care.

[Also: These 779 hospitals actually scored Medicare bonuses]
