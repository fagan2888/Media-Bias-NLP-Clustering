Or, two middle-aged women go on a Hunter S. Thompson-esque drug-buying spree across an international border. And score.\n\nEpiPens used to be cheap\u2014just $35.59 wholesale in 1986. Harvie now pays $333 for a two-pack\u2014the only option (which, given an 18-month-from-manufacture shelf life, ensures waste and risks reliance on an expired device).\n\nWell, maybe the trip is more phlegmatic Fred Thompson than gonzo Hunter S. And maybe we scarf grilled veggies and espresso instead of cocaine and booze (although rum will enter the picture), but we do cop drugs.\n\nThe adventure began with a rant: \u201cThe last time I bought an EpiPen, it cost $60, and that was too much. Now it\u2019s $380. You\u2019re a reporter. Look into this.\u201d My marching orders came from Mary, a friend whose drugs aren\u2019t covered by insurance. Allergic to bees, she could die of anaphylactic shock if stung. Millions of kids and adults are similarly vulnerable\u2014peanuts, stings, various meds can swell shut their airways. Their lives may depend on a pen-shaped, plastic delivery device for self-injecting a quickacting dose of epinephrine.\n\n\u201cIf you balk at the price, you\u2019ll be muttering, \u2018I wish I\u2019d bought it,\u2019 as you breathe your last,\u201d growls Mary. \u201cThe extortionate price is a drop in the bucket of what\u2019s wrong with healthcare.\u201d\n\nActually, it pretty much sums up the whole rotten bucket. First synthesized in 1904, epinephrine, aka adrenaline, is now a dirtcheap generic. If your doctor prescribed it, says Vermont pharmacist Rich Harvie, you could buy a pre-loaded syringe of epinephrine for under $20. But the more foolproof delivery device\u2014the pen in EpiPen\u2014was patented in 1977, meaning that Mylan, the U.S. marketer, and Pfizer, the manufacturer, have a license to gouge. An EpiPen\u2019s price, says Harvie, \u201cis ridiculous, just awful.\u201d And since it requires a prescription in the United States, a doctor\u2019s visit can boost the cost.\n\nEpiPens used to be cheap\u2014just $35.59 wholesale in 1986. Harvie now pays $333 for a two-pack\u2014the only option (which, given an 18-month-from-manufacture shelf life, risks waste and reliance on an expired device).\n\nWhat makes life-and-death EpiPens a poster child for Big Pharma greed is that the industry\u2019s usual excuses for exorbitant pricing don\u2019t apply. R&D costs? The delivery system was developed on the taxpayers\u2019 dime by military/NASA engineer Sheldon Kaplan (who never got a penny in royalties) to inject atropine to counter battlefield nerve gas. Minor modifications suited it to epinephrine. Educational/marketing costs? Every doctor already knows about EpiPens. A limited customer base? With allergies on the rise and millions of EpiPens sold globally, economy of scale is built in, and a repeat market is guaranteed by quick expiration and dire need. EpiPen earned Mylan a tidy $640 million in 2012, the New York Times reported.\n\nIt is not only brand-name and patented drugs that escalate U.S. healthcare costs. A variety of U.S. generics\u2014whether from coincidence or collusion\u2014cost consumers similarly high prices. \u201cI\u2019ve seen all the generic [drug] companies raise prices the same 500 percent overnight,\u201d says Harvie.\n\nI tried repeatedly to talk to Pfizer and Mylan to ask why their device costs $360 to $435 retail, but no one would actually speak to me, and all I could extract were emails regurgitating PR gruel.\n\nSo back to our excellent adventure. We entered Canada from Vermont via a tiny border crossing and headed to Sutton, Quebec. Hunter S. would have sneered at our bistro lunch and stroll past tr\u00e8s charmant tourist shops to Pharmacie Mario Milot & Mathieu B\u00e9lisle. \u201cI\u2019d like to buy an EpiPen,\u201d I told the pharmacist. \u201cHave you a prescription, madam?\u201d M. Milot asked. \u201cBut I was told it was over-the-counter.\u201d \u201cYes, but without [an insurance-backed] prescription, it will be so extremely expensive: US $94.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate my pyrrhic victory, I bought a bottle of U.S.-embargoed Cuban rum, stuck it under the drugs and smoked duck, and passed through U.S. customs. I thought of the nice Canadian pharmacist\u2019s sadness at my having to fork out $94\u2014until I told him how much more EpiPens cost only 10 miles south. \u201cBut why?\u201d he asked. Good question, monsieur.\n\nI\u2019ll go out on a limb and say greed, or, as a pharma-shill stoned enough on samples to be honest would admit: \u201cWhatever the market will bear,\u201d or \u201cBecause we can, suckers.\u201d And if people are forced to rely on expired EpiPens, or do without? Well, that\u2019s the way the U.S. healthcare system\u2014and the peanut-allergic kid\u2014crumbles.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/16951/anaphylactic_sticker_shock", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/Allen_epipen.web__500_350_s.jpg", "description": "Road trip!
