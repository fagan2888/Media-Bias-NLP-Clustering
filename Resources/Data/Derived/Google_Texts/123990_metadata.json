During the two-year implementation period, overall hip replacement surgery rates at the 5 clinics dropped 26 percent compared to the rates of similar patients during two years before implementation, while knee replacement surgery rates fell by 38 percent.\n\nThanks in part to fewer hospitalizations, inpatient days and prescriptions, the adjusted average total costs for patients with hip osteoarthritis dropped 21 percent during 180 days after implementation and knee osteoarthritis patient costs dropped 12 percent.\n\nKey to the program's success was support from senior leaders and clinic leaders who considered routine use of decision aids mandatory. Group Health also recognized the difficulty in using decision aids in life-threatening, time-sensitive cases and therefore focused the program on elective joint replacement surgery, the AHRQ report noted.\n\nThe shared decision making program also benefited from friendly competition among service line leaders, clinic leaders and individual providers, as monthly feedback showed their performance versus peers.\n\nHowever, implementing shared decision making isn't as easy as it sounds, according to a February study by the RAND Corporation and Informed Medical Decisions Foundation. The study cited time-pressed physicians, lack of training about shared decision making and inadequate IT systems as major barriers, FierceHealthIT previously reported.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the AHRQ report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy: Narratives can play role in patient decision making\n\nBusy docs, inadequate IT systems hinder shared decision making\n\nEmotions shape medical decision making\n\nCDS tool cuts inappropriate heart imaging tests\n\nShared decision making bumps up hospital costs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Group Health, an integrated system in Seattle saw significant drops in elective surgery rates and costs by distributing decision aids and engaging in shared decision-making conversations with patients, according to an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Group Health, an integrated system in Seattle saw significant drops in elective surgery rates and costs by distributing decision aids and engaging in shared decision-making conversations with patients, according to an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report.", "title": "Shared decision making lowers elective surgery rates, costs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/shared-decision-making-lowers-elective-surgery-rates-costs/2013-09-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Agency for Healthcare Reseach and Qualit (AHRQ),Decision Aids,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,shared decision-making", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29da\"", "article_summary": "The study cited time-pressed physicians, lack of training about shared decision making and inadequate IT systems as major barriers, FierceHealthIT previously reported.\nHowever, implementing shared decision making isn't as easy as it sounds, according to a February study by the RAND Corporation and Informed Medical Decisions Foundation.\nFor more:- here's the AHRQ reportRelated Articles:Study: Narratives can play role in patient decision makingBusy docs, inadequate IT systems hinder shared decision makingEmotions shape medical decision makingCDS tool cuts inappropriate heart imaging testsShared decision making bumps up hospital costs\nDuring the two-year implementation period, overall hip replacement surgery rates at the 5 clinics dropped 26 percent compared to the rates of similar patients during two years before implementation, while knee replacement surgery rates fell by 38 percent.\nThe shared decision making program also benefited from friendly competition among service line leaders, clinic leaders and individual providers, as monthly feedback showed their performance versus peers."}
