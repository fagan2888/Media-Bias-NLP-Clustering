But, he is also contemplating the leadership of another movement\u2014to reconnect Blacks and the civil rights agenda with the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that, you\u2019ve seen it with my outreach to (Newt) Gingrich and (Grover) Norquist and (Virginia) Governor Bob McDonnell on criminal justice reform issues. The reality is that as a people, we were most effective in pushing our agenda when we had one agenda that was shared between Black members of both parties,\u201d Mr. Jealous said in an exclusive interview with the Trice Edney News Wire. \u201cAnd so we\u2019ve got to get back to civil rights having a beachhead in both parties and there being a common civil rights agenda that is shared and is held in common by Black Democrats and Black Republicans.\u201d\n\nListing a string of elected Republicans with whom he has found common ground, Mr. Jealous says he sees signs that this movement could be successful.\n\n\u201cIt has been very hard sometimes in these partisan times, but we have found allies in unlikely places,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernor Deal in Georgia is helping to downsize prisons. So is Rick Perry in Texas. Gov. Kasich in Ohio is a big proponent of affirmative action for the business sector. Gov. McDonald of Virginia has been proponent of second chances, both in employment and in voting. And the question is, if a Republican can stand for any of this anywhere, then why can\u2019t they stand for all of this everywhere? So, I think it\u2019s important that we get back to doing what (Congresswoman) Shirley Chisholm admonished all of us and that is, \u2018We have no permanent friends. We have no permanent enemies. We just have permanent interests.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOutgoing NAACP leader Ben Jealous wants to make civil rights a bi-partisan issue. Photos: Richard B, Muhammad\n\nMr. Jealous, a Rhodes Scholar who in 2007 became the youngest person ever to lead the NAACP, pointed to this agenda as one of the possible goals of a political action committee (PAC) that he started with two friends 6 years ago in 2007 to help fund then Sen. Barack Obama in his primary stages. In addition to a new teaching job at a university, Mr. Jealous and those friends\u2014who he identified as Steven Phillips and Andrew Wong\u2014will revisit that \u201cVote Hope\u201d PAC with major questions in mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to figure out whether or not now is the time that we can succeed in building a super PAC that will accelerate the breaking of state level glass ceilings of candidates of color across the South and Southwest,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time that we can finally create the equivalent of Emily\u2019s List for people of color candidates with a real eye toward transformations that we think are possible in the South and the Southwest \u2026 breaking glass ceilings in those states in the former Confederacy and on out to California, and with progressives retaking the South, perhaps permanently.\u201d\n\nEmily\u2019s list is a PAC founded in 1985 with a goal of electing pro-choice Democratic women to public office. Mr. Jealous says the PAC he envisions would include Republican and Democratic candidates. In recent history, the Democratic Party has been able to claim an overwhelming majority of the Black vote, consistently more than 90 percent in presidential elections. While Democrats are largely credited with civil rights gains, Mr. Jealous says many of the major gains of the 50s and 60s came about because of bi-partisan cooperation because of Blacks in both parties.\n\nHe recently expounded on his vision during an Aug. 26 forum sponsored by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation\u2019s America Healing initiative, reflecting on the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington.\n\n\u201cWe have to, as a civil rights community, really think deeply\u2014not just about how we build bonds amongst each other\u2014but how we, frankly, reintroduce civil rights to the Republican Party, which for a hundred years was the party of civil rights in many ways,\u201d he told the audience at the Washington, D.C.-based Newseum, where the forum was held.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that if we, in the next 50 years, would get a little bit more sophisticated about how we work our politics, if we in the next 50 years could be a little bit more inspired, quite frankly by our grandparents and lessons that they understood very well. If we can get back to a place where civil rights is a little bit less partisan,\u201d he added, \u201cthen we can move forward even faster than we think is possible.\u201d\n\nAlthough he believes civil rights must be universal, he says Blacks will have to initiate the movement.\n\n\u201cI think, quite frankly, the first courageous step is going to have to be with us saying that we\u2019re going to have the hope to even talk to the other side of the aisle,\u201d he told the forum audience. \u201cBecause right now, we reinforce the isolation of our own agenda in ways that may be expedited in the short term, but detrimental in the long term.\u201d\n\nHis fellow civil rights leaders, still basking in the aftermath of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, expressed shock at the announcement of his resignation.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton issued a statement:\n\n\u201cBen Jealous has operated with integrity and a real sense of hands-on activism. Not only was he able to revive the NAACP and raise its budget to higher heights, he joined us in the streets in real civil rights activity on the ground. From the \u2018suites to the streets\u2019 he will be missed as head of the NAACP, but I am sure he will not leave us in his contribution to the struggle.\u201d\n\nNAACP Chair Roslyn Brock praised Mr. Jealous for his successes in a telephone press conference. She also issued a statement: \u201cUnder his leadership, the NAACP has built a highly competent staff that will carry our mission forward and meet the civil-rights challenges of the 21st century. Our board, staff and volunteer leaders throughout the country deeply appreciate his sacrifice and will continue to implement our game-changing goals for the next half century that include the restoration of Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, implementing Trayvon\u2019s Law, bolstering civic-engagement efforts and ensuring our community is enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\u201d\n\nMr. Jealous also said in the interview that he is pleased with his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most proud of is that I leave the organization bigger, stronger, more powerful and more financially sustainable and with a clear set of priorities for the next half century,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, like every NAACP leader, I leave here passing a baton on to the next person to help finish a race that will go on for a very long time. But I leave here knowing that we are better prepared to finish that race than we have been in a very long time.\u201d\n\nHe hints at his desire to exacerbate the finish of that race\u2014just from a new venue.\n\n\u201cProfessionally, I\u2019m very clear I\u2019m going to go teach,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, it\u2019s very clear I need a lot more time at home to be Dad. Politically, I\u2019m walking in with a question, which is, \u2018Can this be done? Can we create a big, robust PAC that is ultimately funded from the grassroots to help accelerate the careers of transformative candidates of color?\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba30\"", "article_summary": "But, he is also contemplating the leadership of another movement\u2014to reconnect Blacks and the civil rights agenda with the Republican Party.\nThe Final Call | National NewsJealous leaving NAACP to seek GOP allies for civil rights and to build a Super PACBy Hazel Trice Edney | Last updated: Sep 23, 2013 - 9:55:01 AMWhat's your opinion on this article?\nWe just have permanent interests.\u2019 \u201dOutgoing NAACP leader Ben Jealous wants to make civil rights a bi-partisan issue.\nMr. Jealous says the PAC he envisions would include Republican and Democratic candidates.\nWhile Democrats are largely credited with civil rights gains, Mr. Jealous says many of the major gains of the 50s and 60s came about because of bi-partisan cooperation because of Blacks in both parties."}
