At first glance, he looks like any other American teenager in his neon yellow Adidas T-shirt, tan pants and Nike high-tops.\n\nBut this building belongs to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And, according to the government, Josue and the other teenagers in the courtroom are foreign-born children charged with violating immigration law.\n\nThey\u2019re at the mercy of the Omaha Immigration Court, where a judge eventually will decide whether they can stay or be deported.\n\nAnderson goes through case after case: Juan of Guatemala is living with his uncle in Schuyler, Neb. His attorney said he\u2019s seeking SIJ status\u2014Special Immigrant Juveniles, a program through which foreign children who\u2019ve been abused, neglected or abandoned can get green cards and work in the U.S. permanently. Another hearing is scheduled for Juan later this year.\n\nNext up is Edgar, 18, from El Salvador but now living with his uncle in Waterloo, Iowa. He\u2019s also seeking SIJ status. His case was postponed to October.\n\nThen comes Benedicto, 18, of Guatemala. His case is also postponed until October.\n\nAs the children go before the judge, Josue\u2019s mother periodically looks over at her son and smiles. The four young girls with them get antsy as the hearings drag.\n\nFinally, Josue has his turn. He walked across the southern border through Texas two months ago. His attorney says Josue is asking that his case be consolidated with his mother\u2019s asylum case. The attorney for the government searches for her case number. The attorney asks for a continuance until September. It\u2019s granted.\n\nJosue\u2019s hearing takes all of about 10 minutes\u2014just another routine case for the judge, the translator and the government attorney. But to Josue, it\u2019s anything but routine.\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Josue, 13, was one of many foreign children who appeared in Omaha Immigration Court on Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Josue, 13, was one of many foreign children who appeared in Omaha Immigration Court on Tuesday.", "title": "A Look Inside One of America's Immigration Courts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140813_ImmigrationTrial.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-14T16:08:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1t4hWqZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Josue, 13, was one of many foreign children who appeared in Omaha Immigration Court on Tuesday.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140813_ImmigrationTrial.jpg"}, "title": "A Look Inside One of America's Immigration Courts", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2014-08-15T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T16:08:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "immigration, undocumented children, border crisis, illegal immigrants, central america, central american violence"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4c1\"", "article_summary": "And, according to the government, Josue and the other teenagers in the courtroom are foreign-born children charged with violating immigration law.\nThey\u2019re at the mercy of the Omaha Immigration Court, where a judge eventually will decide whether they can stay or be deported.\nAnderson goes through case after case: Juan of Guatemala is living with his uncle in Schuyler, Neb.\nJosue\u2019s hearing takes all of about 10 minutes\u2014just another routine case for the judge, the translator and the government attorney.\nJosue, 13, sits in the front row with his mother and two young sisters and three friends of the family."}
