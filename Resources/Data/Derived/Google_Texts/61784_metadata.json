It\u2019s clear they recognized that the Branstad/Reynolds administration was trying to do too much, too fast and failing to protect vulnerable Iowans.\n\nBut Iowa still isn\u2019t ready. Since the delay by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) more than 40 days ago, we have seen no evidence that the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise and the out-of-state companies picked to help privatize Medicaid have taken the steps necessary to ensure the health and well being of more than 560,000 Iowans.\n\nThe concerns CMS expressed about Iowa\u2019s Medicaid privatization in December are equally valid today. They include:\n\n\u2022Arbitrary and unrealistic implementation timeline\n\n\u2022Failure to establish adequate provider networks in advance\n\n\u2022Disruptions of longstanding patient-provider relationships\n\n\u2022Diminished quality and access to health care services\n\n\u2022Compromised patient care\n\n\u2022Inadequate communication with patients and providers\n\nWe\u2019re also worried about media reports regarding fraud and mismanagement by the Managed Care Organizations selected for Iowa that have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.\n\nFor all these reasons, we are calling on President Obama and other key federal officials to deny Iowa\u2019s application to establish a statewide private managed care system for Medicaid. Instead, Iowa should continue improving patient outcomes, increasing access to care and making the existing public management of Medicaid more efficient.\n\nSTATE SEN. DICK DEARDEN, D-Des Moines, represents District 16 in the Iowa Senate. The district includes east Des Moines and Pleasant Hill. He can be reached at dick.dearden@legis.iowa.gov or 262-1203.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1SNCkf7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "State Sen.
