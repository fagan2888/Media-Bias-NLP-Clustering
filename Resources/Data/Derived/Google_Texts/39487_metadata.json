Her voice is warm, her acting gently winning. Physically, she even evokes the star who proved the quintessential Maria, Julie Andrews.\n\nThe opera company has come down from its mountain home to bring the Austrian Alps to Denver. Last summer, Central City brought the \u201cShow Boat\u201d to the Buell Theatre.\n\nAt the Ellie Caulkins Opera House through Aug. 10, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein\u2019s most enduring musical (and that\u2019s saying something) hits consistently high notes for a family adventure in theater-going.\n\nElegantly staged, the show, opens with beckoning beauty. Candles flicker as the nuns of Nonnberg Abbey sing their evening vespers. When they rise and hold hands, one of them nearly stumbles into a gap. Someone appears to be missing. Again.\n\nIt hardly makes sense to give you rundown of \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t know about the lively young woman from the nearby mountains who may not be cut out for the cloistered life but makes a wonderful governess for Baron Von Trapp\u2019s mischievous youngsters?\n\nSo many of us know the songs that feel like they will be sung for a thousand years, starting with the titular \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d dropping into the valley of \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and soaring upward with \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain.\u201d Oh yes, and then there\u2019s \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen,\u201d \u201cThe Lonely Goatherd,\u201d \u201cDo-Re-Mi.\u201d You\u2019re unlikely to be disappointed.\n\nInstead, the divide here between musical theater and opera occasionally widens around acting. The three nuns who sing \u201cMaria\u201d are good but not quite hilarious.\n\nThose who bridge the two well include: Mezzo-soprano Maria Zifchak as the Mother Abbess; Robert Orth as \u201cUncle\u201d Max, the mostly lovable opportunist who wants the children to perform at the Kaltzberg Festival; and Lucy Schaufer as von Trapp\u2019s cosmopolitan paramour, Frau Schraeder.\n\nThe actors performing the von Trapp young\u2019uns are a charming bunch. Ian O\u2019 Brien brings a lovely tenor to Rolf, the messenger whom Liesl (the very good Julie Tabash) grows increasingly fond of.\n\nBaritone Troy Cook performs the Austrian naval hero with the expected ramrod mien. Only one wished his fine baritone was more supple. It is the singing that gives Captain von Trapp away as someone more tender than tyrannical.\n\nFresh off of death-watch duty with Central City\u2019s superb \u201cDead Man Walking,\u201d Ken Cazan directs with family-pleasing zest.\n\n\u201cNo one gets stabbed,\u201d a man said approvingly to his wife during intermission. True, but the backdrop is the rise of Hitler\u2019s Third Reich.\n\nAnd for those who don\u2019t want to repress that dark shadow, Cazan has staged a subtly wise, aptly uncomfortable scene transition from Captain von Trapp being given a German commission and the night the Von Trapp Family Singers compete at the concert hall where the family will make their exit from Austria.\n\nThe von Trapp house gives way to the festival where soldiers stand guard. In the Ellie the huge, unfurled Nazi banner has disquieting heft. The audience is invited to join the baron in his mournful and defiant rendition of \u201cEdelweiss.\u201d\n\nOn opening night, many accepted the invitation.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\n\u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d 3.5 stars.
