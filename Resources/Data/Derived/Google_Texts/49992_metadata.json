But colorblindness isn\u2019t the answer. Color isn\u2019t the problem. Racism is the problem. And being conscious of racism is the solution.\u201d\n\nCoates explains in his latest piece for The Atlantic, \u201cThe Cost of Reparations,\u201d that white supremacy did not end with the abolition of slavery, but was instead adapted for later generations through waves of socioeconomic policy that connsistently left African-American communities having to catch up even when the policies were hailed by progressives.\n\nFor example, he told Moyers, the implementation of Social Security originally excluded domestic workers, the majority of whom were African-American. Though Black workers were later allowed to join the Social Security system, Coates said, that delay \u201cinjured\u201d thousands of them in a way similar to that caused after many Southern states refused to expand their Medicare programs as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it gets fixed will not close the gap,\u201d Coates said. \u201cSo the question becomes: why do we keep doing that? Why do we look at a map of \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 as they say, where Medicare expansion has gone through and where it hasn\u2019t and why do we see this swath of the country that\u2019s identical to where we had plantation slavery?\u201d\n\nFor that reason, Coates said, he was not asking Moyers or white people to see themselves as \u201censlavers\u201d when reading the Atlantic piece, but rather to consider how many freedoms Americans currently enjoyed stemmed from institutionalized mistreatment of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cThe early American economy was built on slave labor,\u201d Coates wrote. \u201cThe Capitol and the White House were built by slaves. President James K. Polk traded slaves from the Oval Office. The laments about \u2018black pathology,\u2019 the criticism of black family structures by pundits and intellectuals, ring hollow in a country whose existence was predicated on the torture of black fathers, on the rape of black mothers, on the sale of black children. An honest assessment of America\u2019s relationship to the black family reveals the country to be not its nurturer but its destroyer.\u201d\n\nWatch Moyers\u2019 interview with Coates, as aired on Friday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Ta-Nehisi-Coates-BillMoyers.com_-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Ta-Nehisi Coates on \u2018colorblindness\u2019: \u2018Color isn\u2019t the problem.
