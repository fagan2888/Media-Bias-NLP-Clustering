Well, it’s official — ObamaCare is now in your bedroom!

Just last week, CVS announced that through its Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) operation it will no longer permit insurance coverage of Pfizer’s Viagra.

In case you’re wondering what the heck a PBM is, it’s a newly and massively empowered byproduct of the overreaching ObamaCare.

Yes, America, PBMs can now determine which medicine you’ll be taking for everything from allergies to erectile dysfunction.

Get used to it. There’s now a third wheel in bed with you and your love. His name is Uncle Sam.

Don’t pay attention to the smokescreens coming from Washington or the administration. PBMs and health insurers now have the right to tell you to take something as pedestrian as an allergy remedy like Nasacort AQ — an older over-the-counter medicine — instead of the newer, more effective Nasonex your doctor prescribed for you. Even if Nasonex works better.

All this because the insurance plan you pay for chooses not to cover the prescribed medicine.

So just who is benefiting from ObamaCare? One look at the stock charts on health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers and you’ll see who the real beneficiaries are.

Since March 23, 2010, when ObamaCare was signed into law, here’s the happy news:

CVS closed at $36.79 per share then; it’s now $108, a gain of 200 percent.

UnitedHealthcare, which owns Oxford Health, closed at $32.63. Now it’s nearly $122, a 274 percent gain.

Express Scripts was at $50.31. Now it’s almost $88, a 75 percent gain.

Then there’s Cigna, which was $35.90. Today, it’s just below $146 — a 307 percent gain.

There are numerous medicines now dropped by insurance companies. Pfizer’s Viagra has brought this issue to the forefront of the discussion: PBMs and the administration have slipped into the privacy of your bedroom.

Creepy.
