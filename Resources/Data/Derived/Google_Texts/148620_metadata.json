Staff decorated the place to look like a wedding chapel, with cake offered to donors afterward. \u201cWe weren\u2019t into the whole registry thing,\u201d Barry Gamble, 32, told WTVR CBS 6. \u201cWe figured gifts would be nice but it would be even nicer if our friends and family could help us save some lives.\u201d\n\n.\n\nThanks to Mr. & Mrs. Gamble for including us in your celebration! pic.twitter.com/VjwxSnFnso \u2014 VA Blood Services (@vablood) June 1, 2014\n\nThe American Red Cross notes that every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood. Over 41,000 blood donations are needed every day, and the average red blood cell transfusion is about 3 pints. Though about 38 percent of the U.S. population is capable of giving blood, less than 10 percent actually does every year.\n\n\u201cCouples like Monica and Barry are truly the giving type!\u201d Virginia Blood Services spokeswoman Michelle Westbay said. \u201cWe are so thankful for their support for blood donation and sharing the opportunity for others to give the gift of life and provided hope, strength and courage to patients in need. We thank them for making us a part of their celebration and introducing others to the importance of donating blood. Through their simple act of giving, lives were impacted and forever changed.\u201d\n\nBoth Monica and Barry are frequent donors at Virginia Blood Services, so on their wedding day they only donated platelets since they had donated blood only a couple months ago. The Virginia Blood Services center needs about 400 donations every day in order to meet that area's needs, Westbay said. \u201cPeople seemed really excited about it,\u201d Monica Gamble said. \u201cNot all our friends and family are eligible to give blood but they really support the idea. So we have a mix of donors and supporters here today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest gift of all is life,\u201d Barry continued. \u201cIt sounds awful cheesy, but this is a lot more important than a toaster.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "newlyweds, ask, blood, donation, family, and, friends, their, wedding, day, greatest, gift, all", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A couple decided to throw their wedding at a blood services donor center in Virginia, where they asked their family and friends to donate blood instead of giving gifts.", "title": "Instead Of Gifts, Newlyweds Asks Wedding Party To Donate Blood [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/newlyweds-ask-blood-donation-family-and-friends-their-wedding-day-greatest-gift-all-life-286288", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/donating-blood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A couple decided to throw their wedding at a blood services donor center in Virginia, where they asked their family and friends to donate blood instead of giving gifts.", "title": "Instead Of Gifts, Newlyweds Asks Wedding Party To Donate Blood [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/newlyweds-ask-blood-donation-family-and-friends-their-wedding-day-greatest-gift-all-life-286288", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/donating-blood.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/donating-blood.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-03T17:17:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T17:17:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A couple decided to throw their wedding at a blood services donor center in Virginia, where they asked their family and friends to donate blood instead of giving gifts."}, "article_summary": "Someone in the U.S. needs blood every two seconds, and over 41,000 blood donations are needed every day.\npic.twitter.com/VjwxSnFnso \u2014 VA Blood Services (@vablood) June 1, 2014The American Red Cross notes that every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood.\nInstead of receiving silverware for their wedding, Barry and Monica Gamble decided to have all their friends and family donate blood to the Virginia Blood Services Donor Center in Richmond.\nThe Virginia Blood Services center needs about 400 donations every day in order to meet that area's needs, Westbay said.\nThough about 38 percent of the U.S. population is capable of giving blood, less than 10 percent actually does every year."}
