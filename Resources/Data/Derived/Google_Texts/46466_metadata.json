Along the way, he earned the nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d and went by the radio call sign \u201cChaos.\u201d However, he was also viewed as a deeply intellectual leader, whose dedication to study and the Marines earned him yet another nickname: \u201cThe Warrior Monk.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fearing Trump, More Republicans Are Skipping the Convention\n\nMattis\u2019 final post in the Marines was as head of U.S. Central Command, but he also held a number of other top-level posts, including head of U.S. Joint Forces Command and NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. Within the Marines, Mattis is a near-legendary figure, and there have been low-profile efforts by former Marines, like this one, to draft him to run for president.\n\nHowever, aside from the logistical challenges of getting a man largely unknown outside the military into a position to claim a major party presidential nomination, there are some major obstacles to a Mattis candidacy, the largest of which is that it\u2019s unclear Mattis is even interested in the job.\n\nA Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, the 65-year-old Mattis serves on the board of defense contractor General Dynamics and the troubled biotech firm Theranos.\n\nHe also delivers a lot of speeches, as he did at an event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Friday. During the Q&A session afterward, the subject of a presidential run arose Mattis said, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t given any thought to it.\u201d\n\nRelated: An Anti-Trump Super PAC Overplays Its Hand\n\nAnother problem is whether a lifetime Marine with a reputation for blunt talk has the disposition to endure a general election campaign in which his every statement would be parsed by the media and criticized by opponents.\n\nFor example, after leading troops in Afghanistan, he made controversial remarks about fighting the Taliban. \u201cActually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot,\u201d Mattis said during a speech in 2005. \u201cIt's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling.\n\n\u201cYou go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Mattis\u2019 remarks drew a mild rebuke from the Marine Corps Commandant Michael Hagee, who conceded that Mattis \u201cshould have chosen his words more carefully.\u201d\n\nRecently, Mattis acknowledged his history of outspokenness.\n\nRelated: John Kasich Just Gave a Really Weird Interview to the Washington Post\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived a very colorful life and I\u2019ve said some things,\u201d Mattis said in remarks at Columbia Basin College in his home state of Washington last year, according to Marine Corps Times. \u201cBut not once have I taken them back, and I\u2019ve never apologized for them \u2014 and I won\u2019t. I like the enemy knowing there are a few guys like me around.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear this is a man who would be willing to temper his public persona in the way a successful presidential run would require.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A retired four-star general in the United States Marine Corps is increasingly being touted as a possible savior for a Republican Party whose two leading presidential nominees are widely disliked, not just among the general voting public, but inside the GOP as well.", "title": "Can a Retired Marine General Nicknamed \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Save the GOP?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/22/Can-Retired-Marine-General-Nicknamed-Mad-Dog-Save-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04222016_James_Mattis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/22/Can-Retired-Marine-General-Nicknamed-Mad-Dog-Save-GOP", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04222016_James_Mattis.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A retired four-star general in the United States Marine Corps is increasingly being touted as a possible savior for a Republican Party whose two leading presidential nominees are widely disliked, not just among the general voting public, but inside the GOP as well.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Within the Marines, Mattis is a near-legendary figure, and there have been low-profile efforts by former Marines, like this one, to draft him to run for president.\nA retired four-star general from the United States Marine Corps is increasingly being touted as a possible savior for a Republican Party whose two leading presidential nominees are widely disliked, not just among the general voting public, but inside the GOP as well.\nJames Mattis, who retired from the service in 2013, led combat troops in the Persian Gulf War and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nA Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, the 65-year-old Mattis serves on the board of defense contractor General Dynamics and the troubled biotech firm Theranos.\n\u201cYou go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil."}
