Groomed for a year by an outfit called the \u201cFull Rights for Immigrants Coalition,\u201d Sophie is the ponytailed poster child for amnesty who was literally propped up in front of the pope during a September visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nLatino activists brazenly bragged about training the first-grader before the visit and crafting a letter in her name pleading with the Catholic pontiff to help her rescue President Obama\u2019s executive illegal immigrant amnesty program DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents), which was halted under federal court order on May.\n\nIn The Washington Post, a Harvard University professor praised the kiddie human shield tactics of the amnesty movement after Sophie\u2019s stunt.\n\n\u201cTactically really, it\u2019s one of those moves that is just brilliant,\u201d Roberto Gonzales, a Harvard University sociologist, told the Post reporter, Janell Ross. Ross marveled at the \u201cpower of personal narrative\u201d and noted how the use of a child to deliver a political message had been \u201cdeployed to great effect.\u201d\n\nSophie Cruz\u2019s family now works with FWD, us, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s multi-million-dollar lobbying group, which just two weeks ago featured the girl in a high-profile ad campaign reading a fear-mongering script on \u201chow her family would be ripped apart\u201d if America got serious about deporting illegal border-crossers, visa overstayers, document fraudsters and criminal alien fugitives.\n\nThe Washington Post again provided positive coverage of little Sophie Cruz\u2019s latest foray in politics. The article attacked Republicans who support strict immigration enforcement and included a massive photo of the cute child, supplied by her father, coloring a \u201cpro-immigration\u201d propaganda picture for amnesty.\n\nNow, imagine.\n\nImagine if a conservative political cartoonist had depicted Sophie as an organ grinder monkey on a leash held by her illegal immigrant parents and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nImagine if a conservative political cartoonist had defended the depiction of Sophie as a chained dancing monkey by commenting that her parents\u2019 use of their daughter in political ads and media students made the child \u201cfair game.\u201d\n\nImagine the front-page, white-hot and nonstop outrage from Democrats, journalists and the White House that would ensue.\n\nSomehow, The Washington Post\u2019s coverage of 5-year-old Sophie Cruz\u2019s manipulation and exploitation by corporate special interests and amnesty theater production managers escaped the attention of Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes.\n\nInstead, Telnaes focused her supposed wrath over political child abuse last week on another Cruz family: GOP presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz\u2019s sin? Including his 4-year-old and 7-year-old daughters, Catherine and Caroline, in a light-hearted Christmas video poking fun at his rivals and playing off his \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d moment on the Senate floor in 2013.\n\nIn the bizarre world of The Washington Post, employing a 5-year-old to breach Secret Service security for an international headline-grabbing papal photo op and to shill for Facebook\u2019s self-serving immigration expansionist agenda is \u201cbrilliant\u201d and humanizing.\n\nBut taping a viral parody Web ad with your kids telling Seussian Hillary Clinton email server jokes is practically an international human rights crime.\n\nTelnaes indulged her Cruz Derangement Syndrome not just by attacking Cruz, but by serving up a crude depiction of his young, half-Hispanic daughters as animated monkeys. She bitterly warned on Twitter that since \u201cTed Cruz has put his children in a political ad \u2014 don\u2019t start screaming when editorial cartoonists draw them as well.\u201d\n\nDisingenuous jerkette.\n\nPoliticians in both parties put their children in political ads and policy debates all the time. Over the years, the Obamas\u2019 daughters have made strategic campaign cameos for their parents during both of their dad\u2019s presidential election drives, the Obamacare debate, and their mom\u2019s East Wing anti-obesity initiative.\n\nThe Clintons did the same with their daughter. Now, at every available campaign Kodak moment, those geriatric masters of Democratic political stagecraft are currently welded to their baby granddaughter like toddlers tethered to a binkie dipped in Pixy Stix.\n\nImagine the storm of protest that would have rained down on any prominent conservative political cartoonist who caricatured Sasha, Malia, Chelsea or Charlotte as circus animals performing for their parents for maximum electoral gain.\n\nDemocrats surround themselves daily with human Snuggie blankets of other people\u2019s babies, toddlers, tweens and teens to push gun control, endless expansions of government health care programs and entitlements, and abdication of our borders and immigration laws. But instead of decrying this blatant political child abuse, \u201cprogressives\u201d attack the critics of these debate-stifling tactics for ... hating on children!\n\nWhen the media\u2019s selective civility police argue that children should be \u201coff-limits\u201d in politics, what they really mean is that prop-a-palooza should only be allowed when the children promote politically correct causes and left-wing politicians.\n\nThe Washington Post deleted the cartoon that maliciously turned two innocent daughters of a Republican candidate into dancing monkeys \u2014 but not before revealing itself to be run and staffed by drooling moral infants in soiled, double-standards diapers.\n\nMichelle Malkin\u2019s email address is malkinblog@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Weekly Opinion Columnist, Opinion, MICHELLE MALKIN", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "Remember 5-year-old Sophie Cruz?
