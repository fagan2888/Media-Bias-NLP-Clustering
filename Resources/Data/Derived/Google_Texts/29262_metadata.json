Or certain bills may pass if Republicans get some Democrats to sign on, but these will not become law because they will be vetoed by the president.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot of pressure on the GOP leadership to have symbolic votes for their base. It is something they feel they have to do,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, whose district stretches from West Hollywood to Pasadena.\n\nEnvironmental groups expect the flurry of anti-environment bills present in the House for almost three years to become a blizzard now that the Senate has reportedly chosen Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, to head the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\nInhofe does not believe in a human impact on climate change and once compared the U.S. Environmental Protection agency to the gestapo.\n\nWhen the change takes place next year, Inhofe will take the chairmanship from Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a senator with a strong commitment to environmental progress.\n\nThe Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate, a majority in the 100-seat chamber, but not enough to stop a filibuster, which requires 60 votes. Still, Tuesday\u2019s mid-term election was a clear victory for the GOP and some Democrats are blaming the sinking approval ratings of President Obama.\n\nMany newly elected Republican senators in Iowa, Colorado and North Carolina rode a wave of disapproval of President Obama and his policies, exit polls show. That connection could unleash a litany of bills that attempt to reverse Obama\u2019s environmental policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey (Senate Republicans) will use the power of the gavel to go after environmental issues. In particular, those they think will assail the Obama legacy,\u201d said Melinda Pierce, legislative director of the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C.\n\nMany expect bills that will weaken the power of the EPA, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.\n\nSpecifically, clean air advocates in Los Angeles foresee a fight over a court ruling set to take effect in December that says the current EPA safety standard for ozone pollution, the most common element in smog, needs to be lowered to better protect public health.\n\nOthers predict a bill that will reverse the president\u2019s opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline which would take oil from underground shale reserves in western Canada and transport it to refineries in the United States. Proponents say it would help create energy independence but environmental groups and many Democrats say the emissions of greenhouse gases that will further exacerbate global climate change.\n\n\u201cWe have faced hundreds of votes like this under (House Speaker John) Boehner. It was essentially a sideshow. These votes were dead in the Senate. Now, the Senate can actually vote on them,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nCongressman-elect Ted Lieu, who will succeed long-time Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, who is retiring, said he will vote no on any bill that softens environmental laws or threatens healthcare, Social Security and a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nLieu, along with Schiff, said they see both parties working together on many issues, including roads, rail and highway funding.\n\n\u201cA major transportation bill is a great opportunity for Congress to work together. It is nothing we can\u2019t overcome if both parties are willing to compromise,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nLast July, Congress patched together an extension of funding for the nearly bankrupt Highway Trust Fund that expires in May. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, wants to see an infrastructure bill that lasts for five years. She has not yet decided if a tunnel connecting the 710 Freeway gap from Alhambra to Pasadena is viable.\n\nRep. Linda Sanchez, D-Whittier, whose district includes Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood, Pico Rivera, Whittier, La Mirada and La Palma, said she wants to see both sides come together and pass comprehensive immigration reform. What sounds like a tall order may be a possibility, said Sanchez and Schiff.\n\nSanchez said Republicans should realize it would be better for Congress to act, unless they want to see the president issue an executive order.\n\nSchiff and Lieu believe the two sides share common ground on other issues, such as reining in the National Security Agency and asking for a vote in Congress to use military force in Syria against the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State or ISIS.\n\nPresident Obama on Wednesday asked the Congress to vote on an authorization bill. Authorization of the temporary training of military advisers in Syria expires in December. \u201cI think it is constitutionally required,\u201d Schiff said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The mostly Democractic Southern California caucus, fresh from celebrating easy victories in safe districts, were bracing themselves Wednesday for an onslaught of anti-Obama bills that could for the first time come to fruition in the U.S. Senate.", "title": "Election 2014: Local members of Congress see onslaught of anti-Obama bills, some common ground", "og": {"url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20141105/election-2014-local-members-of-congress-see-onslaught-of-anti-obama-bills-some-common-ground", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20141105/NEWS/141109684/AR/0/AR-141109684.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Election 2014: Local members of Congress see onslaught of anti-Obama bills, some common ground"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "The mostly Democractic Southern California caucus, fresh from celebrating easy victories in safe districts, were bracing themselves Wednesday for an onslaught of anti-Obama bills that could for the first time come to fruition in the U.S. Senate.", "title": "Election 2014: Local members of Congress see onslaught of anti-Obama bills, some common ground", "url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20141105/election-2014-local-members-of-congress-see-onslaught-of-anti-obama-bills-some-common-ground", "image": {"src": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20141105/NEWS/141109684/AR/0/AR-141109684.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Election 2014, Mid-term elections", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Election 2014, Mid-term elections"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement\u201cThey (Senate Republicans) will use the power of the gavel to go after environmental issues.\nPresident Obama on Wednesday asked the Congress to vote on an authorization bill.\nIt is something they feel they have to do,\u201d said Rep.
