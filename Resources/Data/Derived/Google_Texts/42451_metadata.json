Paul pushes Congress amendment\n\nForget the Vitter amendment. Rand Paul wants to make sure that Congress can\u2019t ever again write laws with provisions specific to lawmakers.\n\nThe Kentucky freshman Republican has introduced a constitutional amendment that would preclude senators and representatives from passing laws that don\u2019t apply equally to U.S. citizens and Congress, the executive branch and the Supreme Court. The amendment is aimed squarely at Obamacare provisions specific to members of Congress and their staffs that became a central point of contention during the government shutdown.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nUnder Obamacare, Capitol Hill aides and lawmakers are required to enter the law\u2019s health exchanges and a summertime ruling from the Office of Personnel Management ensured they will continue to receive federal employer contributions to help pay for insurance on the exchanges. A number of lawmakers, specifically Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), have been pushing for the end to those contributions, arguing they amount to a Washington exemption from Obamacare. Vitter has drafted legislative language that would eliminate these subsidies and tried to attach the measure to an energy efficiency bill and pushed for it to be included in the government funding bill last week.\n\n( WATCH: 7 defining quotes from Rand Paul)\n\nPaul seeks to go a step further and amend the Constitution so that \u201cCongress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the United States that is not equally applicable to Congress,\u201d the executive branch including the president and vice president as well as the Supreme Court.\n\nPaul told the Daily Caller in September that the amendment would take specific aim at Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, whose swing vote upheld the constitutionality of much of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIf he likes Obamacare so much, I\u2019m going to give him an amendment that gives Obamacare to Justice Roberts,\u201d Paul told the publication.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Rand Paul?)\n\nAmending the Constitution is no easy task, requiring super majorities in both chambers of Congress before going to the states for ratification. And Paul in particular will face the immense burden of trying to convince lawmakers that they should no longer have the authority to make laws governing Congress.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The senator's proposal is aimed squarely at Obamacare provisions.", "title": "Paul pushes Congress amendment", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/rand-paul-constitutional-amendment-98625.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/08/130810_rand_paul_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Kentucky (188),Rand Paul (652),Constitution (152)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The senator's proposal is aimed squarely at Obamacare provisions.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Paul pushes Congress amendmentForget the Vitter amendment.\nRand Paul wants to make sure that Congress can\u2019t ever again write laws with provisions specific to lawmakers.\n\u201cIf he likes Obamacare so much, I\u2019m going to give him an amendment that gives Obamacare to Justice Roberts,\u201d Paul told the publication.\n( QUIZ: Do you know Rand Paul?)\nAnd Paul in particular will face the immense burden of trying to convince lawmakers that they should no longer have the authority to make laws governing Congress."}
