Nick Rahall \u201ccut black lung benefits,\u201d in an ad that fires back after Rahall claimed Jenkins pledged to \u201ctake away\u201d black lung benefits from coal miners. We already said Rahall\u2019s ad was deceptive, but Jenkins\u2019 response is misleading.\n\nJenkins\u2019 ad refers to a 1981 bill that was intended to shore up the financing of the program by doubling the excise tax on coal. It did tighten eligibility requirements for future applicants, but it didn\u2019t cut the amount paid to those then receiving such benefits. It was supported by the United Mine Workers, which feared more sweeping action by the Reagan administration.\n\nThe battle over coal voters began in West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District earlier this year, when the House Majority PAC launched an ad wrongly claiming that Jenkins \u201cvowed to repeal black lung benefits.\u201d Jenkins vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, not end black lung benefits. The ACA included provisions named after former Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia that made it easier for miners and their survivors to get benefits.\n\nRahall followed up in September with an ad that went even further, featuring a coal miner who said he heard Jenkins say \u201cthat he\u2019s gonna take away our black lung benefits.\u201d Jenkins has said he\u2019s opposed to any cuts to the federal program.\n\nJenkins\u2019 counter-attack, launched Sept. 24, cites our work, saying the Rahall ad was \u201cfalse, deceptive.\u201d That\u2019s what we said. But it\u2019s misleading for the ad to claim that Rahall was the one who \u201ccut black lung benefits.\u201d\n\nThe Jenkins ad doesn\u2019t mention that it\u2019s talking about a 33-year-old law, signed by President Ronald Reagan on Dec. 29, 1981. In fact, when it says Rahall \u201ccut black lung benefits,\u201d the screen shows a picture of Rahall with President Obama and the old roll call vote, leaving the false impression that this supposed cut occurred recently.\n\nAt the time Reagan signed the law, he said, \u201cA major purpose of this legislation is to restore solvency to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.\u201d And indeed the Social Security Administration said the trust fund was in the red, and the legislation was intended \u201cto stabilize the program administered by the Labor Department by reforming certain eligibility and benefit provisions and by increasing Trust Fund revenues.\u201d\n\nUnder the federal program, which was initially established in 1969, benefits were intended to be paid by states through workers\u2019 compensation programs, and if not, by the responsible coal operator. And if not that, then the Labor Department would pay. A federal trust fund was set up in 1978 after it became clear states weren\u2019t amending their workers\u2019 comp programs to cover black lung. When no coal operator could be identified as the responsible party, the trust fund, financed by an excise tax on coal, paid.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in 1981 that a Labor Department report put the trust fund\u2019s deficit at the end of fiscal 1981 at $1.2 billion and estimated it could reach $9 billion by 1995.\n\nThe 1981 law doubled the excise tax on coal to bring solvency to the trust fund, and it increased the interest rate coal operators had to pay if they delayed black lung benefit payments and had the trust fund advance the amount.\n\nIn terms of eligibility, the law rescinded a presumption of eligibility for miners who were both disabled from a pulmonary or respiratory ailment and had worked in a coal mine for at least 15 years. It also said that a survivor would only be eligible for benefits if the cause of death of the miner was pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Previously, there was no such requirement. The changes applied to new claims filed after the legislation was enacted.\n\nThe law, the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act, enjoyed broad bipartisan support, passing the House by a 363-47 vote, and the Senate by a 63-30 vote. Coal country lawmakers were overwhelmingly behind it: In the House, the entire Kentucky, West Virginia and Wyoming delegations all voted yes, and in both Pennsylvania and Ohio, all but two of each state\u2019s representatives voted yes. In the Senate, all but one of those coal state senators supported it.\n\nThe United Mine Workers backed the legislation, but reluctantly. The publication Coal Week wrote on Nov. 9, 1981: \u201cFear of Ronald Reagan\u2019s political strength kept members of the United Mine Workers\u2019 political action council agonizing last week over whether to endorse black lung reforms they don\u2019t want.\u201d The Associated Press reported the next day that the union supported the legislation, noting that UMW President Sam Church earlier had organized a protest march against President Reagan and supposed administration plans to revamp the program.\n\nThat\u2019s all to say that Rahall\u2019s \u201caye\u201d vote in December 1981 is a lot more complicated than being a vote about cutting benefits. The law did restrict eligibility for future beneficiaries, but it didn\u2019t \u201ccut\u201d what those already eligible were getting. Church was quoted as saying in that AP article that then-current recipients \u201cdon\u2019t have anything to worry about with this proposal.\u201d\n\nRahall\u2019s latest ad says he \u201chelped expand and improve black lung benefits,\u201d a reference to the ACA provisions. That\u2019s accurate, as we\u2019ve said. But voters may be interested to learn that those provisions loosened some of the eligibility restrictions put into place by his vote for the 1981 law. The ACA allowed for a presumption of eligibility for miners who worked for at least 15 years in a coal mine and were disabled by a respiratory disease. And it said survivors of eligible miners would be automatically entitled to benefits.\n\nRahall had been introducing legislation to restore such provisions since at least the late 1990s.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson\n\nUpdate, Sept. 29: We had contacted the United Mine Workers of America for comment, but did not get a response until after we had published this article. Phil Smith, director of governmental affairs, told us in an email: \u201cAt the outset of the Reagan Administration, a push was made by the coal companies to do away with the federal black lung benefits program altogether. You are right that we did reluctantly back the legislation, and we did so because the alternative was the end of the program entirely. \u2026 At some point in the legislative process, it becomes apparent that half a loaf is better then nothing at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe13\"", "article_summary": "Republican Evan Jenkins claims Democratic Rep.
