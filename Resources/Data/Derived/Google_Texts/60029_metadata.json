The hospital is taking steps to resolve a government reimbursement schedule that lags dangerously behind costs and program requirements, including forming a Limited Liability Corporation with Ridgecrest Regional Hospital.\n\nIt\u2019s little consolation to anyone that small rural hospitals across the country are going through the same angst.\n\nAccording to board member Drew Wickman, a total of $77,000 was donated by community members following SIH\u2019s October 27 public meeting. In addition, LeRoy Kritz provided $80,000 as a short-term loan to cover payroll. As of today (Friday), the payment gap to all employees closed to two weeks. There is no lack of support from Southern Inyo, but there is a sense of urgency, according to Supervisor Matt Kingsley.\n\nThe most obvious solution presented at the public meeting was some form of partnership with Ridgecrest or Northern Inyo Hospital; both chief executive officers were present last month. SIH\u2019s CEO Lee Barron met with Jim Suver Ridgecrest\u2019s CEO last week, reporting that the LLC will allow SIH to run employee insurance benefits through Ridgecrest Regional. Barron had no information on the benefits or costs to SIH. Additional advantages could include sharing a system for the electronic medical records required by the federal Affordable Care Act as well as exploring the possibility of using Ridgecrest\u2019s license to establish Home Health Care in SIH\u2019s district. \u201cRidgecrest is also working to facilitate a loan for SIH,\u201d Barron reported.\n\n\u201cDoes the LLC save money?\u201d Kingsley asked. \u201cI see the biggest savings potential in personnel costs.\u201d Barron responded that when hospitals cut expenses, reimbursements will be cut. \u201cWe need a balance; we\u2019re already under-staffed. We need to look at efficiencies, economies of scale.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wickman, the hospital is approaching the problem from several angles. \u201cThe solution will be a combination,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis now is to keep the hospital open; long term, it\u2019s to increase services and efficiencies.\u201d\n\nWickman reported on activities of an ad hoc committee set up following the October meeting. The committee has divided all the suggestions into short- and long-term fixes. Each would require a specific action plan, he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re already moving forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAt that point staff and community members stepped up, questioning why action wasn\u2019t taken before the situation \u201cspiraled out of control.\u201d Wickman said he didn\u2019t know it was that bad.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Sierra Wave: Eastern Sierra News", "description": "By Deb Murphy The stress of financial issues at Southern Inyo Hospital was evident at Thursday afternoon\u2019s board meeting, from administrators to staff to community and board members.
