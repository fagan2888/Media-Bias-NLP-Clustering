FELLSMERE ? A Fellsmere medical group is one of 48 Florida health centers getting more than $13 million from the federal government to improve access to primary care.

Treasure Coast Community Health, which is based in Fellsmere and has five locations in Indian River County, will receive $249,398 in grant money, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Sylvia Burwell, Health and Human Services secretary, said Friday the money will allow health centers across the state to hire an estimated 215 additional staff, expand clinic hours and add new services including oral health, mental and behavioral health, pharmacy and vision.

The money is expected to help health centers reach an estimated 69,144 new patients in Florida.

As more Americans get insurance under the Affordable Care Act, health centers are a popular location for services, especially primary care.

Florida has a severe shortage of doctors. The state estimates it would take at least 753 primary care physicians to eliminate the shortages.
