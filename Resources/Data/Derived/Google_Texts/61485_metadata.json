The goal is to improve the wages of county employees and make county wages more competitive in the marketplace.\n\nThe consultant was to determine the wages of comparable positions and prepare a new wage plan for county employees. The study\u2019s recommended wage plan was released earlier this year.\n\nIf implemented, the new wage plan will bring huge wage increases to many higher-up county employees and pennies to others.\n\nFor example, the county executive would receive an $18,000 increase, her assistant $10,000. This is all very scientific and based on comparables. Ask yourself, who are the comparables? In the case of the county executive position, it\u2019s much bigger and wealthier counties, for example, Waukesha County. Should Portage County\u2019s executive make the same as the Waukesha County executive? I think not.\n\nI was told that at several county leaders meetings, the county executive boasted of the $500,000 she carved out of the budget process to bring fairer, family-sustaining wages to county employees. But the proposed wage plan gives a majority of the wage increases to already highly paid county employees. If there was any real interest in bringing a better living wage to the rank and file, the majority of the $500,000 would be going to them, not the county\u2019s fat cats.\n\nOne more question: Where did the $500,000 that the county executive boasted about come from? The simple answer is from cutting county department budgets, thereby reducing service to county residents.\n\nPatty Dreier and her accomplices should be ashamed.\n\nThomas Smith-Jacobson\n\nStevens Point\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1MQLCWq", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Wage study brings big increases to \u2018fat cats,\u2019 pennies for other county workers", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Wage study brings big increases to \u2018fat cats,\u2019 pennies for other county workers", "title": "Portage County executive padding her paycheck", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/05/portage-county-executive-padding-paycheck/82665380/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wage study brings big increases to \u2018fat cats,\u2019 pennies for other county workers", "title": "Portage County executive padding her paycheck", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ff558b70c0c3e5bf12223b3feedf0c15c2c5f40/c=0-98-1195-1293&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/05/Wausau/B9321634489Z.1_20160405155456_000_GL0DVP06R.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Patty Dreier (Photo: File photo)EDITOR: Portage County, at the recommendation of the county executive, recently engaged the services of a consultant to conduct a salary study for Portage County employees.\nThe goal is to improve the wages of county employees and make county wages more competitive in the marketplace.\nIn the case of the county executive position, it\u2019s much bigger and wealthier counties, for example, Waukesha County.\nShould Portage County\u2019s executive make the same as the Waukesha County executive?\nI was told that at several county leaders meetings, the county executive boasted of the $500,000 she carved out of the budget process to bring fairer, family-sustaining wages to county employees."}
