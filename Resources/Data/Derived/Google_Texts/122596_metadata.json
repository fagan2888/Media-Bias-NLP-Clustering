Newepicfail1\u2019s \u201c10 Greatest Farts in Live TV History.\u201d I don\u2019t know anything about YouTube user newepicfail1, nor about this video, which has a mere 5,000 views at this writing. I don\u2019t know why the video is so shoddily edited or where these clips came from. I certainly don\u2019t know if any of these examples of breaking bad on television are true or if they are all hoaxes. I do know that we are entering a brave new world of video listmaking, and newepicfail1 is leading the charge. 5. Chris Sims\u2019s \u201c10 Worst Holiday Gifts for Comic Book Readers.\u201d A very funny list, from Comics Alliance, that mixes trenchant comics criticism (DC\u2019s \u201cNew 52 Omnibus\u201d really is stupid) with excellent, terrible Amazon finds (a huge pillow printed with Tom Hiddleston\u2019s face).\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nAl-Jazeera America\n\nHow the Village Voice and Other Alt-Weeklies Lost Their Voice in 2013\n\nScott Timberg\n\nDocumenting the city \u2014 its racial and ethnic fault lines, the brilliant corners of its music scene, its overlooked literary life \u2014 was something, George realized, she could tackle more effectively as a journalist for alternative newsweeklies rather than a novelist. She'd spent years driving to Book Soup, a store on Sunset Boulevard, to pick up the Village Voice and read Greg Tate on black culture or Guy Trebay on the Bronx's crack epidemic or to Venice's Rose Cafe or Tower Records to pick up LA Weekly. \"I wanted it on Thursday; I couldn't wait,\" she says. \"If you didn't get it, it was gone. I wanted to be part of that conversation.\" Talk to readers and writers about the heyday of the alternative press and you hear stories like this. For all the good memories, though, 2013 has been a rough year for alt-weeklies. The Boston Phoenix, among the oldest and most storied, collapsed in March, putting about 50 employees out of work, just six months after an optimistic move to glossy stock; the paper was losing roughly $1 million a year. Susan Orlean, a New Yorker writer who, like Joe Klein, Janet Maslin and David Denby, worked for the Phoenix early on, compares it to the disappearance of her alma mater. \"I am a child of the alt-weekly world,\" she says, \"and I feel like it has played such an important role in journalism as we know it today.\" The New Haven Advocate was folded, along with two other weeklies, into The Hartford Courant this month after a year that saw heavy layoffs. In May, the two top editors of The Village Voice resigned rather than cut a quarter of the staff.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nGrantland\n\nWho Won 2013?\n\nRembert Browne\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 (1) vs. Candy Crush (8): A fact about this bracket: I began prepping for it, and then Beyonc\u00e9 came through like Black Feminist Santa in the middle of the night and released an album. So I had to start the bracket over. I say this for two reasons: (1) to admit there was a time when this bracket didn't include Beyonc\u00e9, which is something I'm not proud of, and (2) to make it clear that her sudden, bracket-validating inclusion is most likely not going to result in a first-round exit. With that said, for most of 2013, Candy Crush was all over everyone's fingertips like liquor. The addiction levels of the game make Rob Ford look like @Pontifex. So yeah, that's next-level crack. [Note: While I was typing this, someone invited me to play Candy Crush Saga on Facebook. I kid you not, the fiends can sense I'm about to knock it out of the bracket. I think they may be at my door. Pray for me.] But no. Even pre-Beyonc\u00e9 Beyonc\u00e9, the mother, Tumblrer, documentary subject, and Super Bowl halftime performer, advances.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nThe Verge\n\nWow This Is Doge\n\nKyle Chayka\n\nWhen 51-year-old Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato started seeing strange pictures of her eight-year-old Shiba Inu dog Kabosu popping up on the internet this past August, she was a little freaked out. \u201cI was taken aback,\u201d Sato, an elegant, brown-haired woman given to wide smiles, recalled. \u201cIt felt very strange to see her face there. It was a Kabosu that I didn\u2019t know.\u201d What Sato didn\u2019t realize was that Kabosu had unwittingly become the face of \u201cdoge,\u201d the white-hot internet meme that plasters photos of Shiba Inu with fractured phrases written in rainbow-colored Comic Sans type. The images often feature a \u201cwow\u201d in one corner, then a series of intensifiers, like \u201cso\u201d and \u201csuch,\u201d paired with nouns relevant to the picture. \u201cSo scare,\u201d \u201csuch dapper,\u201d \u201cmany skill,\u201d some examples read, like a surreal narrative of the dog\u2019s inner monologue.\n\nAP / Jim Mone\n\nDeadspin\n\nI Was an NFL Player Until I Was Fired by Two Cowards and a Bigot\n\nChris Kluwe\n\nNear the end of November, several teammates and I were walking into a specialist meeting with Coach Priefer. We were laughing over one of the recent articles I had written supporting same-sex marriage rights, and one of my teammates made a joking remark about me leading the Pride parade. As we sat down in our chairs, Mike Priefer, in one of the meanest voices I can ever recall hearing, said: \"We should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows.\" The room grew intensely quiet, and none of the players said a word for the rest of the meeting. The atmosphere was decidedly tense. I had never had an interaction that hostile with any of my teammates on this issue\u2014some didn't agree with me, but our conversations were always civil and respectful. Afterward, several told me that what Mike Priefer had said was \"messed up.\" After this point, Mike Priefer began saying less and less to me, and our interactions were stilted. I grew increasingly concerned that my job would be in jeopardy. I had seen the same pattern of behavior directed at our former placekicker, Ryan Longwell, whom Mike Priefer began to ignore during the 2011 season and who was cut after rookie minicamps in early May 2012.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nThe A.V. Club\n\nWhat\u2019s Your Pop Culture Resolution for 2014?\n\nA.V. Club contributors\n\nBecca James\n\nMy pop-culture resolution is to slow down. I\u2019ve managed, for the most part, to keep up with my favorite mediums, but have fallen out of reflective routines. I no longer sit in the theater until the last credit rolls before leisurely making it to my next destination as I contemplate the pros and cons of the film. I rarely take the time to discuss aloud the books I\u2019ve read, and, lately, music has been in one ear and out the other. I imagine this is a result of how readily available these things are and a busier schedule. Regardless, I\u2019m hoping to go back to a time where I fostered longer relationships with the things I take in. So, no more rushing home after a movie, immediately shelving a book after finishing it, or listening to an album only once before I\u2019m onto the next. Instead, I plan to give pop culture the time it deserves.\n\nNBC\n\nThe New Yorker\n\nCommunity Two: Electric Boogaloo\n\nEmily Nussbaum", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most intriguing articles about entertainment we&#39;ve come across in the past seven days", "author": "Nolan Feeney, Ashley Fetters, and Spencer Kornhaber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The most intriguing articles about entertainment we&#39;ve come across in the past seven days", "title": "Top Tens, Community's Comeback: The Week's Best Pop-Culture Writing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/community_650/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/top-tens-em-community-em-s-comeback-the-weeks-best-pop-culture-writing/282736/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27bd\"", "article_summary": "In May, the two top editors of The Village Voice resigned rather than cut a quarter of the staff.\nAfter this point, Mike Priefer began saying less and less to me, and our interactions were stilted.\nAfterward, several told me that what Mike Priefer had said was \"messed up.\"\nI do know that we are entering a brave new world of video listmaking, and newepicfail1 is leading the charge.\nRegardless, I\u2019m hoping to go back to a time where I fostered longer relationships with the things I take in."}
