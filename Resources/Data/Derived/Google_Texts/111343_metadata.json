That\u2019s because, Aronoff says, \u201cThere was nothing ever signed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why they go on with doing all these things that most people think, \u2018well, isn\u2019t that a violation of the agreement or of the UN Resolutions that are sort of involved in that?\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd, in fact, there is no agreement.\u201d\n\nSo while Iran pursues nuclear weapons under a mantle of international legitimacy, Obama receives praise for a job well done. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no question that so many in the media give him credit for this great accomplishment,\u201d said Aronoff, continuing, \u201cand that\u2019s going to be the way most of the liberal historians are going to mark it, that he was able to make this great deal when no one else could.\u201d\n\nAnother signature Obama accomplishment is Obamacare, which was supposed to increase health care access and quality of care. Instead, it has increased part-time employment and led to much higher deductibles and skyrocketing premiums, Aronoff argues. \u201cObamacare, does that ring a bell with anybody?\u201d asked Aronoff. \u201cI mean that has forced so many employment decisions, depending on the size of the company, and you need to keep your part-time people under 30 hours so you don\u2019t have to cover their health insurance.\u201d\n\nHe described the Obamacare law has having \u201cunintended\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic\u201d consequences.\n\nPresident Obama prefers to cast his real-world accomplishments in negatives, to show that he forestalled a worse future. However, as Aronoff noted in his article, \u201cSaying that things could have been worse without Obama\u2019s policy interventions is an argument based on counterfactual reasoning, as if the President could somehow know the future that he avoided.\u201d On Obamacare, the Iran Deal, and even the economy, President Obama\u2019s alleged successes are really debacles.\n\nOne need only look to the state of the economy. While the press stresses that unemployment rates have fallen to only five percent, the labor participation rate reveals a darker picture. \u201cBut if you really look at the statistics and what\u2019s gone on, and then they [the media] point to the fact that oh, we have a five percent unemployment rate,\u201d said Aronoff. \u201cThat figure alone doesn\u2019t tell you anything, really, because we have the lowest labor participation rate since the 1970s.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the complete interview here:\n\nAudio clip: Adobe Flash Player (version 9 or above) is required to play this audio clip.
