At the same time, they don\u2019t expect candidate Trump to release his tax returns. The reasoning from Mr. Trump is that he is in the middle of an audit. An audit does not prevent releasing his return. This goes right to the root of his problem, a lack of character and a dismissive attitude toward anyone who questions his integrity. Is there something Americans shouldn\u2019t know about his business dealings? What this shows me is that hypocrisy is alive and well in our nation. What\u2019s good for the goose should be good for the gander. Or in this case the duck.\n\n- Randy Clay, Cape Coral\n\nForeign aid\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Congressman Jolly got my attention recently when he announced that he was asking for a boost in U.S. aid to Israel from $3.1 billion a year to $5.1 billion a year for 10 years, a 65 percent increase. So far, in direct aid, we have given Israel $143,320,430,000. This amount includes $16,650,160,000 in interest to finance the aid given during the years in which we did not have a budget surplus.\n\nIn addition to the direct aid, we have loaned Israel $2,105,000,000. All of this amount was during years when we had a budget deficit. The U.S. has guaranteed Israel loans of $600 million for housing loans, $5.5 billion for military debt reduction loans, $9.2 billion for Soviet Jew resettlement loans, and $9 billion for economic recovery loans, for a total of $24.3 billion.\n\nTotal assistance to Israel amounts to $167,620,430,000. We\u2019ve been very generous to Israel. Jolly and other politicians rant about growing our national debt while continuing to advocate borrowing more money from China, Japan and others to give to foreign countries.\n\n- C. C. (Doc) Dockery, Lakeland\n\nDr. Tavel\u2019s social disaster\n\nDr. Tavel\u2019s proposal for a single payer health system is ridiculous. (April 21, Single-payer system is best option for health care) One has to look no further than the VA to see the mess a government-run health system would create in the U.S. Every point Tavel makes is without any substantial proof that a single payer system would improve health care for the average American citizen which, after all, is the whole point of any system.\n\nObviously he has no regard or understanding of the benefits of our free enterprise economy that drives any economic activity to provide a better product and/or at lower cost in order to remain competitive. If there are problems in the system as operated prior to Obamacare, they are dwarfed at the mess Obamacare has created.\n\nAs to cost, there is no way to calculate what such a system would cost, either in dollars or human cost. The only thing we can be sure of is that the benefits would be less and the costs higher than predicted as always occurs with any government program. One likely result would be the masterminds running the system deciding as costs spiral out of control which among us deserve medical treatment at all.\n\n- Neil Miller, North Fort Myers\n\nOne man show\n\nTo the local ABC, CBS and NBC news media:\n\nWhy do you think it is necessary to have two news anchors on your news shows? National networks get by with one. If you only had one they couldn\u2019t talk and giggle unprofessionally with each other. Send the weather entertainer somewhere else in the studio until it\u2019s his turn so he can\u2019t be involved with the unprofessional ignoring of the audience. The \u201cone big happy family on the news broadcasts\u201d stinks. Revamp your news programs. Get some class.\n\n-Frank Roth, south Fort Myers\n\nBernie nation\n\nAs I read Leonard Pitts recent column (May 4, Bernie Nation can\u2019t get behind Hillary Clinton) on the Sanders campaign, my first thoughts were, \u201chey, finally, maybe he makes some sense\u201d. That lasted about a nano second.\n\nMr. Pitts, like most of the press, still does not get it. He thinks he does. But his last lines of the article belie his capacity to be honest.\n\nHe bemoans the fact the Sanders supporters can\u2019t accept the fact they lost \u201cfair and square.\u201d I know Bernie supporters and they are as fed up with the system as we on the anti-establishment right are.\n\nTo say Bernie lost \u201cfair and square\u201d is about as true as \u201cyou can keep your doctor\u201d or \u201cread my lips\u201d.\n\nThe party bosses are going to make sure that only Hillary gets the nod. Unless of course she loses every state moving forward.\n\nRemember politicians only do things that they think will help them get elected, first. Everything, including the country, comes second. That is what most people think of the way we are now governed.\n\nBernie supporters are a bit on the young and idealistic side, but they know a fix when they see one.\n\nToo bad the condescending Mr. Pitts can\u2019t. He forgets the one thing that the Trump/Cruz and Bernie supporters have in common is they won\u2019t vote for the establishment candidate, be it a Bush or a Clinton.\n\n- Walter J Sivigny, Cape Coral\n\nRead or Share this story: http://newspr.es/27Iewzf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The only thing we can be sure of is that the benefits would be less and the costs higher than predicted as always occurs with any government program.", "og": {"site_name": "The News-Press", "description": "The only thing we can be sure of is that the benefits would be less and the costs higher than predicted as always occurs with any government program.", "title": "Mailbag May 21: Single payer system a bad choice", "url": "http://www.news-press.com/story/opinion/readers/local/2016/05/20/saturdays-letters-editor-single-payer-system-bernie-sanders-foreign-aid/84655732/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-press.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The only thing we can be sure of is that the benefits would be less and the costs higher than predicted as always occurs with any government program.", "title": "Mailbag May 21: Single payer system a bad choice", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/161030113fb1b2a6f9d6cee2d542d9175efa1799/c=304-0-2097-1793&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/20/FortMyers/B9322239211Z.1_20160520124932_000_G66EE6802.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@thenewspress", "site": "@thenewspress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600073397", "fb": {"app_id": 149631068421067}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Single payer system, health care, foreign aid, Bernie Sanders, Israel"}, "article_summary": "- C.
