Let\u2019s call her Isabella. A few months ago, we edited it in my classroom during lunch. The writing was good, but plenty of 17-year-olds fantasize about swimming with whales. Her essay was distinctive for another reason: Her career goals were not the highlight of the essay. They were just a means of framing her statement of purpose, something surprisingly few personal statements actually get around to making. The essay\u2019s core concerned the rhetoric that educators had used to motivate her and her peers\u2014other minority students from low-income communities. She\u2019d been encouraged to think of college foremost as a path to socioeconomic mobility. Since elementary school, teachers had rhapsodized about the opportunities that four years of higher education could unlock. Administrators had rattled off statistics about the gulf in earnings between college graduates and those with only high-school diplomas. She\u2019d been told to think about her family, their hopes for her, what they hadn\u2019t had and what she could have if she remained diligent. She\u2019d been promised that good grades and a ticket to a good college would lead to a good job, one that would guarantee her financial independence and enable her to give back to those hard-working people who had placed their faith in her.\n\nThankfully, Isabella decried this characterization as shortsighted and simplistic. My guess is that only students like her ever have to hear it.

Their parents are house-cleaners, truck drivers, and non-union carpenters. When administrators, counselors, and teachers repeat again and again that a college degree will alleviate economic hardship, they don\u2019t mean to suggest that there is no other point to higher education. Yet by focusing on this one potential benefit, educators risk distracting them from the others, emphasizing the value of the fruits of their academic labor and skipping past the importance of the labor itself. The message is that intellectual curiosity plays second fiddle to financial security. While Isabella\u2019s essay acknowledged her lack of economic advantages and portrayed with sensitivity her parents\u2019 struggles, she was eager to focus first on nurturing her intellectual passion. She detailed how her curiosity about sea urchins and other marine life had led to a passion she wants to sustain through college and a subsequent career. College will ferry her to her intellectual destiny, not a financial windfall. She\u2019ll make her life\u2019s work what she wants to do, not just what she is able do. My students are understandably preoccupied with money. They don\u2019t have the privilege to not worry about it. They fantasize about what their future wealth will permit them to enjoy. They dream about specific models of cars in certain colors and gargantuan houses in particular neighborhoods and opulent meals at their favorite restaurants any time they wish. Many swoon over the East Coast liberal arts colleges they visit on the special trips that my school is thoughtful enough to arrange. Colleges like Swarthmore and Haverford fly students like Isabella out during college applications season. A few are accepted but most attend state schools, which, especially in California, can provide excellent educational opportunities. The irony, though, is that many of these students aspire to go to a liberal-arts school but don\u2019t necessarily understand its significance. They\u2019re drawn to sleepy quads, weathered brick, and cascading ivy, but they are resolutely pre-professional in spirit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Higher education should be promoted to all students as an opportunity to experience an intellectual awakening, not just increase their earning power.", "author": "Andrew Simmons", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Higher education should be promoted to all students as an opportunity to experience an intellectual awakening, not just increase their earning power.", "title": "The Danger of Telling Poor Kids That College Is the Key to Social Mobility", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/AP070917043021/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/the-danger-of-telling-poor-kids-that-college-is-the-key-to-social-mobility/283120/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Matt Rourke/AP Images A 12th-grader wrote a college admissions essay about wanting to pursue a career in oceanography.\nColleges like Swarthmore and Haverford fly students like Isabella out during college applications season.\nShe\u2019d been encouraged to think of college foremost as a path to socioeconomic mobility.\nThe irony, though, is that many of these students aspire to go to a liberal-arts school but don\u2019t necessarily understand its significance.\nAdministrators had rattled off statistics about the gulf in earnings between college graduates and those with only high-school diplomas."}
