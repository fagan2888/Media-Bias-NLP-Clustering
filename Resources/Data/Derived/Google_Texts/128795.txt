With his wife at his side, Rep. Jeremy Durham (R-Franklin) formally filed his petition Friday and announced his candidacy for re-election for the 65th House seat.

"Jessica [Durham's wife] and I are both small business owners who must make payroll, pay taxes and navigate regulations much like every company in Tennessee," Durham said.

"During my four years in office, I've always listened to my constituents. That is why I led the charge against expanding Obamacare, fought to enforce our immigration laws, advocated fiscal responsibility and consistently defended Tennessee small businesses from harmful regulations."

He was first elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2012 and was re-elected in 2014.

Durham could face the most potential competition in the Williamson County House races. So far, he has two Republican challengers already filed, and two others have pulled petitions. He also could face one Democratic candidate across the ballot.

"Williamson County citizens realize they can count on me to uphold their constitutional conservative values each and every time on each and every issue regardless of outside pressure from establishment politicians or special interest groups," he said.

"I will spend the next four months meeting with residents of District 65 to earn their votes and discuss ideas on how to best take their conservative voices to Nashville."

Since being elected, Durham said he spearheaded countless conservative causes, including sponsoring welfare reform legislation, fighting to protect traditional values and the unborn and leading the way in cutting government waste and regulations to help businesses across the state grow and thrive.
