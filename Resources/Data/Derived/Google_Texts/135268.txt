An outbreak of E. coli linked to Chipotle has expanded to six states.

New cases have been reported in California, New York and Ohio, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The first cases were discovered weeks ago in Oregon and Washington and, more recently, in Minnesota.

Shares of the Denver-based restaurant chain plunged 12.5 percent to $534.99, a new low for the year.

The investigation to determine the specific food item linked to the illness is ongoing, the agency said.

So far, 45 people have been infected, with 43 of the victims saying they had eaten at Chipotle in the week before they got sick, the CDC said.

Late in October, Chipotle Mexican Grill closed 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington after health officials discovered most of the people sickened in an E. coli outbreak had eaten at the chain’s restaurants. The restaurants have since reopened.

“At the moment, we do not believe that it is necessary to close any restaurants,” Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said. He said the company has implemented measures in restaurants including deep cleaning, replacing ingredients and providing supply chain data to investigators.
