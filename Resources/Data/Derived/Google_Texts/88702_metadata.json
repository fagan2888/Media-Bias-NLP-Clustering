For one woman, it\u2019s being independent enough to go to the store to buy milk. For another, it\u2019s living at home and being able to see his grandchildren.\n\nThese are some of the responses to an experimental \u201cconversation guide,\u201d a tool researchers are using to initiate end of life conversations.\n\nAriadne Labs, a collaboration between Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and the Harvard School of Public Health, is leading the study. It\u2019s trying to determine whether asking chronically and critically ill patients the right questions will improve their end of life experience and prevent unwanted or unnecessary care.\n\nResearchers have developed a list of seven questions for physicians to use when discussing treatment options with terminal and critically ill patients.\n\n\u201cWhat abilities are so critical to your life that you can\u2019t imagine living without them,\u201d is one of the questions in the guide.\n\nDr. Daniela Lamas, a pulmonary and critical care fellow at Harvard University, is one of the physicians conducting the study. Lamas is focusing on people who\u2019ve spent extended periods in the hospital and are living with both a breathing and feeding tube, a population which is often invisible, she said.\n\nShe contacted inewsource about the study after reading our special series, Impossible Choice, about the more than 4,000 people who live on life support in California\u2019s nursing homes. The stories posed a basic question: when is a life no longer worth living?\n\n\u201cAsking people what is important to them will only make their care better,\u201d Lamas said.\n\nShe\u2019s used the conversation guide to start about 15 discussions with seriously ill patients at a long term care hospital in the Boston area.\n\nOne man said he would re-consider whether he wanted more treatment if he could no longer communicate in a meaningful way with the people around him, Lamas said.\n\nFor many, maintaining their cognitive abilities was a common theme.\n\nLamas was surprised by how open people are about discussing these issues.\n\n\u201cThey want to tell (me) who they are and what\u2019s important to them,\u201d she said.\n\nLamas has published articles in the New Yorker and The New England Journal of Medicine about living on life support, a limbo between life and death. As an ICU doctor, she\u2019s brought \u201cpatients into this world,\u201d and hopes they are given opportunities to reevalute whether they want to continue living under those circumstances.\n\nDoctors who practice palliative care \u2013 a specialty which focuses on reducing pain and controlling symptoms \u2013 are trained to discuss patient goals at end of life. But not all doctors in other specialties know how to have these conversations, according to Ariadne Labs.\n\nAccording to information about the study on its website: \u201cThe imperative now is to close the gap so that all doctors who care for seriously ill patients are competent and feel comfortable having patient-centered conversations\u2026so that patients can live with a serious illness and into the last stage of life with dignity, control, and a sense of peace.\u201d\n\nEnd of life conversations became a political and controversial subject in 2009, when they were dubbed \u201cdeath panels\u201d and came to mean the government would decide who should live and die.\n\nA proposal in the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, would have allowed doctors to bill Medicare for the time they spent talking to patients about their medical wishes if they had a terminal illness. The term death panels generated so much bad press the provision for those discussions was eventually removed.\n\nA report released in September by the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, urged insurance companies to reimburse health-care providers for these conversations, calling them \u201ccritically important.\u201d\n\nThe American Medical Association has also asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) this past May to create billing codes for these conversations.\n\nClick here to see the conversation guide.\n\nWe'll let you know when big things happen.\n\nEmail address:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego news from inewsource", "description": "What things in your life make it worth living?
