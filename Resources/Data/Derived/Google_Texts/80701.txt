LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) - Las Cruces tourism officials say they will not interfere with an unannounced mural going up on the building they occupy.

The Las Cruces Sun-News reports (http://bit.ly/1JhsMRU) that a group of artists say the owner of the building that houses the Las Cruces Convention and Visitors Bureau gave them permission to paint the mural over the weekend.

The mural shows a woman surrounded by flowers and birds.

The Visitors Bureau initially threatened to cover it up Friday.

But Bureau executive director Philip San Filippo now says it’s the owner’s right to allow a mural but he would have liked input on the design.

He says the attorney who owns the building may not have informed them because he has been sick with strep throat and bronchitis.
