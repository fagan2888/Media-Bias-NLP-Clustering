IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--USMD Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: USMD), a physician-led integrated healthcare system, announced today USMD Hospital at Arlington has been selected to The SafeCare Group’s “100 SafeCare Hospitals Under 100 Beds” 2014 list for achieving among the highest overall performance when compared to 3,500 acute care, nonfederal hospitals across the country. This distinction uniquely identifies the country’s best healthcare institutions based on robust, evidence-based criteria of the Affordable Care Act.

The 100 SafeCare Hospitals is based upon the SafeCare framework of three criteria domains – quality, patient safety and efficiency of care. Hospitals were rated on these domains and given an overall hospital performance score. Only the 100 hospitals under 100 beds with the highest scores made the 100 SafeCare Hospitals® Under 100 Beds list. Just five hospitals under 100 beds in Texas, including USMD Hospital at Arlington, made the list. USMD Hospital at Arlington is the only hospital in the DFW Metroplex and the top hospital in Texas to make the list.

“USMD places tremendous effort on providing patients with the highest-quality and safest care possible,” said John House, M.D., chairman of the board and chief executive officer of USMD Holdings. “To be named to The SafeCare Group’s 100 SafeCare Hospitals Under 100 Beds list is a tremendous honor and it confirms that our team is committed to providing this type of care to our patients each and every day.”

According to The SafeCare Group, if all U.S. hospitals attained the 100 SafeCare Hospitals® level, more than 400,000 hospital deaths and nearly 5.1 million preventable complications would have been avoided in 2014.

“USMD Hospital at Arlington is honored to be recognized by The SafeCare Group as one of the safest hospitals in America,” said Marcia Crim, Chief Executive Officer, USMD Hospital at Arlington. “I want to thank the entire team at USMD Hospital at Arlington for making awards like this possible.”

To assemble the 100 SafeCare Hospitals Under 100 Beds list, The SafeCare Group analyzed hospitals for the overall lowest risk-standardized 30-Day Mortality rates, lowest 30-Day Readmissions, lowest Complications Rates in Medical and Surgical Care, lowest in-hospital Medical and Surgical Infections, highest Medical and Surgical Processes of Care measures for AMI, HF, PN and SCIP, and highest Patient Satisfaction scores.

Hospitals do not apply for this award and the 100 hospitals included on the list did not pay for this honor.

About 100 SafeCare Hospitals®

To produce a meaningful ranking of U.S. hospitals, The SafeCare Group® looked to the Affordable Care Act for guidance of an evidence-based framework for the 100 SafeCare Hospitals® rankings. The distinguished medical and legal experts who designed, developed, and implemented the Affordable Care Act believed that a listing of outperforming hospitals in the areas of Hospital Value Based Program (HVBP), Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), and Hospital-Acquired Conditions Reduction Program (HACRP) would promote strong incentives to improve care. The SafeCare Group adopted this framework for the 100 SafeCare Hospitals® methodology and created three criteria domains – “Processes of Care”, “Outcomes of Care”, and “Efficacy of Care.” As a result, the 100 SafeCare Hospitals® utilized a methodology that is firmly rooted and grounded on nationally recognized, evidence-based metrics and data.
