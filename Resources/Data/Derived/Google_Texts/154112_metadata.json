However, he can't help but wax poetic about the original Jurassic Park, and bemoan the revenue-focused corporate behemoth that its successor theme park, Jurassic World, has become. The scene feels like a wink to 30-something viewers\u2014many of whom are sure to turn out to see the fourth installment of the \"Jurassic Park\" series as it hits theaters this weekend.\n\n\"Jurassic World\" is just one of a handful of cinematic touchstones returning to theaters after a prolonged absence.
