Obama stated that the federal government is America\u2019s largest employer and that those dedicated public servants who stay on the job will do so without pay and several hundred thousand more will be immediately and indefinitely furloughed.\n\nThankfully, those receiving Social Security and Medicare benefits will continue to do so, and the U.S. Postal service will still run. The borders and prisons will stay guarded. Federal officers will continue to enforce the law, and the military will continue to serve the nation.\n\nBut our parks, our federal offices, Veterans Affairs, several power plant operations and more will either shut down or function at the lowest possible capacity.\n\nThe dividing factor that pushed them to this point is the Affordable Care Act. But it is safe to say that many Americans cannot afford that care without a job.\n\nThe federal employees who have been furloughed or temporarily laid off make up the backbone and legs that the United States stands on.\n\nWithout them, the regulations and institutions that keep the U.S. successful start to fall apart. Without them, the American full faith and credit loses its full faith and credit.\n\nDuring the shutdown, the president and the Congress will still be paid. Their salaries are considered mandatory spending. If that\u2019s mandatory spending, then perhaps paying for the labor of federal employees is also mandatory. Decisions must be made eventually, but not at the mercy of innocent pocketbooks.\n\nNo one argues the importance of healthcare. Many people are suffering and deserve to be helped. Now there\u2019s even more people who will begin to suffer. Also, if citizens are expected to go to work for too long without pay, there is a good chance of protest.\n\nThe fiscal year runs Oct. 1\u2013Sept. 30. This allows the government the time to decide how to spend U.S. funds. That schedule should have been the first sacrifice to prevent this from happening. Deadlines are important, but mortgage payments and groceries are essential to the average human life.\n\nWith such a large chunk of the population now left with empty pockets, consumer spending and investments will decrease until the government can make a decision.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that the U.S. is not recession-proof. This hasn\u2019t been a great recovery from the 2008 debacle. The shutdown will ultimately and inevitably begin to affect the economy like salt to the wound. If this shutdown lasts long enough, the consequences will be unavoidable and painful. The government saw this coming and purposely did nothing to prevent it in what seems like a very expensive game of chicken.\n\nIn recent weeks, Congress and the House had more than enough time to save its people from losing precious money. Yet they couldn\u2019t agree or settle for the sake of faithful and now jobless Americans.\n\nThose people were the ones who ultimately built the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the nation.\n\nAnd they were the first to be let down.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Collegian", "description": "President Barack Obama said Congress should never threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America, and he is correct.
