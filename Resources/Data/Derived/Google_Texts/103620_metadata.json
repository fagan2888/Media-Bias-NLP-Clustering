While most cases have been diagnosed in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and New Guinea, cases in Nigeria, Spain, and the United States have also been recorded.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile the outbreak reached a critical point of news coverage in the United States between August and October, the virus continues to ravage parts of west Africa. This week, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon announced a visit to Liberia, one of the hardest-hit nations by the outbreak, though it has also been one of the more successful nations in curbing the spread of the disease in recent months. Ban commended the nation in an address in Liberia this week, noting that efforts have been somewhat successful. \u201cWhere the strategy of isolation of the patients and treatment, contact tracing and safe and dignified burial is implemented, it is working,\u201d he noted, \u201cSome areas that were once hot spots, such as Lofa County in Liberia, have been free of Ebola for weeks.\u201d\n\nThe WHO announced this week that Liberia\u2019s individual death toll currently stands at 3,376. Also on hand in Liberia is Dr. Thomas Frieden, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control. The Liberian Observer notes that Frieden was stern in warning that, while Liberia appears to be slowly recovering from the outbreak, any lack of care in isolating patients or properly protecting health personnel could trigger a second wave of infections.\n\nWhile Liberia is receiving much of the attention, Sierra Leone\u2019s advances in fighting Ebola appear slim, at best. Just this week, the nation yet again lost one of its top doctors to Ebola: Dr. Victor Willoughby, a senior Ebola doctor who died just hours before an experimental medicine sent for him from Canada arrived in the nation. He was the eleventh doctor to succumb to the disease in Sierra Leone. Reuters notes that the entire nation had only 132 doctors before the Ebola outbreak began.\n\nDoctors speaking to Reuters note that Sierra Leone appears to have fallen into a particularly dire situation because the government has had trouble paying health workers full wages, creating a situation where many who could help have gone on strike or simply refuse to. In one city in November, outraged burial workers protested the lack of wages by lining the streets with corpses of Ebola victims.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WHO: Ebola Death Toll Reaches 7,500 While Almost 20,000 Infected", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "WHO: Ebola Death Toll Reaches 7,500 While Almost 20,000 Infected", "title": "WHO: Ebola Death Toll Reaches 7,500 While Almost 20,000 Infected - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/ebola-burial-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/12/25/who-ebola-death-toll-reaches-7500-while-almost-20000-infected/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WHO: Ebola Death Toll Reaches 7,500 While Almost 20,000 Infected", "creator": "@francesmartel", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/ebola-burial-Reuters.jpg", "title": "WHO: Ebola Death Toll Reaches 7,500 While Almost 20,000 Infected - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ebola, West Africa, WHO,Ebola, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Ebola", "tag": "WHO", "published_time": "2014-12-25T07:46:10-07:00", "categories": "National Security,Ebola"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd267\"", "article_summary": "While most cases have been diagnosed in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and New Guinea, cases in Nigeria, Spain, and the United States have also been recorded.\nReuters notes that the entire nation had only 132 doctors before the Ebola outbreak began.\nHe was the eleventh doctor to succumb to the disease in Sierra Leone.\nWhile Liberia is receiving much of the attention, Sierra Leone\u2019s advances in fighting Ebola appear slim, at best.\nIn one city in November, outraged burial workers protested the lack of wages by lining the streets with corpses of Ebola victims."}
