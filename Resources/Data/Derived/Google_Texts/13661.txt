Monday begins the final week for the 2016 legislative session. The billion dollar budget hole still isn't fixed. And there are plenty of other issues still on the table.

A special session is still on the table. But if lawmakers want to be done this week, they have a lot of work in a short amount of time.

The most glaring issue -- that $1.3 billion budget shortfall and finalizing the state budget for the next fiscal year, Right now not many solutions have really been discussed.

The $1.50 cigarette tax and accepting federal funds from Obamacare are still being debated. But also two bills are still on the table that have sparked some controversy.

First the bill that would allow anyone over 21 and who is not a felon to carry a gun. No permit required. That has passed the House and the Senate, but sits in committee.

Also, modernizing beer and wine sales. This would allow grocery and convenience stores to sell high point beer. If passed in the House it would then have to be voted on in November because it is a constitutional amendment.

Also on the agenda, capitol repairs. A $125 million bond issue to fix the building has passed the House but is waiting to be heard in the Senate.
