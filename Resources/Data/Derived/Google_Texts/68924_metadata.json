Despite the competition, Perez said the $168-million Henderson Hospital is a necessary addition to the community given the growth in demand for health-care services created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Valley Health System expects to hire 700 people, including doctors, nurses, therapists and medical technicians, to staff the 142-bed hospital by the time it opens, Perez said.\n\nSt. Rose Dominican hospitals originally agreed to build a hospital at the site but backed out in February 2013, citing a lack of financing. Early last year, Valley Health System announced it would be taking over the project, which is located near U.S. 95 and Galleria Drive and across the street from Cowabunga Bay water park. The $1.2 billion Union Village project, billed as the first integrated health village in the region, has been years in the making. Plans first were unveiled in April 2011.\n\nThe idea of a full-fledged health community at Union Village is what attracted the Valley Health System, Perez said, adding, \u201cit will basically be a one-stop shop for patients.\u201d\n\nUnion Village developers \u2014 Craig Johnson, David Micheal, Gary Holland and David Baker \u2014 recently announced that Las Vegas Athletic Clubs plans to build a fitness center at the site. LVAC likely will break ground on the building later this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving on all fronts,\u201d Johnson said. Construction for Henderson Hospital \u201cis a seminal point in the development of Union Village.\u201d\n\nWith Henderson Hospital serving as an anchor, developers are optimistic the other pieces of Phase I \u2014 a skilled-nursing facility, senior-living village and retail \u2014 will start coming together more quickly, Johnson said. They\u2019re finalizing an agreement for a skilled-nursing facility, which they hope to announce in a few weeks, he said.\n\nThe senior-living village will include independent apartments, assisted living and care for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Johnson said. The combination of living arrangements will fill a need for the valley, which has a growing elderly population, according to a study Union Village commissioned.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping to do is improve (seniors\u2019) wellness while living there,\u201d Johnson said, through education, fitness, nutritious diets and health care.\n\nDevelopers envision the retail component of the project as a mix of coffee shops, restaurants, dry cleaners and salons serving people living at Union Village and the 6,000 expected employees on campus, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complex project,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen you put all those together, it creates a lot of moving parts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The facility is being built on 30 acres of the planned Union Village health care complex, which will anchor a 170-acre mixed-use development at ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "The facility is being built on 30 acres of the planned Union Village health care complex, which will anchor a 170-acre mixed-use development at ...", "title": "Henderson Hospital foundation pouring signals advance of Union Village", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2015/jul/10/henderson-hospital-foundation-pouring-unionvillage/", "image": "http://photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2015/07/09/scaled.UHS_Henderson_Logo_Dawn_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2015/07/09/scaled.UHS_Henderson_Logo_Dawn_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "creator": "@JackieValley", "site": "@LasVegasSun", "card": "summary", "account_id": 12055942}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-10T02:00", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/jacquelyn-valley/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "news_keywords": "News,Business,health"}, "article_summary": "The $1.2 billion Union Village project, billed as the first integrated health village in the region, has been years in the making.\nThe medical building will be the third hospital in Henderson and the sixth Valley Health System hospital operating in the Las Vegas area.\nHenderson Hospital foundation pouring signals advance of Union VillageCourtesyHenderson city and Valley Health System officials are hoping a new development project will pave the way for the city to have a healthier economy \u2014 and healthier people.\nThe combination of living arrangements will fill a need for the valley, which has a growing elderly population, according to a study Union Village commissioned.\nThe Valley Health System expects to hire 700 people, including doctors, nurses, therapists and medical technicians, to staff the 142-bed hospital by the time it opens, Perez said."}
