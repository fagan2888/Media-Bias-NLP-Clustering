Tom Graves in the May 24 Republican primary for the 14th District Congressional seat.\n\nThe district covers Floyd and the 11 other counties in Northwest Georgia.\n\nThere is no Democratic candidate, so the winner will be unopposed in the Nov. 8 general election.\n\nMickey Tuck, of Silver Creek, is an electrician at Gildan Yarns in Cedar\u00adtown. Other than an unsuccessful run for the Floyd commission in the early 1990s, he has no previous political experience. And he said that\u2019s exactly why voters should send him to Washington, D.C., next year.\n\n\u201cTom has been up there too long and made too many friends there,\u201d Tuck said. \u201cHe\u2019s working for the special interests and the lobbyists, not the people of the 14th District.\u201d\n\nAllan Levene said he\u2019s self-employed with investment income, and he wants to take a shot at getting his plan to fix the economy through Congress. He lives in Kenne\u00adsaw but said he will move to Rome if he wins. If he loses, he\u2019ll move to Tennessee and run there.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been in office for six or seven years and you haven\u2019t done what you said you wanted to do, you should get out and let someone else give it a go,\u201d Levene said.\n\nGraves, of Ranger, is a former state legislator who was first elected in 2010 to fill the seat vacated by now-governor Nathan Deal. He\u2019s easily won re-elections, running as a \u201cpro-life, pro-gun, tax-cutting constitutional conservative,\u201d and said he wants to continue in that mold.\n\n\u201cMy overall goal is to expand freedoms for all of the 14th District and guarantee everyone can pursue their American Dream,\u201d he said.\n\nGraves sits on the House Appropriations Committee, and he said his goal is to be \u201ca new breed of appropriator,\u201d who saves money rather than spends it.\n\nTargeted for cuts are the incentives for states to adopt Common Core educational standards \u2014 even though Georgia is one of those states.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should ease out of the role of education and leave it to the states and local communities,\u201d Graves said.\n\nHe also points with pride to his legislation to defund Obamacare \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and another piece that freezes congressional pay. So far, the Republican-controlled Congress has failed to pass anything to weaken the ACA, but the freeze, initiated last year, will remain intact this year.\n\nFor Tuck, that\u2019s not good enough. He said Graves talks like a conservative, but fails to follow through.\n\nAs an example, Tuck said, Graves opposed Planned Parenthood, illegal immigration and the Export-Import Bank, which is a federally backed credit agency for foreign buyers of U.S. goods. But the congressman voted to fund them all in the latest omnibus spending bill.\n\n\u201cThe people of the 14th District are noticing it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors,\u201d Tuck said.\n\nIf elected, he said he would be the conservative lawmaker Graves purports to be \u2014 even to voting against the whole spending bill if it contains money to enable Planned Parenthood operations.\n\n\u201cYes. I would,\u201d Tuck said. \u201cIt brought some good things to Georgia, but there was more bad in that bill than good.\u201d\n\nLevene said there are many smaller issues, but he wants to first devote all his energy to protecting the United States from what he contends is an imminent collapse of the global economy.\n\n\u201cEverything is money-driven,\u201d he said, so the answer is a simple change of the tax code \u2014 eliminating corporate taxes on profits from items manufactured in the country. That would bring back the factory jobs lost to foreign countries in recent years, he said, and strengthen the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. was strong when we did our own manufacturing and the world revolved around the dollar,\u201d Levene said. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to fix, but Graves and the others down there are not interested. You have to think outside the box. Otherwise, you become part of the establishment, and look where that got us.\u201d\n\nHis plan for the tax-code tweak is why Levene says it does not matter what state he runs for office in.\n\n\u201cCongress isn\u2019t about Northwest Georgia issues; you have local and state governments for that. It\u2019s about national issues. When you go to D.C., everyone goes into the same building,\u201d he said.\n\nFor his part, Graves said he can focus on both national and local issues \u2014 and does.\n\nHe has a laundry list of goals, ranging from solving the debt crisis and transforming the healthcare system to strengthening the military. But he said he also has three teen children and a wife who teaches school in Gordon County.\n\n\u201cMy family still lives there. I still live there. I come home every week,\u201d Graves said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not a citizen-legislator, I\u2019m not being a good dad. I\u2019m at all the ball games, the soccer, the track meets. We go to church in Calhoun. When I\u2019m not in D.C., I\u2019m out in the community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "Two men are challenging U.S. Rep.
