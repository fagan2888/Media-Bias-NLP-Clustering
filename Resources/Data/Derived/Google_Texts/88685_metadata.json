Deploying teams of physicians, nurses and emergency care workers gives seniors healthcare \u201cthat anticipates their needs,\u201d monitoring vital signs, diagnosing and treating small problems, helping with medications and also offering a meaningful social support on a regular basis.\n\nThere is clear evidence for the benefits of home-based medicine and demand from seniors who are aging in place, Row said. \u201cPatients do not want to be institutionalized. Hospitals are dangerous places, especially for the frail elderly. The field of geriatrics suggests that frail elderly should not be anywhere near the hospital unless they have to be. Nobody wants to go an ER or be hospitalized,\u201d said Row, who previously led hospitals Maryland, including Calvert Memorial.\n\nOne of many Medicare pilot programs in the Affordable Care Act, the three-year Independence at Home demonstration was launched in 2012 to test the effectiveness of comprehensive primary care provided to high-cost, high-risk and home-limited seniors with comorbidities at home. Among the 15 participating providers were a mix of major hospital systems, and dedicated private practices, such as the Cleveland Clinic, North Shore Long Island Jewish Health Care, Housecall Providers Inc. in Oregon and and the Visiting Physicians Association, in Michigan, Wisconsin and Texas.\n\nAs Row sees it, the federal government is catching up. But with the goal of value-based payments, that\u2019s changing.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services put the providers in the Independence demonstration to the task of establishing a solid evidence base for home-based healthcare, in terms of reducing hospitalizations and high-cost interventions, and Row believes it will lead to dedicated Medicaid reimbursement.\n\nThe providers in Independence at Home are performing longitudinal home visits and reporting on quality metrics and patient satisfaction. The Independence providers are tasked with being self-financing, receiving no upfront payments that are used in some other demonstration programs. Those that save 5 percent or more of the patients population\u2019s baseline pre-demonstration Medicare costs can share savings with Medicare.\n\nDepending on the results of those demonstrations, and Row says early evidence is promising, Independence at Home could become a permanent Medicare benefit, if it were added by Congress. Or, it could be added by regulation specifically for Medicare ACOs. CMS could \u201cencourage every ACO to have one of these programs for its high cost patients,\u201d through either a direct incentive or by contract. The new chronic care coordination payment could also \u201cbring in enough revenue to help these payments break-even.\u201d\n\nSome of the Medicare ACOs actually did have house calls programs, Row said, and \u201cthe results were very strong for these Pioneer ACOs,\u201d including the Montefiore-North Shore-LIJ ACO, which saved $3.5 million in its first year.\n\nA number of health systems are also offering good home medicine options, even under fee-for-service environments. In greater Chicago, the Cadence Physician Group, a part of Northwestern Medicine, is developing a comprehensive program to capitalize on the patient demand for more convenient care. Cadence primary care docs and NPs will visit seniors in homes and assisted living centers and provide everything from EKGs and ultrasounds to immunizations and palliative medicine for those at the end of their lives.\n\nHealth systems can get an ROI with home care medicine by capitalizing on readmissions reductions, whether in Medicare ACOs, Medicare Advantage contracts or with their own Medicare Advantage plans. But \u201cunless there is some kind of managed care option or ACO option, they will have to find a way of cross subsidizing,\u201d Row said. Medicare Advantage plans especially \u201cneed to take advantage of this model,\u201d she argued. \u201cThey do have the flexibility,\u201d and also the membership \u2014 some 17 million seniors, a third of Medicare beneficiaries, and growing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of evolving,\u201d Row said of the state of American home care medicine. \u201cWe are now beginning to see the emergence of large companies and smaller practices. Larger companies are likely to play a real role in providing the infrastructure, and make the best practices more replicable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/home-care-20-reform-creates-biz-case", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/electric-wheelchair-caption_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Home-based medicine is poised to fix the crises in American healthcare, and old and new companies are getting ready.", "title": "Home-care 2.0: Reform creates a biz case"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/electric-wheelchair-caption_0.gif"}, "title": "Home-care 2.0: Reform creates a biz case", "description": "Home-based medicine is poised to fix the crises in American healthcare, and old and new companies are getting ready.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "When results of the Medicare Independence at Home Demonstration are released this spring, advocates are hopeful that the data will go a long way to expanding the field and reimburse for it.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf076\"", "article_summary": "Health systems can get an ROI with home care medicine by capitalizing on readmissions reductions, whether in Medicare ACOs, Medicare Advantage contracts or with their own Medicare Advantage plans.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of evolving,\u201d Row said of the state of American home care medicine.\nThe Independence providers are tasked with being self-financing, receiving no upfront payments that are used in some other demonstration programs.\nMedicare Advantage plans especially \u201cneed to take advantage of this model,\u201d she argued.\nThere is clear evidence for the benefits of home-based medicine and demand from seniors who are aging in place, Row said."}
