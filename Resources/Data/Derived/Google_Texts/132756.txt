Storms will try to fire in western Oklahoma Friday afternoon and then drift east later in the day.

Fridayâ€™s storms pose a risk for damaging hail, winds and a couple of tornadoes. Flooding will continue to be a risk from these storms, especially in central Oklahoma where the ground is the most saturated.

The risk of severe weather on Friday is conditional. Rain that lingers on in the morning and into the day could cut back on storm development.

Saturday will again pose a risk of severe storms across Oklahoma.
