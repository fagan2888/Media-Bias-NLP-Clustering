Radosta called the victim\u2019s recollection of the encounter \u201chighly suspect.\u201d\n\nDuring closing arguments, jurors watched surveillance video that showed Perez grabbing the woman\u2019s hand, as she tried to push him away.\n\nProsecutors said Perez then pulled the woman into a men\u2019s restroom, where he pressed her face against a stall and sexually assaulted her.\n\nWithin minutes, another man in the restroom heard the woman crying and saying \u201cplease stop,\u201d before knocking on the stall. Another video showed Perez bounding down stairs through the casino and running outside of the building. He was arrested two weeks later at his Las Vegas home.\n\nDistrict Judge David Barker is scheduled to sentence Perez in August. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years to life in prison on the sexual assault charge alone.\n\nContact reporter David Ferrara at dferrara@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-1039.
