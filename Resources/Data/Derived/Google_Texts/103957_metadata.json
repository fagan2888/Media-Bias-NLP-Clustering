That means that the majority of those signing up for Obamacare had previous insurance of some kind\u2014whether they were kicked off their old policies, or they found a better deal on the exchanges.\n\nRelated: Uninsured Are Still Unaware of Obamacare Deadline\n\nWhile the number of previously uninsured enrollees is low, the survey does not include those who are now eligible for Medicaid. So the number is likely larger since under the expanded Medicaid program the Obama administration estimates that about 9 million people have been deemed eligible.\n\nThe private consulting firm is the first to offer an answer to one of the biggest mysteries surrounding the Obamacare rollout: Is it actually helping to expand coverage to the uninsured? The administration has not been tracking this information, though it\u2019s a key metric in determining whether the law is meeting its goals.\n\n\u201cThat's not a data point we are really collecting in any sort of systematic way,\u201d Gary Cohen, a top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), told an audience at a health policy conference in Washington on Thursday.\n\nRelated: Top 10 Questions Consumers Ask About Obamacare\n\nThe administration has so far provided numbers only for people who have selected plans on the health exchanges. The figures don\u2019t include how many uninsured have received coverage. They also don\u2019t include an estimate of how many enrollees have paid for their policies \u2013 a crucial piece of information to assess how the risk pools are actually shaping up.\n\nThe McKinsey survey found that about 75 percent of enrollees have paid their premiums. That\u2019s similar to previous estimates from insurers who have said about 20 percent have not paid.\n\nIn response to the new survey, CMS officials said they\u2019re ramping up their outreach efforts \u2013 especially to uninsured individuals \u2013 in the final weeks of the open enrollment period, which ends March 31.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing increased interest in marketplace plans across the country as we enter the final weeks of open enrollment,\u201d said CMS in a statement. \u201cOutreach is occurring in every state with a particular emphasis on areas with the highest population of the uninsured using a mix of grassroots activities and advertising.\u201d\n\nThe president himself has been reaching out to the Hispanic community to sign up for health insurance ahead of the deadline, since Hispanics represent 25 percent of the 38 million eligible uninsured. Nearly all of the issues with the Spanish-language exchange websites have been fixed, Obama has said \u2013 and he warned that if people waited too long, the system could crash at the end of the month.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation has found that awareness of the new law among the uninsured remains particularly low. Some 76 percent of Americans without coverage said they still didn\u2019t know the deadline to sign up for coverage. Moreover, just 12 percent of uninsured respondents said they knew \u201ca lot\u201d about Obamacare, while 24 percent knew \u201csome\u201d information about the law, 36 percent knew \u201ca little,\u201d and 26 percent knew \u201cnothing at all.\u201d\n\nOther studies have found that people at/or below the poverty line without insurance were less likely to know about the law than others.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The entire goal of Obamacare was to expand health coverage to the uninsured\u2014but the ma", "title": "Obamacare May Be Failing the Uninsured", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/09/Obamacare-May-Be-Failing-Uninsured", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12042013_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/09/Obamacare-May-Be-Failing-Uninsured", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12042013_Obama.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The entire goal of Obamacare was to expand health coverage to the uninsured\u2014but the ma", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1da0\"", "article_summary": "Related: Uninsured Are Still Unaware of Obamacare DeadlineWhile the number of previously uninsured enrollees is low, the survey does not include those who are now eligible for Medicaid.\nThat\u2019s according to a new survey from the McKinsey consulting firm, which found that just 27 percent of the 4 million Obamacare enrollees were previously uninsured.\nThe entire goal of Obamacare was to expand health coverage to the uninsured\u2014but the majority of people who have signed up for Obamacare already had insurance.\nThe private consulting firm is the first to offer an answer to one of the biggest mysteries surrounding the Obamacare rollout: Is it actually helping to expand coverage to the uninsured?\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation has found that awareness of the new law among the uninsured remains particularly low."}
