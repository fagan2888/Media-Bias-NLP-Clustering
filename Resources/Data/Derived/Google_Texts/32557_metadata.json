LHB developed and manages the site in collaboration with the Urban Land Institute of Minnesota.\n\nWhile this initiative is helping communities monitor their sustainability, the idea of measuring and tracking performance has helped LHB survive the Great Recession, and promises to help build revenues into the future.\n\n\u201cArchitecture and construction companies got hit harder than almost anyone,\u201d said Bill Bennett, LHB\u2019s longtime CEO, noting that many companies failed to make it beyond the downturn.\n\nInstead, LHB has thrived.\n\nThe company, which was founded in Duluth in 1966 with seven people, was the 45th fastest-growing design company in the nation last year. Since 2012, the company has grown from about 160 to 250 employees, mostly by adding employees in the engineering, energy and infrastructure sectors.\n\nFunding for the Regional Indicators Initiative comes from the cities, which pay about $500 per city per year of data, Carter said, but there are other sources of income, including state agencies such as the Department of Commerce and the MPCA. Private nonprofits, including the Mc\u00adKnight Foundation and Great Plains Institute, have provided support, as well.\n\nBennett and Carter say that the program has many intangible benefits.\n\nThe project regularly puts the company at the front of the room at various meetings, including the Regional Council of Mayors, city councils and environmental commissions in those 22 participating cities. The initiative also helps raise the company\u2019s profile before the Metropolitan Council and among state senators, representatives and at national and regional conferences throughout the country.\n\n\u201cThe High Performance focus, including the Regional Indicators Initiative, has helped us maintain a steady market in the architecture and building sectors,\u201d Carter said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A growing number of Minnesota cities are using an innovative new website to be more green, and the company that developed that site is reaping its own rewards.", "title": "Staying in the 'green' pays off for Duluth firm", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/staying-in-the-green-pays-off-for-duluth-firm/267713921/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140571892546068.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140571892546068.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A growing number of Minnesota cities are using an innovative new website to be more green, and the company that developed that site is reaping its own rewards.", "title": "Staying in the 'green' pays off for Duluth firm", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/staying-in-the-green-pays-off-for-duluth-firm/267713921/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140571892546068.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140571892546068.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A growing number of Minnesota cities are using an innovative new website to be more green, and the company that developed that site is reaping its own rewards."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbbd\"", "article_summary": "A growing number of Minnesota cities are using an innovative new website to be more green, and the company that developed that site is reaping its own rewards.\n\u201cThe High Performance focus, including the Regional Indicators Initiative, has helped us maintain a steady market in the architecture and building sectors,\u201d Carter said.\nThe company, which was founded in Duluth in 1966 with seven people, was the 45th fastest-growing design company in the nation last year.\nRick Carter, LHB\u2019s executive vice president and a performance metrics expert, led the effort to collect, summarize and measure that data.\nSince 2012, the company has grown from about 160 to 250 employees, mostly by adding employees in the engineering, energy and infrastructure sectors."}
