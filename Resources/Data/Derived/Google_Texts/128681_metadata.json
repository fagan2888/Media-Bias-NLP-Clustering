Tickets, which are $25 for the presentation and $120 for the presentation and dinner, are still available.\n\nScully has helped launch several companies in the last few years, including RX Advance, which aims to reduce pharmaceutical costs for chronic care patients.\n\nChronic care patients account for only about 5 percent of patients, but for about half of the country\u2019s health care costs, Sculley said. By using high-powered computer systems, RX Advance has been able to significantly reduce patients\u2019 prescription drug bills.\n\nSculley said the savings can be achieved by tracking and analyzing relevant data, including whether patients take their prescribed pills, how many pills they are taking, the potential drug interactions and how many specialists they\u2019re seeing.\n\nThe data have been available, Sculley said, but until now health care companies have failed to use them to personalize the medication therapies for chronic care patients.\n\nHealth care mergers\n\nPassage of the Affordable Care Act has prompted more consolidation in the health care industry, including the proposed mergers of four of the five big insurance companies, Sculley said.\n\nWhile in Louisville, Sculley will have dinner with Bruce Broussard, CEO of Humana, which is in a deal to be acquired by Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna.\n\nAccording to Sculley, Obamacare is a poorly drafted piece of legislation, and the original projections from the government about the legislation\u2019s cost have turned out to be wrong. Health care companies have incurred much higher costs than expected, he said, and so they are merging to cut costs.\n\nMany young people were expected to sign up for health insurance and offset the higher costs of some of the older and sicker patients, Sculley said, but many young people simply have opted to pay a penalty rather than sign up for insurance.\n\n\u201cThe government assumptions were just plain wrong,\u201d Sculley said.\n\nInsurers including Humana have said that medical claims related to Affordable Care Act-compliant plans have exceed the premiums they have collected. Some companies are considering whether to continue to participate in the health care exchanges.\n\nHowever, Sulley also said he doubts the Affordable Care Act will be repealed. Instead, the legislation will be modified, and it will need innovative approaches from companies including Humana to get costs under control.\n\nHospitals, too, will continue to consolidate, he predicted, and more health care will be delivered in small clinics rather than giant hospitals. Telemedicine, or getting medical care remotely via phones or tablets, also will continue to grow in popularity.\n\nSculley, 76, said he remains motivated to make a difference because of his good health, his curiosity and because of lessons he learned in the 1980s from the late Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, and Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft. The two tech entrepreneurs said at the time that they were focused on the noble cause of empowering knowledge workers with the tools of the mind \u2014 personal computers \u2014 to improve their productivity and change lives.\n\nSculley and his wife, Diane, a mathematician and computer scientist, have a home in Palm Beach, Fla., but spend only about 30 percent of their time there. He said he and his wife love the challenge of being part of teams that are trying to fundamentally change health care delivery, which will have an enormous impact on society for many generations.\n\nSculley was born in New York City, obtained an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business and, at 37, became Pepsi\u2019s youngest president. Sculley also recently published the book \u201cMoonshot: Game Changing Strategies to Build Billion Dollar Businesses.\u201d\n\nThe World Affairs Council of Kentucky and Southern Indiana is hosting the upcoming presentation as part of its World @ Home monthly speaker series.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "description": "Former Apple CEO: Health care companies must focus on innovation and tech to gain control of the unsustainable cost structure in the $2.5 trillion industry.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "Former Apple CEO: Health care companies must focus on innovation and tech to gain control of the unsustainable cost structure in the $2.5 trillion industry.", "title": "Former Apple CEO: Health care industry needs more innovation - Insider Louisville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/health-cost.jpg", "height": 435}, "url": "http://insiderlouisville.com/business/former-apple-ceo-healthcare-industry-needs-more-innovation/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1496697903875229}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/InsiderLouisville", "section": "Business", "tag": "World Affairs Council of Kentucky and Southern Indiana", "published_time": "2016-03-17T11:00:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Health care mergersPassage of the Affordable Care Act has prompted more consolidation in the health care industry, including the proposed mergers of four of the five big insurance companies, Sculley said.\nChronic care patients account for only about 5 percent of patients, but for about half of the country\u2019s health care costs, Sculley said.\nHealth care companies must focus more on innovation and technology if they want to gain control of the unsustainable cost structure in the $2.5 trillion industry, according to former Apple CEO John Sculley.\nHealth care companies have incurred much higher costs than expected, he said, and so they are merging to cut costs.\nHospitals, too, will continue to consolidate, he predicted, and more health care will be delivered in small clinics rather than giant hospitals."}
