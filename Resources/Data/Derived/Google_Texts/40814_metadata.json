That left a few thousands students in the lurch, and thus eligible to have their debt forgiven. But this week's announcement expanded the offering to 350,000 former Corinthian students, if they can prove malfeasance on the part of the college when it recruited them. That could dispose of as much as $3.5 billion in student debt \u2014 the biggest such forgiveness in U.S. history.\n\nAnd the specific mechanics of the plan go even further, offering debt forgiveness to any student from any for-profit and nonprofit institution who can demonstrate harm.\n\nUnfortunately, we need to go further still. For one thing, the plan's details are pretty labyrinthine. But the deeper problem is this: It's basically impossible to get rid of student debt by filing for bankruptcy.\n\nRelated: The 10 Colleges That Deliver the Biggest Bang for Your Buck\n\nTechnically, you can do it. But the federal government has introduced so many hurdles and hoops and delays that student debt is effectively un-killable. If the activists looking to do something about student debt want a big fish to fry, rewriting the bankruptcy code so it treats that debt like all other debt is as worthwhile a goal as any.\n\nThere's a buried assumption in the White House's plan that the debt that deserves forgiveness is the debt that was incurred thanks to criminal deceit. The unspoken corollary of that, of course, is that debt that's legally above-board should always be paid off.\n\nHere's the thing, though: Debt is always a gamble, on the part of the the person or entity loaning the money as well as the person or entity borrowing it. Whenever you loan, you're placing a bet that some chunk of the economy \u2014 be that chunk a big corporation, a small start-up firm, a family, or even an individual \u2014 will economically perform in such a way that it can pay you the interest and the principal. And no one is entitled to having all their economic bets pay off. This is why investments in debt like bonds and mortgages and so forth are rated for their risk: We just take it as a given that some of this debt will fall through.\n\nFraming it that way probably tastes bad to most Americans. We tend to moralize debt \u2014 an obligation that must be paid off as a matter of honor. But it takes two to tango, and creditors are also taking a risk when they loan. They're as responsible as anyone for making sure the risks they take aren't stupid, and for paying a price when they are.\n\nRelated: 10 Colleges That Deliver the Least Bang for Your Tuition Buck\n\nThe moralization of debt essentially introduces a cultural thumb on the scale in favor of creditors over debtors. And that should worry us in moral terms, since debtors tend to be much less powerful and wealthy than the people they owe money to.\n\nThe funny thing is, while America's moral norms may be unforgiving about debt, our actual bankruptcy law is far more humane. As Megan McArdle has pointed out, our approach to bankruptcy is considerably more generous than the way it generally functions in Europe, and this comes with a lot of aggregate economic benefits. \"Less onerous bankruptcy procedures boost rates of entrepreneurship,\" McArdle wrote. \"Reduce the cost of failure, and people become more willing to take risks. America's business environment is much more dynamic than that of Europe or Japan, for many reasons \u2014 and our generosity to capitalism's losers is one of them.\"\n\nObviously, for the markets to function, you want to incentivize against creditors indulging in debt that's too burdensome and extractive, and you want to incentivize against debtors getting out from under their obligations too easily. That's tricky, since debt contracts are inescapably a legal construct, which means how we structure those incentives often boils down to political choices. But it looks like America has done a better job threading the needle between those two countervailing needs than other western countries.\n\nNow, you could argue that, because the government subsidizes student debt, it should be treated differently by the bankruptcy code. But it's not clear why the second point should follow from the first. The subsidization doesn't change the fundamental give-and-take between creditors and debtors. Having the government perpetually extract debt service from people is no better than having private actors do it.\n\nRelated: The 15 Best Pieces of Career Advice for New Graduates\n\nFurthermore, all markets are just information processors. And the purpose of any market is to allocate scarcity. If what we want to do is make something (like education) less scarce, and thus make it more affordable, subsidizing the debt necessary to purchase it is a really terrible, inefficient, roundabout way of going about it. It introduces all sorts of weird complications and possible short circuits into the mix. (See: the housing crisis.) If we think higher education is an intrinsic good or even a universal right \u2014 and that debate is its own can of worms \u2014 the economically quick and clean way to make it less scarce is to just subsidize it directly. Reverse the long fall in public funding for colleges and universities, so more of their operating costs are born by the government and the price tag of a college education comes down.\n\nIn fact, the government's contribution to the student debt industry is now so bloated and inefficient that an equivalent sum could more or less make some form of higher education free for every person in the country.\n\nBut if we're not willing to call a spade a spade, then bringing bankruptcy's treatment of student debt more in line with how it treats other forms of debt is a good interim goal.\n\nIntentionally or not, Americans have developed a bankruptcy code that treats most debt in an unusually sane way \u2014 both in economic and moral terms. We should take our own advice, and treat student debt the same way.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Week.\n\nRead more from The Week:\n\nBack in Iraq: What on Earth is President Obama thinking?\n\nWhy Jeb Bush once thought it was cool to shame single moms\n\nThe New York Times discovers Marco Rubio is a human from Earth", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This week, the Obama administration", "title": "Why Student Loans Should Be Treated Like Every Other Debt", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/12/Why-Student-Loans-Should-Be-Treated-Every-Other-Debt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/student_loan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/12/Why-Student-Loans-Should-Be-Treated-Every-Other-Debt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/student_loan.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This week, the Obama administration", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0c9\"", "article_summary": "Now, you could argue that, because the government subsidizes student debt, it should be treated differently by the bankruptcy code.\nThat could dispose of as much as $3.5 billion in student debt \u2014 the biggest such forgiveness in U.S. history.\nThis week, the Obama administration made a bold move in the ongoing saga over the country's $1.2 trillion student debt crisis.\nBut the federal government has introduced so many hurdles and hoops and delays that student debt is effectively un-killable.\nBut the deeper problem is this: It's basically impossible to get rid of student debt by filing for bankruptcy."}
