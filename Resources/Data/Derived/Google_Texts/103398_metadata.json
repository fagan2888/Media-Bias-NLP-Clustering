The New England Patriots\u2019 quarterback appealed his 4-game suspension on June 23, arguing his innocence in the football cheating scandal for nearly 11 hours!\n\nIn the latest chapter \u201cDeflate-Gate,\u201d Tom Brady, 37, appealed the punishment the NFL handed to the Superbowl Champion for his role in the scandal that rocked the football world. With his lawyer, Jeffrey Kessler, Tom met with the higher-ups with the NFL to argue that his suspension was unfair and he should be allowed to play!\n\nTom and Jeffrey argued with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and representatives from the NFL Player\u2019s Union for close to 11 hours on June 23, reports Time magazine. While the exact details of what was said during this marathon appeal are not known, Tom\u2019s lawyer reportedly said, \u201cI think we put in a very compelling case.\u201d\n\nTom and his lawyer said that the evidence collected by NFL investigator Theodore Wells doesn\u2019t prove that Tom violated any NFL rules, and that the punishment issued to Tom is harsher than what has been handed out for similar violations. Tom was suspended for 4 games and his team was both fined $1 million dollars and docked a pair of draft picks.\n\nDuring the appeal, Tom was reportedly his \u201cgreatest ally,\u201d sources told ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter. The New England Patriots\u2019 quarterback was \u201cgenuine,\u201d \u201cearnest\u201d and very \u201cpersuasive.\u201d Tom addressed every issue raised by Wells\u2019s 200+ page report. That\u2019s probably why it took nearly 11 hours to get through it all!\n\nNow, it\u2019s a waiting game. Tom needs to be patient and hope that his appeal changed Roger Goodell\u2019s mind. However, the Patriots\u2019 training camp starts in just five weeks! The team needs to know ASAP if they need to know if Tom\u2019s eligible to play quarterback at the start of the season or if they need to start someone else!\n\nTom isn\u2019t letting his suspension stop him from having a good time. He got down with his (awkward) bad self on the dance floor during the New England Patriots\u2019 Super Bowl ring ceremony on June 14. Though Tom is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, he is a bit dorky when it comes to dancing. He pulled off some interesting moves during the celebration, all in the view of Wiz Khalifa!\n\nDo you think Tom will win his appeal, HollywoodLifers? Or will he have to serve his suspension?\n\n\u2014 Jason Brow\n\nJavaScript is required to load the comments.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Hollywood Life", "twitter": {"image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/tom-brady-deflategate-scandal-suspension-patriots-ftr.jpg", "description": "Tom Brady is not letting \u2018Deflate-Gate\u2019 go without a fight!
