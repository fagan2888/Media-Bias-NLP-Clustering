The overall share of Americans in the labor force ticked up 0.2 of a percentage point to 62.9 percent.\n\n\u201cThat has been the shadow hanging over all the other labor force statistics,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Keefe, director of economic policy at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, said of the stubbornly low participation rate.\n\nDespite the improved economic picture, there is still plenty of distress and anger, emotions that have helped spur the success of the Republican presidential front-runner, Donald J. Trump, and rallied many Democrats behind the underdog Bernie Sanders\u2019s attacks on inequality and Wall Street cronyism.\n\nPart of the reason is the unevenness of the recovery. Fortunes have diverged depending on where people live, their education and skill levels and what industry they work in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are seeing job growth across a range of industries, but we\u2019re also seeing a polarization in the labor market,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, chief economist for the job site Indeed.\n\nThere has been vigorous demand for hospitality and service workers, often at low wages. But the higher total job count masks losses in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and energy, better-paying industries that tend to be dominated by blue-collar white men who have been particularly battered by shifts in the American economy.\n\nThe mining industry, for example, continues to bleed jobs, with a loss of 19,000 in February, while manufacturing lost 16,000.\n\n\u201cWorking people in states like Michigan and Ohio feel the lousy manufacturing job loss and growing trade deficit with China, even if Wall Street and D.C. do not,\u201d Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering why there\u2019s so much interest in political insurgencies among both Democrats and Republicans this year, here\u2019s your answer.\u201d\n\nAnd while employment has been advancing at a robust pace for more than two years, many workers continue to complain about low pay, or jobs beneath their skill levels.\n\n\u201cWhy do we have this persistent gloom about the economy, when you have below-average unemployment rates?\u201d asked Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. \u201cIt is really a product of anxiety about what we call the middle-class squeeze, the ability of your income and wages to keep up with the staples of a middle-class life.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf you look at many Trump voters, they generally are people who have not been winning economically for a long time as the country is diversifying,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. Whites without a college education provide the core of support for Mr. Trump.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and now president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy research organization, agreed that stalled incomes were a persistent source of dissatisfaction. \u201cGetting wage growth up more rapidly is the key thing,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, if steady job growth continues and wages pick up in response to a tighter labor market, it could change views about the economy and influence the political dynamic. In previous elections, the direction of the economy in the months leading up to the vote has been perhaps the single most important factor affecting whether Americans opt for continuity or change.\n\nThe brisk hiring since the Affordable Care Act went into effect also serves to undermine the Republican argument that the measure has stripped millions of jobs from the economy.\n\n\u201cOur businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that \u2018job killing\u2019 Obamacare bill,\u201d for a total of 14.3 million private sector jobs, President Obama told reporters at the White House.\n\nThomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, underscored the point. \u201cThere\u2019s an undeniable Eeyore caucus out there of fear-mongers and fact-deniers who want people to believe there is no job creation,\u201d he said.\n\nCertainly, the law is spurring job creation in the health care industry, with 38,000 jobs added in February.\n\nEdward Fleischman, chief executive of the Execu/Search Group, a professional recruiting firm based in New York, said he had seen outsize demand for health care professionals, including urgent care physicians, nurses, therapists and technicians. \u201cA lot of that has to do with Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Fleischman, whose firm opened three new offices last year, added that hiring \u2014 particularly for digitally adept workers \u2014 had been strong across the board.\n\nFriday\u2019s report is the first of three estimates of February\u2019s job creation by the Labor Department. Revisions for December and January showed a total of 30,000 more jobs than previously reported.\n\nWilliam Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., contrasted the palpable dissatisfaction of many voters with the record of unbroken job creation. \u201cThis is one of those times when the economic cycle has hit a weird political cycle,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160304050610, "twitter": {"description": "The government said employers added 242,000 workers last month, highlighting the labor market\u2019s steady gains.
