Donald Trump Donald TrumpSanders laughs off Trump's third-party question Sanders: Clinton showing 'tinge of arrogance' Trump and Sanders whip up debate buzz MORE said that \u201cit sounds like another mental health problem,\u201d Ben Carson said that the issue centered around the \u201cmentality of the people,\u201d and Marco Rubio Marco RubioTrump encourages Rubio to reclaim Senate seat The Trail 2016: Interleague play Rubio: I'd speak on Trump's behalf at convention MORE called the matter a \u201cserious societal issue,\u201d while noting the possibility of mental health issues playing a role in violence. However, television personalities like John Oliver have doubted the Republicans\u2019 sincerity in pursuing mental health reform, especially that regarding gun violence. Indeed, the record and policy proposals of most leading Republicans indicate their interest in mental health is more of an excuse to not talk about gun control than a genuine effort to develop nuanced systems that reduce the federal budget and protect the safety of the public.\n\nNotwithstanding the serious issues with Donald Trump\u2019s position paper on civilian firearms, Trump ironically appears to have identified the most significant nuances in public policy on mental health and guns. He notes that in spite of the presence of a national background check system, many states fail to put criminal and mental health records into the system. Indeed, according to a Government Accountability Office report, the million mental health records submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) from 2004 to 2011 have reflected largely only the efforts of 12 states. Nearly more than half of all states have increased the number of mental health records by fewer than 100.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis means that because of state laws hindering the federal cataloging of mental health records, federal regulations on mental health and gun control remain grossly ineffective in a great majority of U.S. states. But Trump\u2019s half-hearted exploration of this matter falls flat on its policy prescription, as it merely calls for the \u201cfix(ing) of the system we have and make it work as intended.\u201d At no point has he ever discussed the ramifications of his \u201cpolicy proposal.\u201d So long as state HIPAA laws hinder the federal system, a great expansion of federal power over state gun control systems would be needed to enforce our government\u2019s laws. This runs contrarily to Trump\u2019s rhetoric, as he says in broad, generic terms, that we don\u2019t need to expand the system we have.\n\nFurthermore, some states like South Carolina, the state of the terrorist attack on a Charleston church on June 17, have even repealed regulations requiring identification for pistol purchases. There are numerous other loopholes in states like South Carolina that allow buyers to circumvent background checks. This, and other failures of states to provide adequate measures to enforce federal regulations, is at odds with Trump\u2019s supposedly \u201ccommon sense\u201d proposals, since they ignore the need for the expansion of federal power or federal legislation to enforce Trump\u2019s gun control schemes.\n\nEven given the policy analysis failures of Trump\u2019s positions, other leading Republican contenders for the presidency are far more clearly referring to mental health as an excuse to dodge gun control rather than develop a functional system.\n\nCarson has barely demonstrated any knowledge on the policy issues of national background checks, with what little discussion he devotes to the topic being focused on platitudes that have little relevance to legislative issues of the Congress or the presidency. No discussion is devoted to mental health in his policy position web pages for healthcare and gun control. If anything, his rhetoric hardening his refusal to \u201cweaken the Second Amendment\u201d would make his positions anathema to mental health and firearm reform, given gun rights groups\u2019 opposition to national background checks in spite of widespread public approval.\n\nMuch of the same has been seen among the remaining leaders in the race. Jeb Bush\u2019s pitiful \u201cstuff happens\u201d response is little more than him closing his eyes and hoping that it all goes away. Carly Fiorina\u2019s talk on mental health has largely related to elderly diseases, like Alzheimer\u2019s, that do not play as significant a role in mass shootings. Even in such discussions, she\u2019s demonstrated little awareness of the fact that some federal programs supporting treatment for mental illnesses may pay for themselves. Instead, she\u2019s called for across-the-board cuts to force accountability. Despite her experience in the corporate world, she\u2019s merely paying lip service to the hackneyed clich\u00e9s on \u201cprograms that work\u201d, without demonstrating any awareness on exactly which programs work.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s established platform may not even permit any significant reform to the mental health system. Their politicians have repeatedly engaged in calamitous grandstanding against programs that support the expansion of Medicaid reimbursements, a key problem, among many others, identified by the National Alliance on Mental Illness in the fight for better treatments.\n\nThe Oregon shooting has helped to reignite the discussion on the call for mental health reform on both sides of the aisle. It\u2019s a discussion that is long overdue, but without serious policy proposals from those who helped start the discussion\u2014Republican politicians like Trump, Carson, Fiorina, and Bush\u2014federal reform will go nowhere. Unfortunately, the Republican presidential candidates this year are acting like children in philosophy class\u2014their talk on public policy has been limited to rudimentary discussions and has demonstrated a very limited understanding of the presidency\u2019s required readings of Government Accountability Office reports, scientific papers, and Supreme Court cases.\n\nDoanvo is a research assistant at the Global Initiative for Civil Society and Conflict.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The record and policy proposals of most leading Republicans indicate their interest in mental health is more of an excuse to not talk about gun control", "description": "The record and policy proposals of most leading Republicans indicate their interest in mental health is more of an excuse to not talk about gun control", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The record and policy proposals of most leading Republicans indicate their interest in mental health is more of an excuse to not talk about gun control", "title": "Republican mental health excuse on guns", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/presidential-campaign/256250-republican-mental-health-excuse-on-guns", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/presidential-campaign/256250-republican-mental-health-excuse-on-guns", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-08T17:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Anhvinh Doanvo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-08T17:30:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Donald Trump, Marco Rubio,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/presidential-campaign/256250-republican-mental-health-excuse-on-guns", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The record and policy proposals of most leading Republicans indicate their interest in mental health is more of an excuse to not talk about gun control", "card": "summary", "title": "Republican mental health excuse on guns"}, "dcterms.title": "Republican mental health excuse on guns"}, "article_summary": "The Republican Party\u2019s established platform may not even permit any significant reform to the mental health system.\nThe Oregon shooting has helped to reignite the discussion on the call for mental health reform on both sides of the aisle.\nThe shooting on Oct. 1 in Oregon has been met with a call for reform of the United States\u2019 mental health system by multiple Republican presidential candidates.\nADVERTISEMENTThis means that because of state laws hindering the federal cataloging of mental health records, federal regulations on mental health and gun control remain grossly ineffective in a great majority of U.S. states.\nHowever, television personalities like John Oliver have doubted the Republicans\u2019 sincerity in pursuing mental health reform, especially that regarding gun violence."}
