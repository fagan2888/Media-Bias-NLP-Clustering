Why are we fighting it again?\n\nGWEN IFILL: Lifelong Milwaukee resident Earl Ingram lives on one side of the divide.\n\nEARL INGRAM: Wisconsin has had a terrible history, like many other states in this country, of not being fair when it comes to people of color \u2014 well, not just here, but across the nation, with the conservative reality that has come back.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Keith Best, who left the city for the suburbs in his \u201930s, lives on the other.\n\nKEITH BEST: I saw jobs were leaving, I saw taxes were going up, and I saw the school system was failing, and that\u2019s why I moved out to Waukesha.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Best and Ingram are from the essentially the same place, battleground Wisconsin, minutes away from one another in distance, but miles away in their politics.\n\nIn Milwaukee\u2019s Riverwest at an urban cafe named Coffee Makes You Black, the topic was how to curb neighborhood violence. Thirty children have been shot in the city this year.\n\nKIMBERLY WILLIAMS: It takes politics. It takes churches. It takes every single resource that we have, not out in Waukesha, not in Menomonee Falls, not in Mequon, right here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nGWEN IFILL: By contrast, at Republican Congressman James Sensenbrenner\u2019s community town hall a few miles away, the hot topic was immigration.\n\nCHRIS BAUMAN: I believe it is not only a humanitarian crisis, but it is a national security crisis.\n\nGWEN IFILL: The audiences, black and white, Democrats and Republicans, urban and suburban, reflect a sober truth. Residents of metropolitan Milwaukee, once home to ticket-splitting independent thinkers, no longer view the world through the same lens.\n\nThe city of Milwaukee is majority-minority, 56 percent black and Hispanic, but the minority population in the surrounding suburbs is somewhere in the single digits. And here in southeastern Wisconsin, it goes way beyond race, to social, economic, and partisan segregation.\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s suburbs are redder than almost anywhere else outside the south.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Craig Gilbert, who tracked Wisconsin\u2019s growing polarization in a four-part series for The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said the split widened in 2012. That\u2019s when an effort to recall Republican Governor Scott Walker drove record partisan turnout in the blue cities of Milwaukee and Madison, as well as in the red suburbs clustered around both.\n\nCRAIG GILBERT, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: He\u2019s just so divisive. I mean, it\u2019s just all about how you feel about how he\u2019s governed this state over the past three or four years. And every piece of evidence we have is that it\u2019s almost right down the middle.\n\nGWEN IFILL: One example: Republicans give Walker 91 percent approval rating. Among Democrats, President Obama gets 93 percent.\n\nMAYOR THOMAS BARRETT, D, Milwaukee: All you have to do is look at a map and you can see, in voting results, just how widespread the differences are, and Milwaukee, the city of Milwaukee, a deep, deep blue. You get the outlying areas of Waukesha County, and you can\u2019t get much redder.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Milwaukee Mayor Thomas Barrett has slammed headlong into that partisan wall, running unsuccessfully for governor three times, the last time on the losing end of the effort to recall Republican Walker.\n\nPolarization, he believes, has been driven by the strength of conservative talk radio.\n\nTHOMAS BARRETT: I think it\u2019s horrific economically\u2026\n\nGWEN IFILL: Why?\n\nTHOMAS BARRETT: \u2026 to have that much of a schism. I think it\u2019s bad in terms of race relations. I think it\u2019s bad in terms of growth for the region, because I think if you have got an area that\u2019s pitted against each other, you\u2019re not trying to find the similarities, you\u2019re not trying to find the commonalities that would allow you to work together as a team. And it\u2019s very unfortunate.\n\nGWEN IFILL: The divide is deep and enduring.\n\nCarmen Murguia is a poet who was born on the city\u2019s South Side.\n\nCARMEN MURGUIA: We don\u2019t talk to each other. We \u2014 at least from what I have seen, we keep ourselves separate because we don\u2019t think, A, we\u2019re going to be listened to, other side of the aisle, or understood, or even come to a happy medium.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Sally Kabacinski also grew up in Milwaukee, but now lives in nearby Wauwatosa, Scott Walker\u2019s hometown.\n\nSALLY KABACINSKI: I don\u2019t understand liberalism, because, believe it or not, I was a Democrat. My family was a Democrat. And\u2026\n\nGWEN IFILL: What changed?\n\nSALLY KABACINSKI: Their liberalism.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Republican Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch says Wisconsinites are merely voting with their feet.\n\nLT. GOV. REBECCA KLEEFISCH, R, Wis.: Wisconsin is really no different from the rest of the country. As population trends have evolved over time, so have political trends. And so folks are looking for candidates, leaders, representatives who speak to their wants and needs regardless of geography.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Walker\u2019s move to roll back union protections for public workers, she said, actually helped.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Did that leave the state divided? Because Democrats overwhelmingly wanted to recall the governor; Republicans overwhelmingly didn\u2019t.\n\nLT. GOV. REBECCA KLEEFISCH: You noticed that too.\n\nGWEN IFILL: I did notice that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLT. GOV. REBECCA KLEEFISCH: I think the whole country noticed that.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Yes.\n\nLT. GOV. REBECCA KLEEFISCH: I don\u2019t think it left the state divided. Frankly, I think it left the state in a stronger position than she was in even before.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Try telling that to Keith Schmitz. He spent part of his weekend campaigning for Democrat Mary Burke, who is challenging Walker this fall.\n\nKEITH SCHMITZ: The thing about progress in any state is that, when you divide, you can\u2019t multiply. And things have been rather divisive in this state.\n\nGWEN IFILL: As Walker\u2019s national star has continued to rise, Republicans are eying him as a likely presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nCRAIG GILBERT: Governor Walker has sort of been making the argument to Republicans that you can be a very sort of staunch conservative and still succeed politically.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Or survive, anyway?\n\nCRAIG GILBERT: Or survive anyway in a battleground state. And we will see if that happens.\n\nGWEN IFILL: With 18 terms in Congress, Sensenbrenner has survived.\n\nREP. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, R, Wis.: If you go fishing where the fish are, and the Republicans were turning the votes out in the suburbs, while the Democrats were turning the votes out in the city, and no political party is going to turn, vote south, or go vote the other way.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Five-term Democratic Congresswoman Gwen Moore says the lines have hardened over time, as Republicans deny city residents funding for amenities like public transit.\n\nREP. GWEN MOORE, D, Wis.: It\u2019s not like your ward captain walks up and down the street and says you need to stay in line and vote as a Democrat.\n\nBut I think that when you don\u2019t have the opportunity, you know, like we\u2019re here in the public market, to gather and there be some sort of public forum for exchanging ideas, that it is a lot easier for people to corral you into one type of thinking.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Sheldon Wasserman, a former state assemblyman, describes himself as a moderate Democrat. He tripped into this political chasm in 2008, when he decided to expand his reach and run for state Senate. The bigger district, which stretched across the divide, exposed him to a whole new world.\n\nSHELDON WASSERMAN, D, Former State Assemblyman, Wis.: I represented a district that was educated, progressive, and Republican, and Democratic, but more Republican. And I thought I knew what Republicans were all about and I thought I knew what Democrats were all about.\n\nGWEN IFILL: He lost his race to the Republican incumbent by one point.\n\nIn this environment, both sides admit there is little incentive to find middle ground.\n\nKEITH BEST: I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take to get compromise again, because there\u2019s \u2014 of the polarization. It\u2019s just a tough situation. One side is going to be proven right, and one side is going to be proven wrong. And I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to end up.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Is it a healthy fight?\n\nKEITH BEST: Good question. I can\u2019t answer that. I wish I could.\n\nGWEN IFILL: But with a gubernatorial and presidential race on the horizon, this fractured political landscape could determine outcomes for years in Wisconsin and in Washington.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And back now with Mark Shields and David Brooks.\n\nMark, how typical is this divide that we just \u2014 that Gwen is showing us in Wisconsin in the rest of the country?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: It\u2019s too typical. And just congratulate Gwen on that piece.\n\nShe interview Craig Gilbert of the Milwaukee Sentinel, who pointed out that, in 1994, just 20 years ago, Tommy Thompson, the Republican governor, carried Milwaukee, and Herb Kohl, the Democratic senator, carried Waukesha County, the bedrock Republican \u2014 there was a time when 40 percent of Wisconsin voters split their ballot. That is no longer the case.\n\nAnd you have \u2014 where you have basically in the campaigns in Wisconsin that Gwen was describing are \u2014 it\u2019s army politics. In other words, we\u2019re not interested in persuading anybody on the other side, reaching around and finding common ground with them. We\u2019re just in an army. We\u2019re just mobilizing our troops. That\u2019s what we\u2019re about doing and getting them \u2014 we\u2019re not interested in getting 65 or 70 percent, as Tommy Thompson did. We\u2019re interested in getting 51.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But what changed? In the 20 years, what has happened?\n\nDAVID BROOKS: That\u2019s a good question.\n\nThere\u2019s been this debate among political scientists, is the polarization a Washington phenomenon or is it a national phenomenon? And I used to think it was a Washington phenomenon. It was the people who watch MSNBC and FOX and then all the lobbyists and all the money people.\n\nIt\u2019s now pretty clear that it\u2019s a national phenomenon, and that it\u2019s much more bottom-up than it used to be than top-down. And that may be because the top-down polarized the bottom, but people are moving in with people like themselves. The ideological lines are hardening for a whole bunch of reasons.\n\nThe one thing I would point out in Wisconsin which I\u2019m really struck by is scarcity. Remember why Walker became nationally famous? It because of the pension fights. So, as resources begin to dwindle, some of the fights over those resources get more polarized, whether we\u2019re going to have a lot of city services or a lot of secure state pensions or not. And different populations that live in different areas have vastly different reactions to that scarcity problem, on top of all the ideologicalization that\u2019s going on.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s post-financial collapse and recession?\n\nDAVID BROOKS: I think that\u2019s part of it.\n\nThere\u2019s also an irony that, the more educated a population get, the more polarized it gets, the more ideological people are. So, as the country gets more educated, we also get more ideological.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, we can point to colleges and say that\u2019s where the\u2026\n\nMARK SHIELDS: It is. It all goes back to the campuses and parking spaces problems with faculty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMARK SHIELDS: No.\n\nBut the campaign is not about persuasion. It\u2019s not about saying, I have this in common with you, even though we don\u2019t belong to the same party.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You\u2019re saying\u2026\n\nMARK SHIELDS: And that\u2019s a real difference.\n\nSo you end up only talking to your own people and telling them how good we are and how virtuous and how terrible the other side is and how threatening they are.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you\u2019re saying that\u2019s because people have already made up their minds and they don\u2019t want to hear anything else.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Well, it\u2019s a self-reinforcing phenomenon, if I only talk to other people on the other side.\n\nDAVID BROOKS: Right. If your choice is between refrigerator company A and refrigerator company B, these two polarized options, you will polarize. And that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s happening.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will take the refrigerator company of Shields and Brooks.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.
