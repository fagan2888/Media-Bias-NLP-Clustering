We then allowed for three times the known period of time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC cautions that the link between Zika and birth defects, like microcephaly, still isn't fully understood.\n\n\"I think the evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger. At this point, we're not using causal language, but the evidence is mounting,\" said the CDC's Denise Jamieson.\n\nThe CDC says symptoms appear in only about 20 percent of Zika cases. They typically include rash, fever and joint pain.\n\nCDC officials updated their count Friday to 273 known cases in the U.S. across 35 states.\n\nThis video includes clips from KCNC and images from Getty Images and Edward Boatman / CC BY 3.0.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans who might have been exposed to Zika and are trying to get pregnant should know these new government guidelines.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Americans who might have been exposed to Zika and are trying to get pregnant should know these new government guidelines.", "title": "Sex Can Wait If You've Been Near Zika, CDC Warns", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/sex-can-wait-if-you-ve-been-near-zika-cdc-warns/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1459018133.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Americans who might have been exposed to Zika and are trying to get pregnant should know these new government guidelines.", "title": "Sex Can Wait If You've Been Near Zika, CDC Warns", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/sex-can-wait-if-you-ve-been-near-zika-cdc-warns/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1459018133.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=d0MzdkMjE6pb3tFLxzgAXckst9nvZ2YJ&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://58420", "iphone": "newsy://58420", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://58420", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "Newsy, zika virus, cdc recommendations on zika virus, centers for disease control and the zika virus, cdc zika research, zika and pregnancy, pregnancy complications from zika, zika and birth defects", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1459018133.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1dd9\"", "article_summary": "For others who are diagnosed with or showing symptoms of Zika, the CDC recommends women wait eight weeks before conceiving and men wait six months before having unprotected sex.\nFor those who've traveled to affected areas but aren't showing symptoms, wait eight weeks before trying to get pregnant.\nWe then allowed for three times the known period of time.\"\n\"I think the evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger.\nAmericans who might have been exposed to Zika and are trying to get pregnant should know these new government guidelines."}
