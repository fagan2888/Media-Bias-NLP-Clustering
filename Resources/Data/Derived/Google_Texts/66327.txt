Parts Town Expands Food Facility Services with Another Acquisition

This is the first purchase for Parts Town since getting backed by Summit Partners

Private equity-backed Parts Town LLC purchased North American Commercial Parts and Service Inc. (NACPS) for an undisclosed price. The deal comes more than a year after Summit Partners bought a majority stake in Parts Town, a distributor of maintenance parts to companies in the food services equipment space.

NACPS, headquartered in Windsor, Connecticut, also distributes equipment parts for food companies, as well as repair services for restaurants, hotels, hospitals and schools. The company's operations span California, Florida, Georgia and the New England area and employs more than 150 people. NACPS maintains relationships with many of the leading restaurant equipment manufacturers and operates factory authorized parts and service centers for select original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

The acquisition is part of Parts Town's growth strategy as a distributor of OEM restaurant equipment parts. The Addison, Illinois-based buyer, founded in 1987, has grown to include an eCommerce segment, a group of local field service and parts distribution operations and a list of partners that includes roughly 200 manufacturers of restaurant equipment.

Carter Morse & Mathias served as NACPS's exclusive financial adviser for the transaction. This is the investment bank's second time advising NACPS on a sale. Shipman Goodwin handled legal matters for NACPS, while Weil Gotshal & Manges did the same for Parts Town. Investment bank Metronome Partners advised Parts Town on the deal.
