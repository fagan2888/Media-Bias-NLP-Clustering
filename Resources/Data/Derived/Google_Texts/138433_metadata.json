The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to all forms of protected health information, whether electronic, written, or oral. It is an important tool in helping to protect against health care identity theft.\n\nWhat type of health information has to be kept private?\n\nHIPAA calls it Protected Health Information (PHI), and it includes any individually identifiable information about your health status, health care that you have received, or payment for health care. The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not apply when the information is used as part of a large data set with no identifiers that connect information to individual patients. Also, the HIPPA Privacy Rule does permit release of your medical files for the purposes of coordinating treatment with another provider, payment, or other health care operations.\n\nWho has to keep my medical information private?\n\nThis is a key point. Only \"covered entities\" are bound by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Covered entities include:\n\nindividual health care providers, such as doctors, psychologists, chiropractors, dentists, pharmacists, and nurses.\n\nmedical establishments, such as hospitals, clinics, urgent care centers, and nursing homes\n\nhealth plans, such as health insurance companies, HMOs, company health plans, and certain government programs that pay for health care, including Medicare and Medicaid\n\nhealth care clearinghouses, such as organizations that work with converting health information into electronic format.\n\nImportantly, many entities are not covered by HIPAA. These include your employer, life insurance companies, workers' compensation carriers, and most schools and school districts. Nor does it apply to companies that collect your information through health-tracking apps or activity trakers. And, to the chagrin of many, the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not apply to a friend or family member who breaches your confidence, to your coworker who overhears you talking on the phone, or to the sanitation worker who finds your paperwork in the trash.\n\nHow is the HIPAA Privacy Rule enforced?\n\nThe federal Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which is within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is in charge of enforcement. You, as a consumer, can file a complaint, but you have no standing under this law to sue for a HIPAA Privacy Rule violation. Only the OCR or the U.S. Department of Justice can file an action.\n\n\u2014Susan Feinstein", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "HIPAA, health, privacy, health care, health insurance, Money", "Title": "HIPAA Privacy Rules Explained - Consumer Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2008/12/hipaa/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/etc/designs/cro/application-resources/modules/products/images/missing_thumbnail.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "HIPAA Privacy Rules Explained - Consumer Reports"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2015-07-22T10:00Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2015-07-21T12:48Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: HIPAA Privacy Rules Explained - Consumer Reports", "keywords": "HIPAA, health, privacy, health care, health insurance, Money", "contenttag": "Money", "description": "The HIPAA Privacy Rule causes a lot of confusion among consumers and health care providers.
