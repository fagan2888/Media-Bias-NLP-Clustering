One woman credited the exercise with helping her quit after 35 years of smoking.\u201d\n\nThe free seven-minute \u201cCure Stress\u201d audio exercise is a short version of the longer 30-minute classic observation exercise called \u201cBe Still and Know,\u201d which has been used for years within the military to relieve stress and increase resilience, and even to help with more serious issues like depression, addictions and PTSD.\n\nIn fact, the exercise has been highly endorsed by both the U.S. Army\u2019s top Christian chaplain and its top psychiatrist. Maj. Gen. Douglas L. Carver, the Army\u2019s retired chief of chaplains, called it a \u201cgreat resource for our soldiers,\u201d with Col. John Bradley, M.D., long the chief of psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, concurring.\n\nMaj. Gen. George R. Harris, recently retired from the Office of the Secretary of the Army, told WND \u201cit was fantastic\u201d to be able to give the exercise to stressed-out soldiers returning from deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIn every case I heard of that he went through the process, it was helpful to the soldiers and their wives,\u201d he said.\n\nLikewise, in the civilian world, the technique is valued by physicians and psychiatrists such as George M. Hayter, M.D., chief of psychiatry at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Orange, California.\n\n\u201cI must say, on the basis of 20 years\u2019 experience, that the application of this technique has made a significant contribution to the treatment of the great majority of those people who have learned it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cBe Still and Know\u201d exercise \u2013 like the free seven-minute version called \u201cCure Stress\u201d \u2013 was developed by Roy Masters, who at 86 is the patriarch of stress experts, having taught the method since 1960 to millions. His fans include everyone from movie star John Wayne to Internet journalist Matt Drudge. He also hosts talk radio\u2019s longest-running counseling show, \u201cAdvice Line,\u201d on Talk Radio Network, has authored 18 books and was featured on \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show\u201d to discuss his newest book, \u201cHypnotic States of Americans.\u201d\n\nIn a recent message on Twitter, Masters summed up more than 60 years of work in just 140 characters: \u201cLearn to endure cruelty and injustice without resentment and after the stress has passed you will find the fulfillment you have been seeking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost stress,\u201d Masters told WND, \u201cis simply cruelty, in one form or another, directed at us by other stressed-out human beings, who themselves have been victimized by cruelty and stress in their own pasts.\n\n\u201cImagine, however, that someone said or did something cruel to you, but that you did not react in any way whatsoever \u2013 you did not become upset, resentful or even ruffled. You simply observed that this person was saying or doing something cruel, as though you were calmly observing the scene in a movie. You simply would not be stressed by what would appear to others to be a highly stressful encounter. Stress and cruelty affect us as profoundly as they do only because we react to them resentfully.\u201d\n\nThe exercise works so well, he adds, because \u201cit enables you to become objective, a little bit separate, detached and disentangled from all your troublesome thoughts, emotions, heartaches, fears and traumatic memories \u2013 and that, all by itself, is extremely helpful, and actually healing.\u201d\n\nThe free seven-minute exercise can be downloaded for iPhone and Android here, and can also be accessed online for free here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A popular seven-minute stress-reduction exercise widely used within the U.S. Armed Forces has just been released as a free iPhone and Android app for the general public, under the name \u201cCure Stress.\u201d The app, launched recently by Richard Tytus, M.D., professor of medicine at Canada\u2019s McMaster University, includes guided audio programs that have proven highly [\u2026]", "title": "New smartphone app can \u2018Cure Stress\u2019", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/12/new-smartphone-app-can-cure-stress/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/12/stress3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The \u201cBe Still and Know\u201d exercise \u2013 like the free seven-minute version called \u201cCure Stress\u201d \u2013 was developed by Roy Masters, who at 86 is the patriarch of stress experts, having taught the method since 1960 to millions.\n\u201c\u2018Cure Stress\u2019 acts as a tool for physicians to help patients deal with these issues.\u201dNoting his high success rate with the simple practice, Tytus adds: \u201cPatients regularly tell me how their relationships with family and co-workers are improving.\nIn fact, the exercise has been highly endorsed by both the U.S. Army\u2019s top Christian chaplain and its top psychiatrist.\n\u201cSixty to 80 percent of issues presented to family doctors are stress-related,\u201d says Tytus, who trains incoming family doctors at the Ontario-based university.\nYou simply would not be stressed by what would appear to others to be a highly stressful encounter."}
