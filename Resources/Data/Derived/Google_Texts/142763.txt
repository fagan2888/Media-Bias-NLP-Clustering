Longmont police are investigating a home-invasion robbery Sunday morning during which a 19-year-old man was beaten with a fireplace poker and two vehicles, cash and marijuana were stolen.

Cmdr. Jeff Satur said the robbery happened in the 1200 block of Atwood Street around 5 a.m., but police weren't notified until the man showed up at Longmont United Hospital for treatment.

The man suffered facial bone fractures and lacerations to his head and remained hospitalized Sunday afternoon.

Satur classified the man's injuries as "serious."

Satur said the alleged victim told police that two men dressed in black entered his home, beat him and then stole two vehicles, cash and marijuana from him.

The vehicles are described as a 2001 red Jeep Cherokee four-door with Colorado license plate 917-YYH and a 1997 orange Ford Econoline van with Colorado license plate number 124-IAO.

Police located the Ford van, which had been abandoned, later on Sunday in the 1700 block of Antero Drive.

Satur said the man didn't know if the suspects had weapons other than the fireplace poker, and police believe a third person might be involved.
