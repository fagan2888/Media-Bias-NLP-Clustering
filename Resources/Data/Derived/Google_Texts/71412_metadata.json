Aaron said she was told by the owner of APS that the valet responsible would immediately be fired and was offered a gift certificate for dinner, which she turned down.\n\nAccording to ABC News affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta, the owner of APS Valet confirmed that the valet in question no longer worked at the company and that \"APS does not tolerate racism of any kind whatsoever.\"\n\nAaron said she was bothered that the Spondivits' restaurant had not offered a further apology for the valet's actions.\n\nHome Depot Apologizes for Racist Tweet\n\nAn unidentified restaurant employee at the Spondivits' restaurant declined to comment to ABCNews.com about the incident.\n\nIn a pointed statement posted on Facebook, Spondivits' chef and overseer Glenn Gagne said that the restaurant has \"no tolerance for racism\" and would not talk to news outlets about the case.\n\n\"Spondivits will not tolerate racial speak by employees or customers on our property. We are known for our racial diversity,\" wrote Gagne.\n\nGagne pointed out that the valet was fired within hours of the incident. But he disputes the slur was intentionally left to insult the couple, pointing out that many valets write descriptive details about customers, such as \"leather jacket or white beard,\" to help them remember a car's owner.\n\n\"This valet wrote an unacceptable description on this customer's ticket, but it was not him trying to send a racist message to the customers,\" wrote Gagne. \"He just has poor taste and this cost him his job.\"\n\nAaron said by bringing media attention to the incident she wanted to send a message that racism would not be tolerated in any form.\n\n\"You can't just do things or say things people and think there are no repercussions behind it,\" said Aaron.\n\nNew Map Marks Location of Racist, Hateful Tweets", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Georgia Couple Shocked Over Racial Slur on Valet Ticket", "description": "Georgia Couple Shocked Over Racial Slur on Valet Ticket", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/01/georgia-couple-shocked-over-racial-slur-on-valet-ticket/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "A fun night out turns sour for interracial couple.", "title": "Georgia Couple Shocked Over Racial Slur on Valet Ticket"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae25\"", "article_summary": "Credit: WTVMA Georgia couple was shocked and disgusted to find a racial slur scrawled on a valet ticket after a night out at a local restaurant.\nThe phrase is a racial slur for an interracial couple.\nThe Spondivits restaurant contracts with APS Valet to run their valet service.\n\"This valet wrote an unacceptable description on this customer's ticket, but it was not him trying to send a racist message to the customers,\" wrote Gagne.\n\"I've never had their [valet] tag left on the key,\" said Aaron."}
