Congress has extended the funding for another two years.\n\n\u201cI think [health centers] are a great example of how you meet the needs of a community that otherwise would not have their needs met nearly as effectively,\u201d Blunt said at a press conference held at Affinia Healthcare in north St. Louis.\n\nAffinia, formerly known as Grace Hill Health Centers, operates five clinics that serve about 50,000 patients a year; 96 percent of whom report incomes below the federal poverty line, and more than half are uninsured.\n\nBlunt, a Republican who opposed the Affordable Care Act but has expressed support for some of its provisions, chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services. That committee is in the middle of determining budget appropriations of $1.5 billion for community health centers around the country.\n\nFor clinics like Affinia, those appropriations represent 30 percent of its total funding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increased our workforce by about 45 [people] in the past four years,\u201d said Alan Freeman, Affinia\u2019s president and CEO. That\u2019s a 16 percent staffing increase that includes physicians, dentists and nurses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increased the amount of services we provide in four of our locations, and we\u2019ve remodeled two to increase the patient throughput and the amount of service we can provide.\u201d\n\nThe four federally-qualified health clinic networks based in the city of St. Louis served a total of 130,000 patients in 2013, and Freeman said he expects that number to continue to grow.\n\nThe coming months could be rocky for the health care system: a Supreme Court ruling over the legality of giving income-based subsidies to eight million people who bought health insurance on Healthcare.gov is due in June. If people who purchased insurance there can no longer afford it, their next stop may be community health clinics like Affinia.\n\n\u201cThey will go above and beyond to serve maximum amount of folks they can with the staff and the space they have. But they couldn\u2019t begin to pick up eight million people,\u201d said Dan Hawkins, who heads Public Policy and Research for the National Association of Community Health Centers.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt visited a community health clinic in north St. Louis Thursday and pledged support for the model, which uses federal", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/blunt-expresses-support-community-health-centers-st-louis", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201505/blunt_doctors.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt visited a community health clinic in north St. Louis Thursday and pledged support for the model, which uses federal", "title": "Blunt expresses support for community health centers in St. Louis"}, "story_id": 410383576, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@durrieB"}, "author": "Durrie Bouscaren", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Blunt expresses support for community health centers in St. Louis"}, "nid": 46172, "datePublished": "2015-05-28", "keywords": "health, public health, FQHC\\'s, community health centers, Roy Blunt", "wordCount": 435, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "If people who purchased insurance there can no longer afford it, their next stop may be community health clinics like Affinia.\nBut they couldn\u2019t begin to pick up eight million people,\u201d said Dan Hawkins, who heads Public Policy and Research for the National Association of Community Health Centers.\nThat committee is in the middle of determining budget appropriations of $1.5 billion for community health centers around the country.\nThe Affordable Care Act included an increase in funding to community health centers over the past five years.\nMissouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt visited a community health clinic in north St. Louis Thursday and pledged support for the model, which uses federal funds to provide basic healthcare services for people who are uninsured or living in poverty."}
