Morgan Griffith, R-Va., pressed Slavitt on his previous job at OptumInsight/QSSI and that company\u2019s continuing involvement with HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cHow are you able to manage your former employer, and doesn\u2019t this create a conflict of interest?\u201d Griffith asked Slavitt during the new Obamacare official\u2019s testimony before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.\n\nSlavitt, the new principal deputy administrator at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, didn\u2019t go into specifics, but said he had limited contact with his former employer. He assured Griffith and other subcommittee members that he was taking the proper steps to maintain ethical standards and noted that he had signed an ethics pledge.\n\n\u201cAs a public servant, I have a very clear set of rules to follow,\u201d Slavitt said.\n\nThe Daily Signal previously detailed lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Slavitt\u2019s potential conflict of interest.\n\n>>> Company That \u2018Saved\u2019 HealthCare.gov Faces Questions of Cronyism\n\nCMS, Slavitt\u2019s new employer, is the federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, including the website HealthCare.gov.\n\nSlavitt, 47, joined the Obama administration in June, leaving a job as group vice president at OptumInsight/QSSI to take the No. 2 job at CMS under Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. In 2012, he made the maximum contributions allowed by law to the Obama Victory Fund and Obama for America (now Organizing for Action).\n\nSlavitt told lawmakers yesterday that he rid himself of any financial stakes in OptumInsight/QSSI, including stocks and investments.\n\n>>> Obamacare Official Gets Ethics Waiver as Former Company Faces Scrutiny\n\nOptumInsight/QSSI is the sister company of UnitedHealthcare, a health insurance company that offers plans on both the federal and state-run online insurance exchanges. Both companies are subsidiaries of UnitedHealth Group.\n\nQSSI, which had won a contract with CMS to construct Obamacare\u2019s federal data hub, was acquired by OptumInsight in September 2012, weeks before President Obama\u2019s re-election.\n\nThe Obamacare agency then brought in the renamed OptumInsight/QSSI to \u201csave\u201d HealthCare.gov after its disastrous rollout in October 2013. The company serves as a \u201csenior adviser\u201d on the project.\n\nTypically, those who leave the private sector for posts in the federal government must wait at least one year before engaging in any work involving the previous employer.\n\nAs The Daily Signal previously reported, however, Slavitt received an ethics waiver allowing him to resume work immediately on matters involving his former employer. The waiver, granted July 11 by the Department of Health and Human Services, was made public two weeks ago.\n\nAt issue for lawmakers is UnitedHealthcare\u2019s ability to gain competitive advantage over other insurance companies because of data available to its sister company, OptumInsight/QSSI, as a result of its work on HealthCare.gov and the federal data hub.\n\nAfter UnitedHealth Group acquired QSSI in 2012, HHS officials began designing a firewall to prevent the parent company from obtaining Obamacare-related data from its subsidiary. HHS, however, halted construction of the firewall.\n\nAdministration officials responsible for Obamacare have not responded to questions from Republican lawmakers on completion of the firewall. A spokesman for CMS did not answer The Daily Signal\u2019s questions regarding the technological safeguard.\n\nDuring his questioning, Griffith asked Slavitt about the firewall:\n\nWe have a situation again where there\u2019s an appearance of a conflict or impropriety. \u2026 It would appear that the folks at QSSI who then report at UnitedHealth Group, and if that\u2019s the case, aren\u2019t they able then to gain information on competitors by participating in the process and in all these meetings, and get an advantage over their competitors in the health care websites?\n\nSlavitt sought to clarify the relationship between sister companies UnitedHealthcare and OptumInsight/QSSI, but did not address the subject of the firewall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andy Slavitt runs into sharp questions from a House panel about a potential conflict of interest in his new role as the nation's No. 2 Obamacare official.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Andy Slavitt runs into sharp questions from a House panel about a potential conflict of interest in his new role as the nation's No. 2 Obamacare official.", "title": "Top Obamacare Official Questioned on Potential Conflict", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140731_Slavitt_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-01T15:18:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1pJWLqh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Andy Slavitt runs into sharp questions from a House panel about a potential conflict of interest in his new role as the nation's No. 2 Obamacare official.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140731_Slavitt_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "Top Obamacare Official Questioned on Potential Conflict", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "cronyism,obamacare", "published_time": "2014-08-01T03:00:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-01T15:18:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Andrew Slavitt, Andy Slavitt, Obamacare, Morgan Griffith, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, HHS, UnitedHealthcare, HealthCare.gov"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4b1\"", "article_summary": "During his questioning, Griffith asked Slavitt about the firewall:We have a situation again where there\u2019s an appearance of a conflict or impropriety.\nThe Obamacare agency then brought in the renamed OptumInsight/QSSI to \u201csave\u201d HealthCare.gov after its disastrous rollout in October 2013.\nAdministration officials responsible for Obamacare have not responded to questions from Republican lawmakers on completion of the firewall.\nThe Daily Signal previously detailed lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Slavitt\u2019s potential conflict of interest.\nRep.
