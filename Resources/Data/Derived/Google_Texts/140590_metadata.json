In 2014, it was the only co-op in the country to turn a profit from its plans offered under the new Affordable Care Act.\n\nMichael Gendreau, a spokesman for the insurer, said the insurer is not going to close and that state regulators\u2019 scrutiny after 2015\u2019s financial hit \u201cdoes not affect our member\u2019s coverage whatsoever.\u201d\n\nWhen it came on the market, MCHO shot to the top of Maine\u2019s individual health insurance market and was expected to grow to 40,000 members by 2019. It ended February with 84,269 members, according to state regulators. Most members are in Maine, though the exchange also operates in New Hampshire.\n\nWith that growth in members, its total hospital and medical payments ballooned 138 percent as total revenue from premiums grew by about 71 percent. The company\u2019s bottom line has many other factors, but revenue fell below total medical payments last year, a change from 2014, according to the company\u2019s 2015 financial statement.\n\nThe financial shortfall last year caused the insurer to return to the drawing board for its 2017 rates, which it will propose by a deadline in April. Gendreau said the company plans to raise rates but hasn\u2019t determined by how much.\n\nIn the meantime, he said the company will trim administrative costs. Those costs had risen by two-thirds last year to about $48 million from about $29 million in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to minimize expenses as best we can and continue to offer a quality product and quality service,\u201d Gendreau said.\n\nThe state\u2019s Bureau of Insurance said with notification of the losses last fall, it \u201cincreased its level of regulatory supervision to the highest level possible short of a judicial proceeding\u201d and asked the insurer to stop writing new policies.\n\nDoug Dunbar, a spokesman for the insurance bureau, wrote in an email that the state has received more inquiries from the public about MCHO, but \u201chas not experienced an increase in concerns about quality of care or payment of services.\u201d\n\nMCHO curtailed its enrollment early, both directly and through the online health insurance marketplace the federal government runs for Maine and other states.\n\nUnder the higher level of monitoring, MCHO also drafted a detailed financial plan for each month of 2016. In January, the insurer outperformed the plan, state regulators said.\n\nNationally, losses by insurance co-ops have raised concern about their ability to continue to offer plans under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInsurance Journal reported in December that a dozen of the 23 co-ops created under the Affordable Care Act have folded. Those types of insurers were created and have received federal funds in order to compete on the exchanges with private and other insurers.\n\nIn Maine, those other insurers include Aetna, Anthem and the nonprofit Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.\n\nGendreau said he doesn\u2019t think the latest year portends doom for Maine Community Health Options and could reflect the challenges of an insurance risk pool that\u2019s more likely to include people who have not had insurance in years before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like looking into a crystal ball, but we saw that initial peak of claims costs,\u201d Gendreau said. \u201cI do think a portion of it is that people who did not have health insurance and who were putting off getting the care that they needed for many reasons.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine Community Health Options, the state\u2019s largest individual health insurer, expects to raise rates for its 2017 plans after closing 2015 in the red.
