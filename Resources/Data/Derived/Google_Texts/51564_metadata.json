(Tribune News Service) \u2014 In yet another example of government waste, bureaucratic bloat and excessive regulation, Americans complete more than 23,000 forms for 68 federal agencies each year, according to a new analysis by the American Action Forum.\n\nJust filling out all these forms consumes 11.4 billion hours, which works out to about 35 hours per person \u2014 almost a full work week.\n\nThe biggest offender, by a large margin, was the Health and Human Services Department, with 5,005 forms, including 943 forms related to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat was 34 percent more than the next agency, the Agriculture Department, with more than 3,700 forms.\n\nThis includes 334 forms for vegetables and specialty crops, which is more than the total number of crops actually sold in the country (222), AAF noted.\n\nThe Commerce Department came in third with more than 2,000 forms.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the Treasury Department, home to the Internal Revenue Service, came in only fourth with 1,599 forms \u2014 1,053 related to the tax code.\n\nThese forms imposed far and away the greatest time burden, however, accounting for 77 percent of the total, \u201cthanks in large part to the incomprehensible individual and corporate tax system in the U.S.,\u201d AAF added.\n\nAs if the sheer number of forms were not inconvenient enough, more than 1,400 Agriculture forms, more than 1,000 Treasury forms and nearly 450 HHS forms \u2014 28 percent of those agencies\u2019 forms \u2014 cannot be submitted online, AAF found.\n\nWhile some forms are necessary to apply for certain programs, verify eligibility and make sure people are who they say they are, the amount of paperwork imposed on the public has clearly gotten out of hand \u2014 as has the amount of government regulation in general.\n\n\u201cThe number of federal forms, 23,000, should give pause to regulators seeking to add more to the pile or to members of Congress wanting to cede additional power to the executive branch,\u201d AAF concluded.\n\nIt should also crystallize the need to significantly reduce the size and scope of government.\n\nThe thought of filling out endless forms to provide personal information, file income taxes and apply for countless government programs would have been inconceivable to our nation\u2019s founders.\n\nIt should shock the conscience still today.\n\nVisit the Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.) at www.ocregister.com.
