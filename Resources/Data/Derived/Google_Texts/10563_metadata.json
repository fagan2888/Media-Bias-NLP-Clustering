I ran into a brick wall.\"\n\nPeloff's wife battles mental illness and needs medication. Without a doctor to prescribe it, he finally took her to the Emergency Room.\n\n\"It's about $495 dollars more plus the inpatient place where she was. I still haven't got the bill for that, but it's going to be a lot. A lot,\" Peloff explained.\n\nFlorida Blue said it apologizes for the issues, and regrets these challenges impacting less than 10 percent of customers and turned down a request for an on camera interview.\n\n\"I think it was a misrepresentation of what they said it was,\" explained Peloff.\n\nThe CEO for the Medical Specialists of the Palm Beaches, Elizabeth Strombom, told us doctors are doing extra work to manage care. She said this plan also created a hardship for doctors who had to refer patients to specialists because the network of doctors taking the insurance is so limited. So a primary care doctor who had a relationship with a specialist for twenty years may no longer be able to refer patients to that specialist.\n\nTo see a specialist in this plan, you need to see a primary care doctor.\n\nBoca Raton Regional Hospital said they were notified that they would no longer be part of the myBlue network as of July 1. \"Florida Blue Cross has narrowed their primary care network for their Obamacare Exchange Health product,\" the hospital wrote. The Hospital directed customers with questions to Florida Blue.\n\nDoctors are dropping like flies,\" explained Peloff.\n\nBut patients are stuck in the plan or they'll lose their tax subsidy which drastically reduces the cost of the plan.\n\n\"This is really effecting people. It's not just a mistake it has real life implications and it's maddening,\" said Peloff.\n\nFor a business man who makes his money making sure every detail is right.\n\nFlorida Blue said even though doctors are dropping out, the plan still meets federal guidelines. The insurer is working with customers individually to address their problems, and make sure patients like Peloff don't face any \"extra\" out of pocket costs.\n\nFlorida Blue is also working to make sure the list of doctors online is updated.\n\nThe federal government requires that information be updated at least once a month.\n\nHealth and Human Services, which oversees the Affordable Care Act and Marketplace, told us starting in 2017 the insurance company will be required to provide 30 day written notice when a provider is discontinued from the plan. When a provider is terminated without cause, patients can continue to get treatment for in-network prices until treatment until its complete or for 90 days (whichever is shorter).\n\n\n\nFlorida Blue statement:\n\n\"We apologize for, and truly regret, the challenges these members have experienced.\n\nIt is important to note that we cannot discuss specific member situations due to privacy laws. However, we have learned there are a small number of members in one of our new health plans who have encountered frustration and delay in care due to issues in finding in-network primary care physicians.\n\nWhile this experience is not typical for most of our members, we take this matter very seriously and are working aggressively to help those who have been affected.\n\nThe network for this new plan has undergone some modifications since its introduction earlier this year. Nonetheless, it continues to meet the required standards for access to local primary and specialist care.\n\nWe are committed to the health of those we serve throughout Florida, and we will personally work with any member to find a local, in-network provider and make an appointment to be seen. We invite members to call us, visit us online or meet face-to-face with an advisor at our Boynton Beach retail center or any one of our 20 other locations across the state.\"\n\nHealth and Human Services statement:\n\n\"While changes are typical between a health plan and their network, there are specific regulations and communication requirements to make sure enrollees have access to benefits. We work with states to make sure health plans are fully compliant with the rules and regulations.\"\n\n----\n\nFor the latest on consumer issues and ripoffs, follow Jenn on Facebook and Twitter .\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"isPremium": "false", "description": "A trip to the doctor is becoming a headache for some \"myBlue\" customers who bought Affordable Care Act policies and can't find a doctor that takes it.
