He supported Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that outlawed same-sex marriage in California until the U.S. Supreme Court found it unconstitutional.\n\nIn the interview, Del Beccaro called for the repeal of Obamacare, but only if Republicans replace it with a better healthcare law. One provision that should be kept, he said, is the one allowing young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 health plans until they are 26.\n\nThe other main Republican in the Senate race is state Assemblyman Rocky Chavez of Oceanside. Chavez\u2019s lackluster fundraising in his campaign\u2019s first few weeks -- he reported less than $5,000 in the bank at the end of March -- has raised questions about his viability.\n\nThe major Democrat in the race, state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, reported more than $2.2 million in cash on hand at the end of March.\n\nAllan Hoffenblum, a former Republican consultant who publishes the nonpartisan California Target Book election guide, described Del Beccaro as a \u201cshowman\u201d whose candidacy would be hard to take seriously.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an ego thing for him,\u201d Hoffenblum said, comparing Del Beccaro to presidential candidates who aim less for the White House than for lucrative TV and radio jobs that can follow a high-profile campaign.\n\nDel Beccaro said he expected to tap the statewide networks he cultivated as party chairman to raise as much as $10 million for the campaign. He also said he did not deserve blame for the the party\u2019s poor election results on his watch.\n\n\u201cThere were far greater factors than I involved in that process,\u201d he said, citing the heavy turnout of Democrats for the 2012 presidential election and labor\u2019s costly campaign against a California ballot measure that would have curbed union spending on politics.\n\nDel Beccaro was raised in Huntington, N.Y., a Long Island suburb of New York City, and the East Bay. He said his experience mediating business disputes was part of what qualified him for the Senate job.\n\n\u201cBusiness partners fighting -- it\u2019s worse than divorce court,\u201d Del Beccaro said. \u201cIt\u2019s very contentious.\u201d\n\nIn his announcement, he called for a federal \u201cflat tax.\u201d He said he was still working on details but expected his plan to include just one or two income tax rates.\n\nHe also vowed a dramatic cut in deductions -- but not those for mortgage interest or charitable donations -- with the goal of eliminating giveaways to corporations and the wealthy.\n\n\u201cThis may sound kind of populist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m against using the tax code to exploit relationships and get better deals.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @finneganLAT", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Ex-state GOP chief Tom Del Beccaro launches Senate bid", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Former state Republican chairman Tom Del Beccaro announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate on Sunday, ensuring a divided GOP field in next year\u2019s contest to succeed Democrat Barbara Boxer.", "title": "Ex-state GOP chief Tom Del Beccaro launches Senate bid", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-delbeccaro-senate-campaign-launch-20150426-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55396c07/turbine/la-me-pc-delbeccaro-senate-campaign-launch-20150426", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Delbecarro Republican California Senate Campaign", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83364794", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-26", "Description": "Former state Republican chairman Tom Del Beccaro announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate on Sunday, ensuring a divided GOP field in next year\u2019s contest to succeed Democrat Barbara Boxer.
