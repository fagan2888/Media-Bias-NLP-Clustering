Researchers from Duke University collaborated with Hanyang University in South Korea to better understand why some students are more likely to drop out of school than others. The study, which will be published in the American Economic Journal-Applied Economics, reveals a new link between the age children start school, and drop out and commit crimes.\n\n\u201cThis research provides the first compelling evidence of a causal link between dropout and crime,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Philip J. Cook, a professor in Duke\u2019s Sanford School of Public Policy, in a press release. \u201cIt supports the view that crime outcomes should be considered in evaluating school reforms. Dropouts are greatly over-represented in prison, so we know there is a strong association between dropping out and crime. But to establish causation requires an experiment. My analysis takes advantage of nature\u2019s experiment associated with birth date.\u201d\n\nResearchers monitored American students who were born 60 days before and 60 days after the school cutoff date, which was Oct. 16. Children had to turn 5 before they were eligible to start kindergarten. Studies have shown parents will hold their child back if their birthday falls right before the cut off date; if their birthday is Oct. 10, for example. Their parents think they\u2019re giving their child a social and academic advantage by making them \u201cold-for-grade\u201d through delayed enrollment.\n\nWhile they excel over their younger classmates in every single measure of school performance, their leverage dies out by their 16th birthday. Old-for-grade students were about 30 percent less likely to engage in delinquent behavior because they were more physically and mentally mature than their schoolmates. But that dynamic shifts at 16, making them more likely to drop out and get convicted of a felony by sometime around 20 years old.\n\n\u201cShould you redshirt your kid?\u201d Cook said. \u201cWell, on the one hand, he\u2019ll do better while he\u2019s in school and is less likely to become delinquent. On the other hand, he\u2019ll be more likely to drop out before graduation, and bad things may follow that. Even something as crude as a regulation that requires a kid stay in school to a fixed age, whether he wants to or not, has a considerable effect on criminal activity.\u201d\n\nParents are more likely to academically redshirt their son over their daughter, and it is overall more common among white parents than African-Americans. The likelihood of an old-for-grade student dropping out and committing a serious crime increases 3.4 times for children of unwed mothers, and 2.7 times if their mothers were also high school dropouts.\n\n\u201cPeople say there is no point keeping a kid in school who doesn\u2019t want to be there because he won\u2019t learn anything and he\u2019ll be disruptive,\u201d Cook said. \u201cMy findings suggest that intuitive argument is not entirely correct. Even students who would rather drop out can benefit from staying in school when they are required to do so. Otherwise they are prime candidates for recruitment into a life of crime.\u201d\n\nSource: Cook PJ and Kang S.
