We also learned that for the first time in almost 8 years, the unemployment rate dropped below 5 percent. Just two years ago, economists did not expect unemployment to fall below 5 percent until 2020. So here are five facts you should know about where America's economy stands today thanks to the President's leadership and the hard work of the American people.\n\n1. We've beaten expectations on the unemployment rate\n\nAs recently as 2012, the Blue Chip consensus of independent private sector economists was that unemployment would be 6.7 percent in 2015; would still be almost 6 percent in 2018; and would not fall below 5 percent until 2020. And yet, today it\u2019s 4.9 percent.\n\nMitt Romney predicted his policies, if he were elected, would bring unemployment down to 6 percent \u2013 by the end of 2016, and one publication called that \u201ca bold claim that Romney will surely be held to by Democrats if he\u2019s elected.\u201d To put that into perspective, if the unemployment rate were 6.7 percent today, roughly 2.7 million additional Americans would be out of work. If it were 6 percent, roughly 1.5 million additional Americans would be unemployed.\n\n2. We\u2019ve cut the unemployment rate by more than half\n\nWe've gone from a high of 10 percent in 2009 to less than 5 percent today. And the broadest measure of unemployment (known to econ wonks as \u201cU-6\u201d), which includes part time workers who want to work full-time and discouraged workers,has dropped even faster than the traditional unemployment rate (known to econ wonks as \u201cU-3\u201d). Long-term unemployment (>27 weeks) has also dropped even faster than short-term unemployment (<27 weeks) in the last year. Short-term unemployment is back to pre-crisis levels, and long-term unemployment is 90 percent of the way back to pre-crisis levels.\n\n3. All of the jobs our businesses have been created are full-time jobs\n\nAll of the net job creation since 2010 has been full-time jobs, despite erroneous claims by detractors that Obamacare (which passed in March 2010) would create or has created a \u201cpart time economy.\u201d\n\n4. We have the most job openings ever recorded\n\nWe have 5.4 million open jobs today \u2013 and job openings have been higher since mid-2015 than at any time since we started keeping records in 2000.\n\n5. Wages have grown at the fastest pace since the financial crisis\n\nOver the last six months, average hourly earnings for all private employees rose 2.9 percent at an annual rate, the fastest pace since the financial crisis.\n\nNow we should continue to do everything we can to extend these positive trends, including increasing investments in infrastructure, implementing high-standards free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and raising the minimum wage.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"creator": "@WhiteHouse", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/05/unemployment-drops-below-5-here-are-five-facts-about-americas-jobs-market", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/unemploymentForecast_020516.jpeg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "title": "As Unemployment Drops Below 5%, Here Are Five Facts About America's Jobs Market", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "With the unemployment rate below 5 percent for the first time in almost 8 years, here are five things you need to know about where our economy stands.", "title": "As Unemployment Drops Below 5%, Here Are Five Facts About America's Jobs Market", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/05/unemployment-drops-below-5-here-are-five-facts-about-americas-jobs-market", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/unemploymentForecast_020516.jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/unemploymentForecast_020516.jpeg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2016-02-05T14:47:36-05:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-05T14:17:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T14:47:36-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "We also learned that for the first time in almost 8 years, the unemployment rate dropped below 5 percent.\nWe\u2019ve cut the unemployment rate by more than halfWe've gone from a high of 10 percent in 2009 to less than 5 percent today.\nShort-term unemployment is back to pre-crisis levels, and long-term unemployment is 90 percent of the way back to pre-crisis levels.\nWages have grown at the fastest pace since the financial crisisOver the last six months, average hourly earnings for all private employees rose 2.9 percent at an annual rate, the fastest pace since the financial crisis.\nLong-term unemployment (>27 weeks) has also dropped even faster than short-term unemployment (<27 weeks) in the last year."}
