In conjunction with Mr. Obama\u2019s announcements, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is set to declare Wednesday that his state is the first one to eliminate veterans\u2019 homelessness statewide.\n\nMr. Obama also will call on Congress to act on three pieces of legislation to expand education benefits for veterans.\n\nSEE ALSO: Clinton seeks to upgrade VA computer system to help fix wait-list issue\n\nBut problems within the VA continue unabated. An internal VA audit has found that the secret waitlists occurred not only in Phoenix but at 110 VA facilities.\n\nVA officials still haven\u2019t corrected a computer system error that led to tens of thousands of combat vets being denied VA health care enrollment, although the problem was brought to light in August.\n\nThe administration has tried under VA Secretary Robert McDonald to get beyond the crisis that erupted in Phoenix in April 2014 over delayed health care for veterans and phony waitlists, which led to the resignation of former Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. The agency said it has handled about 7 million more health care appointments for veterans in the past 12 months than in the previous year.\n\n\u201cBecause of many of the reforms that Secretary McDonald has put into place, we have seen important progress made at the VA when it comes to ensuring that our veterans have access to the health care and benefits that they deserve,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nNearly 18 months after the waitlist scandal broke in Phoenix, the problems there aren\u2019t fixed. An inspector general\u2019s report in October found that seven more Phoenix-area veterans died after delayed treatment and lapses in medical care.\n\nMr. McDonald also acknowledged during a House hearing last month that his department also is suffering \u201ca leadership crisis.\u201d In September, for example, one of his top deputies quit under pressure from congressional investigators looking into a scandal over padding the salaries and relocation expenses of senior VA managers. Five VA officials invoked their Fifth Amendment rights at a House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs hearing last week in connection with the probe.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, said the VA is still suffering from a culture that fails to hold wrongdoing accountable.\n\n\u201cUntil the VA rids itself of those who engage in scandalous behavior, the department will always be mired in scandal,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote in an op-ed in The Hill Tuesday. \u201cBut unfortunately, indefensible civil service rules that put the job security of failing VA bureaucrats ahead of the safety of the veterans they are charged with serving are prolonging the agency\u2019s problems indefinitely.\u201d\n\nPete Hegseth, president of Concerned Veterans for America, says the VA under Mr. McDonald \u201cis not fundamentally serious about fixing the systematic problems plaguing the department.\u201d\n\nAnd government watchdogs in the past year have found numerous additional cases of VA whistleblowers facing retaliation, and of VA leadership failing to discipline those responsible for mismanagement or dangerous health care practices.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel wrote directly to Mr. Obama on Sept. 17 about continued problems at the Phoenix VA Medical Center, including the lack of training of emergency room nurses and substandard care at other facilities.\n\nOSC head Carolyn Lerner told the president that the lack of accountability for the problems in Phoenix \u201csends the wrong message to the veterans served by this facility, including those who received substandard emergency care.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, she said, the VA continues to go after employee whistleblowers with a vengeance.\n\n\u201cThe VA has attempted to fire or suspend whistleblowers for minor indiscretions and, often, for activity directly related to the employee\u2019s whistleblowing,\u201d she told Mr. Obama.\n\nIn a speech last week at the National Press Club, Mr. McDonald claimed that the VA has \u201cproposed disciplinary action against 300 individuals for manipulating scheduling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wish that there would be more fact-checking on some of the numbers that are used, because there are a lot of myths out there,\u201d he added.\n\nActually, his claim is dubious. The VA\u2019s own statistics submitted to Congress showed that, as of last week, there were proposed disciplinary actions against 27 employees and one senior executive specifically for patient wait-time manipulation.\n\nOf those 27, three have been fired. And Sharon Helman, the Phoenix VA medical center director, was fired for accepting improper gifts, not because of her role in the waitlist scandal.\n\nThe department has proposed disciplinary action against 305 employees for various issues, including 20 probationary workers and other nonmedical employees such as food service workers and transportation supervisors.\n\nFunding for the VA has increased 73 percent since 2009, but examples of waste at the agency are rampant. Construction of a VA hospital in Denver is more than $1 billion overbudget. And an investigation earlier this year uncovered that a VA executive received almost $300,000 in relocation expenses to move from Washington to Philadelphia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Veterans Day President Obama will lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery and talk about his administration's progress in caring for vets, but critics of the beleaguered Department of Veterans Affairs point to fresh scandals and persistent mismanagement as proof that little has changed.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On Veterans Day President Obama will lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery and talk about his administration\u2019s progress in caring for vets, but critics of the beleaguered Department of Veterans Affairs point to fresh scandals and persistent mismanagement as proof that little has changed.", "title": "Obama promises fall flat as VA continues to fail veterans", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/10/obama-promises-fall-flat-va-continues-fail-veteran/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/11/Veterans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/11/Veterans.jpg", "description": "On Veterans Day President Obama will lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery and talk about his administration's progress in caring for vets, but critics of the beleaguered Department of Veterans", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama promises fall flat as VA continues to fail veterans"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Politics, Social Issues, Department Of Veterans Affairs"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Obama also will call on Congress to act on three pieces of legislation to expand education benefits for veterans.\nVA officials still haven\u2019t corrected a computer system error that led to tens of thousands of combat vets being denied VA health care enrollment, although the problem was brought to light in August.\nAnd Sharon Helman, the Phoenix VA medical center director, was fired for accepting improper gifts, not because of her role in the waitlist scandal.\nSEE ALSO: Clinton seeks to upgrade VA computer system to help fix wait-list issueBut problems within the VA continue unabated.\n\u201cThe VA has attempted to fire or suspend whistleblowers for minor indiscretions and, often, for activity directly related to the employee\u2019s whistleblowing,\u201d she told Mr. Obama."}
