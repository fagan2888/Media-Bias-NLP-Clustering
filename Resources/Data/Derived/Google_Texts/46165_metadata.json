Bush and Bruce Reed have in common. Bush, of course, was our 43rd president and agitated liberals and Democrats pretty much on a daily basis. Reed worked for former President Bill Clinton, was chief of staff for Vice President Joe Biden and has done a great deal of work on policy and politics in the interim years. In December, he left Biden\u2019s office to become president of the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, which focuses on K-12 education.\n\nHere\u2019s what both men should be lauded for: Whatever problems they might have had with a particular president, they kept it to themselves \u2013 or have to date \u2013 so the men could do their jobs. Reed was a senior adviser on domestic policy to Clinton and worked also for the Democratic Leadership Council during the difficult years \u2013 the ones where Clinton was under fire for having a sexual relationship with an intern. Others wrote books or went on TV to separate themselves from the scandal-tarred \u2013 yet later, extremely popular \u2013 Clinton. Not Reed. He did his job; he focused on the policy issues that mattered to him, and if he had a problem with Clinton\u2019s behavior, he kept it to himself.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nBush, too, has been quiet. Aside from going on \"The Tonight Show\" to display his affable side and show paintings he had done (the best being of his cat, Bob), Bush has been notably mum on matters involving his successor, President Barack Obama. If Bush hates the Affordable Care Act, he\u2019s kept his thoughts out of the news pages and off the Sunday shows. If he is wringing his hands over the more deliberative foreign policy style practiced by the current occupant of the White House, he\u2019s kept it to a close group of confidantes. You can love Bush or hate him for his policies on Iraq, taxes, education or whatever \u2013 but you have to give the man props for doing the decent and adult thing and just letting the president do his job without his predecessor rhetorically nipping at his heels.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so disappointing to see former members of the Obama administration \u2013 or for that matter, any administration \u2013 come out with tell-almost-all books in which they openly discuss the disagreements and disappointments they had with the man who gave them a high-level job in government. Robert Gates did it; Hillary Clinton did it (though less brutally \u2013 one presumes she\u2019d like the president\u2019s help should she indeed decide to run to succeed him); and now former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta has done it.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nPanetta, who actually has a deserved Washington reputation as a collegial mensch, lit into Obama in his book, \u201cWorthy Fights,\u201d saying the president was wrong to disengage so completely with Iraq. The administration argued (correctly) that the Nouri al-Maliki regime refused to agree to terms, but Panetta said they hadn\u2019t tried hard enough. And, he continues, Obama shouldn\u2019t be promising not to put boots on the ground.\n\nThe problem with these complaints is that someone serving as defense secretary doesn\u2019t have to take the wishes of the American public into account. The military is single-minded in its mission (as it should be), but politicians don\u2019t have that luxury. This country does not want to get involved in another bloody, costly war in the Middle East, and Obama is listening. Is it wrong for him to reassure the American public, instead of keeping his options open? That\u2019s an intellectual exercise one can conduct more easily when one is in appointed, not elected, office.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nAnd if these former senior officials were so unhappy with Obama, why did they hang around so long? Show me any employee, no matter how high up, who doesn\u2019t have problems and conflicts with the person at the top. Deal with it or leave. Dealing with it and then writing a book about how awful it was, or how you were right and they were wrong, is not the way to go.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Leon Panetta's New Book Is the Latest to Air Obama Administration Criticisms", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Ex-White House officials should keep mum on internal disagreements and conflicts.", "title": "Time to Ditch the Tell-All", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/10/08/leon-panettas-new-book-is-the-latest-to-air-obama-administration-criticisms", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/20/64/e4016f0e4c35b8cb3756d444e0af/141008-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Ex-White House officials should keep mum on internal disagreements and conflicts.", "card": "summary", "title": "Leon Panetta's New Book Is the Latest to Air Obama Administration Criticisms"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Oct. 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,White House,Obama administration,Clinton, Hillary,Clinton, Bill,Reed, Bruce,Bush, George W.,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ex-White House officials should keep mum on internal disagreements and conflicts."}, "article_summary": "[SEE: Political Cartoons]And if these former senior officials were so unhappy with Obama, why did they hang around so long?\nIn December, he left Biden\u2019s office to become president of the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, which focuses on K-12 education.\nThis country does not want to get involved in another bloody, costly war in the Middle East, and Obama is listening.\nBush, of course, was our 43rd president and agitated liberals and Democrats pretty much on a daily basis.\nThe administration argued (correctly) that the Nouri al-Maliki regime refused to agree to terms, but Panetta said they hadn\u2019t tried hard enough."}
