Heritage Action supports striking down the law.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the political implication of further alienating the pro-life movement is likely to be substantial,\u201d Holler said.\n\n\u201cThe political implication of further alienating the pro-life movement is likely to be substantial,\u201d @DanHoller.\n\nThe controversy surrounds a law called the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act, which ensures that \u201cindividuals are protected from discrimination by an employer, employment agency, or labor organization, based on an individual\u2019s or dependent\u2019s reproductive health decisions.\u201d\n\nCongress used a rare measure called a \u201cresolution of disapproval\u201d in attempt to kill the law, which, with the support of both houses and the president, would overrule the legislation passed by the D.C. City Council.\n\nThe political tactic hasn\u2019t been used in over two decades, and local lawmakers such as Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., view the effort as a violation of \u201cthe local democratic rights of 650,000 District residents.\u201d\n\nCongress reserved the power to do so under the Home Rule Act of 1973, which secured lawmakers the authority to review all legislation passed by the District of Columbia and overrule it with a resolution of disapproval.\n\nNorton, speaking on the House floor Thursday afternoon, accused Republicans of furthering the \u201cwar on women,\u201d in fighting the legislation.\n\n\u201cThe goal here is to resume the war on women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe predicate for getting to the nation\u2019s women is the D.C. Home Rule Act. It goes after self-government and women at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal here is to resume the war on women,\u201d @EleanorNorton.\n\nThe resolution of disapproval passed the House on Thursday largely along party lines, with 13 Republicans voting against it.\n\nOn March 18, Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas and James Lankford, R-Okla., introduced an identical version to overturn the legislation in the Senate, but leadership failed to schedule a vote before the 30-day deadline Congress had to act.\n\nIn a press release this morning, Cruz not only criticized Congress for \u201crunning the clock to the eleventh hour\u201d in regards to the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination act, but D.C.\u2019s Human Rights Amendment Act as well.\n\nThe Human Rights Amendment Act seeks to prohibit religious-affiliated schools from discriminating against gay and lesbian student groups.\n\nConservatives, like Cruz, argue this policy would infringe on the ability of private schools to operate according to their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe District of Columbia\u2019s [Human Rights Amendment Act] would allow fines or penalties against religious schools that sincerely believe it violates the tenets of their faith to support homosexual activities on campus,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cIf the [Human Rights Amendment Act] is not repealed, then a group of students could sue to force a private religious school to provide official recognition, facilities, and financial support for homosexual student activities on campus against the school\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nRep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., led the effort against the Human Rights Amendment Act in the House, but the Oversight and Government Reform Committee never brought that resolution to a committee vote.\n\nThe D.C. City Council is now predicting both laws will go into effect Saturday, May 2.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In what was a historic move, the House voted in favor of striking down a Washington, D.C., anti-discrimination law.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In what was a historic move, the House voted in favor of striking down a Washington, D.C., anti-discrimination law.", "title": "House Passes Resolution Banning D.C. \u2018Anti-Religious Freedom\u2019 Law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150501_GOPBudget.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-04T22:51:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GMiUz5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In what was a historic move, the House voted in favor of striking down a Washington, D.C., anti-discrimination law.", "title": "House Passes Resolution Banning D.C. \u2018Anti-Religious Freedom\u2019 Law", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150501_GOPBudget.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life,religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-05-01T15:08:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T22:51:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "dc anti-discrimination law, cruz, Lankford, dc law, norton, Human Rights Amendment Act, reproductive health non-discrimination act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e8d\"", "article_summary": "The Human Rights Amendment Act seeks to prohibit religious-affiliated schools from discriminating against gay and lesbian student groups.\nThe resolution of disapproval passed the House on Thursday largely along party lines, with 13 Republicans voting against it.\nIn a press release this morning, Cruz not only criticized Congress for \u201crunning the clock to the eleventh hour\u201d in regards to the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination act, but D.C.\u2019s Human Rights Amendment Act as well.\nNorton, speaking on the House floor Thursday afternoon, accused Republicans of furthering the \u201cwar on women,\u201d in fighting the legislation.\n\u201cThe District of Columbia\u2019s [Human Rights Amendment Act] would allow fines or penalties against religious schools that sincerely believe it violates the tenets of their faith to support homosexual activities on campus,\u201d Cruz said."}
