It was recorded live in Barry Goldwater\u2019s hometown on Saturday night, in front of a 1,000-person ballroom audience, during a banquet roast of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the gala conclusion to the annual Western Conservative Conference, known until last year as Western CPAC.\n\nArizona Attorney General Tom Horne laid down the basic comic framework for his fellow roasters, totaling a dozen conservative dignitaries of local and national reputation. \u201cApologies to the Civic Center,\u201d said Horne, \u201cbut half of the kitchen staff was arrested tonight upon arrival of Joe and his deputies. Because of a budget crunch, the sheriff\u2019s cutting way back. No more green baloney for prisoners \u2014 just an extra beating at suppertime. Over the years, Joe\u2019s touched many people. We know because many are now pressing charges.\u201d\n\nChuckling throughout Horne\u2019s routine on stage next to Arpaio was Russell Pearce, a recalled state senator with a documented fondness for neo-Nazi websites, and the primary architect of Arizona\u2019s controversial immigration bill S.B. 1070. Pearce smiled as his one-time ally in the 1070 fight, Arizona State Rep. John Kavanagh, began his set asking, \u201cHow many Hispanics did you pull over on the way over here, Arpaio?\u201d He later added, \u201cAll these years I figured he was rounding up Hispanics because you had a grudge from [fighting in] the Spanish-American War. But if you were in the Korean War, how come you\u2019re not rounding up Asians?\u201d Kavanagh was doing a bit about the difficulties of dining out with Arpaio \u2014 \u201cWhen we go into a restaurant, most of the wait staff and cooks dive out the back window\u201d \u2014 when he spotted a passing waiter holding a platter of stuffed chickens, and screamed, \u201cThere\u2019s a brave one! Get him! Sic \u2019em!\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared; the waiter turned red. Thus did a day of strategy sessions on how to reclaim the White House and build a new conservative majority end with national movement leaders affectionately teasing a divisive deport-\u2019em-all drug-war dinosaur, whose roast material revolved entirely around the three facts of his being old, sadistic, and having a bit of a brown-person problem. The Tea Party\u2019s loud rejection of immigration reform shows it has also refused the message of electoral emergency delivered by Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 victory map. But if anyone needed another reminder, they now have the image of Joe Arpaio receiving a \u201cMedal of Freedom\u201d award in recognition of his rough detainment and deportation techniques, and a taste for racial profiling so aggressive it has resulted in a federally appointed monitor in Maricopa County.\n\nThe man behind the Western Conservative Conference, Floyd Brown, has never been very good at helping the GOP build bridges. In 1988, he created the infamous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad that has dogged his party\u2019s outreach efforts ever since. But Brown\u2019s interests and achievements are more diverse than scorched-earth political advertising. He has been a Zelig-like presence on the right for the better part of three decades, zig-zagging his way through and connecting the worlds of conservative organizing, publishing, opposition research, campaigning, fundraising, marketing, and predatory investment advice.\n\nA co-founder of Citizens United, Brown now runs a marketing company, Excellentia Inc., helping clients \u201cachieve success in the conservative and Christian marketplace.\u201d He works as a traveling speaker for groups like the Oxford Group claiming to offer \u201cinsider\u201d stock tips and advice. He also pushes gold coins and municipal bonds, sometimes in mutual exclusion of the other, depending on his audience.\n\nAll of which makes Brown a perfect impresario for today\u2019s conservative grassroots activist circuit, where organizing and politics can seem incidental to the interests of an interlocking constellation of thinly veiled data mining, fundraising, and precious metals operations. This was sometimes the case in Phoenix, where an older, nearly all-white group of activist-attendees from Western states paid $399 to train under the tutelage of organizers from Heritage Action and the Leadership Institute, as well as hear national figures pitch gold coins and radio shows. The bold-face names who appeared live or by video included Sen. Ted Cruz, Gov. Rick Perry, and embattled National Rifle Association board member Ted Nugent, who was welcomed despite being under fire for racist attacks on President Obama.\n\nThe main organizer behind the conference, the Western Center for Journalism, did much to anticipate this combine. Joseph Farah founded the WCJ in the early \u201990s to churn out Clinton conspiracies with arch-conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife\u2019s money, which it did in enough volume to spin off WorldNetDaily in 1998. (Brown\u2019s tactics during this period were notably ruthless. In 1992, the Bush-Quayle campaign called Brown and his associates \u201cthe lowest forms of life\u201d for hounding the family of a woman who had killed herself). The WCJ went dormant during the Bush years, while an increasingly scammy WND grew its traffic and for-sale email list. WCJ reopened for business in 2007 to underwrite and promote Jerome Corsi\u2019serror-filled book, The Obama Nation, and brought Brown in to revive the site. It was in his capacity as president of the Western Center for Journalism that Brown chaired the host committee in Phoenix. (The American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC, the larger, better-known annual event that will be held next weekend outside Washington, D.C., did not respond to questions about its relationship to Brown\u2019s event, or why it is no longer called Western CPAC.)\n\nThe conference began on Friday night with a keynote speech by Trevor Loudon, a dour New Zealander who has found steady work peddling stories of a modern-day Red Scare on the Tea Party circuit. As attendees lined up for drinks and baby carrots, Loudon sketched out the contents of his most recent book, The Enemies Within: Communists, Socialists, and Progressives in the U.S. Congress. It is Louden\u2019s belief that \u201c98 percent of the Democratic Party\u201d is far-left, anti-American, and actively working toward an economic collapse to allow communism \u201ca second chance.\u201d With his haunted imagination and lottery-ticket approach to numbers, Louden evokes the South Pacific-accented ghost of Fred Schwartz, an Australian anti-communist speaker who made a good living on the Bircher circuit of the 1950s and 60s selling books and warning of Reds under every bed.\n\nLike Schwartz, Louden believes he has a crucial role to play in uniting the American Right and positioning it for victory. \u201cHere\u2019s what you need to do,\u201d Loudon told the crowd in Phoenix. \u201cYou need a new Reagan coalition and a Reagan type leader that inspires people, like Ted Cruz. And Cruz should promise the following cabinet to unify the right: Allen West, VP; Rand Paul, Treasury; Sarah Palin, Energy; Scott Walker, Labor; Herman Cain, Commerce; John Bolton, State; Health and Human Services, Ben Carson. Attorney General, Mark Levin. Education, David Barton. U.N. \u2014 nobody. Everybody gets something. It would energize the whole movement.\u201d\n\nAmong the last people to leave the ballroom following Loudon\u2019s speech was Floyd Brown, who stayed behind signing copies of his 2008 book, Obama Unmasked: Did Hollywood Handlers Create the Perfect Candidate?, and giving them away to whoever would take one. As Brown personalized my copy \u2014 \u201cTo Alex: Keep fighting for freedom!\u201d \u2014 I asked him if he thought any of the old Clinton scandals he pushed in the 90s could have traction if Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016. He paused, looking for a moment as if the question had never occurred to him, then quickly recovered the confident tone of a professional dealer of \u201cinsider\u201d information and analysis. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot unless the other side brings them up. I know for a fact that there are people on the other side who are going to challenge her.\u201d\n\nThe next morning Brown hosted a breakout session entitled, \u201cIs An Economic Collapse Coming?\u201d He opened with another question: \u201cYou may be wondering, \u2018Why are we holding a meeting on economic collapse?'\u201d But it\u2019s unlikely anyone in the room found the subject, or its gold-dealer sponsor, out of place. Wherever conservatives gather these days, gold dealers are close at hand. Even the NRA\u2019s annual meeting now offers seminars on buying gold as a form of \u201ceconomic self-defense.\u201d\n\nListening to Brown tout his \u201ctraining as an economist\u201d (by which he meant his bachelor\u2019s degree) and riff on gold\u2019s imperviousness to \u201ccounterparty risk,\u201d it was tempting to admire his career as a journeyman pitcher of junk in the conservative gutter league. \u201cFirst, please, I beg you, limit your exposure to bonds,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey have performed extraordinarily well over 30 years. But sometimes when it has been the best, it is preparing to be the worst. Please, please, please, try and limit your exposure to bonds. Not even CD\u2019s and Social Security are safe anymore, because they\u2019re protected by the government \u2014 and the government is bankrupt.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona conservatives honor Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014\u00a0and get a little bit racist in the process VIDEO", "title": "\u201cHow many Hispanics did you pull over on the way over here, Arpaio\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Arizona conservatives honor Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014\u00a0and get a little bit racist in the process VIDEO", "title": "\u201cHow many Hispanics did you pull over on the way over here, Arpaio\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/02/how_many_hispanics_did_you_pull_over_on_the_way_over_here_arpaio_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/joe_arpaio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arizona conservatives honor Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014\u00a0and get a little bit racist in the process VIDEO", "title": "\u201cHow many Hispanics did you pull over on the way over here, Arpaio\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/joe_arpaio.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alexander Zaitchik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Conservatism, CPAC, Joe Arpaio, Media Matters, Video, Western Conservative Conference", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The man behind the Western Conservative Conference, Floyd Brown, has never been very good at helping the GOP build bridges.\nTopics: Conservatism, CPAC, Joe Arpaio, Media Matters, Video, Western Conservative Conference, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on Media MattersPHOENIX \u2014 The demographic death spiral of the conservative movement has a laugh track.\nIt was recorded live in Barry Goldwater\u2019s hometown on Saturday night, in front of a 1,000-person ballroom audience, during a banquet roast of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the gala conclusion to the annual Western Conservative Conference, known until last year as Western CPAC.\nPearce smiled as his one-time ally in the 1070 fight, Arizona State Rep.
