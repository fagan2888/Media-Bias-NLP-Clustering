Dexter Nelson tells News 9 that the object is a possible explosive device, but says that is all the information they have at this time.\n\nAn employee at the Goodwill called police at 10:27 a.m. about a potential grenade found in a former employee's desk. They also told police they were going to self-evacuate.\n\nSometime later, a second potential grenade was discovered somewhere in their warehouse. Because the building sits so far off the road, police decided not to divert traffic on Reno.\n\nJust before 10:50 p.m., Oklahoma City police determined that both devices were \"not dangerous.\" Employees were allowed back inside the building.\n\nNelson tells News 9 the area will remain blocked momentarily while crews on scene load up their equipment and leave the scene.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Emergency crews were called to investigate a suspicious package at the Goodwill store in downtown Oklahoma City, Thursday morning.", "author": "Matthew Nuttle", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25879292/suspicious-package-found-at-downtown-okc-goodwill", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25879292_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Emergency crews were called to investigate a suspicious package at the Goodwill store in downtown Oklahoma City, Thursday morning.", "title": "Suspicious Devices At Downtown OKC Goodwill Deemed Harmless"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25879292_SA.jpg", "description": "Emergency crews were called to investigate a suspicious package at the Goodwill store in downtown Oklahoma City, Thursday morning.", "card": "summary", "title": "Suspicious Devices At Downtown OKC Goodwill Deemed Harmless"}, "wnreadableurl": "suspicious-package-found-at-downtown-okc-goodwill", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/06/26", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS17", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "Emergency crews were called to investigate a suspicious package at the Goodwill store in downtown Oklahoma City, Thursday morning.\nJust before 10:50 p.m., Oklahoma City police determined that both devices were \"not dangerous.\"\nAn employee at the Goodwill called police at 10:27 a.m. about a potential grenade found in a former employee's desk.\nSometime later, a second potential grenade was discovered somewhere in their warehouse.\nCrews were called to the store, located near W.
