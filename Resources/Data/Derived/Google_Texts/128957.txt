Hours after being released from an Oakland, Calif.-area hospital Sunday, Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried was back in uniform. He not only played against the Portland Trail Blazers, he started at the Pepsi Center.

It was the culmination of a whirlwind, scary 18 hours.

Faried suffered a cervical injury after teammate Will Barton inadvertently came down hard on his back and neck after contesting a layup by Golden State’s Klay Thompson late in overtime Saturday night in Oakland. A stunned Faried made his way out of bounds at the next dead ball, which came after that play, and was immediately attended to by the Nuggets training staff. That treatment continued through the remainder of the game — a 111-108 Nuggets loss in the extra period — and afterward.

Faried had movement in all of his extremities while being transported off the court but was immobilized on a stretcher and taken to a hospital for precautionary reasons. He stayed in Oakland overnight, was given a clean bill of health and flew home.

Then he suited up.

In the heat of Saturday’s game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said he didn’t pay much attention to Faried’s plight, but he did as soon as the game was over.

“Not to sound coldhearted, I wasn’t concerned at all, because we had a game to win,” Malone said. “Afterward, that’s when the concern set in and how was he. You hear he has to go to the hospital, neck injury, that can be very scary. … Then you think about Kenneth the person, once the game is over. It’s great to have him back.”

Early Sunday, Faried tweeted: “I’m doing much better a little sore but I’m the Manimal I’m not going to (let) this keep me down & out long!”

Footnotes. The Nuggets got the services of injured forward Kostas Papanikolaou back Sunday. He missed Saturday’s game because of a sprained left ankle. … Denver rookie Emmanuel Mudiay remains out of the lineup but could return to uniform at some point this week.
