They allege Lewis inflicted the fatal stab wound on each victim.\n\nLewis\u2019 case marks the first time since 2001 that Denver prosecutors have pursued the death penalty.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f9b\"", "article_summary": "Lewis\u2019 case marks the first time since 2001 that Denver prosecutors have pursued the death penalty.\nThe man facing the death penalty for allegedly stabbing five people to death in a Denver bar is due in court this week, when attorneys will argue a slew of motions in the case.\nProsecutors have already indicated they will seek to present all the statements Lewis made to police and others at trial.\nDexter Lewis, 24, is charged with 16 counts for his role in the attack that left five people dead at Fero\u2019s Bar and Grill in October 2012.\nTwo other men charged in the case, brothers Joseph and Lynell Hill, have accepted plea agreements and have received lengthy sentences."}
