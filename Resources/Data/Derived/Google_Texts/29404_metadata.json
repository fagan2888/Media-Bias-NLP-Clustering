It is flown from the FCO\u2019s main flagpole at all times. It is never substituted for another flag.\n\n\u201cIt is the FCO\u2019s long-standing policy to fly the Union flag, national flags and the flags of Overseas Territories.\u201d\n\nHammond was first appointed Foreign Secretary in July last year. His predecessor William Hague took a very different view, tweeting and writing on Facebook during London Pride 2014: \u201cThe rainbow flag is flying over the Foreign Office today as the LGBT Pride 2014 parade makes its way through London.\u201d\n\nBritish embassies also flew the rainbow flag in Paris, Tel Aviv, Oslo and Santiago.\n\nHammond was one of four Conservative cabinet members who refused to support gay marriage when it was introduced in 2013, saying it would upset \u201cvast numbers of people\u201d.\n\nThere are signs that embassy staff may be rebelling however. One worker at the British embassy in Rome said: \u201cStaff of all persuasions at the embassy wore the rainbow colours in T-shirts for a photo shoot for Rome Pride as they were not allowed to fly the flag. People are seriously unhappy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tory Cabinet Minister Orders Embassies Not to Fly Rainbow Flag", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Tory Cabinet Minister Orders Embassies Not to Fly Rainbow Flag", "title": "Tory Cabinet Minister Orders Embassies Not to Fly Rainbow Flag - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rainbow-Flag_reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-16T07:07:36-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/06/16/uk-foreign-sec-orders-embassies-not-to-fly-rainbow-flag/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tory Cabinet Minister Orders Embassies Not to Fly Rainbow Flag", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rainbow-Flag_reuters.jpg", "title": "Tory Cabinet Minister Orders Embassies Not to Fly Rainbow Flag - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Gay, Gay Pride, Philip Hammond,Breitbart London,british embassies rainbow flag", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-16T04:00:30-07:00", "section": "Breitbart London", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T07:07:36-07:00", "tag": "Philip Hammond", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb704\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBritain\u2019s Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has ordered UK embassies around the world to not fly the gay rainbow flag during pride marches.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA spokesman said: \u201cThe Union Flag always takes priority.\n\u201cIt is the FCO\u2019s long-standing policy to fly the Union flag, national flags and the flags of Overseas Territories.\u201dHammond was first appointed Foreign Secretary in July last year.\nThere are signs that embassy staff may be rebelling however.\nAccording to the Daily Mail the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London will also not fly the rainbow banner this year, unlike last year when it boasted about the flag on Twitter."}
