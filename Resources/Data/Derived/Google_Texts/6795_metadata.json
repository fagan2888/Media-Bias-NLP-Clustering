New York \u2013based Riverside, one of the busiest private equity firms in middle-market M&A, has made more than 410 investments since its start in 1988 and currently boasts more than 80 companies in its portfolio. The firm won Mergers & Acquisitions\u2019 2014 M&A Mid-Market Award for Seller of the Year.\n\n\n\nRiverside added Prima Eye Group to its Independent Doctors of Optometric Care platform, an alliance of optometrists with about 3,100 members and more than 60 vendors. The alliance provides group purchasing, marketing and continuing education services to members. Prima Eye Group provides consulting services and purchasing programs to nearly 900 U.S. optometrists in nearly 400 practices, including services for marketing, human resources and financial analysis of practices.\n\nSafeTec Compliance Systems Inc. is an add-on to Riverside\u2019s Health & Safety Institute platform, which provides healthcare and workplace safety training and compliance services. SafeTec provides web-based compliance software and services for complying with chemical regulations and reducing environmental, health and safety risks. Riverside anticipates that demand for chemical compliance and safety will grow with the pending adoption of the new Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals, an international standard.\n\nThe Dermatology Group of New Jersey is a physician practice-management company with 16 offices and 34 providers in New Jersey providing dermatological clinical, surgical, cosmetic and pathology services. Riverside reported that it expects demand for dermatology services to grow, due to rising skin cancer rates and an aging population, and the PE firm expects to grow the practice group through add-on acquisitions and provider recruiting.\n\nKasasa by BancVue provides financial technology and marketing to more than 700 community banks and credit unions in the U.S. The company was recently included on the American Banker 2015 FinTech Forward 100 list of leading financial technology providers. Its flagship product is a suite of reward checking accounts that feature nationwide ATM fee refunds, monthly cash rewards and require no minimum balance and no monthly service fees.\n\nWorking on the Prima deal were Loren Schlachet, a managing partner at Riverside; Alan Peyrat, partner; John McKernan, vice president; Christopher Shea, associate; Keith Kerman, operating partner; Dan Haynes, principal; and Ross Fuller, finance director.
