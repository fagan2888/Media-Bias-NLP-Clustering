How can anyone sum up an entire year in just one minute!? FOX Animation Domination High-Def was able to do it through the magic of gifs. The ADHD gifs tell the story of 2014 in very quick chapters.

The FOX Animation Domination High-Def crew covers everything “2014” including Obamacare, Michael Sam, the Sochi Olympics, Macho Vlad Putin, the late Ultimate Warrior, Ferguson, Donald Sterling, pot legalization, changes at the Tonight Show, Ebola, even the disappearing rhinos. In one of the big comedy stories of the year, we see a gif of Cosby getting hit with some pudding. That about sums it up.

FOX Animation Domination High-Def can be seen Saturdays at 11 pm et on FOX. Also you can subscribe to the FOX ADHD YouTube channel.
