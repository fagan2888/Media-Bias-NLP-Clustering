Ky.'s unlikely health care heartthrob\n\nFor anxious national Democrats who have pined for a white knight in the health care reform debate, Steve Beshear is starting to look like the one they\u2019ve been waiting for \u2013 implausible as that development may be.\n\nAmid a torrent of negative national headlines about the Affordable Care Act, the 69-year-old Kentucky governor \u2013 a canny Southern operator who\u2019s spent his career at arm\u2019s length from the Democratic base \u2013 has charged out of Frankfort as a kind of ambassador-by-default for the controversial law. He has toured the cable networks, appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and authored a tartly worded New York Times op-ed telling Republican ACA opponents to \u201cget out of the way so I can help my people.\u201d This week, congressional Democrats hosted Beshear at their Thursday caucus meeting to learn from his example on health care.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe has even fielded a grateful phone call from the president of the United States. Barack Obama called last month \u201cjust to say thank you,\u201d Beshear told POLITICO. And this gratitude comes from the president to a state where he failed to get 40 percent of the vote in the 2012 election.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Nevada's Republican governor is 'all in')\n\n\u201cHe said Kentucky is showing the way here and is showing the nation that this can work and it will work,\u201d the governor recalled. \u201cI thanked him, because he and the Congress gave me the opportunity to do this.\u201d\n\nThe way Beshear tells it, \u201cthis\u201d is enrolling 69,000 Kentuckians in newly available health coverage programs, a number that has grown steadily and that the Democrat expects to \u201csurge\u201d in the final weeks of the year. As the only governor of a Southern state who has both set up a state insurance exchange and green-lighted an expansion of the Medicaid program, Beshear represents a painfully rare bright spot in the landscape of Obamacare implementation. The state exchange, dubbed Kynect, has been a model of smooth enrollment compared to the federal government\u2019s version, and has absorbed 550,000 web visitors and 180,000 phone inquiries so far.\n\nThe final verdict on the program \u2013 nationally and on the state level \u2013 is far from decided, but Beshear says his mind is entirely made up on both the merits and the politics of health care. From his perspective, voters\u2019 opposition to the ACA is driven largely by a sense of anxiety about how the program may change their lives. If they find a year from now that the law has left their personal care unchanged, or even improved it, public opinion could shift quickly.\n\n( Obamacare Guide: What the fight's really about)\n\n\u201cI believe the pressure will be so great over the next three or four or five years, on the states that haven\u2019t gone in this direction, that they will end up just where Kentucky is,\u201d Beshear predicted. \u201cTheir people are going to demand this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s precisely the message national Democrats are aching to hear, even \u2013 or perhaps especially \u2013 from a source as unexpected as a pro-gun, pro-coal, red-state governor who once endorsed using state tax incentives to build a creationist theme park.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Xavier Becerra, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, called Beshear\u2019s Hill visit \u201creassuring\u201d to a party that\u2019s been under fire on health care for nearly half a decade.\n\n\u201cI think most of us felt like, this is a story that we\u2019ve been wanting to surface, that it\u2019s got to percolate to the top,\u201d Becerra said. \u201cHe came in, very honest, the aw-shucks kind of thing, and said, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re making it work.\u2019\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Next up: ACA worst-case scenario?)\n\nBeshear was never supposed to be an activist governor, let alone a prophet of health care transformation. At home, he\u2019s viewed as a surefooted but conventional figure, a clever pol who last year named his chief GOP antagonist, David Williams, to a circuit judgeship just to get him out of the state Senate. The Democrat\u2019s wiliness was on display again in the Obamacare debate, when he circumvented the legislature to implement the ACA by executive order.\n\nUntil a few years ago, the sharp-featured, snowy-haired Beshear wasn\u2019t expected to end up as governor at all: A onetime wonder boy of Kentucky politics, Beshear lost two statewide races and spent 20 years out of public office before his improbable return to prominence in 2007. A former state attorney general and lieutenant governor, Beshear seemed largely spent as a political force after losing a 1996 Senate race to Republican Mitch McConnell by nearly 13 points.\n\nHis fortunes shifted abruptly in the run-up to the 2007 governor\u2019s race, when a Democratic attorney general indicted Republican Gov. Ernie Fletcher for violating the state\u2019s civil service laws. Beshear emerged as the victor from a crowded Democratic primary and easily defeated the tarnished incumbent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Gov.
