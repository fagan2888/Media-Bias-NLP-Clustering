They\u2019re occurring in the belly of the beast: the district attorney\u2019s office in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nHere in Philadelphia, Andrew Jenemann, head of the district\u2019s attorney\u2019s Public Nuisance Task Force, is making changes to how \u201creal property\u201d\u2014homes, warehouses, and businesses\u2014moves through the forfeiture process.\n\n>>> This is the third article in a three-part series. Read part one here and part two here.\n\nJenemann, an assistant district attorney, also spearheads adjustments to the process that property owners go through to prove that their cash or cars are not connected to criminal activity. That process begins in the notorious Courtroom 478.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies across America have been the target of critics who argue that police and prosecutors use civil asset forfeiture\u2014a legal tool giving them the power to seize property and money suspected of being related to a crime\u2014to pad their budgets.\n\nBut for the officers of the Philadelphia Police Department and the prosecutors in the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office, the bulk of the criticism seems to be aimed at them.\n\n\u201cWhy has there been so much scrutiny on our program?\u201d Jenemann says in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you, honestly, why we have gotten that much scrutiny compared to any other city.\u201d\n\nThe city seized more than $3.4 million in cash and property last year, according to a report from the Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Office. The total is more than any county in Pennsylvania and three times more than Montgomery County, which had the second highest amount in proceeds.\n\nBy comparison, Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, reported forfeiture proceeds of $730,168 in cash and property last year.\n\nThe law enforcement officials at the top in Philadelphia: District Attorney R. Seth Williams, a Democrat who assumed the elected office in January 2010, is a former assistant district attorney. Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey, former police chief of Washington, D.C., took over the Philadelphia force in 2008. He is set to retire in January.\n\nAs the city maneuvers through legal challenges and changes proposed at the state level, Jenemann concedes that the system has flaws and recognizes that change is both needed and coming.\n\n\u201cWe have used forfeiture successfully as a tool for a long time. I think it\u2019s used, for the most part, fairly,\u201d he says. \u201cAs prosecutors, our objective is to take what we have, to try and make it better, and try to make it the system that people deserve going forward.\u201d\n\nChanges From the Courts\n\nAs opponents mount fights against the practice in statehouses in roughly a dozen states, organizations have challenged states\u2019 civil asset forfeiture laws in at least three suits in federal courts.\n\nIn Arizona, the American Civil Liberties Union sued Pinal County\u2019s top law enforcement officials on the grounds that the county\u2019s use of asset forfeiture violates constitutionally protected rights.\n\nSimilarly, a District of Columbia class-action lawsuit by 22 property owners accuses the Metropolitan Police Department of improperly seizing vehicles and money and failing to provide the property owners with timely notice to fight the seizures.\n\nBut perhaps the most well-known legal challenge comes from the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm in Arlington, Va. In August 2014, the group filed a class-action lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cCivil forfeiture is one of the greatest threats to property rights and due process in our nation today. And Philadelphia is just an example of what happens when it\u2019s taken to its extreme,\u201d Darpana Sheth, an Institute for Justice lawyer arguing the case, tells The Daily Signal. Sheth adds:\n\nIn Philadelphia, you have this system of robo-forfeitures, which is just automatically done. That\u2019s why we call it the forfeiture machine, and the system of kangaroo courts. And that is all the inevitable results of a system of policing for profit that is driving Philadelphia\u2019s forfeiture machine.\n\nThe Institute for Justice sued after Philadelphia police seized a house belonging to Chris Sourovelis and his wife, Markela. Their son had been arrested for selling $40 worth of heroin outside their northeast Philadelphia home.\n\nThe couple, though, never was charged with a crime.\n\nThe Philadelphia Police Department could not comment on the case, but a spokeswoman said the department follows the laws on the books regarding civil forfeiture.\n\nNow, Chris Sourovelis is one of four property owners challenging the constitutionality of Philadelphia\u2019s civil forfeiture system.\n\n\u201cNo other jurisdiction is evicting people out of their homes without giving them notice,\u201d Sheth says. She adds:\n\nThe Supreme Court made very clear that you cannot seize a home or real property without giving notice and without giving an opportunity to be heard. The fact that they were flagrantly violating that\u2014we couldn\u2019t understand how it had been going on this long.\n\n\u2018Seize and Seal\u2019\n\nIn its suit, the Institute for Justice first pushed back against Philadelphia\u2019s \u201cseize and seal\u201d policy. Under it, law enforcement seals a property seized under forfeiture laws while the case moves through the court system.\n\nThe organization says the policy has led to the eviction of innocent property owners who don\u2019t have the chance to defend themselves before their houses are sealed.\n\n\u201cSeize and seal\u201d orders were intended to be used sparingly and only in extreme circumstances, but the group found that nearly 85 percent of forfeiture cases involving houses in Philadelphia began with such orders.\n\nThe Institute for Justice argues that the orders violate the Constitution because property owners are kept from their homes for several weeks or months.\n\nIn a proposed settlement agreement between prosecutors and the legal group, the city agrees to dismiss any \u201cseize and seal\u201d orders currently in effect.\n\nThe Institute for Justice also challenged the process by which property owners try to get their property back. In forfeiture cases, those who fight the city for the return of cash, motor vehicles, and houses are asked to return multiple times to Courtroom 478\u2014where forfeiture proceedings take place.\n\nFor many property owners, the process is too lengthy to be pursued by anyone but the most dedicated.\n\nAccording to a study by the American Civil Liberties Union, a review of 16,000 forfeiture cases between 2011 and 2013 that didn\u2019t involve real estate found that property owners appeared in court a median of four times before their cases were decided.\n\nAnd for some, the reward may not be worth the effort.\n\nThe ACLU, examining a random sample of 351 cash forfeitures over the same period, found that half involved amounts under $192. Just 10 percent topped $1,000.\n\nSuch \u201cprocedural pitfalls,\u201d the Institute for Justice argues in its suit, violate the right to due process. The group refers to a 2002 case, Krimstock v. Kelly, in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled that the government must provide a prompt hearing after law enforcement seizes property.\n\nThe Institute for Justice also argues that Philadephia law enforcement treats citizens \u201clike ATMs.\u201d It is a reference to what the group regards as a perverse profit incentive created by civil asset forfeiture: Pennsylvania law allows the proceeds to go into the coffers of police departments and district attorney\u2019s offices that conduct the seizures.\n\nThe ACLU and Institute for Justice both found that the money is used to buy a vast array of items and also goes to paying officers\u2019 and prosecutors\u2019 salaries.\n\nThe Institute for Justice argues that such use of proceeds injects bias and self-interest into the decision-making process for prosecutors and police, since financial gain is to be had for city officials. Sheth says:\n\nThe heart of the lawsuit has always been the profit incentive, this direct conflict of interest that prosecutors and police have in seizing and forfeiting property. And that is something the city and the DA\u2019s office has indicated they will never settle. It\u2019s not a surprise there. It\u2019s what\u2019s driving and fueling the Philadelphia forfeiture machine\u2014this $6-million slush fund that the City Council isn\u2019t monitoring or accountable for. It\u2019s just the [district attorney\u2019s] office wants to spend it.\n\nWhen property owners go to Courtroom 478 to prove that their belongings are not tied to criminal activity, they appear only before prosecutors and a scheduler, who notifies them of when they need to return for the next hearing.\n\nWith no judge present, the Institute for Justice argues, a neutral party is not involved. And according to the lawsuit, lawyers representing the city can move for automatic forfeiture of cash, cars, or houses if a property owner misses just one hearing.\n\nNearly 10 months after the Institute for Justice filed its suit, the district attorney\u2019s office asked that the case be dismissed, but a federal judge denied the request in May.\n\n\u201cCivil forfeiture is a problematic legal tool to begin with, but it\u2019s been used in Philadelphia so aggressively,\u201d Sheth said. \u201cIt\u2019s created this sort of system where because of that direct profit incentive where 100 percent of the proceeds go directly back to the DA\u2019s office \u2026 there\u2019s a lack of any procedures.\u201d\n\nChanges From Within\n\nAs the federal court considers the case, the prosecutor who heads the civil asset forfeiture program is instituting changes from the inside.\n\nJenemann took over the Public Nuisance Task Force at the end of March. Although he doesn\u2019t come from a background in forfeiture, he began making changes to the program just one week later.\n\n\u201cAs a prosecutor\u2019s office, our job is to ensure we\u2019re providing justice and fairness to everyone we came into contact with,\u201d Jenemann tells The Daily Signal. \u201cWhen I looked at the processes, I wanted to make sure the right petitions are being filed, they are being filed with the right person, and the process works [in] the manner that everyone expects it to.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately, Jenemann changed how the office executes forfeitures on real property\u2014 including houses, businesses, and warehouses\u2014and specifically the process relating to property owners.\n\nIf the owner is the defendant named in a corresponding criminal case, then the office will move to forfeit the property. If not, the office will determine the owner\u2019s level of involvement.\n\n\u201cWere they present during the search warrant? What extent are they involved? Are they a landlord or resident?\u201d Jenemann says of the process for \u201cweeding out\u201d those who weren\u2019t aware of what was occurring at their property.\n\nIf the property owner isn\u2019t the defendant, the district attorney\u2019s office won\u2019t issue a forfeiture petition, Jenemann says. Instead, it will opt for a warning letter alerting the owner that illegal activity took place there.\n\nIn some cases, he says, illegal activity continues despite the warning. In those cases, what he said represents a \u201csmall category,\u201d the city will file a forfeiture petition in court.\n\nJenemann said the district attorney\u2019s office hasn\u2019t yet had this happen. Instead, he cited an interaction prosecutors had with a landlord after his property was used three times for drug-dealing activity. The city spoke with the landlord and learned that the property had been boarded up. Drug dealers, Jenemann said, were breaking in and selling drugs out of the home.\n\nBecause the landlord had acted swiftly to quell the illegal activity, the district attorney\u2019s office opted not to forfeit the property.\n\nIn the months since Jenemann\u2019s changes went into effect, his office has assigned nine new forfeiture cases. Four forfeiture petitions have been filed.\n\nRiding in a black pickup truck owned by the DA\u2019s office\u2014it previously belonged to a drug dealer \u2014Jenemann tells The Daily Signal the new process has been well-received and appears to be working.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard to establish a track record,\u201d Jenemann says, \u201cto establish that people either do or do not have knowledge of what\u2019s going on with their properties.\u201d\n\nJenemann also is working to reform the court aspect of the process and move to a \u201cmore traditionally recognized\u201d courtroom.\n\nReforms governing the court proceedings went into effect Oct. 19 to limit the number of times property owners must appear in Courtroom 478, as well as the interactions between them and prosecutors. Such interactions took place after the district attorney\u2019s office picked up some of the slack for the courts, Jenemann says.\n\nJenemann contends that negotiations are a \u201cfundamental part\u201d of civil proceedings, since they can lead to settlements and withdrawal of cases. However, he put an end to the counseling and explaining that assistant district attorneys often did with property owners. Instead, a trial commissioner guides them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to make things work better,\u201d Jenemann says of the forfeiture process. \u201cWe work closely with opponents. This is one of those processes where the time has come.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csingle biggest change,\u201d the assistant district attorney says, addresses the Institute for Justice\u2019s criticism of re-listing cases\u2014or requiring a property owner to appear multiple times in Courtroom 478.\n\nUnder the new system, property owners who have a criminal case pending at the same time a forfeiture case moves through the courts will not have to return to Courtroom 478 for status hearings. The change, Jenemann says, keeps property owners from having to appear multiple times.\n\nInstead, the forfeiture case is virtually frozen in the system\u2014continued without a further listing, officially\u2014until the criminal case is resolved.\n\nProperty owners can request that a forfeiture case move forward, Jenemann says, and such demands typically are made by those fighting to have their vehicles returned.\n\nMany of the changes Jenemann oversees were made in response to Sheth and the Institute for Justice\u2019s lawsuit. She is glad the city has begun to make the process more fair, Sheth says, but was surprised to see how \u201cresolute and defensive\u201d prosecutors were at first.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of delay, delay, delay,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief to see the light with respect to at least some of these claims.\u201d\n\nChanges at the Statehouse\n\nFor state Sen. Anthony Williams, a Democrat representing Delaware and Philadelphia counties, the increasing number of incidents involving innocent property owners who had cash, cars, and houses seized by the City of Brotherly Love was cause for alarm.\n\n\u201cPrivate citizens should not feel that their government would take away their rights and treat them as guilty \u2026 if they\u2019re innocent, but even if they\u2019re not properly charged or vetted,\u201d Williams says in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cYou don\u2019t want any American feeling that the government is working against them and taking what is theirs rightfully away from them without due process.\u201d\n\nNow, as Jenemann and the district attorney\u2019s office consider more internal changes, legislation reforming Pennsylvania law on civil asset forfeiture is before the state legislature.\n\nSponsored by Williams and state Sen. Mike Folmer, a Republican representing Dauphin, Lebanon, and York counties, the bill addresses many of the most controversial aspects of the process. Specifically, their bill would:\n\nRequire a criminal conviction before property can be forfeited.\n\nRaise the burden of proof to \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d\n\nGuarantee the right to counsel and to seek attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nRedirect forfeiture revenues to the county or state general fund.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very comprehensive, top-down reform of the forfeiture system,\u201d Jason Snead, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, says. \u201cIf you look down the list, it does everything that a good package should be considering.\u201d\n\nLegislative reforms have been lauded by groups opposed to forfeiture, but they draw criticism from law enforcement agencies. The latter argue that such changes will impede their ability to curb drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\n\u2018Get the Conviction First\u2019\n\nDistrict attorneys across the state pushed back on his legislation, arguing that the revenue from forfeiture is important to fighting crime, Williams says.\n\nSpeaking with The Daily Signal, Jenemann explains why it\u2019s important for law enforcement to begin the forfeiture process before a conviction\u2014a provision of the proposed legislation that has been criticized.\n\nA drug dealer under surveillance by police may pass cash to another person, Jenemann says as an example. If a police officer stops the person with the money but the drug dealer goes in a different direction, he says, that person shouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep it.\n\nIf a conviction is required before cash or property is forfeited, Jenemann says, some criminals won\u2019t have to forfeit the profits from the crime:\n\nThe money is drug money. The person should be deprived of that. Forfeiture action gives us the opportunity to prove the money or house or car is related to the crime.\n\nBut Williams, the senator, says that requiring a conviction first puts the onus on the truly guilty\u2014the property owners from whom law enforcement should seek revenue.\n\n\u201cThe claim puts it in a category or space that, while you may have not been found guilty in court, we can still sort of weigh against you because our opinion is different,\u201d Williams says, adding:\n\nThat\u2019s not the standard we should be taking. That\u2019s a standard you apply against O.J. Simpson. That\u2019s not a standard you apply against O.J. Simpson\u2019s grandmother.\n\nFolmer, Williams\u2019 Republican co-sponsor, stresses that under the proposal, police still could seize money from those they believe are engaged in criminal activity.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t take away civil asset forfeiture,\u201d Folmer tells The Daily Signal. \u201cIt just reforms it and brings it more in line with the Fifth and Sixth amendments [of] the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. We are innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\u201cIf [forfeiture is] a good tool for law enforcement, great. Use it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut get the conviction first. I don\u2019t want to hurt [police] in doing their job. Their job is hard enough. I get it. But get the conviction first.\u201d\n\nHeritage\u2019s Snead commends the legislation for getting back to forfeiture\u2019s original intent\u2014to send a clear message to criminals that crime doesn\u2019t pay.\n\n\u201cA good forfeiture package should return forfeiture to its original and narrow purpose, which is relieving drug kingpins and criminal organizations of their ill-gotten gains,\u201d he says, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics of civil forfeiture are calling for changes to the tool that gives law enforcement the power to seize cash, cars and property.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Critics of civil forfeiture are calling for changes to the tool that gives law enforcement the power to seize cash, cars and property.", "title": "Reformers Want to Make It Harder for Police to Keep Property", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151014_PhillyReformsFEAT_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-12T10:10:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1WQhfhH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Critics of civil forfeiture are calling for changes to the tool that gives law enforcement the power to seize cash, cars and property.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151014_PhillyReformsFEAT_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "Reformers Want to Make It Harder for Police to Keep Property", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-11-11T03:01:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-12T10:10:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "policing for profit, civil asset forfeiture, Philadelphia police forfeiture, Andrew Jenemann, Mike Folmer, Anthony Williams, Darpana Sheth, Institute for Justice, Jason Snead"}, "article_summary": "The Institute for Justice also challenged the process by which property owners try to get their property back.\nSimilarly, a District of Columbia class-action lawsuit by 22 property owners accuses the Metropolitan Police Department of improperly seizing vehicles and money and failing to provide the property owners with timely notice to fight the seizures.\nFor many property owners, the process is too lengthy to be pursued by anyone but the most dedicated.\nThe organization says the policy has led to the eviction of innocent property owners who don\u2019t have the chance to defend themselves before their houses are sealed.\nHowever, he put an end to the counseling and explaining that assistant district attorneys often did with property owners."}
