CEDAR RAPIDS — Public Policy Polling reported earlier this week that Hillary Clinton was leading Bernie Sanders 52 percent to 34 percent in Iowa, but its findings show the Vermont senator fares better against Republicans than the former secretary of state.

PPP’s Iowa general election poll finds mixed results for Clinton. In head-to-head matchups, she leads Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump, but trails Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and ties Ben Carson.

Sanders does an average of 2 points better than Clinton in general election matchups, leading all the GOP hopefuls except Rubio. According to PPP, he’s winning 45 to 39 over Fiorina, 44 to 40 over Bush, 46 to 43 over Trump, 44 to 43 over Cruz, and 43 to 42 over Carson. He trails Rubio 44 to 42.

In the one-on-one matchups, Clinton leads 46 to 41 over Bush, 45 to 42 over Fiorina and 45 to 43 over Trump and ties Carson at 45. She trails Cruz 47 percent to 44 percent and Rubio 48 percent to 41 percent.

The margin of error for the survey of 1,426 Iowa voters from Dec. 10-13 is 2.6 percent. Eighty percent of participants responded via phone, while 20 percent who did not have landlines conducted the survey over the Internet.

The GOP advantage would be wiped out if Trump bolts the party and runs as an independent, according to PPP. In a three-way race with Clinton and Rubio, he would win 23 percent of the vote, which takes Clinton from a 7 percentage point deficit to winning 39 percent to 33 percent. If Cruz were the GOP nominees, Trump gets 20 percent and Clinton wins 41 percent to 33 percent.

In other findings:

l Next year’s U.S. Senate race continues to look like a cakewalk for Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who has a 53 percent to 33 percent approval rating, compared with 42 percent to 41 percent for GOP Sen. Joni Ernst and 37 to 48 for Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who is posting some of the lowest numbers of his entire time in office. Grassley leads all his potential Democratic opponents by 25 points for re-election — 54 to 29 percent over Tom Fiegen and Rob Hogg and 53 to 28 over Bob Krause.

l By 84 percent to 9 percent, Iowa voters support barring people on the terrorist watch list from buying a firearm and by 83 to 10 percent favor requiring criminal background checks on all gun purchases.

l Iowans are divided 42 to 42 percent on the Affordable Care Act.

l In a head-to-head match-up to see who Iowans like better, Stephen King, the author, or Steve King, the congressman, it was a romp for the author, coming out ahead 50 to 26 percent. The congressman did win 48 to 23 percent with Republicans, but the author wins 75 to 9 percent with Democrats and 49 to 22 percent with independents.
