A middle school teacher in Jacksonville, Florida, has been suspended for 15 days after she was accused of receiving a lap dance from a student and twerking in front of others at a school-sponsored soccer team party.

Courtney Spruill, a physical education and health teacher at Kernan Middle School, was accused of drinking alcohol at an end-of-year girls’ soccer team party at the home of a team member, the Florida Times-Union reported.

The teacher was also accused of twerking and teaching other students how to twerk. Cellphone video reportedly showed Ms. Spruill receiving a lap dance from a student.

The mother who hosted the party told investigators that Ms. Spruill brought a bottle of vodka to the party as a housewarming gift, but she only drank soda. The woman said she wouldn’t allow alcohol around her children, the Florida Times-Union reported.

The teacher has been reprimanded once verbally and twice in writing in the last year for failing notify her boss that she would be late for work, the newspaper said.

The Duval County School Board concluded after an investigation that there was enough evidence to allege Ms. Spruill of “the gross exercise of poor judgement,” while chaperoning children at a school party.

The school board voted unanimously at its July 1 regular meeting. Details of the suspension didn’t become public until Monday.
