Their message: The district\u2019s cost-cutting ideas are misguided, life-threatening and disrespectful to teachers who dedicated decades in the classroom with the expectation that they would be adequately medically insured for the rest of their lives.\n\n\u201cHad I known what we\u2019d be talking about at this point, I wouldn\u2019t have retired,\u201d said Ed Riddick, 63, a 37-year employee. Riddick retired from Arlington High School to care for his sick spouse because he thought his medical insurance would adequately cover her. He said the prospect of navigating massive changes in his family coverage is frightening. \u201cChanging out of the Cigna plan is like jumping off a cliff without a parachute,\u201d he told the board.\n\nDistrict leaders are exploring ways to reduce retirees\u2019 non-pension benefits by, among other things, cutting retirees\u2019 spouses from the plan, switching retirees to a state plan, or giving retirees cash to shop for their own insurance.\n\nPHOTO: Kayleigh Skinner\n\n\u201cWe all worked our rears off for years,\u201d said Bob Cannon, 79, a 30-year employee. \u201cI love this place and I gave my life to this place. \u2026 I\u2019m an old man \u2026 and I want some insurance.\u201d Cannon said that, when he went to work for the former Memphis City Schools, he was told that insurance was the best feature of his benefits package. Cannon said he needs good medical insurance to cover three people in his family, including his handicapped daughter.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever been grateful that my husband died of cancer before now,\u201d said Susan Goodman, 69, who worked for 30 years in several districts throughout the state. \u201cThis is an incredibly hideous thing that could happen at the end of their lives. Many people have given their lives for the county, for the city, for the schools, and are now being treated so incredibly horrible.\u201d Goodman is relying on medical, visual and dental coverage to help care for her disabled adult son.\n\nBoard members told retirees they will consider the feedback of those impacted by the changes and reminded them that they have not made any changes to health plans at this point.\n\nState legislators and county commissioners have warned that the financially strapped school district could go bankrupt if it fails to pay down its debt in the near future.\n\nThe debt grew over time after the self-insured district, which is the result of a 2013 merger between Memphis City Schools and the former Shelby County Schools, repeatedly paid for medical costs as they arose rather than pay the \u201cactuarial\u201d costs of the plan, which administrators estimate at $125 million a year. Currently, the district spends about $30 million on its retirement health care plan.\n\nGoodman said the board has not adequately explained options offered by the district and complained that many teachers are confused.\n\nLast month, at the request of the board, administrators presented several options that could reduce the annual actuarial costs, including:\n\nWriting retirees a monthly check for $10 for every year served \u2014 to go toward private insurance or insurance purchased through the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 reducing the debt by about $430 million;\n\nSwitching district employees and retirees to the state\u2019s employee health insurance plan at a cost savings to the district of $233 million. Administrators said the state plan provides better benefits than the district\u2019s current plan. A switch would have to be voted on and approved by a majority of the district\u2019s 10,000 employees;\n\nCutting all retirees\u2019 benefits in 2020, reducing the district\u2019s debt by $255 million;\n\nCutting district spouses from the plan, at a cost savings of $166 million.\n\nAdministrators are asking current teachers and retirees for feedback on insurance coverage options outlined on the district\u2019s website.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chalkbeat", "description": "Angry retired educators pack a Shelby County Board of Education forum to protest proposed changes to their health insurance plans.", "title": "What Shelby County\u2019s retired teachers told the district about their threatened benefits", "url": "http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/tn/2015/07/07/what-shelby-countys-retired-teachers-told-the-district-about-their-threatened-benefits/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Audience2.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-07T05:19:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T04:05:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Audience2.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Cannon said he needs good medical insurance to cover three people in his family, including his handicapped daughter.\nRiddick retired from Arlington High School to care for his sick spouse because he thought his medical insurance would adequately cover her.\nGoodman said the board has not adequately explained options offered by the district and complained that many teachers are confused.\nAdministrators said the state plan provides better benefits than the district\u2019s current plan.\nAdministrators are asking current teachers and retirees for feedback on insurance coverage options outlined on the district\u2019s website."}
