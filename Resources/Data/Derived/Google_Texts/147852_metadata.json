It\u2019s the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men in the country. Native American men are typically diagnosed at a later stage of cancer growth when treatment options are limited, leading to higher mortality rates than other ethnicities, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\n\u201cAnytime you can get a large group of people together and bring attention to something like cancer awareness, there's never a negative in that,\u201d Sequoyah Football Head Coach Shane Richardson said. \u201cCancer reaches everyone\u2019s family and everybody\u2019s life in some way, so being involved in bringing attention to it is something we take pretty seriously.\u201d\n\nFor Sequoyah\u2019s campus security officer, Deputy Marshal Clay Troutman, who works football games, the cause hits close to home. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 and lost both his father and grandfather to the disease. Troutman was fortunate to catch the cancer early and is currently cancer free.\n\n\u201cProstate cancer isn\u2019t really something that you talk about around the water cooler. As guys, we don\u2019t think about it, we don\u2019t talk about it, but I think it does need to be recognized,\u201d Troutman said. \u201cI\u2019m in full support of the team, or anybody wanting to help promote awareness for the men in the crowd.\u201d\n\nSequoyah also holds an annual \u201cThink Pink Game\u201d for breast cancer awareness on Oct. 4, and a \u201cPack It Purple Game\u201d for domestic violence awareness on Oct. 17\n\nFor general information about prostate cancer awareness, contact Greg Bilby at 918-453-5381 or greg-bilby@cherokee.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Sequoyah Indians march across Thompson Field to battle the Beggs Demons Friday night, players will be sporting a small blue ribbon promoting prostate cancer awareness o", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/13/sequoyah-football-players-sport-blue-ribbons-prostate-cancer-awareness-151264", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/shscancerhelmets.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Sequoyah Football Players Sport Blue Ribbons for Prostate Cancer Awareness"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-09-13T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/13/sequoyah-football-players-sport-blue-ribbons-prostate-cancer-awareness-151264", "dc": {"title": "Sequoyah Football Players Sport Blue Ribbons for Prostate Cancer Awareness"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Sequoyah Football Players Sport Blue Ribbons for Prostate Cancer Awareness"}, "article_summary": "He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 and lost both his father and grandfather to the disease.\n\u201cIf these young men can influence members of their families or anyone at the game to get checked, then we\u2019ve done some good.\u201dSeptember is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month.\n\u201cAnytime you can get a large group of people together and bring attention to something like cancer awareness, there's never a negative in that,\u201d Sequoyah Football Head Coach Shane Richardson said.\n\u201cProstate cancer isn\u2019t really something that you talk about around the water cooler.\nTroutman was fortunate to catch the cancer early and is currently cancer free."}
