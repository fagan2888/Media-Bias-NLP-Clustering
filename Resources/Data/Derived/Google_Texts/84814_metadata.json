Pat McCrory for pandering to racial fears in statements about Central American children fleeing violence at home and coming to the United States.\n\nMcCrory claimed his recent remarks are motivated by his concern for the children\u2019s welfare. But he cleverly manipulates false stereotypes about immigrants of color invading \u201cour\u201d country and state, to steal \u201cour\u201d resources and participate in criminal acts like drug trafficking and prostitution.\n\nLatino advocacy and immigrants\u2019 rights groups, including El Pueblo, El Centro Hispano, and others, will join Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, President of the NC NAACP, at a Friday news conference at 1:00 p.m. in Raleigh to hold Gov. McCrory accountable for his political grandstanding. Advocates say the situation that should be addressed with compassion, love, and a thoughtful commitment of resources and energy.\n\nThe Forward Together Moral Movement also calls upon the NC state legislative leadership to state publicly whether they agree with the governor\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cThese children have fled from trauma in search of the better life that America promises, and they should be welcomed in North Carolina, not turned into the targets of a manhunt to deport them,\u201d said Rev. Barber.\n\nFriday\u2019s press conference will be held at Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh.
