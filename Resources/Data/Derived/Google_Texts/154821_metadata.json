Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.\n\nWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\n\nWe value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either by the same reader or different readers.\n\nWe follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.\n\nWe do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.\n\nWe welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly.\n\nWe appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tribune-Review", "description": "A rally and march are scheduled Saturday in Oakland to urge UPMC, Western Pennsylvania's largest employer, to improve treatment of its employees, Pittsburgh City Councilwoman ...", "pubdate": "2013-09-04 17:45:01", "author": "Tribune-Review", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "A rally and march are scheduled Saturday in Oakland to urge UPMC, Western Pennsylvania's largest employer, to improve treatment of its employees, Pittsburgh City Councilwoman ...", "title": "Rally in Oakland will protest UPMC's treatment of workers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-04 17:45:01.308", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/4649488-74/rally-upmc-oakland", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "A rally and march are scheduled Saturday in Oakland to urge UPMC, Western Pennsylvania's largest employer, to improve treatment of its employees, Pittsburgh City Councilwoman ...", "title": "Rally in Oakland will protest UPMC's treatment of workers", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "creator": "@triblive", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-04 17:45:01", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/4649488-74/rally-upmc-oakland", "sailthru.title": "Rally in Oakland will protest UPMC's treatment of workers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Breaking", "headline": "Rally in Oakland will protest UPMC's treatment of workers", "keywords": "rally, upmc, oakland, workers, march", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2013-09-04 17:45:01", "subcategory": "Admin Page", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2013-09-04 17:45:01", "modified_time": "2013-09-04 17:45:01.308", "tag": "rally, upmc, oakland, workers, march", "subsection": "Admin Page", "title": "Rally in Oakland will protest UPMC's treatment of workers", "author": "Tribune-Review"}, "docauthor": "Tribune-Review", "sailthru.description": "A rally and march are scheduled Saturday in Oakland to urge UPMC, Western Pennsylvania's largest employer, to improve treatment of its employees, Pittsburgh City Councilwoman ..."}, "article_summary": "SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, which accuses UPMC of intimidating and retaliating against workers trying to organize, is hosting the rally.\nThe rally and march begin at 11 a.m. at the corner of Bigelow Boulevard and Forbes Avenue in Oakland.\nA rally and march are scheduled Saturday in Oakland to urge UPMC, Western Pennsylvania's largest employer, to improve treatment of its employees, Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak said.\nBecause of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\nTo avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction."}
