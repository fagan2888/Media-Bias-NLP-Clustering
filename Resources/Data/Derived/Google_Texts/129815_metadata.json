Since 2003, 4,459 U.S. troops have died in combat operations in Iraq, with the majority of those deaths (3,908) occurring during a five-year period from 2003 to 2007.\n\nThe deadliest year was 2007, during which 904 U.S. troops died in Iraq\u2014a total lower than the yearly average of 1,135 Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat since 2014.\n\nThe Ukraine war has seen two official cease-fires and a renewed truce that went into effect in September, all of which have failed to fully quell the violence.\n\nThe most recent cease-fire, called Minsk II, was signed in February 2015 but collapsed days later when combined Russian-separatist forces sacked the village of Debaltseve, then Ukrainian-controlled, in a massive artillery attack.\n\nIn September, both sides to the conflict renewed their commitment to the Minsk II terms, but fighting never completely stopped. Cease-fire \u201cviolations\u201d occur daily.\n\n\u201cOne has to say that unfortunately we still don\u2019t have a sustainable cease-fire, which is naturally a prerequisite for the implementation of different points in the Minsk agreement,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel said before a Monday meeting with Poroshenko in Berlin, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nLiving in Limbo\n\nThe Donbas region remains in a state of militarized limbo and is a virtual tinderbox ready to reignite at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nDozens of villages ravaged by the fighting are in ruins and abandoned. About 1.7 million Ukrainians remain refugees in their own country. They are internally displaced persons, in U.N. parlance.\n\nU.S. and Ukrainian intelligence sources say Russian weapons and troops still flow into the self-proclaimed separatist republics\u2014a charge the Kremlin denies.\n\nCoffey said it is in the Kremlin\u2019s interest to let the Ukraine war fizzle but not completely extinguish:\n\nI would say it\u2019s a combination of a few things: Moscow\u2019s focus in Syria, the drop in oil prices, the winter, and the fact that the status quo is a victory for Russia and a defeat for Ukraine. Therefore, Russia doesn\u2019t really need to support major combat operations right now. As long as Ukraine doesn\u2019t control all of its territory, the onus is on Kyiv to act\u2014not Russia.\n\nWith snipers and artillery working every day, the potential for an unanticipated, or unintended, escalation by either side remains high.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the multinational group charged with monitoring the Ukraine cease-fire, reported Monday a \u201csharp increase\u201d in cease-fire violations over the weekend.\n\nAnd the Ukrainian military said Tuesday that combined Russian-separatist forces attacked Ukrainian positions more than 50 times Monday with small arms, machine guns, grenade launchers, and mortars.\n\nThe war simply oscillates between being not quite as bad as people feared and never completely waning under the cease-fires.\n\nAt the height of the war in summer 2014, officials in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, issued instructions on how to use the metro subway system as a bomb shelter in case of a Russian attack on the city. Across Kyiv, spray-painted signs on the sides of buildings told where the nearest bomb shelters were located.\n\nYet the war never expanded out of the Donbas. And while the opposing camps have jockeyed for territory during the past two years, the front lines have stayed largely fixed since about September 2014.\n\nUphill Battle\n\nThe combined Russian-separatist attack on Debaltseve last February was the latest significant change of territory in the Ukraine war.\n\nSince Debaltseve, the war has been static, fought largely from trenches and from military camps based in ruined villages along the front lines. It is a distance war, where most casualties come from artillery or sniper potshots. Land mines are a constant threat.\n\nThe United States and the European Union recently have increased pressure on Moscow to enforce the terms of the Minsk II cease-fire.\n\nAccording to U.S. and Ukrainian reports, Russia has continued to ship surplus Soviet military equipment and armaments into the separatist territories. The Ukrainian military says combined Russian-separatist forces now command 450 tanks\u2014more than Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe separatist territories now have one of the best militaries in Europe; they only lack airpower,\u201d said Mykhailo Samus, deputy director of the Center for Army, Conversion, and Disarmament Studies, a Ukrainian think tank.\n\nWhile Kyiv\u2019s attention has refocused lately on the domestic fight against corruption and for political reforms, the conflict in eastern Ukraine looms over the entire country.\n\nSome analysts contend the Kremlin\u2019s continued support for the separatist territories telegraphs an intent to keep the conflict in eastern Ukraine \u201cfrozen,\u201d both as political leverage over Kyiv and a way to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.\n\n\u201cAmong other things, Putin sees the war in Ukraine as a way to stall political reforms in Kyiv,\u201d Coffey said.\n\nHe added:\n\nTrying to reform your political system and economy while fighting a war inside your borders is a bit like trying to build a ship while you are already out at sea. However, at the end of the day, Russia\u2019s goals in Ukraine are geopolitical and imperial. Without Ukraine, or at least considerable influence in Ukraine, Russia is only an Asian power and not a European power.\n\nNo Good Option\n\nKyiv faces an uphill battle to live up to its half of Minsk II. A constitutional reform to decentralize power\u2014a condition of the cease-fire that the U.S. and the EU support\u2014is unpopular in Ukraine. Some lawmakers have pushed back against the move.\n\nOpponents of the deal say it will be a capitulation to Russia and a betrayal of the military. Supporters claim that the deal is prudent and necessary to end the fighting and concentrate political energy on rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s post-revolution democracy and economy\u2014and to forge closer ties with Europe.\n\n\u201cIs this war finished? Of course not,\u201d Samus said, adding:\n\nFor now, it\u2019s very dangerous because of the Minsk agreement. If Poroshenko tries to complete the Minsk accord conditions, it will be a conflict for him inside of Ukraine. The political situation will be unstable. He\u2019s trying to gain time.\n\nSpeaking before Ukraine\u2019s parliament Jan. 24, Poroshenko defended the Minsk II truce and decentralization, underscoring the potential for the conflict to reignite if a compromise is not reached.\n\n\u201cThe political forces who want at all costs to torpedo the Minsk agreements, block the peace process, [and] block the constitutional process must be aware of the consequences of their actions,\u201d the Ukrainian president said.\n\n\u201cThey will cause the resumption of a hot phase of the conflict, including full-blown, rather than local, as it has been so far, conflict with Russia.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"There is a real war going on and most in the U.S. haven't got a clue,\u201d The Heritage Foundation's Luke Coffey says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"There is a real war going on and most in the U.S. haven't got a clue,\u201d The Heritage Foundation's Luke Coffey says.", "title": "Despite a Lull in Fighting, the Ukraine War Isn\u2019t Over", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160203_Limbo_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-08T11:53:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JYozYq"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"There is a real war going on and most in the U.S. haven't got a clue,\u201d The Heritage Foundation's Luke Coffey says.", "title": "Despite a Lull in Fighting, the Ukraine War Isn\u2019t Over", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160203_Limbo_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2016-02-05T03:01:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T11:53:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Minsk, Russia, Putin, NATO, Poroshenko, Merkel, Ukraine conflict,  Europe"}, "article_summary": "KYIV, Ukraine\u2014The two-year-old Ukraine war has hit a grim milestone amid the longest and most durable lull in fighting since the conflict began.\nWithout Ukraine, or at least considerable influence in Ukraine, Russia is only an Asian power and not a European power.\nUphill BattleThe combined Russian-separatist attack on Debaltseve last February was the latest significant change of territory in the Ukraine war.\nThe Ukraine war has seen two official cease-fires and a renewed truce that went into effect in September, all of which have failed to fully quell the violence.\nThe Ukrainian military says combined Russian-separatist forces now command 450 tanks\u2014more than Germany, France, and the United Kingdom."}
