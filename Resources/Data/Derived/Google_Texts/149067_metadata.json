The union said its 350 members at Mardi Gras planned to begin their strike at 5 a.m. Monday \u201cunless the Union hears back from the Company that is is willing to continue to negotiate,\u201d a USW news release said.\n\nThe union then announced both parties would meet with a federal mediator for further discussions and the strike deadline had been extended.\n\nFriday\u2019s vote was the third rejection of a company proposal in recent weeks. Mardi Gras has paid a 90/10 split in worker premiums. The new offer is closer to a 75/25 split. The proposal would have increased costs per worker to approximately $1,100 a year, the union said. The union supports a new premium split of 80/20.\n\nThe union also claimed Saturday the company has engaged in unfair labor practices including \u201cthreatening employees with retaliation, intimidation, and undermining the Union,\u201d the USW said. The union has notified the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nMardi Gras Vice President Dan Adkins told MetroNews earlier this he was confident the issues would be worked out. He also said the casino would remain open if a strike were to occur.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Latest insurance offer rejected by members of USW.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Latest insurance offer rejected by members of USW.", "title": "Mardi Gras workers vote again to strike; federal mediation scheduled", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2015/10/03/mardi-gras-workers-vote-again-to-strike/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MardiGrasCasinoandResort5.jpg", "height": 405}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MardiGrasCasinoandResort5.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T20:06:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-03T21:50:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Mardi Gras Vice President Dan Adkins told MetroNews earlier this he was confident the issues would be worked out.\nMardi Gras has paid a 90/10 split in worker premiums.\nFriday\u2019s vote was the third rejection of a company proposal in recent weeks.\nThe union then announced both parties would meet with a federal mediator for further discussions and the strike deadline had been extended.\nUnited Steelworkers Union 14614-F8 rejected the casino\u2019s latest health insurance offer in a Friday vote."}
