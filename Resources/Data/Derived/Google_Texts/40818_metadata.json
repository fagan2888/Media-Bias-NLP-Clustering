The protests at Mizzou led to the resignation of Missouri University System President Tim Wolfe.\n\nOn Wednesday, Christie said he had no interest in meeting with Black Lives Matter activists, blaming the group for the murder of police officers.\n\n\u201cI want the Black Lives Matter people to understand: Don\u2019t call me for a meeting,\u201d he said at an Iowa town hall meeting, The Star-Ledger of New Jersey reported. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting one.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey governor also defended his 2010 stance on immigration, which supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Christie, who changed his stance earlier this year, attributed his previous position on the issue to being a new governor.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that I know now that that\u2019s just not going to work and that we\u2019re not gonna reward people who have come here illegally with citizenship,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI have a real, holistic plan on how to deal with immigration going forward as president of the United States,\u201d he added.\n\nChristie said he would support Ben Carson\u2019s claim that the media is simply picking on him if his answers were \u201csufficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he has answers that are sufficient for the American people, then the issue will go away. If he has answers that are not sufficient for the American people, then they won\u2019t. And that\u2019s what he should do and that\u2019s what every candidate is required to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Christie said Thursday that under President Barack Obama, America's racial divide has worsened.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "Chris Christie said Thursday that under President Barack Obama, America\u2019s racial divide has worsened.", "title": "Christie: Obama has made the racial divide in America worse", "url": "http://wqad.com/2015/11/12/christie-obama-has-made-the-racial-divide-in-america-worse/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/s053304816.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/s053304816.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2015-11-13T02:46:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T02:46:24+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "keywords": "politics,", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (CNN) \u2014 Chris Christie said Thursday that under President Barack Obama, America\u2019s racial divide has worsened.\nChristie, who changed his stance earlier this year, attributed his previous position on the issue to being a new governor.\nOn Wednesday, Christie said he had no interest in meeting with Black Lives Matter activists, blaming the group for the murder of police officers.\nThe protests at Mizzou led to the resignation of Missouri University System President Tim Wolfe.\nAnd that\u2019s what he should do and that\u2019s what every candidate is required to do.\u201d"}
