So far, just under $173,000 has been raised.\n\nOsamu Sassa, the project architect for the tower for Tokyo\u2019s Maki and Associates, which designed it, completed the climb and said the experience was a bit emotional. He lost both of his parents to cancer during the seven years he spent working on the building.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I guess poetic in a way that there is such an event for such a good cause, and it\u2019s in the intimate setting of a building I know very well,\u201d he said.\n\nOther climbers were also well-acquainted with the building, which has played host to cocktail parties, movie shoots and other fundraisers since its opening. Megan Lenz, a design engineer with Leslie E. Robertson Associates who has worked on the building for about three years, said that while she had climbed all the stairs before, she had never done them all at once.\n\nDavid Hill stretches before \u2018Runyon Up\u2019 a fundraiser for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation at 4 World Trade Center in New York on Thursday. Participants climbed to the 72nd or 54th floor. See more photos in our slideshow. Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cYou have memories on every floor, and it\u2019s kind of like a time-lapse going all the way up,\u201d she said. \u201cReally makes you proud to be a part of this project.\u201d\n\nOther participants knew more about climbing than the building itself.\n\nKen Myers, 45, whose friends call him Spider-man, climbed the stairs dressed in a Spider-man shirt and matching red shorts. \u201cIt\u2019s a nickname that stuck, and it\u2019s perfect for climbing buildings,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the fifth building Mr. Myers has climbed in New York City, and the 45th or 46th overall in a total of six states and three countries, he said. He lives just outside Philadelphia, where last weekend he completed a race at the Bell Atlantic Tower, climbing the building\u2019s 50 stories and 1,088 steps twice. Next week, he plans to head to Germany for the Mount Everest Stair Marathon, in which climbers attempt a 397-step outdoor staircase 100 times, or however much they can get through in 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no standard between step height or pitch, every building is a little bit different, every building you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re getting into til you get there,\u201d Mr. Myers said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\nRunner Sarah Anderson stretches after running in the race.

Keith Bedford for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSteve Wechsler of Manhattan, 26, who finished in just under 13 minutes, did the race with colleagues from Mount Sinai Hospital. The group of physical therapists called their team 72 Problems But Stairs Ain\u2019t One and hope to climb the stairs at the Empire State Building next.\n\n\u201cStairs, they come pretty easily to us,\u201d Mr. Wechsler said. \u201cSeventy-two flights, it ain\u2019t no problem.\u201d\n\nRocco Flores, 40, of Summit, N.J., who climbed the stairs with a team from his company, Vita Organic Foods, said the event had particular resonance for him because of 9/11.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ll keep in mind going to the top is how the firefighters, what they went through to get to the top of the stairs to help people through 9/11,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event\u2019s fastest climber, Tim Donahue of Manhattan, 44, reached the 72nd floor in just under nine minutes. A high school teacher, he told a group of reporters afterward that this is the only type of running he can do because it\u2019s gentler on the knees.\n\nHe said the hardest part of the event was getting to the building itself, riding his bicycle through crowds of people in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s striking how new this building is, it\u2019s like an unused baseball glove,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s missing the cigarette butts and gum stains.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Robert Alcaraz\n\nCorrections & amplifications: The climbers went up 71 flights during the event.
