The plane, a United Airlines flight from Brussels, may have contained some passengers from Liberia, including the man who was purportedly ill. The man may have been suffering from food poisoning for all we know, but health officials still didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s now being treated with protocols as if he has it but no clear indication at this point that he does,\u201d the official said of the sick passenger, who had been traveling with his daughter. He and his daughter were removed from the plane by CDC members in full protective gear and taken to University Hospital in Newark to be tested. The plane, which landed around noon, was required to keep passengers on board until about 2 p.m. They were then asked to move to a separate area of Customs.\n\nUnited released a statement about the event: \u201cUpon arrival at Newark Airport from Brussels, medical professionals instructed that customers and crew of United flight 988 remain on board until they could assist an ill customer. We are working with authorities and will accommodate our customers as quickly as we can.\u201d\n\nShortly after, health officials announced that the man was cleared of Ebola. While the CDC must remain vigilant during this volatile time, it\u2019s important to remember that not every vomiting person near you has Ebola.\n\nThe first Ebola patient to be diagnosed in the U.S. was confirmed earlier last week by CDC officials. The Liberian man, who had been visiting relatives in Dallas, began exhibiting symptoms of the virus days after landing on U.S. soil. This means he likely was not contagious during his flight. But the CDC and health officials in Texas have been working on creating a \u201ccontact web\u201d to ensure that anyone who was near the infected patient did not receive the virus themselves.\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, has reassured Americans that the chance of an outbreak here in the States is extremely low, even if a few more cases pop up. \u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019re stopping this in its tracks in the U.S.,\u201d Frieden told CBS. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident we can do that because of our strong health care and infection control, and our strong public health system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ebola, ebola in us, newark ebola", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A man travelling from Brussels, Belgium to Newark Airport in New Jersey was removed from a plane after exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, but was soon cleared after.", "title": "The Sick Passenger At Newark Airport Most Likely Doesn't Have Ebola", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nj-ebola-scare-cdc-removes-sick-passenger-newark-airport-says-infection-unlikely-306259", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/newark-airport.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man travelling from Brussels, Belgium to Newark Airport in New Jersey was removed from a plane after exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, but was soon cleared after.", "title": "The Sick Passenger At Newark Airport Most Likely Doesn't Have Ebola", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nj-ebola-scare-cdc-removes-sick-passenger-newark-airport-says-infection-unlikely-306259", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/newark-airport.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/newark-airport.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-04T16:54:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-04T16:54:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A man travelling from Brussels, Belgium to Newark Airport in New Jersey was removed from a plane after exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, but was soon cleared after."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac3d\"", "article_summary": "The first Ebola patient to be diagnosed in the U.S. was confirmed earlier last week by CDC officials.\nAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials, two passengers traveling to Newark Airport on Saturday \u2014 a man and his daughter \u2014 were removed after a potential Ebola scare.\nThe man was \u201cvomiting on flight but did not display most of the other [Ebola] symptoms,\u201d a CDC official said.\nThe man may have been suffering from food poisoning for all we know, but health officials still didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\nHe and his daughter were removed from the plane by CDC members in full protective gear and taken to University Hospital in Newark to be tested."}
