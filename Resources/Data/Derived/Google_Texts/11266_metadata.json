We are sharing recent and relevant information with our foreign allies and are consulting the aviation industry.\"\n\nJohnson spoke briefly about the new policy during an appearance this morning on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" when he told host David Gregory that there was no plan at present to implement the policy at U.S. airports.\n\n\"The screening we have right now domestically, from one domestic airport to the other, is pretty robust, as the American traveling public knows. In this instance, we felt that it was important to crank it up some at the last point of departure airports. And we'll continually evaluate the situation.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 TSA: No knives on planes, as agency reverses decision\n\n\u2022TSA OKs Air Canada for PreCheck expedited screening program", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@river','@starledger','aviation','september-11','transportation'", "title": "Uncharged electronics barred on U.S.-bound flights from some overseas airports", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Uncharged electronics barred on U.S.-bound flights from some overseas airports\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/uncharged_devises_barred_on_us-bound_flights_from_some_overseas_airports.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/06/tsacheckpoints-lfilejpg-c56ce97bb231634d.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13349229\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-07T01:09:38Z\", \"author\": \"Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"aviation\",\"september-11\",\"transportation\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/06/15357988-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The new policy intended to prevent the use of explosives disguised as cell phones, lap tops or other devices.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@stevestrunsky"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, July 07, 2014,  6:48 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/07/06/tsacheckpoints-lfilejpg-c56ce97bb231634d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sstrunsky\", \"author_nickname\": \"Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"8361321\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The new policy intended to prevent the use of explosives disguised as cell phones, lap tops or other devices.", "title": "Uncharged electronics barred on U.S.-bound flights from some overseas airports", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/uncharged_devises_barred_on_us-bound_flights_from_some_overseas_airports.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, July 06, 2014,  9:09 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The new policy intended to prevent the use of explosives disguised as cell phones, lap tops or other devices."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d0f\"", "article_summary": "\"I have directed TSA to implement enhanced security measures in the coming days at certain overseas airports with direct flights to the United States,\" the statement read.\nIn this instance, we felt that it was important to crank it up some at the last point of departure airports.\n\"We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible.\"\nRELATED COVERAGE\u2022 TSA: No knives on planes, as agency reverses decision\u2022TSA OKs Air Canada for PreCheck expedited screening program\n\"We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible."}
