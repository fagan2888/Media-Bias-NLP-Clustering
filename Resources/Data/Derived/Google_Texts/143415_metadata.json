Do ghosts exist? What is the meaning of life? Why are there two Twix bars in one wrapper?\n\nFinally, after years upon years of vexation, the Twix company has shared the details of its troubled past, shedding light on the question of candy bar bifurcation. About a year ago, Twix released the first in a series of television commercials that has begun to explain one of life\u2019s greatest mysteries.\n\nIt seems that almost immediately after Twix was unveiled, the company\u2019s two like-minded founders\u2014Seamus and Earl\u2014fell into an abyss of irreconcilable disagreement. Realizing that they could no longer continue on as co-workers, they decided to split the company in two.\n\nWhat emerged from the division were two rival companies alike in nearly every way, Left Twix and Right Twix.\n\nWhile obvious to the outside world, the overwhelming similarities between the two chocolatey corporations went unnoticed by the myopic executives of each respective \u201cside.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ad\u2019s narrator, \u201cEach factory took a vastly different approach. Left Twix flowed caramel on cookie, while Right Twix cascaded caramel on cookie. Left Twix bathed in chocolate, while Right Twix cloaked in chocolate.\u201d\n\nAnother similar ad focuses on the modern-day state of the rival factories. An ambitious young employee approaches the head of Right Twix. \u201cWe\u2019re in the Right Twix factory,\u201d he says, \u201cmaking cookie layered with caramel for the right side of the pack. And next door is the Left Twix factory, and they make cookie layered with caramel covered in chocolate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014cloaked in chocolate,\u201d interrupts the obtuse executive. \u201cTotally different process.\u201d After peering across the driveway through a telescope, observing an identical office in the Left Twix factory, he contemptuously concludes, \u201cI just don\u2019t like the way they carry themselves.\u201d\n\nThis is laughable, of course, because Left Twix and Right Twix \u201ccarry themselves\u201d the exact same way. Beyond mere rhetoric, they are indistinguishable.\n\nThe Left-Right Twix dichotomy bears a striking resemblance to the American political system. Like Seamus and Earl, Republicans and Democrats quarrel over superficial disparities, while enthusiastically\u2014albeit often unwittingly\u2014agreeing on all matters of substance.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans quibble about the structure and funding of education, but they unanimously agree that mandated, standardized instruction is the only way to go.\n\nDemocrats favor intervention in one far-off land, while Republicans favor it in another, but neither party flinches at the mention of sanctions, foreign aid, arms dealing, drone strikes, combat troops, or outright war.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans adhere to slightly different philosophies regarding how to manipulate the economy, yet from both sides there is an unequivocal disregard for the free market. Bailouts, taxes, subsidies, and regulations are bipartisan rallying cries. The only hint of disagreement concerns whether the nation should approach financial insolvency at Mach-2 or Mach-3.\n\nWhen it comes to money, the Left and the Right both march steadfastly to the beat of the Keynesian drum. The recipe for inflationary stew calls for equal parts donkey and elephant.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Medicare Part-D or Obamacare, healthcare nationalization counts on both sides of the aisle. Whether it\u2019s marijuana or raw milk, the war on \u201cillicit\u201d commerce gathers support from the GOP and the Dems alike. Whether it\u2019s sheet music or cell phone technology, \u201cintellectual property\u201d remains unquestioned by nearly everyone.\n\nAttempts to distinguish the indistinguishable are futile and distracting. Prattling about trivial differences invites vacuous dialogue, subdues critical thinking, precludes progress, and produces farcical demagoguery.\n\nFrom the Twix website, we learn of the length taken by each factory to maintain illusory separation:\n\n\u201cRight Twix Bars are packaged in the same location as that other Twix at The Twix Union Packaging Company, an equal opportunity packaging company. They package Right Twix between the hours of 12:00pm and 11:00pm. That other one is packaged between 12:00am and 11:00am. Between shifts, the equipment is reviewed and conveyor belts are replaced to avoid any unwanted cookie mingling.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, though, neither Twix manufacturer can deny that their respective candy bars do, in fact, snuggle closely with their supposed rivals.\n\nExcessive expenditures on avoidance and propaganda mirror the electoral rigmarole. Every four years, presidential candidates go to extraordinary lengths to convince the voting public that two inches is a mile.\n\nDemocrats flow from a river of absurdity, while Republicans cascade from a stream of futility. Democrats bathe in inefficacy, while Republicans are cloaked in uselessness. Despite these obvious, palpable, insurmountable differences, they both fit comfortably inside the same wrapper.\n\nAt the end of each Twix commercial, we are prompted to, \u201cTry both and pick a side.\u201d Of course, we could also choose to just not buy Twix.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is laughable, of course, because Left Twix and Right Twix \u201ccarry themselves\u201d the exact same way.
