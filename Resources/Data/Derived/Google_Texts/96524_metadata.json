The sixth-seeded Ravens (11-7) had won two of three playoff games in Foxborough over the past five seasons.\n\n\u201cWe came to their home field and fought them to the end and we just came up short,\u201d said Kamar Aiken, who caught one of Flacco\u2019s four touchdown passes.\n\nBrady completed 33 of 50 passes for 367 yards for an offense that picked up just 14 on the ground, the second fewest in team playoff history. His 46 career playoff touchdown passes surpassed Joe Montana\u2019s 45 for most in NFL history.\n\nFlacco was 28 for 45 for 292 yards and two interceptions. Justin Forsett gained 129 yards on 24 carries.\n\nForsett had an outstanding season replacing the Ray Rice, who was suspended and then released for domestic abuse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all faced with challenges in life,\u201d Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said, \u201cand, as a teacher and coach that\u2019s what you ask of your guys. I guess what I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m so proud of the way they handled it.\u201d\n\nIt was a thrilling game of shifting momentum \u2014 two touchdowns by the Ravens, the next two by the Patriots, two more by the Ravens and another two by the Patriots.\n\n\u201cWe had two separate 14-point leads. Those guys did a good job getting it back to seven as quickly as they could,\u201d said Flacco, who threw his first two interceptions in six playoff games. \u201cThey don\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\nFlacco completed his first eight passes, two for touchdowns of 19 yards to Aiken and 9 yards to Steve Smith, to give the Ravens a 14-0 lead. Then the Patriots tied it on a 4-yard run by Brady and his 15-yard pass to Danny Amendola late in the first half.\n\nThe Patriots were driving again \u2014 until Daryl Smith intercepted Brady, who immediately grasped both sides of his helmet and then bent over in frustration.\n\n\u201cIt was just a terrible play by me,\u201d he said.\n\nFlacco capitalized with an 11-yard scoring pass to Owen Daniels with 10 seconds left for a 21-14 halftime lead.\n\nAnd when New England punted on the first series of the third quarter, Baltimore added to its lead on Flacco\u2019s fourth scoring pass, a 16-yarder to Forsett, who was wide open in the flat and scored easily.\n\nThen fortunes turned again.\n\nBrady threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, and the Patriots got the ball back after a punt. This time, another strong arm lifted the Patriots into a tie.\n\nWith the ball at the New England 49, Brady threw behind the line of scrimmage to Edelman on the left side. The Kent State quarterback then lofted a deep pass to a wide-open Amendola after cornerback Rashaan Melvin came up toward Edelman.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had it in for 10 weeks, and the coaches finally got to call it,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cI had to loosen up the arm a little bit.\u201d\n\nAfter Justin Tucker\u2019s 25-yard field goal gave the Ravens a 31-28 lead five minutes into the fourth quarter, the Ravens nearly stopped the Patriots. Brady threw a 9-yard completion to Shane Vereen and officials ruled he fumbled and Baltimore recovered. The call was reversed when replays showed Vereen was down by contact.\n\nSeven plays later, LaFell scored.\n\nBaltimore had two more possessions. The first ended when Duron Harmon intercepted Flacco\u2019s deep pass in the end zone with 1:39 left. On the final series, Flacco\u2019s desperation pass into the end zone was knocked down as time expired.\n\n\u201cIt was a wild game,\u201d Patriots coach Bill Belichick said, \u201cbut I\u2019m just thankful our players hung in there and made the plays they needed to make.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brady's third touchdown pass gave New England its first lead with about five minutes remaining and the Patriots reached their fourth consecutive AFC championship game with a 35-31 win over visiting Baltimore on Saturday.", "Author": "Howard Ulman", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Brady\u2019s third touchdown pass gave New England its first lead with about five minutes remaining and the Patriots reached their fourth consecutive AFC championship game with a 35-31 win over visiting Baltimore on Saturday.", "title": "Tom Brady throws three touchdown passes as Patriots top Ravens", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/10/tom-brady-throws-three-touchdown-passes-patriots-t/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/885d5ed7c570e1016a0f6a706700232a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/885d5ed7c570e1016a0f6a706700232a.jpg", "title": "Tom Brady throws three touchdown passes as Patriots top Ravens", "description": "Brady's third touchdown pass gave New England its first lead with about five minutes remaining and the Patriots reached their fourth consecutive AFC championship game with a 35-31 win over visiting Ba", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, New England Patriots, Tom Brady, Baltimore, Joe Flacco"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1163\"", "article_summary": "His 46 career playoff touchdown passes surpassed Joe Montana\u2019s 45 for most in NFL history.\nBrady threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, and the Patriots got the ball back after a punt.\n\u201cIt took a lot of execution to overcome it.\u201dThanks to three touchdown passes by Brady and one by college quarterback turned receiver Julian Edelman, the resilient Patriots kept their season alive.\n\u201cIt was a wild game,\u201d Patriots coach Bill Belichick said, \u201cbut I\u2019m just thankful our players hung in there and made the plays they needed to make.\u201d\n\u201cWe came to their home field and fought them to the end and we just came up short,\u201d said Kamar Aiken, who caught one of Flacco\u2019s four touchdown passes."}
