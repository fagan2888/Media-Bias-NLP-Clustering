Thy legacy come so that we can take it to people here and elsewhere.\"\n\nThe delegate from the border state of T\u00e1chira kept on reading. \"Give us today your light to guide us every day. Lead us not into the temptation of capitalism, but deliver us from oligarchy.\"\n\nDelegates cheered Uribe loudly, especially when she shouted \"Viva Ch\u00e1vez!\" at the end of her speech. Maduro raised no objections.\n\nBut Uribe's actions have offended many Christians in the South American country, Catholics and Protestants alike.\n\nThey say the words of a prayer found in the books of Matthew and Luke in the Bible should not be changed for political propaganda or any other purposes.\n\nCarlos Caripa, head pastor at the Saint Jude Thaddeus Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church in Caracas, said the changed prayer was, at best, disrespectful.\n\n\"It's an expression of people who had a deep affection for Hugo Chavez, who was our president, and that's how they're showing that love and affection. But that's not a feeling shared by all of our people. They're changing a prayer that is highly important to us, a prayer that begins by saying that our father is God,\" Caripa said.\n\nThe Rev. Jos\u00e9 Pi\u00f1ero, vice president of the Evangelical Council of Venezuela, went further.\n\n\"From a Christian perspective, we consider changing the words of the Lord's Prayer sacrilegious, an act of idolatry and desecration and a trivialization of the sacred,\" Pi\u00f1ero said.\n\nHe said the evangelical leadership is deeply concerned about acts by loyal followers of Hugo Chavez who, Pi\u00f1ero said, are worshiping the late leader as if he were a divinity.\n\n\"There was a movement that fortunately failed that wanted to establish a church and name Hugo Chavez a bishop,\" Pi\u00f1ero said.\n\nThe cult of Hugo Chavez is not necessarily new. It started well before he died of cancer in March 2013. There is an altar to worship Ch\u00e1vez at Cuartel de la Monta\u00f1a, the military barracks in Caracas where Chavez is buried.\n\nDuring the campaign that led to his election as Chavez's successor in April 2013, Maduro famously said Ch\u00e1vez appeared to him in the form of a little bird.\n\nAn animated video published weeks after the president's death showed Ch\u00e1vez entering heaven and joining other deceased Latin American leaders, such as his revered independence hero, Sim\u00f3n Bolivar.\n\nThe changed prayer also offended some Chavistas, such as Carmenchi Chavez (no relation), an attorney who said people should give Caesar what is Caesar's and God what's God's, paraphrasing Jesus' words in Matthew 22:21.\n\n\"I'm Chavista,\" Ch\u00e1vez said, \"but I believe that you can't mix politics with other things. You can have your own political persuasion, but you need to respect the beliefs people have been raised with.\"\n\nOsmary Hernandez contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Rafael Romo, CNN (CNN) -- A member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and follower of Hugo Chavez is raising eyebrows for changing the words of the Lord's Prayer to honor the late president.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "In Venezuela, a 'sacrilegious' Lord's Prayer", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/03/in-venezuela-a-sacrilegious-take-on-the-lords-prayer/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140220173903-aman-hugo-chavez-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Rafael Romo, CNN\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- A member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and follower of Hugo Chavez is raising eyebrows for changing the words of the Lord's Prayer to honor the late president.", "title": "In Venezuela, a 'sacrilegious' Lord's Prayer"}, "keywords": "americas, christianity, church and state, venezuela, christianity, hugo chavez, lord's prayer, venezuela", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/03/in-venezuela-a-sacrilegious-take-on-the-lords-prayer/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Carlos Caripa, head pastor at the Saint Jude Thaddeus Chiquinquir\u00e1 Church in Caracas, said the changed prayer was, at best, disrespectful.\n\"There was a movement that fortunately failed that wanted to establish a church and name Hugo Chavez a bishop,\" Pi\u00f1ero said.\nThey're changing a prayer that is highly important to us, a prayer that begins by saying that our father is God,\" Caripa said.\nThe cult of Hugo Chavez is not necessarily new.\n\"From a Christian perspective, we consider changing the words of the Lord's Prayer sacrilegious, an act of idolatry and desecration and a trivialization of the sacred,\" Pi\u00f1ero said."}
