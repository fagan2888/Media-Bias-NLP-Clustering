Royals, Hill to D.C. press: Clean up

The Washington press corps may be due for a few lessons from “Miss Manners.”

On Thursday, the Senate Periodical Press Gallery sent out an email reminding reporters of the general rules of etiquette while covering Congress, such as not taking pictures in the wrong places, not walking backwards and not being so absorbed in a phone as to run into people.

Separately, there’s the issue of the impending visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate, on Dec. 7 and 8. Our much more refined brothers across the pond are apparently worried that the American press corps, with our pride of the haggard and ill-dressed journalists, won’t be appropriately attired when interacting with the royals. Buckingham Palace advises reporters covering the royals to adhere to a certain dress code, according to guidance posted on the palace website.

“Journalists wishing to cover Royal engagements, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad, should comply with the dress code on formal occasions out of respect for the guests of The Queen, or any other member of the Royal Family,” the palace press office requests. “Smart attire for men includes the wearing of a jacket and tie, and for women a trouser or skirt suit. Those wearing jeans or trainers will not be admitted and casually dressed members of the media will be turned away. This also applies to technicians.”

Time to get your act together, folks.
