Story highlights Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead" the GOP race is "wide open"

Bush pushed back on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's claim that it's between Rubio and himself.

Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) Jeb Bush, battling against low poll numbers in the last days before Tuesday's primary, attempted Wednesday to convince voters he's still worth supporting in what will likely be a tight New Hampshire race.

The former Florida governor told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead" the race is "wide open" -- pushing back on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's claim that it's between Rubio and himself.

Bush also took swipes at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, comparing the two first-term senators to then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.

"There's nothing in their past that suggests they can lead. They might be able to lead, but how do you know?" Bush told Tapper.
