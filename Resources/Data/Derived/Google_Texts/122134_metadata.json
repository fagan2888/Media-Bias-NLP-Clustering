If you want your tax return filed on time and avoid a penalty, pay attention to the collection schedule posted on the box.\n\nAccording to the Post Office, each box is marked with the latest pick up time that a postal worker swings by to empty the box.\n\nWhether the tax return is sent to the government by postal mail or e-filed, midnight Wednesday is the important time mark.\n\nProbably just as important to remember is that even if an extension is requested, taxpayers still have to send money to the government for their estimated tax payment. Remember the extension is the extension of time to file the paperwork, not of time to pay. Checks and credit cards are accepted.\n\nThe government offers some other reminders and suggestions:\n\n\u2022 Consider filing electronically instead of using paper tax forms. Information regarding e-filing is at www.IRS.gov along with other forms and information.\n\n\u2022 Put all required Social Security numbers on the return and your check.\n\n\u2022 Double check figures and numbers.\n\n\u2022 Attach all required schedules.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t forget to sign and date the return, and if you owe money, to write a check or use a credit card. Make sure all required signatures are included.\n\n\u2022 Checks for federal tax payments should be made out to United State Treasury, or for California tax, the Franchise Tax Board.\n\nFor California returns, check the website for the California Franchise Tax Board www.ftb.ca.gov which contains forms and information, or call the toll-free assistance line at 1-800-852-5711.\n\nThe IRS warns if you use a web site to help or file, make sure the web address includes the .gov suffix. Other Internet sites using .com, .net or .org are not official IRS or FTB sites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IRS has designated an assistance center in north Chico, at 1395 Ridgewood Drive, off East Lassen and Ceres avanues. Its hours are 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Services here include assistance with Affordable Care Act questions, forms, multilingual assistance, payment arrangements and noncash payments. Forms are also available at libraries.\n\nThe IRS warns of long waits at any tax information phone line.\n\nAnd just in case you\u2019re a lucky one with a refund due, you can check your refund\u2019s progress on either government website: www.irs.gov or www.ftb.ca.gov.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chico >> While some circle Christmas, anniversaries and kids\u2019 birthdays on the calendar, there aren\u2019t so many with April 15 circled in red.
