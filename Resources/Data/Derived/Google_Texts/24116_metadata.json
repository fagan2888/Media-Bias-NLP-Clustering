The storyline (Spoiler Alert!) actually has nothing to do with marijuana, though that particular weed does make a few appearances. Instead, the book takes the reader on a 31 year journey through the birth and trundling growth of a barely fictional branch of the United States Department of Agriculture \u2013 the Agency of Invasive Species (AIS) \u2013 and the lives of those invested in its perpetual growth, as well as those seeking its downfall.\n\nThat one sentence could imply for some that this is a government policy tome disguised as a novel, but that\u2019s far from the case. Geraghty brings his characters to life in a way which quickly draws the reader into their struggles, moments of success and many failures. The story is told in an almost mockumentary fashion, skipping back and forth across the timeline of the agency\u2019s history while carefully chronicling the national debt \u2013 as well as the metastasizing budget of the Weed Agency \u2013 in tandem with the storyline. At the center of the plot are two characters \u2013 one a cynical, career bureaucrat and the other a Reagan era cost cutting warrior \u2013 locked in a decades long battle.The details of this evolution are filled with so many alternating hilarious and maddening events that the reader eventually begins to wonder how the AIS isn\u2019t already a real agency. You may come to love or hate some of the players in this comic tragedy, but you\u2019ll welcome them into your life for a time.\n\nOne of the more original devices employed by the author which makes this novel work so well is the way that Geraghty weaves so many real life events and Washington power players into the story, seamlessly incorporating the Agency of Invasive Species into the real life history of our nation which we all recall. Without giving too much of the plot away, I will share the fact that I laughed loud and long when Al Gore made a brief appearance. On a related note, I do hope that someone puts a copy of this book into Newt Gingrich\u2019s hands, if only to see his reaction to how he is portrayed in the tale.\n\nGeraghty\u2019s writing is full of more quotable moments than could be put in one review, but there is a particular one I\u2019ll share just to convey the flavor of the work. They cynical head of the agency, speaking to his protege in a moment of brutal honesty, describes the level of effort required to work in such a government body.\n\n\u201cYou notice no one ever says, \u2018close enough for private sector work.\u2018\u201d\n\nThe Weed Agency is available for pre-order through Amazon and as of this writing is ranked at #11 in Books > Humor & Entertainment > Humor > Political. It will be available for general sale on June 3, 2014.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The Bureau Cats", "title": "Book review: The Weed Agency", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/18/book-review-the-weed-agency/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "books, bureaucracy, government workers, Washington,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-18T13:31:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-18T12:43:10+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf0d\"", "article_summary": "The story is told in an almost mockumentary fashion, skipping back and forth across the timeline of the agency\u2019s history while carefully chronicling the national debt \u2013 as well as the metastasizing budget of the Weed Agency \u2013 in tandem with the storyline.\n\u201cYou notice no one ever says, \u2018close enough for private sector work.\u2018\u201dThe Weed Agency is available for pre-order through Amazon and as of this writing is ranked at #11 in Books > Humor & Entertainment > Humor > Political.\nactually has nothing to do with marijuana, though that particular weed does make a few appearances.\nGeraghty brings his characters to life in a way which quickly draws the reader into their struggles, moments of success and many failures.\nBook review: The Weed Agencyposted at 9:31 am on May 18, 2014 by Jazz ShawJim Geraghty\u2019s first novel, The Weed Agency, is an engaging and enlightening romp through the halls of the nation\u2019s capitol which will deliver a fun read for everyone from policy wonks to those who have little to no interest in government affairs."}
