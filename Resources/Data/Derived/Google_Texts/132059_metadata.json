Nevertheless, its interior minister, from the pro-EU National Coalition party, agreed in July to take about 800 refugees from among those who had arrived in Greece and Italy.\n\nThe government is due to decide on Friday on how to respond to a new EU quota proposal.\n\nThe tax proposals may also be aimed to counter accusations that the poor and middle class have been hit worst by government policies. The government also announced that members of parliament would be required to take a week's unpaid holiday and all ministers would forgo a week's pay.\n\nEarlier this week it presented labor market reforms that included reductions in holidays, prompting a hostile reaction from trade unions who said it went against Finland's traditional consensus politics.\n\nFinland's economy is shrinking for a fourth year in a row due to weak demand from European and Russian markets and problems affecting its main export industries, including technology.\n\n(Editing by Robin Pomeroy)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's government on Thursday proposed increasing capital gain", "title": "Finland to raise taxes on the wealthy to cover refugee costs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/10/Finland-raise-taxes-wealthy-will-partly-cover-cost-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-france_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/10/Finland-raise-taxes-wealthy-will-partly-cover-cost-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-france_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's government on Thursday proposed increasing capital gain", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The government agreed before the summer that any EU plan to apportion asylum seekers among EU states should be voluntary.\n\"These will help to cover higher immigration costs which we estimate to be about 114 million euros this year,\" Stubb told a news conference.\nFinland last week doubled its estimate for the number of asylum seekers expected this year to up to 30,000, compared with just 3,600 last year.\nThe government is due to decide on Friday on how to respond to a new EU quota proposal.\nThe government also announced that members of parliament would be required to take a week's unpaid holiday and all ministers would forgo a week's pay."}
