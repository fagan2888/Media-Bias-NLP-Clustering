The industry has for years invested more in lobbying than any other.\n\nBut a series of criminal cases, multibillion-dollar fines and other scandals has diminished its reputation, and its prices \u2014 the last 10 cancer drugs approved before July 2015 have an average annual price of $190,217 \u2014 are again becoming a major political issue. Even with discounts and insurance coverage, a growing number of Americans find themselves choosing between their lives and lifetime savings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the wane. There\u2019s just too much obvious greed,\u201d said another veteran lobbyist for a major drug maker, citing Turing Pharmaceuticals\u2019 overnight price increase on a 62-year-old drug to $750 a tablet from $13.50. \u201cEverybody in the industry is talking about this.\u201d\n\nThe White House has begun building a political case for reining in drug costs, and the administration recently agreed in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord to intellectual property protections for advanced pharmaceuticals that was about half of what the industry demanded and United States law provides. Worse, a 2011 patent law has resulted in a wave of lawsuits funded by hedge funds against the industry\u2019s most valuable property \u2014 drug patents.\n\nIn years past, according to interviews with longtime industry lobbyists, such problems could have been fixed by a vigorous lobbying push. No more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe last time the industry\u2019s prices and other practices raised significant concerns in Washington, drug makers decided that the solution was to increase the share of patients who had health insurance so that more people had help buying drugs. So in 2009, the industry rallied around President Obama\u2019s push for the Affordable Care Act, striking an $80 billion deal with the administration that even led the industry to fund an advertising campaign supporting the law.\n\nFor decades, drug makers had overwhelmingly supported Republican lawmakers with campaign contributions. But the alliance with the Obama administration changed that, and Pfizer led the way. The company appointed Jeff Kindler, a lawyer and a longtime Democrat, as its chief executive in 2006, and Mr. Kindler became chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry\u2019s main lobbying arm, on the eve of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage in Congress in 2010.\n\nMr. Kindler for the first time in memory not only directed a majority of the company\u2019s political donations toward Democrats but also hired top Democrats to lead the company\u2019s lobbying efforts. His most important hire was plucking Ms. Susman from beauty brand Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies.\n\nTogether with her father, a lawyer and an investment banker, Ms. Susman had raised more than $1 million for Mr. Obama\u2019s election in 2008 just as she was being hired by Pfizer. Her father was so good at bundling money for Democratic politicians that he was nicknamed \u201cthe Vacuum Cleaner\u201d and \u201cthe Hoover.\u201d Mr. Obama rewarded Mr. Susman by appointing him ambassador to Britain, among the most coveted assignments in diplomacy. He resigned in 2013.\n\nWhen he became chief executive in 2010, Mr. Read asked Ms. Susman to improve the company\u2019s image, and Ms. Susman commissioned a series of studies \u201cto really research what it is the public holds and harbors against the industry so we can address it in a new and fresh way,\u201d Ms. Susman said in 2011. She declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here four years, and I definitely feel the tides shifting,\u201d Ms. Susman said in the same 2011 interview. She said she found the public\u2019s lack of excitement about the industry\u2019s scientific advancements frustrating.\n\nPfizer\u2019s greatest challenge in the past two decades has been its laboratories\u2019 lack of productivity. To continue growing, the company has been forced into a series of mergers with other drug giants, including Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia, Wyeth and now Dublin-based Allergan.\n\nIn her emailed statement, Ms. Susman, who is a resident of New York City and has a weekend house in Sag Harbor, N.Y., said that improving the company\u2019s research productivity was an important reason for the merger with Allergan, an argument the company has made after each of its major mergers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this combination of Pfizer and Allergan is to create a global R & D leader with an expanded ability to make investments in the U.S., find cures and treatments for conditions ranging from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease to cancer and rare genetic disorders,\u201d Ms. Susman wrote.\n\nThose arguments are losing traction in Washington, where rising drug costs are an important reason for increasing premiums under the Affordable Care Act, veteran industry lobbyists said.\n\n\u201cLawmakers are now telling us that they\u2019re being pounded at home by voters who can\u2019t afford our prices,\u201d said one of the industry\u2019s top lobbyists.\n\n\u201cThese people are angry. And it\u2019s not easy for people on the Hill to support us in that environment. And now with this Pfizer thing? I think we\u2019re going to have to start getting used to losing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151125200159, "twitter": {"description": "Escalating drug prices and now a major company\u2019s pending move overseas leads to concern about \u201ctoo much obvious greed\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry.", "title": "Pfizer\u2019s Plan to Leave U.S. Unsettles Drug Lobbyists", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/us/politics/drug-lobbyist-discomfort-over-pfizers-leaving-us.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004059492"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "gardinerharris", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/26/us/26lobby-web/26lobby-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/us/politics/drug-lobbyist-discomfort-over-pfizers-leaving-us.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004059492", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/us/politics/drug-lobbyist-discomfort-over-pfizers-leaving-us.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Pfizer\u2019s Plan to Leave U.S. Unsettles Drug Lobbyists", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 25, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Allergan Inc", "keywords": "Pfizer Inc,Allergan Inc,Relocation of Business,Corporate Taxes,Ireland,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Lobbying and Lobbyists,Susman  Sally (1961- ),Mergers  Acquisitions and Divestitures", "news_keywords": "Ireland", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Gardiner Harris", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Susman, Sally (1961- )", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By GARDINER HARRIS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Escalating drug prices and now a major company\u2019s pending move overseas leads to concern about \u201ctoo much obvious greed\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/26/us/26lobby-web/26lobby-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Escalating drug prices and now a major company\u2019s pending move overseas leads to concern about \u201ctoo much obvious greed\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 25, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/gardiner_harris/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-02-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "published": "2015-11-25", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Ireland", "slug": "26lobby", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160209040005, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/us/politics/drug-lobbyist-discomfort-over-pfizers-leaving-us.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/26/us/26lobby-web/26lobby-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Escalating drug prices and now a major company\u2019s pending move overseas leads to concern about \u201ctoo much obvious greed\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry.", "title": "Pfizer\u2019s Plan to Leave U.S. Unsettles Drug Lobbyists"}, "pdate": 20151125, "des": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "articleid": 100000004059492, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Pfizer\u2019s Plan to Leave U.S. Unsettles Drug Lobbyists", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/26/us/26lobby-web/26lobby-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve been here four years, and I definitely feel the tides shifting,\u201d Ms. Susman said in the same 2011 interview.\nHis most important hire was plucking Ms. Susman from beauty brand Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies.\nThe lobbyists asked for anonymity since criticizing Pfizer or the industry\u2019s present position in Washington could get them fired.\nIn years past, according to interviews with longtime industry lobbyists, such problems could have been fixed by a vigorous lobbying push.\nThose arguments are losing traction in Washington, where rising drug costs are an important reason for increasing premiums under the Affordable Care Act, veteran industry lobbyists said."}
