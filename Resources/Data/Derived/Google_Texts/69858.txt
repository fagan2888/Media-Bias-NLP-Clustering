Tuesday's grants nationally total $120 million

Ohio institutions have received 13 of these grants, $30.9 million.

Tuesday was large-dollar day for two Cincinnati medical researchers doing patient-centered studies of obese young people with bipolar disorder and juvenile arthritis.

The grants were part of the $120 million that the nonprofit Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute handed out Tuesday to 34 research projects around the country. The institute was created in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act. Its mandate is to fund research that focuses more closely on patients.

Dr. Melissa DelBello of the University of Cincinnati will get a $12.9 million award to assess whether overweight and obese youth with bipolar disorders would be helped with a regimen of healthy lifestyle interventions plus the diabetes drug metformin, as opposed to lifestyle interventions alone. DelBello is Dr. Stanley and Mickey Kaplan Professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at UC.

Bin Huang, Ph.D., of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center will get a $1.4 million award to develop methods to make it easier and more efficient for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, their families, and their clinicians to determine which treatment to use next if a first-line therapy does not produce the desired response.

With these new awards, Ohio institutions have received 13 research grants totaling nearly $30.9 million.
