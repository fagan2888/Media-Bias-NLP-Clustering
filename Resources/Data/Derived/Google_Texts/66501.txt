The Newseum has placed a sign at its memorial to fallen journalists for the two employees of the Roanoke, Virginia station WDBJ who were shot and killed on the job Wednesday.

The Newseum has a two-story glass memorial with the names of journalists killed reporting news around the world.

On Wednesday, a sign was constructed and placed in the atrium to pay tribute to Alison Parker and Adam Ward.

"We offer deepest sympathies to the WDBJ7 family on the loss of Allison Parker and Adam Ward. Rest in Peace," the Newseum tweeted.

Nearly 150 journalists have been killed since the the tribute began in 1837, but these most recent killings were unusual, according to chief operating officer of the Newseum Institute, Gene Policinski.

“It’s very rare for a reporter in the United States to be killed on the job," Policinski said. "It's an ever more dangerous environment for journalists. There are hundreds and thousands of people out there every day risking their lives to deliver the news, and tragically, some of them die in that process."

The memorial is rededicated every year, asking visitors to stand for journalists to be able to do their jobs without the fear of being killed.
