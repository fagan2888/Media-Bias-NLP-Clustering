At Elle, employees are free to express their personal style, which can range from sweats and colorful high-tops to custom-made Italian suits or even the occasional Yves Saint Laurent “Le Smoking” jacket. The magazine has nearly 90 (mostly female) employees who work in the Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan.

Joe Zee, creative director, straddles the extremes with no in between. “I will be the classic Joe in a suit, shirt, tie,” he said, or, “you’ll find me in my jeans, high-tops and hoodie–I will be sitting here like a skateboarder hip-hop dancer.”

The Dress Code: There is none, and on occasion, people do dress unprofessionally, said Robbie Myers, editor in chief. “When the interns show up in flip-flops with their cut-off shorts, I sometimes wonder if they think they’re still in college.”
