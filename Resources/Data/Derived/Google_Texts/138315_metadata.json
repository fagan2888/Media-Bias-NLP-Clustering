And he had dreams. And Jerrod squashed them,\u201d Jeana West, Generro Sanchez's mother, said.\n\nMurray was later found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to a mental health facility in Vinita.\n\nAnd 38 days later, Pottawatomie County District Attorney Richard Smothermon said a doctor claimed the alleged killer was no longer a danger to the public and Murray had the potential of being released.\n\n\u201cI mean you talk about ripping the scab off. And only 38 days after the court hearing,\u201d Smothermon told News 9. \u201cThat is why this law has got to change.\u201d\n\nSecond opinions kept Murray in custody, but this loophole in the law has sparked new legislation.\n\nSmothermon said the \"guilty but with mental defect\" option would be reserved for the untreatable, and a jury could send them straight to prison.\n\n\u201cThey are just wired differently than you or me. They\u2019re just mean and no amount of treatment will ever make them not a danger,\u201d he explained.\n\nWest said she will be do everything in her power to stop who she called \u201cthe other Jerrod Murrays of the world\u201d from committing murder and seemingly getting away with it.\n\nSenate Bill 1214 passed through the state Senate judiciary committee Tuesday, and now, it goes to a vote of the full Senate.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "In December 2012, 18-year-old Generro Sanchez was shot and killed in Pottawatomie County by a man who told police he did it because he wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone.", "author": "Christy Lewis", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31238703/state-senate-bill-proposes-guilty-but-with-mental-defect-option", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9842148_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In December 2012, 18-year-old Generro Sanchez was shot and killed in Pottawatomie County by a man who told police he did it because he wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone.", "title": "State Senate Bill Proposes 'Guilty But With Mental Defect' Option"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9842148_G.jpg", "description": "In December 2012, 18-year-old Generro Sanchez was shot and killed in Pottawatomie County by a man who told police he did it because he wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone.", "card": "summary", "title": "State Senate Bill Proposes 'Guilty But With Mental Defect' Option"}, "wnreadableurl": "state-senate-bill-proposes-guilty-but-with-mental-defect-option", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/02/16", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,murder, mental health, mental illness, Homicide, death", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,murder, mental health, mental illness, Homicide, death"}, "article_summary": "Senate Bill 1214 passed through the state Senate judiciary committee Tuesday, and now, it goes to a vote of the full Senate.\nAnd only 38 days after the court hearing,\u201d Smothermon told News 9.\nMurray was later found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to a mental health facility in Vinita.\nSmothermon said the \"guilty but with mental defect\" option would be reserved for the untreatable, and a jury could send them straight to prison.\nJerrod Murray, 21, said he knew of Sanchez because they both went to East Central University."}
