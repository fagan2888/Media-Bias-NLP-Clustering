At least until the end of the year, a special program guarantees that insured women who get a Liletta will pay no more than $75 out of pocket for it, Grossman said. A permanent patient assistance program will also provide Lilettas for free to women who qualify.\n\n\u2018Hey, I want an IUD and I want it now. I want it to be available to me today. I don\u2019t want to come back.\u2019\n\nAnd, behind the scenes but even more important, public health clinics can order the Liletta for a mere $50 each.\n\nIn Massachusetts, all six Planned Parenthood clinics have begun to stock the Liletta, and it\u2019s starting to enter \u201cformularies\u201d \u2014 the approved prescription lists \u2014 from major hospitals to cash-strapped community health clinics. Medicines360 reports shipping Liletta to 49 states, with more than half of the devices going to clinics that serve low-income patients.\n\nThe idea is to make the devices affordable enough that clinics can stock plenty, Grossman said, so that a woman can come in and say, \u201c\u2019Hey, I want an IUD and I want it now. I want it to be available to me today. I don\u2019t want to come back.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Anonymous Donor\n\nThe Liletta is the latest chapter in the story of the great resurgence of IUDs in the United States, featuring billionaire investor Warren Buffett in a key cameo.\n\nAfter the 1970s debacle of the Dalkon shield, which caused infections and even a few deaths, IUDs fell almost completely out of use among American women. Then, in 2001, a new, hormone-emitting device came on the market \u2014 the Mirena.\n\nIUDs steadily gained popularity as a relatively safe, set-and-forget, long-acting but reversible option for many women. (As a no-complaints Mirena user for a decade, I\u2019m one of them.)\n\nMore than 10 percent of American women who use birth control now choose IUDs, the most recent data show \u2014 the Mirena or the Skyla, which emit tiny amounts of hormones, or a simpler copper IUD, the Paragard.\n\nThe latest evidence of the IUD\u2019s full rehabilitation: New York City\u2019s Health Department this week launched its \u201cMaybe the IUD\u201d campaign to encourage New York women to consider an IUD.\n\nThe campaign talks about \u201creproductive justice,\u201d reflecting in part a troubling trend: Unintended pregnancy is increasingly a poor woman\u2019s problem. Look at the trend in the Guttmacher chart below:\n\nThe numbers shout that poor women need more effective birth control. IUDs are over 99 percent effective and they last years. But they\u2019re expensive.\n\n\u201c[So] people basically got together to say, \u2018We need this option to be available to all women, not just those with resources or who have insurance,\u2019 \u201d said Guttmacher Institute senior research scientist Megan Kavanaugh. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the main drivers for getting the Liletta out there \u2014 to increase access for all women.\u201d\n\nYes, under Obamacare, IUDs should be free to women with insurance, but that leaves many women out, says Dr. Alisa Goldberg, director of family planning at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and director of clinical research and training at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.\n\nThey may lack insurance, she said, or be undocumented immigrants, or need to pay out of pocket for birth control for privacy reasons. The Liletta could help \u201cwomen who are currently falling through a variety of cracks,\u201d she said.\n\nThanks to epic reporting by Karen Weise at Bloomberg Businessweek, we now know that those family planners who got together to create a low-cost IUD had the financial backing of the billionaire Buffett\u2019s family foundation. (Don\u2019t miss her recent piece: \u201cWarren Buffett\u2019s Family Secretly Funded A Birth Control Revolution.\u201d)\n\nOver $70 million in seed funding for the Liletta came from an anonymous donor, Weise writes; she followed a trail of \u201ctax filings, medical journal disclosures, and an archived interview with a foundation official\u201d to Buffett\u2019s family foundation, the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett\u2019s late first wife.\n\nIn 2009, Medicines360 came into being \u201cwith the sole purpose of developing a low-cost, hormonal IUD,\u201d said Grossman, its new CEO. \u201cThat is our mission.\u201d\n\nMedicines360 licensed a European IUD very similar to the Mirena, Grossman said, and, with that money from a \u201csingle philanthropic donor\u201d (she absolutely refused to name the donor but that\u2019s OK because we know who it is), took it through the biggest American clinical trial yet for a hormonal IUD.\n\nWhen the FDA approved the Liletta this February, results from that trial backed its use by a broad swath of women, including those who\u2019d never had children, who were as young as 16, who were thin all the way up to very obese with a Body Mass Index of 50.\n\nMedicines360 does not actually make or sell the Liletta; it has a commercial partner, Allergan, that does all that.\n\nAllergan sets the commercial prices when a woman gets a Liletta through private insurance (Reiches says her plan was billed $1,400). But the deal is that all public health or \u201csafety net\u201d clinics get the Liletta wholesale for just $50.\n\n\u201cIf clinics can\u2019t afford to stock it, then they can\u2019t offer it to their patients,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in, that\u2019s our goal.\u201d\n\nDr. Goldberg, who is on Medicine360\u2018s scientific advisory board, attests to the importance of that low $50 price. Clinics often can\u2019t afford to stock many IUDs when they cost hundreds of dollars wholesale, she said. If a patient comes in and is told there\u2019s no device immediately available, she may well not come back \u2014 or come back too late, already pregnant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe patient came in for an IUD, couldn\u2019t get it, got rescheduled for a later appointment \u2014 and it\u2019s just a little too late.\u201d\n\nRachel Preiss, a nurse practitioner and clinical manager at the Dimock Center, a community health center in Boston, says that when IUDs run out, \u201cWe\u2019re all aghast.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the studies show that if you can do it right now, women are more likely to be happy with it, they\u2019re more likely to continue with it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Liletta is not yet offered at the Dimock Center, but Preiss has signed up for Liletta training in November, she said, and is already calculating that its low price could quintuple the IUD stocks on the shelves.\n\nIUD Nation?\n\nSo how far can the reborn IUD go? And will it make a difference?\n\nJust over half of American pregnancies are unintended. A striking recent drop in teen pregnancies in Colorado, where that anonymous donor funded a free-IUD program, seems to suggest that the Liletta might help cut that rate. Teen abortions dropped by more than a third over a three-year period in the counties served by the program, and teen pregnancies by 40 percent statewide, according to the governor.\n\nStudies have yet to be done at the national level, said Kavanaugh of the Guttmacher Institute, but it follows: If you move people to more effective contraception, you\u2019re going to have lower rates of unintended pregnancies.\n\nAs for IUD rates, in other developed countries, the percentage of women who choose them tends to hover in the teens or 20s, Kavanaugh said. Norway is at 23 percent, France at 19. (Then there\u2019s North Korea at 62 percent and China at 40 percent \u2014 different category.)\n\nThe Choice Project, a landmark St. Louis study also reportedly funded by You Know Who, found that when all cost barriers were removed, most women opted for the most effective, long-acting methods: 56 percent for IUDs and 11 percent for implants.\n\nBut that study had some special conditions, among them that the counselors used a special script that especially highlighted advantages of IUDs and implants, Kavanaugh said.\n\nSo it\u2019s not clear what the American IUD rate will be \u2014 or what it should be.\n\nIt\u2019s tricky territory, the intersection between fertility and class. There\u2019s been some tension in the family planning field about how to talk about promoting long-acting methods to different groups of women, Kavanaugh said, with high sensitivity to possible \u201cundertones of coercion.\u201d\n\nPreise reports in Bloomberg Businessweek:\n\nThis March, a state legislator in Arkansas proposed a bill that would pay unwed, low-income mothers on Medicaid $2,500 to get an IUD. That echoes a not-so-distant controversy over the Norplant hormonal implant. After it hit the market in 1991, legislators in more than a dozen states introduced bills that would have pushed women into getting the implant as a condition of welfare, in lieu of jail time, or in exchange for cash.\u201d\n\nIssues of class and coercion aside, any family planning specialist will tell you that choosing a method is a highly individual issue, with no one-size-fits-all best method.\n\nPreiss, of the Dimock Center, says that when she\u2019s counseling women on contraception \u2014 one of her favorite parts of her job \u2014 and she brings up IUDs, \u201cI don\u2019t get a ton of takers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get a ton of takers [for IUDs].\u201d \u2013 Nurse practitioner Rachel Preiss\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finding right now we have a lot of people who prefer Depo-Provera, we have a lot more people using [the implant] Nexplanon right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do have some IUD users and I don\u2019t really know what it is that would help increase those rates, because the studies show that when people do choose an IUD, they use it for longer and they\u2019re more happy with it.\u201d\n\nLiletta\u2019s sales may also be slowed by its initial time limit of just three years, though the limit is expected to be extended to five years or longer after further study.\n\nWhen Reiches was considering her Liletta, she heard a lot of IUD \u201chorror stories,\u201d she said, of pain and problems, even from family planning enthusiasts.\n\n\u2018I felt like I was taking a risk,\u201d she said. But in the weeks she\u2019s had the Liletta, \u201cI\u2018ve had a really positive experience so far.\u201d\n\nShe would \u201chesitate to recommend anything to anyone, because it really is a personal choice,\u201d but of one thing she is sure: \u201cEducation and access need to be available for everybody.\u201d\n\nReaders, IUD thoughts or experiences?\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a cheap new IUD on the block: the Liletta.
