How grand.\n\nMike Krzyzewski earned his 1,000th career win Sunday, making him the first NCAA Division I men\u2019s coach to reach the milestone, when No. 5 Duke surged past St. John\u2019s in the second half for a 77-68 victory at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTyus Jones scored 22 points and the Blue Devils went on an 18-2 run down the stretch to put Krzyzewski in four figures on his first try.\n\nJahlil Okafor had 17 points and 10 rebounds, combining with Jones and Quinn Cook, who also had 17 points, to fuel the decisive spurt after Duke trailed by 10 with 8:15 remaining.\n\nThat\u2019s when the Blue Devils (17-2, 4-2 ACC) finally began to look like a Krzyzewski-coached team, picking up their defense and hustling to loose balls as he urged them on from one knee in front of the bench. Duke outworked the Red Storm on the glass and held them without a field goal for nearly six pivotal minutes.\n\nWhen the final horn sounded, Duke players engulfed Krzyzewski, and he received a bear hug from assistant Jeff Capel. Players were given T-shirts that read \u201c1,000 Wins And Kounting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were so gritty in the last 10 minutes,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cIt was tough to get involved with 1,000. I was just trying to survive this game, which is how you get to 1,000.\u201d\n\nA public address announcement offered congratulations to Krzyzewski from St. John\u2019s, and Duke fans at a packed Garden chanted his name and held aloft \u201cK\u201d signs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in it right now. I wasn\u2019t in it until now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, to see the happiness of my players makes it good. We have to keep it in perspective. It makes us 17-2 and we\u2019ve got to go to Notre Dame on Wednesday, but for this moment, for basketball, for the game and for this program, we\u2019ll enjoy this one right now.\u201d\n\nSir\u2019Dominic Pointer had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Red Storm (13-6, 2-4 Big East), who were looking for a huge win to put on their NCAA tournament resume. They were in position to get it, but got worn down late by Duke and let this one slip away.\n\nNo. 1,000 came about 500 miles from the cramped and cozy confines of Cameron Indoor Stadium, but Krzyzewski was hardly on unfamiliar soil.\n\nAfter all, Madison Square Garden was where he notched victory No. 903 against Michigan State in November 2011, breaking the Division I record previously held by his college coach and mentor, Bob Knight.\n\nThe 67-year-old Krzyzewski improved to 1,000-308 in a 40-year coaching career that began in 1975 at his alma mater, Army. He is 927-249 in 35 seasons at Duke, guiding the Blue Devils to four NCAA titles and 11 trips to the Final Four.\n\nThe lively crowd of 19,812, mixed with fans of both schools, included about 15 to 20 former Duke players. Carmelo Anthony and Phil Jackson from the New York Knicks, St. John\u2019s greats Chris Mullin, Lou Carnesecca and Felipe Lopez, and Nike boss Phil Knight were also in attendance.\n\nAround 30 minutes before the opening tip, rising ticket prices ranged from $225 to $888 on secondary ticket markets \u2014 and they also covered admission to the Iona/Niagara doubleheader finale.\n\nBy midway through an entertaining first half, Krzyzewski was on his feet as St. John\u2019s erased an 11-point deficit.\n\nWearing a blue suit and white sneakers to support Coaches vs. Cancer, Krzyzewski stalked after the officials at the end of the half to argue that D\u2019Angelo Harrison\u2019s buzzer-beating 3-pointer came after the shot clock expired.\n\nKrzyzewski didn\u2019t get the call, and the Red Storm went into the locker room leading 43-39.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A second-half rally helped the Blue Devils win at Madison Square Garden and gave Krzyzewski his 1,000th career victory, the most of any Division I coach, on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A second-half rally helped the Blue Devils win at Madison Square Garden and gave Krzyzewski his 1,000th career victory, the most of any Division I coach, on Sunday.", "title": "Mike Krzyzewski earns 1,000th victory as No. 5 Duke defeats St. John\u2019s", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/25/mike-krzyzewski-earns-1000th-victory-no-5-duke-def/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/25/2671815e0a2c43046c0f6a7067001433.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/25/2671815e0a2c43046c0f6a7067001433.jpg", "description": "A second-half rally helped the Blue Devils win at Madison Square Garden and gave Krzyzewski his 1,000th career victory, the most of any Division I coach, on Sunday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mike Krzyzewski earns 1,000th victory as No. 5 Duke defeats St. John"}, "Author": "Mike Fitzpatrick", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Mike Krzyzewski, Madison Square Garden"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2fda\"", "article_summary": "5 Duke surged past St. John\u2019s in the second half for a 77-68 victory at Madison Square Garden.\nBy midway through an entertaining first half, Krzyzewski was on his feet as St. John\u2019s erased an 11-point deficit.\nWhen the final horn sounded, Duke players engulfed Krzyzewski, and he received a bear hug from assistant Jeff Capel.\nThe lively crowd of 19,812, mixed with fans of both schools, included about 15 to 20 former Duke players.\nDuke outworked the Red Storm on the glass and held them without a field goal for nearly six pivotal minutes."}
