Vavatsikos was told Vincenzo would need medical glue to seal the cut. Since it was Canada Day, however, there was only one doctor on duty in the clinic, so an office assistant, a part-time employee with no medical training, was tasked with gluing the child\u2019s eye.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s only on-duty doctor, Jean Therrien, was in charge of the \"crucial medical act of holding the boy in place,\" Dr. Marie-Andree LeBlanc, one of the clinic\u2019s owners, told CBC. Unfortunately, the receptionist missed the laceration and proceeded to glue the child\u2019s eye shut.\n\n\u201cMy son was yelling, 'Mommy, mommy.' He couldn't open his eye and also the doctor looked like he was panicking,\u201d Vavatsikos told CBC. \u201cHe was trying to open my son's eye with water and his fingers. He was even swearing at that point. I've never met any doctors that swear. At that point, I knew something was really wrong.\u201d\n\nEventually, Therrien told Vavatsikos that she needed to take Vincenzo to the hospital, where an ophthalmologist was able to open the child\u2019s eye. However, according to Vavatsikos, an attending nurse questioned how the incident was allowed to occur, since normally doctors don\u2019t use glue on sensitive areas such as the eye. Even in the rare cases where glue is used to seal eye lacerations, the procedure must only be done by a doctor or a specialist.\n\nDr. Saideh Khadir, a spokesperson for the Quebec arm of the Canadian Doctors for Medicare, explained to CBC that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that a receptionist was asked to perform the medical procedure, but cited cost cuts as a potential reason for the clinic\u2019s short staff.\n\nNewser reported that the clinic did refund Vavatsikos her $150 payment, but the mother also wants a guarantee such a mistake will not be repeated.\n\n\"I don't want any other kid, adult, baby to go through that \u2014 to go through what my son went through. He was absolutely traumatized,\" Vavatsikos told CBC. \"I think the doctor needs to know what he did wasn't right. He might as well have asked me to put glue on my son's eye.\"\n\nAlthough your eye may be the last place you\u2019d want to put glue anywhere near, individuals accidentally gluing their eyes shut is unfortunately becoming more common due to the increasing popularity of false eyelashes. Thankfully, the problem is usually easily remedied, although it may cost you both your eye lashes and your pride.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "eye laceration, ophthalmology", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 3-year-old in Canada was admitted to the hospital after his eye was accidentally glued shut.", "title": "Untrained Receptionist Glues Toddler's Eye Closed In Medical Procedure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eyes-wide-shut-untrained-part-time-receptionist-accidentally-glues-3-year-olds-eyes-351546", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/08/brown-eye.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 3-year-old in Canada was admitted to the hospital after his eye was accidentally glued shut.", "title": "Untrained Receptionist Glues Toddler's Eye Closed In Medical Procedure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eyes-wide-shut-untrained-part-time-receptionist-accidentally-glues-3-year-olds-eyes-351546", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/08/brown-eye.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/08/brown-eye.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-09-08T16:13:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-08T16:13:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 3-year-old in Canada was admitted to the hospital after his eye was accidentally glued shut."}, "article_summary": "Vavatsikos was told Vincenzo would need medical glue to seal the cut.\nHe was absolutely traumatized,\" Vavatsikos told CBC.\nHe couldn't open his eye and also the doctor looked like he was panicking,\u201d Vavatsikos told CBC.\nOn July 1, Julia Vavatsikos took her 3-year-old son, Vincenzo, to Clinique M\u00e9dicale Priv\u00e9e Jean-Pierre Savaria et Associes to check out a minor cat scratch on the boy\u2019s eyelid.\nanthony kelly CC BY 2.0An understaffed clinic in Quebec is in hot water after a staff member allowed an untrained, part-time receptionist to perform a medical procedure that resulted in a 3-year-old's eye being glued shut."}
