In addition, Lawson plans to feature pastors from near and far who will contribute to the broadcast.\n\nHe's working alongside his friend Donny Hinkle, pastor at Harvest Baptist Church in Maryland. Hinkle will manage the two radio station offices, one expected to be housed in Uniontown and one in Maryland.\n\n\u201cIt'll be based in the Uniontown area, but I know this is something that will reach around the world,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201c(We're) told to go and preach the gospel \u2014 that's our mandate. I believe that God has called us to touch the world.\u201d\n\nUpReach Radio will be entirely online, accessible from any Internet-connected device such as an iPhone or computer.\n\n\u201cThe reason we're doing this is because we're trying to go ahead of technology,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWhy not take your radio with you? Why not take ministry with you? ... We're literally able to take the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the world and never leave our office.\u201d\n\nUpReach is intended to offer ministry to people at all hours \u2014 \u201cfor us to be there when they need us,\u201d Lawson said.\n\nIn the future, Hinkle said he'd like to broadcast live on Sundays from local church services.\n\nUpReach pledge drives in November raised about $10,000 for equipment, which is expected to cost $25,000, Lawson said. In one night alone, the drive drew 58,000 viewers.\n\nThe pastors will host more pledge drives in 2014, he said, with a total goal of $200,000 to equip the station with enough money to fund its first year of operation.\n\nFresh Fire member Michele Ready, who serves as a pastor in the pastoral care department, said she assisted with the pledge drive. To her, UpReach is \u201cthe future of Christian broadcasting,\u201d especially considering that many newer cars are already equipped to stream Internet radio, she said.\n\n\u201cI'm just really excited about UpReach,\u201d Ready said. \u201cI think it's on the forefront of what Christian radio's going to be in the future.\u201d\n\nWith the 2-year-old Fresh Fire church, Lawson broadcasts \u201cFire Moment,\u201d an Internet program broadcast on weekdays. It began as a way for Lawson to encourage his congregation during the week, but it quickly spread on the Internet to 24 nations.\n\n\u201cIt started with our congregation sharing the message on Facebook, Twitter and then it took off. By social media alone, it caught. And people like the presentation,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cNow it's more than just a webcam. We have a whole media team. It's a big production now. It's amazing what God has done.\u201d\n\nLawson said UpReach is separate from Fresh Fire church and Fire Moment, and Fire Moment will continue.\n\nRossilynne Skena Culgan is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
