Ted Cruz, the first Latino to serve as a U.S. senator from Texas, says he did not scare a little girl with the news that the whole world was on fire.

Cruz was delivering his typical inflammatory anti-Obamacare speech in New Hampshire on Sunday when he said that due to "the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire."

That’s when an adorably shocked 3-year-old girl cried out in the front row, "The world is on fire?"

As reported by CNN, the anti-Net-Neutrality senator went on to try to placate the kid while sticking to his script by saying, "The world is on fire -- yes! Your world is on fire."

Everyone laughed and Cruz added, "But you know what? Your mommy's here and everyone's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better."

The media jumped all over the incident, which quickly became a headline grabber as well as a late-night talk show joke.

Cruz explained to Michelle Trant on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that everything had been blown out of proportion.

“First it was ‘girl startled,’ then it became ‘girl terrified.’ By the end of it, I’m Freddy Krueger torturing this girl in her nightmares,” Cruz said.

The senator said he spoke to the mother of the little girl who asked him if the world was really aflame.

“I actually talked to the mother yesterday, called her, because she was very dismayed,” Cruz said.

Michelle Trant and her 3-year-old daughter Julie appeared on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday to share their side of the story.

Of her daughter's sense of what was actually taking place, Trant said, as reported in Politico, that the little girl thought Cruz was a firefighter.

“She really did, she looked at him like he was a hero … that he was going to save her,” said Trant.
