Actually two great services.\n\nFirst, he clarified what should be an obvious point \u2014 that when you bomb a country, you increase the likelihood that further military action will follow. Then, by so doing, he invited war supporters and other elites to align themselves with the cause of hiding the consequences of military action from the public.\n\nThe trap was so subtle, and so unintentionally set, that a day later it\u2019s unclear whether anyone who fell into it realizes what happened.\n\nSo here\u2019s what happened.\n\nEarly in his Tuesday testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry engaged in a bit of improvisational contingency planning that in hindsight he probably wishes he\u2019d withheld.\n\n\u201cIt would be preferable not to \u2014 not because there\u2019s any intention, or any plan, or any desire whatsoever to have boots on the ground. I think the president will give every assurance in the world,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cBut in the event Syria imploded, for instance, or in the event there was a threat of a chemical weapons cache falling into the hands of al-Nusra or someone else and it was clearly in the interest of our allies \u2014 all of us, the British, the French, and others, I don\u2019t want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to the president of the United States to secure our country.\u201d\n\nIt quickly dawned on him that he\u2019d heaved the cat clear across the room and left himself awkwardly holding the bag. With the help of senators on the other side of the dais he did his best to shove it back in \u2014 \u201cAll I did was raise a hypothetical question about some possibilities and I\u2019m thinking out loud about how to protect American\u2019s interests,\u201d Kerry said in response to a prompt from Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn, who\u2019s favorably disposed to an attack \u2014 but it was too late.\n\nThat\u2019s in the nature of \u201cgaffes\u201d as properly understood \u2014 moments of unintended candor \u2014 rather than the \u201cbinders full of missiles\u201d sense of the term. They\u2019re really hard to revise and extend.\n\nBut those who support attacking Syria, or generally don\u2019t have substantive views about anything, blurred the distinction, and turned Kerry\u2019s remarks into a misstep in the horserace to war.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're now criticizing John Kerry for being \"too candid\" about the war.
