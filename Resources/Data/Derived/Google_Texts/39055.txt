Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, promised in a press conference that the GOP will think of an alternative to the Affordable Care Act.

"Our job is to show the American people we have better solutions, and we're working to build a consensus to do that. And when we have something to talk about, we'll show you," said Boehner in response to a reporter's question about the GOP replacement for the president's health legislation.

Now that people are signed up, Boehner says people won't be upset when they see the plan the Republicans do form to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- they will welcome it. He didn't say when such a plan may be formed or any details about what it would include, but says people will like it because it will protect them and, "not harm them as the president's bill is doing."

The GOP has faced criticism over their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while providing no alternative policy. They have also been slammed by Democrats for launching efforts to repeal the healthcare law dozens of times.
