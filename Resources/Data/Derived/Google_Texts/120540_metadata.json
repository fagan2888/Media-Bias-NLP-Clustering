Those episodes came on the heels of an incident in 2012 in which agents performing advance work for the president\u2019s trip to Colombia were caught with prostitutes in their hotel rooms.\n\nWhile serving as interim director, Mr. Clancy had already embarked on a shake-up of the agency\u2019s top officials, reassigning at least four others to posts elsewhere in government. He is a former agent-in-charge of the president\u2019s personal protection detail as well.\n\nAn independent review panel concluded earlier this year that agency was too \u201cinsular\u201d and \u201cstarving for leadership,\u201d and recommended an outsider for the agency\u2019s next director.\n\n\u201cOnly a director from outside the service, removed from organizational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require,\u201d the panel\u2019s report said.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said he and Mr. Obama considered several candidates, \u201cincluding those who had never been with the Secret Service.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, Joe Clancy struck the right balance of familiarity with the Secret Service and its missions, respect from within the workforce, and a demonstrated determination to make hard choices and foster needed change,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI am confident Joe will continue this management approach.\u201d\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman, called the choice of Mr. Clancy \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe [review] panel made it crystal clear that only a director from outside the agency would meet the needs of the agency today \u2014 someone with a fresh perspective, free from allegiances and without ties to what has consistently been described as a \u2018good old boys network,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said. \u201cThe good men and women of the Secret Service are screaming for a fresh start. At this moment in time, the Secret Service would best be served by a transformative and dynamic leader from outside the agency.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, said Mr. Clancy has already demonstrated \u201cdecisive leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with him closely over the next year to ensure that the Secret Service gets what it needs to fulfill its critical mission,\u201d Mr. Cummings said.\n\nMr. Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the agency, also served in the protective detail for President Bill Clinton. He left the Secret Service in 2011 to become the head of corporate security at Comcast, then returned when Mr. Obama summoned him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama Wednesday tapped the acting director of the Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, to lead the embattled agency on a permanent basis, ignoring calls for an outsider to take over.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama Wednesday tapped the acting director of the Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, to lead the embattled agency on a permanent basis, ignoring calls for an outsider to take over.", "title": "Obama picks Joe Clancy as Secret Service director", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/18/obama-picks-joe-clancy-secret-service-director/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/b2b3edbd45823e026b0f6a706700f735.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/b2b3edbd45823e026b0f6a706700f735.jpg", "description": "President Obama Wednesday tapped the acting director of the Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, to lead the embattled agency on a permanent basis, ignoring calls for an outsider to take over.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama picks Joe Clancy as Secret Service director"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Joseph Clancy, Secret Service"}, "article_summary": "While serving as interim director, Mr. Clancy had already embarked on a shake-up of the agency\u2019s top officials, reassigning at least four others to posts elsewhere in government.\n\u201cThe good men and women of the Secret Service are screaming for a fresh start.\nHe left the Secret Service in 2011 to become the head of corporate security at Comcast, then returned when Mr. Obama summoned him.\nPresident Obama on Wednesday tapped the acting director of the Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, to lead the embattled agency on a permanent basis, ignoring calls for an outsider to take over.\nMr. Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the agency, also served in the protective detail for President Bill Clinton."}
