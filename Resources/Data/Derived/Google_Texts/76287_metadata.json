More recently, there\u2019s been an abundance of coverage of testimony to the legislature about HIX problems by Joshua Sharfstein, M.D., who is the head of Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) as well as the chair of the exchange\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nSharfstein\u2019s testimony brings much-needed openness and welcome transparency to MHBE\u2019s problems, which seem to have surfaced inside the organization about January 2013, not long after $157 million of federal money came into state coffers.\n\nSilent board minutes, some not posted\n\nThe media blitzkrieg draws attention to Maryland state law establishing the need for openness and transparency in MHBE\u2019s activity. The law specifically calls for openness \u201c\u2026so the public can understand\u2026 [MHBE\u2019s operations.]\u201d\n\nPolitics continues to cause Maryland officials from being forthright about MHBE\u2019s difficulties. Even its board minutes are silent about problems.\n\nFour of the last five meetings have been \u201c...open to the public for the purpose of voting on a motion to close the session.\u201d Four sets of earlier meeting minutes dating from 2013 are awaiting approval and remain unpublished. And all meeting materials (particularly exchange managers\u2019 updates) posted since August 2013 have no content about exchange problems. The board seems to have lawyered up by keeping its board discussions vague or inaccessible to the public.\n\nWhere would we be if not for media coverage and the legislature demanding answers via a newly formed joint committee?\n\nGuarded testimony\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of culpability for MHBE\u2019s problems -- even the federal government can be blamed and many argue that Congress deserves most of it.\n\nSharfstein, however, casts apparently well-founded blame on contractors, particularly Noridian Administrative Services Inc. and its subcontractor, C\u00faram/IBM. Notably, Sharfstein\u2019s written testimony does not acknowledge any culpability by MHBE, even while he apologizes in general to state residents.\n\nAny objective look back at MHBE\u2019s formative period would show several important realities bearing on the monumental risks the state had embraced with implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s leader, Rebecca Pearce, was tasked to build an organization and build a website.\n\nOn the first track, she had to hire and train 70 highly specialized employees in a tight employment market for these kinds of workers, while managing the duties arrayed on this chart. On the second track, she had to procure and manage 15 to 20 contracts including those to oversee and build, in record time, the most complex information system in the state\u2019s history.\n\nThese challenges appear excessive and unreasonable for one leader to overcome in time, a condition her bosses might have seen but could not fix before she resigned. Something had to give, yet there was no room for slippage on the schedule caused by any problem.\n\nThe exchange simply was not prepared. Sharfstein\u2019s testimony, however puts all the blame on contractors without admitting any culpability by the exchange or higher state officials, including himself.\n\nIf he would sidestep his well-placed concern for politics, state residents likely would understand how honest -- albeit major -- errors by exchange personnel could happen. People appreciate candor, and Sharfstein should come clean.\n\nManagement shortcomings include hasty procurements\n\nMedia reports include several MHBE management gaffes. For instance, The Washington Post reported HIX needed to be connected to 13 different state information systems, but \u201c\u2026most agencies had not heard from the exchange or were unaware that the work was even overdue. The findings were summarized in a Nov. 1, 2012, letter to the president of the Maryland Senate and the speaker of the House of Delegates.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of additional indicators of management shortcomings not yet aired publicly. Some but not all are covered below.\n\nFor example, consider the high number of MHBE\u2019s emergency procurements. The exchange procured five Program Management Services contractors in April 2013 (committing to pay them $1.5 million) after allowing less than a week for bidders to prepare proposals. Typically bidders are allowed at least 21 days.\n\nThese hasty procurements suggest that the exchange was overwhelmed, realizing it could not manage the Noridian work and had no better option than emergency outsourcing. Bidders commonly build extra risks into their prices (increasing costs to the exchange) under the circumstances of these procurements.\n\nLater in the project, the exchange provided a 10-day bidding period for a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d Third-Party Computer Security Assessment. The contractor was then given five weeks to do security control assessments of HIX applications and infrastructure, even while programmers and hardware configuration experts were furiously trying to finish building them.\n\nThis computer-security work was a vital federal requirement but its timing raises questions about how effective and reliable the results were.\n\nContractors not held to the terms of their contracts\n\nAnother indicator might be the evidence pointing to MHBE\u2019s difficulties holding contractors to the terms of their contracts. For instance, Sharfstein\u2019s Jan. 14 testimony includes excerpts from reports prepared by BerryDunn, a consulting firm responsible for monitoring qualitative and technical aspects of Noridian\u2019s build of the HIX website.\n\nSharfstein\u2019s testimony (Pages 27 \u2013 59 Appendix 4) describe numerous instances of Noridian\u2019s performance outside the contract requirements, and demonstrate quite clearly that the exchange had lost control over the project\u2019s System Development Life Cycle.\n\nThis term refers to the internal control structure of managing large information-technology projects. Adhering to the principles of System Development Life Cycle is an inherent responsibility of the owner of the computer system, in this case the exchange. This responsibility cannot be shifted to contractors, although IT contracts require that private contractors utilize these Life Cycle methodologies. By trying to affix all blame on contractors, Sharfstein demonstrates that he does not understand this distinction.\n\nIn retrospect, the state might have managed its risks more fully by having the exchange contract with the Maryland Department of Information Technology to oversee the HIX build. This would have allowed Rebecca Pearce to focus on building the organization and meeting her myriad other administrative duties.\n\nIt was the responsibility of the governor and his lieutenant to consider risks at these highest levels.\n\nAccountability: cost overruns and requests for more federal funding\n\nSharfstein acknowledges work done by Noridian was deficient and he has not ruled out any possible remedies, such as some combination of the following:\n\nSue contractor/s and recover overpayments.\n\nObtain more grant funding from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nCover unexpected costs with Maryland taxpayer dollars.\n\nAvoidable cost overruns due to delay, disruption, acceleration-deceleration, negligence and honest error appear to adversely affect several years of MHBE\u2019s budgets.\n\nFor instance, Sharfstein\u2019s testimony shows a 2014 budget of $138 million -- including the MHBE\u2019s first bailout, a $33 million deficiency appropriation for unexpected spending. This is more than four times the resources estimated for the exchange\u2019s annual operations just two years earlier.\n\nSome of the easiest overruns to pinpoint include costs for the Optum/QSSI contract, extra call center resources, HIX entire cost if Maryland decides to abandon it, the emergency insurance just enacted because of HIX problems(MHIP Bridge) and state personnel salaries for extensive manual workarounds.\n\nThese do not include any indirect costs and could amount to more than $100 million. There are overruns more difficult to deal with, such as higher costs incurred by the exchange\u2019s insurance companies to sign up customers in spite of erroneous HIX outputs.\n\nThe federal government will pay for some but not all overruns. The state has applied to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for additional grant funds. This might be viewed as the exchange\u2019s second bailout, but because the centers hasn\u2019t decided what to fund, the exchange will not disclose the amount of the request or the justifications being used.\n\nThe exchange hasn\u2019t terminated Noridian because the law dictates it must make its best efforts to mitigate damages. However, O\u2019Malley must establish accountability by deciding -- immediately after March 31 -- whether to sue Noridian. This is another decision that could be influenced by politics. Noridian\u2019s likely countersuit would almost surely air in public the exchange\u2019s dirty laundry by giving Noridian\u2019s version of events.\n\nQuestions remain on self-sustainability and long-term financing\n\nMHBE is a public corporation and independent unit of the state government established in April 2011. Part of the reason it was set up separately was to insulate its decisions from politics. That was the intent, anyway.\n\nThe state planned to finance almost all of the exchange\u2019s operating costs through 2014 with federal money. Starting Jan. 1, 2015, Obamacare money runs out and the exchange must be self-sustaining.\n\nIn December 2012, DHMH submitted a consultant report prepared by Wakely Consulting Group to the legislature recommending several ways to pay for MHBE\u2019s operations.\n\nThe report estimated \u201c\u2026the cost of operating the exchange to be between $24 and $30 million in 2014, between $38 and $51 million in 2015, and between $44 and $61 million in 2016.\u201d However, Gov. O\u2019Malley chose a different financing approach, and the state legislature passed the Maryland Health Progress Act of 2013 to levy a new tax on insurance premiums charged by health insurers and for-profit health maintenance organizations -- regardless of whether they offer insurance through the exchange. This tax purportedly would pay for MHBE\u2019s operations.\n\nBut according to the Department of Legislative Service\u2019s (DLS) assessment of the exchange\u2019s 2014 budget (page 24), MHBE will face a widening excess of expenses over revenues immediately after the federal grant money dries up.\n\nGeneral Fund bailouts projected for years\n\nIn 2015, exchange expenses are projected to exceed revenues by $22 million. That shortfall, however, will be much higher because revenue assumptions include $24 million of unspent federal money -- a dubious assumption, given the magnitude of HIX-related overruns.\n\nIn the following three years, DLS predicts that the state will need to find more than $100 million to pay for exchange operations because the new tax on premiums is projected to be insufficient. DLS is careful to say its projections are soft because of uncertainty. Nonetheless, its paper projections show the exchange will need General Fund bailouts every year until those uncertainties fade.\n\nThe decision over what to do about HIX will have a significant effect on the exchange\u2019s cost of operations. If HIX is fixed, the state would keep the advantages of running its own exchange while committing to bear the costs of fixing or replacing HIX, finishing its functionality and paying significant operations and maintenance including software licensure for proprietary software built into HIX.\n\nIf HIX were abandoned, the effects generally would be the opposite. The governor may want to consider procuring an independent study to objectively quantify taxpayers\u2019 cost of his options in lieu of making a decision that may be too influenced by the prevailing political winds.\n\nCharlie Hayward recently retired after 30 years\u2019 experience with performance, IT, and financial auditing of a wide variety of government programs and activities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The problems at the Maryland Health Benefits Exchange (MHBE) are likely more serious and more expensive to fix than has already been reported, according to an assessment of project documentation by MarylandReporter.com.\r\n\r\nCost overruns and higher costs in future years could easily run to over $100 million, and big decisions loom regarding who will pay and what will happen to the glitch-ridden website.", "original-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2014/02/18/analysis-health-exchange-problems-could-be-more-serious-and-expensive-than-reported/", "og": {"site_name": "MarylandReporter.com", "description": "The problems at the Maryland Health Benefits Exchange (MHBE) are likely more serious and more expensive to fix than has already been reported, according to an assessment of project documentation by MarylandReporter.com.\r\n\r\nCost overruns and higher costs in future years could easily run to over $100 million, and big decisions loom regarding who will pay and what will happen to the glitch-ridden website.", "title": "Analysis: Health exchange problems could be more serious and expensive than reported", "url": "http://marylandreporter.com/2014/02/18/analysis-health-exchange-problems-could-be-more-serious-and-expensive-than-reported/", "image": "http://marylandreporter.com/files/2015/07/maryland-SQ-771x771.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mdreporter", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2014/02/18/analysis-health-exchange-problems-could-be-more-serious-and-expensive-than-reported/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf744\"", "article_summary": "By Charlie HaywardCharlieHayward@MarylandReporter.comThe problems at the Maryland Health Benefits Exchange (MHBE) are likely more serious and more expensive to fix than has already been reported, according to an assessment of project documentation by MarylandReporter.com.\nAnd all meeting materials (particularly exchange managers\u2019 updates) posted since August 2013 have no content about exchange problems.\nRecent newspaper accounts have covered tidbits drawn from litigation between contractors fighting over disagreements about building Maryland\u2019s Health Information Exchange website (HIX).\nSilent board minutes, some not postedThe media blitzkrieg draws attention to Maryland state law establishing the need for openness and transparency in MHBE\u2019s activity.\nMaryland Reporter\u2019s audit hawk Charlie Hayward gets into the weeds of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange and finds a few snakes, financial sinkholes and some future traps."}
