Facing third-and-7 from the SMSU 12-yard line, BSU quarterback Alex Haas broke free and sprinted into the end zone for the game\u2019s first touchdown. SMSU blocked the point after attempt to keep the score 6-0.\n\nFollowing an SMSU punt, the Mustang defense forced its first turnover of the game, recovering a fumble at the BSU 44-yard.

Just four plays later, Tonderum plowed across for a 4-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to 20-14 early in the second quarter.\n\nSMSU took its first lead of the game midway through the second quarter as Tonderum broke away for a career-long 77-yard touchdown run to give the Mustangs a 21-20 advantage. It was his second 70-plus yard touchdown run of the season.\n\nBSU answered with its most impressive drive of the half to regain the lead. The Beaver offense moved the ball 69 yards on 12 plays \u2013 including converting three third-down conversions \u2013 with Walker grabbing a 6-yard touchdown pass from Hass to give BSU a 26-21 lead at halftime.\n\nSMSU cut into the deficit early in the third quarter as Schuveiller drilled a 31-yard field goal with 9:41 remaining in the third to make the score 26-24.\n\nBoth teams exchanged punts, before the Mustang defense came through in a big way as McKoy Rodning intercepted Hass at the 15-yard line and returned for his first career touchdown and give SMSU the lead back at 30-26.\n\nThe SMSU defense came through again just two plays later as Andrew McReynolds forced a BSU fumble and teammate Jared Twedt recovered the ball giving SMSU first-and-10 deep in BSU territory at the 26-yard line.
