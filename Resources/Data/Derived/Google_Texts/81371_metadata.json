As talk turned to Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-Wis.) budget proposal and the GOP\u2019s recent efforts to repeal Obamacare, Obama attempted to deliver a zinger to the GOP, comparing their policies to food served at a local deli.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like that movie \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019 except it\u2019s not funny,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they tried to sell this sandwich at Zingerman\u2019s, they\u2019d have to call it the stinkburger or the meanwhich.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama visited Zingerman\u2019s, an Ann Arbor-based deli, before his speech and discussed the minimum wage with several local workers.\n\nThe president\u2019s speech before the crowd of more than 1,400 is the latest of several attempts to pressure Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour.\n\nWhile Obama and his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill have made the wage hike a priority of their 2014 agenda, their colleagues on the other side of the aisle worry a minimum wage increase could hurt both businesses and workers.\n\nAnd President Obama wasn\u2019t soft on the GOP, as he went on to mock Republicans for dismissing his minimum wage proposal because they believe it\u2019s beneficial only to young people.\n\n\u201cNext thing you know, they\u2019ll say: \u2018Get off my lawn,'\u201d the president said. \u201c\u2026You\u2019d think it would be a no-brainer. Here\u2019s the problem: Republicans in Congress don\u2019t want to vote to raise it at all. In face, some just want to scrap the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nYou told them, Mr. President.\n\nPresident Obama pushed young students in attendance to reach out to their elected officials and encourage them to vote to raise the minimum wage.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), though, has made it clear that he will not bring a bill to raise the minimum wage to the floor. Along with many other Republicans, Boehner argued raising the minimum wage would cause the price of goods and services to increase, slow hiring and cause businesses to lay workers off.\n\nThe Senate, to the contrary, is moving forward with a vote.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Barack Obama was full of schoolyard insults during a speech on the minimum wage Wednesday, as he told the crowd that if the GOP's policies were deli foods, they'd be a \"stinkburger\" or \"meanwhich.\"", "title": "President Obama: If GOP's policies were deli food, they'd be...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/President-Obama-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/04/02/president-obama-if-gops-policies-were-deli-food-theyd-be-called-the-stinkburger-and-meanwhich/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "zingermans", "published_time": "2014-04-02T16:34:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T10:23:53+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6f8\"", "article_summary": "President Obama pushed young students in attendance to reach out to their elected officials and encourage them to vote to raise the minimum wage.\nPresident Obama: If GOP\u2019s policies were deli food, they\u2019d be called the \u2018stinkburger\u2019 and \u2018meanwhich\u2019President Barack Obama was full of schoolyard insults during a speech on the minimum wage Wednesday, as he told the crowd that if the GOP\u2019s policies were deli foods, they\u2019d be a \u201cstinkburger\u201d or \u201cmeanwhich.\u201dThe president addressed students at the University of Michigan and discussed proposals to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), though, has made it clear that he will not bring a bill to raise the minimum wage to the floor.\nAnd President Obama wasn\u2019t soft on the GOP, as he went on to mock Republicans for dismissing his minimum wage proposal because they believe it\u2019s beneficial only to young people.\nAlong with many other Republicans, Boehner argued raising the minimum wage would cause the price of goods and services to increase, slow hiring and cause businesses to lay workers off."}
