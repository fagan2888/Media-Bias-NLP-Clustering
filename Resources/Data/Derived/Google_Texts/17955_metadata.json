When Mariluz doesn\u2019t call and Jaoquin forgets to take her medication, she hears voices inside her head, reacts, and gets in trouble.\n\nLike the time last year when Joaquin heard a threat: People were coming to invade the building, owned by the Boston Housing Authority, where Joaquin rents a one-bedroom apartment. Joaquin rushed into the hall to alert her neighbors.\n\n\u201cShe started knocking on everyone\u2019s doors, at 3 or 4 in the morning, so everyone could get out,\u201d Mariluz recounted. \u201cShe was throwing things from her building down the stairs, things you can\u2019t do in housing, but in her head she was doing it because she wanted to help.\u201d\n\nJoaquin\u2019s misguided warnings almost got the generally demure, middle-aged native of the Dominican Republic evicted.\n\nBut Mariluz intervened, in her role as a community health worker. She\u2019s one of at least 3,600 men and women in Massachusetts who help patients pay bills, arrange pet or child care so the patient can have surgery, or sit with them at an AA meeting. It\u2019s a job that\u2019s been taking shape for decades but is just now becoming a more formal profession. Massachusetts is finalizing rules that are expected to establish the first voluntary community health certification.\n\nMariluz is in a newly created position at Rosie\u2019s Place, where the focus for decades has been on helping women find stable jobs and housing. The idea for her job took shape a few years ago when Rosie\u2019s Place director Sue Marsh realized that about 20 percent of her clients were losing their housing, even though they could pay rent and utility bills.\n\n\u201cTheir housing was relatively under control; what wasn\u2019t under control was their health problems,\u201d Marsh said.\n\nA woman with diabetes who passed out when her blood sugar got too high might be sent to a nursing home and then be back on the streets. Women like Joaquin, with untreated mental health, bothered other tenants. So Marsh hired Mariluz and asked her to figure out what it would take to help about 20 women get control of their health.\n\nHer first step: \u201cto build trust,\u201d said Mariluz. Then she established a routine with each woman: daily calls, restocking refrigerators, pills sorted into boxes marked \u201cmorning\u201d and \u201cnight\u201d each day, ad hoc exercise and addiction counseling, trips to the pharmacy or clinic or hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s running interference for somebody who has health problems and lacks that person in their lives to serve that need.\u201d \u2013 Sue Marsh, Rosie's Place director\n\nMariluz became the mom or grown son or sister that Joaquin and many women at Rosie\u2019s Place do not have.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the daughter who goes with them to the doctor\u2019s appointment and then hounds the home health agency to do what they\u2019re supposed to do, or who reminds the doctor that the guest has an allergy to something,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s running interference for somebody who has health problems and lacks that person in their lives to serve that need.\u201d\n\nCommunity health workers are running interference for all kinds of patients in all kinds of social service and health care settings. The job title covers more than 50 positions, including health care coaches, patient navigators and peer counselors.\n\nCaitlin Allen, a research assistant at Emory University in Atlanta, surveyed community health workers across the country in 2014, four years after the Affordable Care Act \u201ccreated a watershed moment\u201d for the profession. She found that many doctors and nurses see the need for someone who can monitor or track patients between appointments.\n\n\u201cCommunity health workers can really become that bridge between the community and clinic that I think a lot of providers have been looking for for a long time,\u201d Allen said.\n\nBut beyond the bridge, Allen said it often isn\u2019t clear who the community health worker reports to, how much authority they have, or even just what they\u2019re supposed to do.\n\nMara Laderman, a senior research associate at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Cambridge, said clinics and agencies that want to hire a community health worker must be prepared to define that role and train the new employee for a specific set of tasks.\n\n\u201cOrganizations, both health care and community-based, that are thinking about bringing in a community health worker should not rely on them to serve as a one-size-fits-all solution to a heterogeneous set of problems,\u201d Laderman said.\n\nThere are no national standards for community health workers and no required training or certification. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is finalizing regulations for voluntary certification that would include 80 hours of training in 10 core areas.\n\nLissette Blondet, director of the Massachusetts Association of Community Health Workers, started crafting requirements for this field 25 years ago. In that quarter century, Blondet says one thing has not changed: Her members are in the job to give back.\n\n\u201cMany of them have walked the shoes of their clients, because of poverty or because they share the health issue, they understand the barriers, obstacles and issues that their clients are facing,\u201d Blondet said, \u201cso they can coach them in very pragmatic ways.\u201d\n\nBlondet says these workers, who often start at $12 an hour, save the health care system much more than they are paid. Preliminary results from a demonstration project, using community health workers to help children manage asthma in New England, show fewer hospital admissions and emergency room visits with savings of $1,104 per patient in one year.\n\nMost community health workers are paid through short-term grants and change jobs frequently.\n\nThat\u2019s not the plan for Mariluz, who is full time at Rosie\u2019s Place. Joaquin and other women have become so dependent on Mariluz that when she takes time off, they fall apart.\n\n\u201cThis is the product of me being out,\u201d Mariluz said while walking down a hallway inside Boston Medical Center, flipping through Joaquin\u2019s medical chart. Her blood sugar had been dangerously high recent mornings. Joaquin had stopped taking her pills at night.\n\nWhen Joaquin\u2019s sugar is high, she gets massive headaches and a racing heart. \u201cThe other day something happened in my heart, it was beating a lot,\u201d Joaquin said in Spanish, patting her chest and sitting on an exam table in the officer of her endocrinologist, Dr. Devin Steenkamp.\n\nThe racing heart could also be a symptom of dehydration, Dr. Steenkamp told Joaquin. He was concerned and went over a new plan to get Joaquin\u2019s blood sugar back into a stable, safe range.\n\n\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Steenkamp said to Joaquin, as Mariluz translated. \u201cYou have before.\u201d\n\nJoaquin nodded, a shy smile lights her face.\n\nAs long as she can keep her family, Joaquin said. All she has is Mariluz and Rosie\u2019s Place.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve given me a lot of help and that\u2019s been my saving grace because I don\u2019t have any other help,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The workers help patients pay bills, arrange child care so the patient can have surgery, or sit with them at an AA meeting.
