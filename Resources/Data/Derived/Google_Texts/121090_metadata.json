He was always working on something. It was unbelievable how smart he was. He never got down on himself when things weren\u2019t going his way.\u201d\n\nWard, a 2012 South Lewis graduate, was buried in his nearby hometown of Port Leyden, 55 miles from Syracuse.\n\n\u201cHe was an amazing sprint-car driver and had a family like no other,\u201d his cousin, Amanda Ward, said in a eulogy. \u201cWe used to tell him before every race, \u2018Drive it like you stole it.\u2019 He never let us down.\u201d\n\nHis sister, Kayla Herring, said the orange and white lapel ribbons worn by family and friends were to signify that the team colors would remain bright, even in the darkest times.\n\nThere was barely a dry eye in the auditorium as a recording of the Dixie Chicks singing \u201cGodspeed, little man, sweet dreams, little man\u201d was played at the request of Ward\u2019s mother.\n\nAfter the service, as Ward\u2019s casket was taken to the hearse for the short trip to the cemetery, mourners let loose helium balloons in orange, white and black.\n\nWard died Saturday night at a track 140 miles away in Canandaigua, where Stewart was riding a day before the Sprint Cup race at Watkins Glen.\n\nThe accident touched off debates as video of the crash circulated online, with fans questioning whether Stewart, known for his hot temper, tried to send his own message by buzzing Ward, or whether Ward recklessly stepped onto a dark track clad in black.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kevin Ward Jr. praised, mourned at funeral after fatal crash with Tony Stewart\u2019s car", "title": "Kevin Ward Jr. praised, mourned at funeral after fatal crash with Tony Stewart\u2019s car", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/14/kevin-ward-jr-praised-mourned-at-funeral-after-fatal-crash-with-tony-stewarts-car/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815__kevin-ward-jr-funeralp1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815__kevin-ward-jr-funeralp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-14T21:24:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:48:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After the service, as Ward\u2019s casket was taken to the hearse for the short trip to the cemetery, mourners let loose helium balloons in orange, white and black.\n\u201cHe was an amazing sprint-car driver and had a family like no other,\u201d his cousin, Amanda Ward, said in a eulogy.\nWard died Saturday night at a track 140 miles away in Canandaigua, where Stewart was riding a day before the Sprint Cup race at Watkins Glen.\n\u201cEven if he had rough day, he always had a smile,\u201d a tearful Dylan Swiernick said of his best friend and car-obsessed buddy.\nThe 90-minute service was held at the South Lewis Senior High School auditorium to accommodate crowds of people from the close-knit central New York racing community."}
