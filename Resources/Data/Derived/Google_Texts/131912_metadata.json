The car starts at $105,000.\n\nTesla also dropped the price for a single-motor, 70-kWh Model S to $70,000, $5,000 less than the dual motor version.\n\nThe feature that garnered the most attention during the call, however, was what the company called the \u201cludicrous\u201d speed version, to be available for an extra $10,000 for new buyers of the Model S 85D. Existing owners of that model can buy it for $5,000 plus labor over the next six months.\n\nIt propels the Model S to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and to a quarter mile in just under 11 seconds, Tesla said. Musk said a next-generation Tesla Roadster, to be available in four years, would come with \u201cmaximum plaid\u201d speed, an allusion to the 1987 Mel Brooks sci-fi parody \u201cSpaceballs.\u201d\n\nThe company said it developed a \u201csmart\u201d fuse for the battery, one that won\u2019t melt past a high amperage. The fuse has its own electronics and a tiny lithium-ion battery that constantly monitors current, and it uses a super-alloy rather than steel so it can withstand the heat generated by the electric current.\n\nShares of Tesla looked poised to end the week up 6%, with shares rising 3% ahead of the conference call and holding at that level. Shares have gained 23% so far this year, compared with gains of 3.3% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, +0.70%\n\nDuring the call, Musk offered some incremental updates on the timelines for the Model X, Tesla\u2019s planned SUV, and the Model 3, the mass-market car Tesla plans to sell for about $40,000.\n\nThe Model X is on track for deliveries in two months and the Model 3 in a bit more than two years, Musk said.\n\nIn the call, Musk was asked about what hopes he\u2019d have for additional Model S sales with the tweaks announced Friday.\n\nHis response?\n\n\u201cI have no idea. We are just trying to make awesome cars.\u201d\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Tesla launches three new features for the Model S, including a new speed mode that takes the sedan from zero to 60 miles per hour in just under three seconds.", "creator": "@ClaudiaAssisMW", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DQ338_tsla_m_ZG_20150717130808.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Claudia Assis", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Tesla launches three new features for the Model S, including a new speed mode that takes the sedan from zero to 60 miles per hour in just under three seconds.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-launches-ludicrous-mode-more-for-model-s-2015-07-17", "author": "Claudia Assis", "parsely-title": "Tesla launches \u2018ludicrous mode,\u2019 more for Model S", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-07-17T16:15:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Tesla launches three new features for the Model S, including a new speed mode that takes the sedan from zero to 60 miles per hour in just under three seconds.", "title": "Tesla launches \u2018ludicrous mode,\u2019 more for Model S", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-launches-ludicrous-mode-more-for-model-s-2015-07-17", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DQ338_tsla_m_ZG_20150717130808.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DQ338_tsla_m_ZG_20150717130808.jpg"}, "article.id": "EA560796-2CB8-11E5-A96F-7B2E42755BD1", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e66\"", "article_summary": "Tesla also dropped the price for a single-motor, 70-kWh Model S to $70,000, $5,000 less than the dual motor version.\nRecap: Tesla unveils new features for Model SThat would take Tesla\u2019s longest-range model, the Model S 85D, to a range of just under 300 miles of highway driving at 65 mph.\nIt propels the Model S to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and to a quarter mile in just under 11 seconds, Tesla said.\nIn the call, Musk was asked about what hopes he\u2019d have for additional Model S sales with the tweaks announced Friday.\nTesla Motors Inc. unveiled three features for its Model S on Friday, including a \u201cludicrous\u201d speed mode that can take the all-electric sedan from zero to 60 miles per hour in just under three seconds."}
