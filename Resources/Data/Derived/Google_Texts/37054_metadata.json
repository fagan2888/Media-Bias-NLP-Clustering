Only toilet paper and, well, you know.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t? Those new, so-called flushable personal wipes, say a growing number of city sewer managers, who are dealing with humongous clumps of these wipes clogging up pipes and sewers across the country.\n\nUnlike toilet paper, which quickly breaks down in water, these other products \u2013 despite their claims of being \u201cseptic safe\u201d and \u201cbreaking down like toilet paper\u201d \u2013 tend to stay intact, gumming up sewer systems and causing overflows into streams or basements from jammed pipes and broken pumps.\n\nThe moist, cleansing wipes \u2013 sort of an adult version of baby wipes, which also aren\u2019t flushable \u2013 are just part of the problem, reports the Washington Post. Other products, including pop-off scrubbers on toilet-cleaning wands, are increasingly being marketed as \u201cflushable.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because you can flush it doesn\u2019t mean you should,\u201d I.J. Hudson, a spokesman for the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, in Laurel, Md., told the Post.\n\nIn Grand Rapids, Mich., city officials sent out \u201cNo wipes in the pipes\u201d flyers to residents to urge them to stop flushing the products, and a Raleigh, N.C., sanitation expert pleaded for residents to \u201cjust throw [used wipes] in the trash can,\u201d USA Today reports.\n\nAnd the problem is not just here. This summer, a 15-ton bus-size glob of wipes and hardened cooking grease \u2013 nicknamed a \u201cfatberg\u201d by the Brits \u2013 was discovered in a London sewer pipe after residents complained of toilets that would not flush.\n\nA spokesman for Kimberly-Clark, which makes Cottonelle flushable cleansing cloths, told USA Today that the product is tested and designed to be flushed.\n\nWhen Consumer Reports, however, tested several brands of wipes labeled flushable, they found that while toilet paper disintegrated after only eight seconds, the wipes still hadn\u2019t broken down after 30 minutes. (Click here for video showing the results.)\n\nWipes manufacturers and an industry trade association are working on better flushability testing standards and a more prominent \u201cDo not flush\u201d logo on other products, according to the Post.\n\nIn the meantime, when it comes to flushing, just stick with what officials call the three P\u2019s: pee, poop and (toilet) paper.\n\nPhoto: Elvert Barnes via flickr\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "What should be flushed down the toilet?
