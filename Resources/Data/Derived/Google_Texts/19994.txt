Continuing our countdown of the 20 greatest Dodgers of all time, as selected by our readers.

No. 10: Maury Wills (35 first-place votes, 27,046 points)

Wills is credited by many with bringing the stolen base back to baseball. In his first full season as Dodgers shortstop (1960), Wills led the league with 50 stolen bases, becoming the first National League player to steal 50 since Max Carey stole 51 in 1923.

In 1962, Wills broke Ty Cobb's 47-year-old record by stealing 104 bases for the Dodgers and was named NL most valuable player.
