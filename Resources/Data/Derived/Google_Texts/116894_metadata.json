Mark Walker of North Carolina, also will give a featured speech.\n\n\u201cBuilding a strong civil society is about more than government policies,\u201d Walker said in a press release plugging the event. \u201cI am honored to share my thoughts at the Heritage Action Conservative Policy Summit on how we can advance a conservative civil society while expanding our audience in this new era.\u201d\n\nHeritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former U.S. senator and House member from South Carolina, will welcome the participants.\n\nThe summit begins at 9 a.m. EST and will be live-streamed on C-SPAN and from Heritage Action\u2019s website. (Here is the day\u2019s agenda.)\n\nAlthough Republicans dominate the straight-ticket speaking roster, the event features politicians from across the conservative spectrum and both chambers of Congress. A gang of five senators is expected to attend, accompanied by 19 House members.\n\nModerators for the lawmakers\u2019 panel discussions include Needham and Heritage Action\u2019s chief operating officer, Tim Chapman.\n\nThe gathering will give conservative members an opportunity to talk strategy and count political scalps.\n\nA mile marker, this year\u2019s summit stands in stark contrast to the 2015 event. Since then, the conservative House Freedom Caucus has matured from a rabble-rousing startup to an influential voting bloc.\n\nPressed into early retirement by conservatives in September, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, stepped down as both House speaker and member the next month. After courting and unifying the Republican conference, Ryan won election to that position.\n\nUnder his leadership, Ryan has pledged to return the House to regular order on appropriations bills, passing them individually rather than all together in an \u201comnibus.\u201d If successful, it will be the first time Congress has passed all 12 appropriations bills since 1996.\n\nThe Conservative Policy Summit also will provide a forum for discussing the future of the Senate institution\u2014the filibuster.\n\nBen Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, will moderate a debate on the controversial parliamentary procedure between Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThis report has been corrected to attribute the quote from Heritage Action to its CEO, Michael Needham.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative members of Congress will plot a course for 2016 during the Conservative Policy Summit hosted by Heritage Action, the think tank's lobbying arm.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative members of Congress will plot a course for 2016 during the Conservative Policy Summit hosted by Heritage Action, the think tank's lobbying arm.", "title": "Conservatives to Outline Plan to 'Take Back America'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160202.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T15:05:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PxsqvP"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative members of Congress will plot a course for 2016 during the Conservative Policy Summit hosted by Heritage Action, the think tank's lobbying arm.", "title": "Conservatives to Outline Plan to 'Take Back America'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160202.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2016-02-02T16:21:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T15:05:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Heritage Action for America, Conservative Policy Summit, Jim DeMint, Heritage Foundation, 2016, Paul Ryan, Mike Lee, conservative ideas, public policy"}, "article_summary": "The Conservative Policy Summit also will provide a forum for discussing the future of the Senate institution\u2014the filibuster.\nTwo dozen members of Congress will tackle aspects of \u201ca blueprint to take back America\u201d during the annual Conservative Policy Summit, set for Wednesday at The Heritage Foundation.\nSince then, the conservative House Freedom Caucus has matured from a rabble-rousing startup to an influential voting bloc.\nThis report has been corrected to attribute the quote from Heritage Action to its CEO, Michael Needham.\nHeadlining will be House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., scheduled to deliver a keynote address at the summit, hosted by Heritage Action for America, the think tank\u2019s lobbying arm."}
