Chesapeake said suspending the payment will allow it to retain $170 million of additional cash yearly\u2014funds which will be used to purchase debt.\n\nVolatile energy prices weighed heavily in the Oklahoma City company\u2019s decision.\n\nBoth oil and stock prices\u2014which have been moving in tandem\u2014were down again on Jan. 25 following a short-lived rebound on Jan. 22.\n\n\u201cGiven the current commodity price environment for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we believe that redirecting this cash toward debt retirement provides better returns for the company,\u201d Chesapeake\u2019s CEO Doug Lawler said in a statement. \u201cWe currently have senior debt securities trading at significant discounts, and we will continue to take advantage of that within the coming year.\"\n\nChesapeake\u2019s measure to slash debt is the latest attempt to trim its balance sheet. On the final day of 2015, it completed a debt exchange, swapping out $3.8 billion of previously issued bonds for new 8 percent senior-secured second-lien notes due 2022. The exchange was funded with borrowings under Chesapeake\u2019s $4 billion revolving credit facility.\n\nChesapeake reported a $4.695 billion net loss available to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2015. The company\u2019s announced plan to suspend the dividend payment did little to put investors at ease, however. The company\u2019s stock was down 9.75 percent in midday trading.\n\nMeanwhile, Chesapeake\u2019s financial troubles, indicative of a wider-spread commodities market issue, could be why some predict an increase in M&A activity in the energy sector this year, as stronger companies consolidate with weaker ones to preserve pricing and eliminate excess capacity.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/energy/chesapeake-skipping-dividend-payment-to-buyback-debt-259745-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/naturalgas.jpeg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Chesapeake Skipping Dividend Payment to Buy Back Debt"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07d5\"", "article_summary": "Chesapeake Skipping Dividend Payment to Buy Back DebtThe oil and gas producer blames plummeting energy pricesOil and natural-gas producer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) will skip a payment to shareholders and instead use the cash to retire its debt, the company said Jan. 25.\nThe company\u2019s announced plan to suspend the dividend payment did little to put investors at ease, however.\nChesapeake said suspending the payment will allow it to retain $170 million of additional cash yearly\u2014funds which will be used to purchase debt.\nThe company\u2019s stock was down 9.75 percent in midday trading.\nThe decision affects dividend payments on Chesapeake\u2019s outstanding convertible preferred stock."}
