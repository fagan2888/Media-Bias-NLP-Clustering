But he said a jury, not a judge, should sort out who was liable. The judge did dismiss breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims against PwC.\n\nPwC spokeswoman Caroline Nolan said, \u201cWe respectfully disagree\u201d with the decision to let the case go forward, according to the article. She also said PwC\u2019s audit of MF Global complied with professional standards, and that MF Global\u2019s treatment of the repurchase-to-maturity transactions was consistent with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n\nDaniel Fetterman, a partner at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman representing the plan administrator, said: \u201cWe are pleased with Judge Marrero's well-reasoned decision, and look forward to presenting our case to a jury,\u201d according to the article.\n\nFASB issues guidance to improve financial reporting of going concern uncertainties\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on Wednesday issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nThe update is intended to define management\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an organization\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.\n\nUnder US GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nUS GAAP currently lacks guidance about management\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.\n\nThe update provides guidance to an organization\u2019s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.\n\n\u201cThis update responds to stakeholder concerns about the diversity that currently exists in footnote disclosures because of the lack of guidance in GAAP and the differing views in practice about when substantial doubt exists,\u201d FASB Technical Director Susan Cosper said in a written statement. \u201cIt improves the comparability of these disclosures by providing guidance on when there is substantial doubt and how the underlying conditions and events should be disclosed in the footnotes.\u201d\n\nThe amendments in this update apply to all companies and not-for-profit organizations, according to the FASB. They become effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted.\n\nThe update and a FASB In Focus document are available on the FASB website.\n\nCAQ commends FASB\u2019s issuance of guidance to improve financial reporting of going concern entities\n\nCenter for Audit Quality (CAQ) Executive Director Cindy Fornelli had this to say on Wednesday about the FASB\u2019s new going concern guidance: \u201cThe CAQ commends FASB for its efforts in developing a standard that provides guidance regarding a preparer\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, and, where required, to provide footnote disclosures about going concern uncertainties each reporting period.\n\n\u201cWe believe the adopted ASU represents an improvement over the current going concern model and will provide users of financial statements with more clarity on the nature of conditions or events that may raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n\u201cThe CAQ encourages accounting and auditing standard-setters to continue to work together to develop complementary standards which would further benefit financial statement users.\u201d\n\nCAQ provides new tool to help auditors avoid judgment tendencies, traps, and biases\n\nSpeaking of the CAQ, the public policy organization on Wednesday issued the Professional Judgment Resource, designed to provide auditors with an example of a decision-making process to facilitate important auditing and accounting judgments in a professionally skeptical manner.\n\nIt is aimed at assisting auditors who are responding to judgment challenges arising from the increasing complexity of business transactions, the development of principles-based (or objectives-based) auditing and accounting standards, the increasing focus on estimates, and other highly subjective elements.\n\nThe tool outlines an example of a decision-making process grounded in five essential actions. They are:\n\nIdentify and define the issue. Gather the facts and information and identify the relevant literature. Perform the analysis and identify alternatives. Make the decision. Review and complete the documentation and rationale for the conclusion.\n\nAdditionally, it identifies several of the more common judgment tendencies and traps that can potentially lead to bias and weaken professional skepticism, and includes illustrative examples of these tendencies, as well as strategies to avoid them.\n\n\u201cIt is critical for the public and capital markets to have trust and confidence in the reasonableness of judgments made by public company auditors,\u201d Fornelli said in a written statement. \u201cWhile there is no \u2018silver bullet\u2019 that will eliminate all psychological traps, increased awareness of them can improve an auditor\u2019s decision-making process.\u201d\n\nWhile the Professional Judgment Resource was developed with auditors in mind, it can be a useful tool for all participants in the capital markets.\n\nKPMG faces criticism for Esp\u00edrito Santo audit work\n\nIn KPMG LLP\u2019s office in Lisbon, Portugal, few clients provided as much audit work as the Espirito Santo Group, whose business interests ranged from banking to mining. Now the collapse of the family-owned empire is raising questions about whether KPMG should have detected problems earlier, Patricia Kowsmann, David Enrich, and Margot Patrick of the Wall Street Journal wrote on Thursday.\n\nKPMG was the auditor of Espirito Santo Financial Group SA, a publicly traded Luxembourg finance company that filed for creditor protection in July. In Lisbon, it was the auditor of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo SA, which was bailed out in August, and of dozens of related companies. And KPMG was the auditor of three offshore investment vehicles that trafficked in Espirito Santo debt and played a part in what the Portuguese central bank describes as a fraudulent scheme.\n\nCritics say the scope of KPMG\u2019s audit work could have put the firm in a position to identify the billions of euros that were secretly flowing among group companies before Espirito Santo's unraveling sent shock waves across European markets this summer, Kowsmann, Enrich, and Patrick wrote.\n\n\u201cWith the auditor playing so many roles, the question seems to be: Were they just too spread out to see the big picture, or in the worst case were they too focused on getting audit mandates to act on the big picture?\u201d said Peter Hahn, a finance professor at London's Cass Business School, according to the article.\n\nKPMG spokesman Brian Bannister told the Wall Street Journal that the firm \u201cstands by the quality of the audit work\u201d it conducted for the offshore vehicles and Espirito Santo, noting that it was performed \u201cin accordance with all applicable professional and ethical standards.\u201d He said KPMG doesn't believe there was any conflict of interest and that the offshore vehicles were legally separate from Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo.\n\nInsurers pay more tax on executive compensation under Obamacare: study\n\nWhen Washington eliminated corporate tax deductions on health insurance executive compensation above $500,000 under President Obama\u2019s healthcare reform law in 2013, it generated more than $72 million in additional tax revenue for the US government, a left-leaning think tank said on Wednesday, according to an article by Caroline Humer of Reuters.\n\nThe report from the Institute for Policy Studies examined executive compensation in the 2013 proxy filings from WellPoint Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc., among others, and found that those companies paid more taxes than they would have if the law had not been passed.\n\nAfter examining the 10 largest publicly traded health insurers, it found that corporate taxes on their pay would likely increase in coming years because some 2013 compensation included stock options that predated the law, Humer wrote.\n\nBased on those disclosures, it calculated the corporate tax each company paid on the compensation of the top five executives versus what the companies would have paid based on the US tax code that applied to insurers prior to 2013 and that continues to be used by most other US corporations outside of the health insurance industry.\n\nThe report said that if all corporations were to be taxed this way, it would raise $50 billion more in revenue for the US government, according to the article.\n\nSEC adopts new rules on asset-backed securities and credit ratings\n\nWilliam Alden of New York Times DealBook reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unanimously approved rules on Wednesday that would require issuers of asset-backed securities \u2013 complex investments based on mortgages, auto loans, or other types of debt \u2013 to disclose more information about the underlying loans.\n\nThe rules are meant to help investors better judge the quality of such securities.\n\nAt the same time, the SEC tightened controls on credit rating agencies, whose overly optimistic ratings helped inflate the housing bubble in the years before the financial crisis. With two of the five commissioners casting dissenting votes, the agency adopted rules to help guard against conflicts of interest in the ratings business, as well as to increase disclosure of the rating process.\n\n\u201cThe reforms before us today will add critical protections for investors and strengthen our securities markets by targeting products, activities, and practices that were at the center of the financial crisis,\u201d SEC Chair Mary Jo White said, according to the article. \u201cWith these measures, investors will have powerful new tools for independently evaluating the quality of asset-backed securities and credit ratings.\u201d\n\nThe rules on rating agencies drew forceful criticism from two of the commissioners. Among other issues, those rules aim to address a potential conflict inherent in the business model of rating agencies, which are paid by the issuers of the securities they rate, by prohibiting sales considerations from influencing them, Alden wrote. The rules also require the firms like Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s to have internal procedures for setting and revising their ratings. They will also have to increase disclosure of their accuracy.\n\nQuick Links:", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Jason Bramwell"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: FASB Puts Onus on Management for Going Concern Disclosures", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Standards"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: FASB Puts Onus on Management for Going Concern Disclosures", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/aa/standards/bramwells-lunch-beat-fasb-puts-onus-on-management-for-going-concern-disclosures", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2014-08-28T15:26:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/aa/standards/bramwells-lunch-beat-fasb-puts-onus-on-management-for-going-concern-disclosures", "card": "summary", "title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: FASB Puts Onus on Management for Going Concern Disclosures"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/aa/standards/bramwells-lunch-beat-fasb-puts-onus-on-management-for-going-concern-disclosures", "dcterms.creator": "Jason Bramwell", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-28T15:26+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Standards\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Standards\",\"A&A\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_18703\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-28T17:26:13+01:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T17:26:13+01:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Standards", "sft-date": "Aug 28th 2014", "sft-topic": "A&A", "sft-type": "Article", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-18703", "publishtime": "2014-08-28T17:26:13:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Jason Bramwell", "sft-title": "Bramwell\u2019s Lunch Beat: FASB Puts Onus on..."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3f4\"", "article_summary": "2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\nFASB issues guidance to improve financial reporting of going concern uncertaintiesThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on Wednesday issued Accounting Standards Update No.\nFinancial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.\nUnder US GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances.\nUS GAAP currently lacks guidance about management\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures."}
