In an ACO and similar hospital-physician partnerships, health-care providers are held accountable for patient outcomes, and the focus of care is on value, not volume.\n\nImproved care coordination through payment and delivery reform could help reduce more than $200 billion annually in avoidable health care costs, the IMS reports.\n\nIMS also views the federal government's release of Medicare physician data earlier this year as an important step toward greater health data transparency.\n\nFor providers, the real benefit of having detailed clinical data is \"really understanding what works best for each patient,\" Aitken explained.\n\nConsumers are demanding data, too, Nayer said. People enrolled in high-deductible health plans, in particular, are becoming savvy health care shoppers.\n\n\"Within the year, we're going to see this huge movement of consumers asking the questions: How much does it cost? What are the quality indicators? And, what are the outcomes I can expect?\" Nayer said.\n\nOther key indicators of health system change cited by the report include:\n\nThe discovery of highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, like Gilead Sciences' medication Sovaldi. The current cost for a 12-week treatment of Sovaldi is $84,000, according to the report. As cures for other deadly diseases come down the pipeline, the health system must shift the way it pays for the upfront costs of medicines, IMS said.\n\nA new online tool and mobile app to help cancer doctors weigh the cost of medicines, along with their benefits and side effects. IMS believes the initiative signals that cost will become a factor in doctors' clinical decisions.\n\n\"To me, it's pretty clear doctors have zero interest in knowing the cost of things because their job is to provide the best care for patients,\" said Hughes-Cromwick. He said patients in high-deductible plans will be the ones pressuring doctors to tell them the costs of different treatments.\n\nMore information\n\nConsumer Reports' Best Buy Drugs is a free source of information on the safety, effectiveness and price of drugs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/general-health-information-16/doctor-news-206/report-identifies-game-changers-for-u-s-health-care-691988.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/womendocandpatient.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Recent innovations, developments may transform direction of patient care in next decade, researchers say", "title": "Report Identifies Game Changers for U.S. Health Care"}, "description": "Recent innovations, developments may transform direction of patient care in next decade, researchers say", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2426\"", "article_summary": "People enrolled in high-deductible health plans, in particular, are becoming savvy health care shoppers.\nIMS predicts greater innovation in mobile health applications and wearable health devices that cull personal health data and monitor everything from physical activity to blood-sugar levels.\n\"These new technologies get people more engaged in their own health care,\" Aitken said.\nImproved care coordination through payment and delivery reform could help reduce more than $200 billion annually in avoidable health care costs, the IMS reports.\nOne indication of what lies ahead: the entry of such technology juggernauts as Apple, Google and Samsung into the health care marketplace, according to the report."}
