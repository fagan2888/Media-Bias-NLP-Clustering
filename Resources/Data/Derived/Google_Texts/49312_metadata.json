The 2013-14 payment is around $233 million, with $226 million going to the state and $7 million to local governments.\n\nBut the deal also gives the tribe exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. If the tribe loses that exclusivity through an expanded gambling bill, the Seminoles can stop paying.\n\nThose who would be involved in the negotiations kept their cards close to the vest last week.\n\nGov. Rick Scott\u2019s office released a one-sentence statement.\n\n\u201cWith the gaming compact set to expire in 2015, we will take the time needed to negotiate the best arrangement for Florida,\u201d said Melissa Sellers, Scott\u2019s communication director.\n\nRyan Duffy, spokesman for House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, referred questions to Rep. Rob Schenck, R-Spring Hill, who chairs the House select committee on gaming. He was traveling and couldn\u2019t be reached.\n\nKatie Betta, spokeswoman for Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said that chamber\u2019s gaming committee \u201cis studying the Seminole Compact as part of their comprehensive review of current gaming in Florida.\u201d\n\nThe expiration of the card-game provision was one reason Gaetz formed a special panel to deal with gambling and \u201cdevelop a comprehensive, statewide policy,\u201d she said.\n\nSeminole spokesman Gary Bitner said the tribe would not comment on any future talks.\n\nIn October, however, Bitner told The Tampa Tribune that the Seminoles had \u201cworked for two decades to secure a gaming compact with the state of Florida that provided a more stable future for the tribe \u2026 and allowed for significant sharing of gaming revenue with the state.\n\n\u201cThe tribe wants to maintain that steady, stable course through 2015 and beyond,\u201d he added.\n\nSen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, worked on the compact when he served in the House.\n\n\u201cFiguring out what to do regarding the Seminoles and the end of the compact is pivotal to figuring out what to do about gaming overall in Florida,\u201d Galvano said. \u201cAnd the reduction in revenues to the state, depending on what we do, will be significant.\u201d\n\nOne lawmaker last week raised the Seminole Compact in opposing a gambling operator\u2019s bid to set up a slot-machine casino in Miami.\n\nGenting Resorts World wants to lease Gulfstream Racetrack\u2019s slot-machine license and open for business in the former Miami Herald building that Genting now owns. The property overlooks Biscayne Bay.\n\nIn 2012, a bill died in the Legislature that would have permitted the construction of three destination hotel-casinos in South Florida. Genting was hoping to open one of them in the Herald building.\n\nSen. Gwen Margolis, D-Miami, wrote to Gaetz on Thursday, asking him to join her in opposing the Genting-Gulfstream plan.\n\nIf the deal goes through, \u201cgambling activity would be allowed in an area never contemplated by the voting public \u2026 at the center of an arts district, with two performing arts centers, two museums and the American Airlines Arena, all within two city blocks,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt might also adversely impact our revenues from the compact with the Seminole Tribe of Florida.\u201d\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Gaetz had not replied publicly to the letter.\n\nAn outside study done for legislators has said \u201cthe introduction of casinos, whether standalone destination resorts, or addition of slot machines at existing parimutuels, will lead to modest economic benefits.\u201d\n\nMargolis previously suggested that the state allow the Seminoles to offer roulette and craps, now prohibited.\n\n\u201cWe would probably, without opening one new casino, have much more money,\u201d she said at an October committee hearing.\n\nIn response, Bitner then said the tribe \u201cis not negotiating for additional games, and is happy with the games it has now.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 12 Jan 2014 13:21:31 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 As lawmakers decide whether to address expanded gambling in the state, another issue looms: The expiration of the agreement to let the Seminole Tribe of Florida offer card games.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 As lawmakers decide whether to address expanded gambling in the state, another issue looms: The expiration of the agreement to let the Seminole Tribe of Florida offer card games.", "title": "Seminole  contract looms over future of Florida gambling", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/seminole-contract-looms-over-future-of-florida-gambling-20140112/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140112/ARTICLE/140119768/AR/0/AR-140119768.jpg", "height": 685}, "updated_time": "2014-01-12T13:21:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 As lawmakers decide whether to address expanded gambling in the state, another issue looms: The expiration of the agreement to let the Seminole Tribe of Florida offer card game", "title": "Seminole  contract looms over future of Florida gambling", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140112/ARTICLE/140119768/AR/0/AR-140119768.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-12T13:21:31Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-12T13:21:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gambling,Seminole Tribe of Florida"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd483\"", "article_summary": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 As lawmakers decide whether to address expanded gambling in the state, another issue looms: The expiration of the agreement to let the Seminole Tribe of Florida offer card games.\nThat document, known as the Seminole Compact, includes a provision allowing the tribe to offer blackjack and other card games, at locations including its Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Tampa.\nThe deal with the Seminoles guarantees the state a minimum $1 billion from the tribe\u2019s gambling income over five years.\n\u201cIt might also adversely impact our revenues from the compact with the Seminole Tribe of Florida.\u201dAs of Friday afternoon, Gaetz had not replied publicly to the letter.\nBut the deal also gives the tribe exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties."}
