NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Up until recently, the word "drone" likely conjured up images of an unmanned flying military object going into war zones while soldiers controlled the device remotely. Nowadays, partly thanks to Amazon, drones have taken on a whole new meaning for the typical consumer.

In 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced on "60 Minutes" that the e-commerce giant was looking into delivery via drones. While that reality is still far away, thanks to regulations from the Federal Aviation Administration, the notion of seeing drones outside of a war zone is becoming a more familiar concept.

Two-thirds of consumers expect to receive their first drone-delivered package in the next five years, according to a report from communications firm Walker Sands.

The use of drones for delivery is certainly growing, but what about consumer drones? Is the Average Joe going to buy a drone for himself?

“The demand for drones seems to still be in the early adoption phase, but catching fire as the idea has been taken more seriously by retailers and therefore in the public eye much more in this last year,” said Dave Parro, retail practice lead at Walker Sands.

Parro is confident in the adoption of the drones for delivery but doesn’t believe consumers themselves will own them any time soon.

“Drones are likely to remain a novelty item in the near future for the average consumer, no more popular than Google Glasses in current time, unless made more practical and affordable for the the majority to adopt,” he said.
