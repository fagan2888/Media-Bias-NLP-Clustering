Senator Coburn, as he himself said this morning on Morning Joe, received the highest conservative rating in the United States Senate as recently as 2012. In other words, he's no RINO. And yet because he was leery and ultimately unsupportive of the movement to defund Obamacare, many of his constituents are confused and angry with him. The reason, he said, is because some members of the Republican caucus are being \u201cintellectually dishonest\u201d and misleading. The exchange begins around the 5:15 mark (via MSNBC):\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting all sorts of e-mails from people that supported me because they\u2019ve been totally misled about what\u2019s possible\u2026I\u2019d love to get rid of Obamacare. But I don\u2019t see a path forward to doing that until the president is out of office.\u201d\n\nThe reason Cruz\u2019s imaginary mission to defund Obamacare was never going to work was because Republicans simply didn\u2019t have the votes. Period. As George F. Will wrote yesterday, \u201cArithmetic, not moral failings, makes Republicans unable to overturn Obama\u2019s vetoes.\u201d I suspect Coburn agrees one hundred percent with this assessment. Still, Cruz\u2019s faux-filibuster or speech or whatever the hell you call it did at least some good for the cause, Coburn said. How? Well, it allowed for Republicans to speak directly to the American people about why Obamacare isn\u2019t working -- and remind them why it must eventually be repealed. After all, Obamacare is bad for small business, bad for seniors, and of course, bad for young people -- all subjects covered in detail during Cruz\u2019s marathon speaking event. Remember, Obamacare cannot function without healthy young Americans bearing the preponderance of the costs. Hence why the Obama administration is spending millions of dollars trying to convince young Americans to enroll in the exchanges. But at the same time, Obamacare is also making it more difficult for them to get jobs. This is creating, as Ted Cruz said during his talk-a-thon, another \u201clost generation.\u201d Sad.\n\nRepeal therefore is the ultimate goal -- but that\u2019s probably not possible, at least as Coburn sees it, until we elect a new president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I almost feel sorry for the guy. .05/24/2016 10:57:27AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "I almost feel sorry for the guy.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Coburn: Thanks, Ted Cruz, I Guess I\u2019m a RINO Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2013/09/26/coburn-thanks-ted-cruz-i-guess-im-a-rino-now-n1710310", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/141/2013-05-21T215023Z_1_CBRE94K1OO400_RTROPTP_3_WASHINGTON-SUMMIT.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "I almost feel sorry for the guy.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Coburn: Thanks, Ted Cruz, I Guess I\u2019m a RINO Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2013/09/26/coburn-thanks-ted-cruz-i-guess-im-a-rino-now-n1710310", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/141/2013-05-21T215023Z_1_CBRE94K1OO400_RTROPTP_3_WASHINGTON-SUMMIT.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Coburn: Thanks, Ted Cruz, I Guess I\u2019m a RINO Now, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbe9\"", "article_summary": "And yet because he was leery and ultimately unsupportive of the movement to defund Obamacare, many of his constituents are confused and angry with him.\nSenator Coburn, as he himself said this morning on Morning Joe, received the highest conservative rating in the United States Senate as recently as 2012.\nRepeal therefore is the ultimate goal -- but that\u2019s probably not possible, at least as Coburn sees it, until we elect a new president.\nThis is creating, as Ted Cruz said during his talk-a-thon, another \u201clost generation.\u201d Sad.\nStill, Cruz\u2019s faux-filibuster or speech or whatever the hell you call it did at least some good for the cause, Coburn said."}
