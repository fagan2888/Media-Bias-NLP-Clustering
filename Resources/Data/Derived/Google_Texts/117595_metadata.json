My client had no idea that Medicaid was running a tab; otherwise she would have had the family take turns look after her mother at home.\n\nSue is now stuck with a $43,200 bill, on her mother's estate (house) that Medicaid says must be paid in full. Her mother died at least a year ago.\n\nShe recently received a document from MERP (Medicaid Estate Recovery Program) saying that Medicaid wants the money used for her care back because Sue\u2019s mother owned a house. What is MERP or the Medicaid Estate Recovery Program?\n\nToni, let your readers know that Medicaid is keeping a tab, so be careful when receiving Medicaid help? Especially if you still own your home, like Sue\u2019s mother did, but had no money for \u201cextra\u201d care at home.\n\nThanks, Chuck\n\nHello Chuck:\n\nWhat a great question! After researching what the MERP (Medicaid Estate Recovery Program), I found it to be very eye opening.\n\nWith Healthcare Reform (Obamacare) everyone needs to be aware that nothing comes without a cost! And yes, you can lose your house or any assets when your loved one receives care from the state of Texas\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nThis is a real surprise when a Medicare beneficiary receives Medicaid Long Term Care and later the Medicaid recipient\u2019s estate receives notification from the state of Texas for a \u201cNotice of Intent to File a Claim against the Estate.\n\nI am sure your client was astonished to find out that the state want their $43K back that Texas Medicaid spent for her mother\u2019s care, even though it was at home and not in a nursing home.\n\nMedicaid can recover ANY - and I repeat ANY - medical expenses, not just nursing facility services or home and community based services, but also includes related hospital services, prescription drugs and even Medicare cost sharing expenses which are Medicare premiums (Part A - hospital insurance, Part B \u2013 medical insurance), deductibles and coinsurance amounts.\n\nSome of these services may be part of the $43K your client has to pay back to Medicaid. You asked if the state can take her mother\u2019s house. Yes. All claims against an estate, including MERP claims, must be paid before the property can be distributed as specified in a will. The state does not, however, require an heir to sell the deceased recipient\u2019s homestead (house) if the claim can be paid by other funds. But if not, then you may have to sell the house or the state will file a lien against the house.\n\nThe state does not process its own paperwork and so it has contracted with HMS, the Texas Medicaid Estate Recovery Contractor who handles the complete process. In the letter sent to the recipient\u2019s estate it states the amount received will not exceed the value of the estate\u2019s assets, if any. If there is no money in the estate, then there is nothing to recover.\n\nNow you know how the Medicaid\u2019s Long Term Care services operate. My advice would be to explore all of your options and maybe as a family can work out a schedule to take care of your loved one or ask the church to find a volunteer or two to assist in the process. This way you can protect all that your loved ones have worked, so hard to accumulate.\n\nToni Says\u00ae:\n\nBuy a long term care policy while you are still in decent health.\n\nPut some money away for that rainy day.\n\nSeek the advice of an Elder Care Attorney that can help with proper Medicaid planning.\n\nDo proper planning. No one wants their kids to be their caregiver and take care of their activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, bathroom problems, etc. But we are here to make sure they have the best life they can.\n\nToni King, author of the new Medicare Survival Guide\u00ae, which is a simple guide that puts Medicare in \u201cpeople\u201d terms, is on sale at www.tonisays.com.
