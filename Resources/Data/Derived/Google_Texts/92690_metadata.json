At Motomaki, customers will grab a menu at the door, mark their order, choose a drink, pay at the register and sit down with an order number.\n\nMotomaki will be similar in concept to fast-casual restaurants such as Modmarket, Noodles & Company and Chipotle, Van Grack said, adding that customers will be able to customize their sushi rolls, bowls and Moto Rolls, which he described as \"Japanese burritos.\"\n\nVan Grack and Hapa officials have wanted to branch out with a fast-casual concept, but the timing or locale was not right until now, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"No. 1 was the location,\" he said. \"We've been looking for the right location for a while and I think that the Twenty Ninth Street (space) is a perfect location.\"\n\nMotomaki is operated under the Hapa Franchise Group Inc. umbrella, but Van Grack said that Hapa has no immediate plans to start franchising.\n\nThe success of the Twenty Ninth Street location could help to determine the fate of Motomaki, he said.\n\n\"I think it's too early to tell,\" he said of expansion plans. \"We obviously need to see if our concept is right.\n\n\"We believe very strongly that this concept has the potential to grow; but until you prove the concept, obviously, we won't know.\"\n\nHapa Sushi Grill & Sake Bar has a location in downtown Boulder, at 1117 Pearl St., and three restaurants in the Denver area.\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or wallacea@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25549357/hapa-sushi-nearing-opening-fast-casual-restaurant-motomaki", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace ,  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25549357:view"}, "startDate": "2014-04-13T14:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Hapa Sushi intends to open Motomaki, a new fast-casual sushi restaurant at the Twenty Ninth Street mall, by the early summer, the company's founder said Friday.", "title": "Hapa Sushi to open fast-casual restaurant Motomaki in Boulder", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25549357/hapa-sushi-nearing-opening-fast-casual-restaurant-motomaki", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-04-13T01:00:58-0600", "endDate": "2024-04-11T18:28:25-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Alicia Wallace,", "pubDate": "2014-04-11T18:38:06-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-13T14:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Hapa Sushi to open fast-casual restaurant Motomaki in Boulder", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "description": "Hapa Sushi intends to open Motomaki, a new fast-casual sushi restaurant at the Twenty Ninth Street mall, by the early summer, the company's founder said Friday.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25549357/hapa-sushi-nearing-opening-fast-casual-restaurant-motomaki", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Hapa Sushi intends to open Motomaki, a new fast-casual sushi restaurant at the Twenty Ninth Street mall, by the early summer, the company's founder said Friday.", "title": "Hapa Sushi to open fast-casual restaurant Motomaki in Boulder"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3ad\"", "article_summary": "Twenty Ninth Street seen as 'perfect location'Hapa Sushi intends to open Motomaki, a new fast-casual sushi restaurant at the Twenty Ninth Street mall, by the early summer, the company's founder said Friday.\n1216, a 2,521-square-foot space previously occupied by the San Francisco Soup Co., said Mark Van Grack, Hapa owner.\nHapa Sushi Grill & Sake Bar has a location in downtown Boulder, at 1117 Pearl St., and three restaurants in the Denver area.\nMotomaki is operated under the Hapa Franchise Group Inc. umbrella, but Van Grack said that Hapa has no immediate plans to start franchising.\nThe success of the Twenty Ninth Street location could help to determine the fate of Motomaki, he said."}
