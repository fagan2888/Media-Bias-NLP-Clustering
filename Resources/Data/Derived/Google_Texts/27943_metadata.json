I used an online due-date calculator that puts my delivery around May 31, 2015. Should I believe it? \u2014 Jessica R., Indianapolis\n\nA: First, congratulations, and we hope you enjoy this amazing journey. However, an online calculator isn\u2019t the very best way to figure out your estimated due date.\n\nUpdated guidelines for estimated due dates came out this month from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: They say counting out 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of your last period isn\u2019t accurate enough to allow for optimal prenatal care. That calculation is based on the assumption that every woman has a 28-day cycle and ovulates on day 14. The truth is that around 80 percent of women deliver anywhere between 37 and 42 weeks.\n\nThe new guidelines recommend an ultrasound during your first trimester so the fetus\u2019s precise size and head circumference can be measured. That, taken with the info about your last period, allows a far more accurate estimated due date.\n\nFor example: If you have an ultrasound before you\u2019re 14 weeks along and the fetal size suggests a due date that\u2019s more than seven days different from an estimated due date based only on your menstrual period, the ultrasound due date should be the one that is accepted as accurate. If your pregnancy was from in-vitro fertilization, the latest guidelines state that your estimated due date should be calculated from both the age of the embryo and the date of the transfer.\n\nWhatever your due date is, remember: Get regular prenatal check-ups; take prenatal vitamins; eat a baby-healthy diet (you\u2019re eating for 1.1, not two people); and don\u2019t gain too much weight (25-35 pounds if you started at a healthy weight, 15-25 pounds if you\u2019re overweight, less than 15 pounds if you\u2019re obese).\n\nAnd pick up a copy of our book \u201cYou: Having a Baby.\u201d It\u2019ll help you consider and plan for the many choices you\u2019ll be making \u2014 from food to delivery location. Good luck with your labor of love!\n\nQ: My sister and my brother-in-law often get really angry with each other in front of their two kids, ages 6 and 9. Last time I was around, I had to step in and change the subject so they\u2019d cool down. I can see their arguing bothers the kids \u2014 it bothers me! I\u2019m going to say something, but what? Any advice? \u2014 Susan K., Provo, Utah\n\nA: Oh, yes. Start by telling them that having disagreements in front of the kids is one thing. Disagreements are part of life, and they can teach kids about the importance of critical thinking, the art of compromise and using warmth and humor to solve disputes. That is CONstructive. But having a nasty, angry argument in front of your children is something else. It can be very DEstructive, especially if it happens on a regular basis. It can cause children long-term psychological damage and harm a child\u2019s developing ability to identify and control positive and negative emotions.\n\nHow are children supposed to learn how to deal with tough emotions such as fear and sadness when there\u2019s emotional chaos all around them? Often they don\u2019t; research shows those kids are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression in the future. Violent parental arguments can even be considered emotional child abuse, and emotionally abused children can end up with worse mental health problems than kids who\u2019ve been physically or sexually abused.\n\nSo it may be time for the grown-ups to get counseling, before the children start blaming themselves for their parents\u2019 arguments, which is usually what happens. You can find a nondenominational family counselor at www.theravive.com, or if your sister and her husband belong to a religious organization, you may ask them to start there.\n\nGetting help is tough, but sooner is better than later.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
