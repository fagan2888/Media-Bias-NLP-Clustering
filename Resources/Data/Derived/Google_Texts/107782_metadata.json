Take a look at our map \u2014 and make sure you share it.\n\nEr, Virginia, \u201ccommitted\u201d? Really? Terry McAuliffe may be VA\u2019s new governor-elect, but the governor doesn\u2019t just get to decide whether or not to expand Medicaid all his own, as Politico points out (among other problems with the map):\n\nVirginia is singled out for special treatment, listed as \u201ccommitted\u201d to expanding Medicaid because of the election this week of Democrat Terry McAuliffe as governor. But that comes as news to local Republicans, who insist that expansion is no sure thing in the Old Dominion State, regardless of McAuliffe\u2019s victory. \u201cAs they have been throughout the entire Obamacare implementation process, the White House remains blissfully unaware of reality,\u201d said Matthew Moran, spokesman for Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell. \u201cThe authority to expand Medicaid no longer rests with the governor.\u201d A legislative commission must weigh in.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "[Attempted] public shaming.", "title": "White House to unruly states: You guys should really get on that Medicaid expansion, you know", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/07/white-house-to-unruly-states-you-guys-should-really-get-on-that-medicaid-expansion-you-know/", "image": "http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/getcovered_medicare_map_110713.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-08T01:41:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-08T01:42:22+00:00"}, "keywords": "Medicaid, Obama administration, ObamaCare, U.S. states, Virginia,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2477\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe authority to expand Medicaid no longer rests with the governor.\u201d A legislative commission must weigh in.\n\u201cAs they have been throughout the entire Obamacare implementation process, the White House remains blissfully unaware of reality,\u201d said Matthew Moran, spokesman for Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell.\nBut that comes as news to local Republicans, who insist that expansion is no sure thing in the Old Dominion State, regardless of McAuliffe\u2019s victory.\nTake a look at our map \u2014 and make sure you share it.\nEr, Virginia, \u201ccommitted\u201d?"}
