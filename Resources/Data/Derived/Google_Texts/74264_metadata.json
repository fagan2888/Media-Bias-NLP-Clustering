That\u2019s led some political observers to predict that Obama will be using his veto pen a lot more in his last two years in office than he did in the first six. (The White House already has threatened to veto bills authorizing the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, changing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s definition of a full-time worker, and delaying certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial-reform law.)\n\nA look at recent history indicates that presidents do, in fact, veto more bills when both houses of Congress are controlled by the opposing party. We examined more than four decades of legislative data, courtesy of the Library of Congress\u2019 THOMAS website, and found that when presidents are of one party and Congress is controlled by the other, they vetoed 3.6% of all public bills presented to them, versus just 1% when both House and Senate were controlled by the president\u2019s party. When control of Congress was divided, presidents vetoed 1.9% of the public bills that reached their desks. (Public bills are those of general applicability, and account for the overwhelming number of laws Congress makes.)\n\nThis makes intuitive sense. Presidents have more leverage with Congress to shape legislation to their liking when their party controls one or both chambers, and congressional leaders usually try to avoid showdowns with presidents of their own party. Conversely, a Congress run by the opposition may deliberately seek out confrontation \u2014 sending bills to the White House that are sure to get vetoed so as to sharpen political contrasts with the president.\n\nVetoes come in two varieties. With regular vetoes, the president refuses to sign a bill and instead sends it back to Congress with his written objections; if two-thirds of each chamber vote to re-pass the bill, the veto is overridden and the measure becomes law. \u201cPocket vetoes\u201d occur when Congress has adjourned and can\u2019t officially receive the vetoed measure; in such cases the president can kill the bill by simply doing nothing. (Whether and under what circumstances presidents can pocket-veto bills during mid-session adjournments and recesses has long been a sore spot between the two branches; court rulings have been ambiguous.)\n\nBy our count, presidents have issued 194 regular vetoes and pocket-vetoed another 75 bills between 1973 and 2014. Of these, 140 regular vetoes (72% of the total) and 45 pocket vetoes (60% of the total) occurred when both houses of Congress were controlled by the opposition party \u2014 a total of 18 years out of the total 42-year period studied (that is, 43% of the time.)\n\nBy their nature, pocket vetoes can\u2019t be overridden, since Congress isn\u2019t in place to act. And while Congress can try to override a regular presidential veto, it doesn\u2019t often succeed: Only 31 of the 194 vetoes referred to above (16%) were overridden. Override attempts failed in 74 cases (38%), and in the remaining 89 cases (46%) Congress accepted the vetoes with no attempt to override. Put another way: If the President vetoes a bill it has a better than 8-in-10 chance of staying vetoed.\n\nThe chances of a successful override improve when one or both houses of Congress are controlled by the party in opposition to the president\u2019s. According to our analysis, of the 29 regular vetoes issued when either the House or the Senate (but not both) was run by the opposition, six (20.7%) were overridden. Twenty-three of the 140 vetoes issued when both chambers were controlled by the opposition (16.4%) were overridden. By contrast, only two of the 25 vetoes issued during the dozen years when the same party controlled the House, Senate and the White House were overridden.\n\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s presidency may hold some clues to what lies ahead for Obama. Bush vetoed no bills in his first term and only one (which was sustained) in his second. (Democrats controlled the Senate for most of Bush\u2019s first two years in office; otherwise the GOP dominated Capitol Hill.) In 2006, however, Democrats won control of both the House and Senate. During the subsequent 110th Congress Bush issued 11 vetoes, four of which were overridden.\n\nTo date, Obama has vetoed just two bills \u2014 both, as it happens, during the two years Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. The first, a stopgap budget resolution, was vetoed in December 2009 as \u201cunnecessary\u201d given the subsequent passage of a regular defense-spending bill. The other veto, in October 2010, was of a bill concerning the interstate recognition of notarizations by federal and state judges \u2014 which doesn\u2019t sound like much, except that it came as several major banks were entangled in the \u201crobo-signing\u201d foreclosure scandal. In his disapproval memorandum, Obama said he was concerned about the measure\u2019s \u201cpossible unintended impact\u2026on consumer protections, including those for mortgages.\u201d Both vetoes were sustained.\n\nTopics: Barack Obama, Congress", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "congress,obama,veto", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"site_name": "Pew Research Center", "description": "Some political observers predict that Obama will be using his veto pen a lot more in his last two years in office than he did in the first six.
