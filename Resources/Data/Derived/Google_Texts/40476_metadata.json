In his State of the Union speech, he declared: \u201cInequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by \u2013 let alone get ahead.\u201d I\u2019m thrilled the president is shining a light on inequality. But for environmentalists, the debate over inequality \u2013 not only here in the US, but also the chasm between wealthy and poor countries \u2013 raises serious tensions and forces us to look beyond the mainstream conversations for solutions.\n\nOn the one hand, inequality is a huge problem, with many people prevented from accessing the resources they need for dignified lives. Inequality is inherently unjust, and is the root of an array of environmental, health, and social ills. In Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better , public health scientists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett show that high levels of inequality correlate with a stunning array of ills that reduce quality of life for all of society.\n\nAnd inequality undermines the workings of our democracy, which is a problem since we need a functioning democracy to solve big problems \u2013 like climate change and even inequality itself. Under the post-Citizens United system of campaign finance in the US, inequality is a near-absolute barrier to significant political participation by all but the super rich, making it hard to advance goals on the environment, education, and workers\u2019 rights. Reducing inequality is not a cause environmentalists can afford to watch from the sidelines.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s undeniable that worldwide, and especially in the US, we\u2019re already using too many resources. We have only one planet, but globally humanity is using raw materials and generating waste at a rate that would take 1.5 Earths to sustain.\n\nThe leading solutions put forward to address inequality are \u201cgrowing the pie\u201d and \u201craising the floor.\u201d In other words, increasing economic growth so there\u2019s more stuff to go around and raising low end wages to make it possible for poor people to access the stuff they need. Wages are raised so that people buy more goods; businesses expand to meet the increased demand by hiring more workers; more workers equals more people buying more stuff; and the wheel keeps turning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's time we stop pretending that inequality and environmental decline are two separate problems", "title": "Social inequity vs. the environment is a false choice", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's time we stop pretending that inequality and environmental decline are two separate problems", "title": "Social inequity vs. the environment is a false choice", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/16/social_inequity_vs_the_environment_is_a_false_choice_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/06/climate_change_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's time we stop pretending that inequality and environmental decline are two separate problems", "title": "Social inequity vs. the environment is a false choice", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/06/climate_change_rect.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "ANNIE LEONARD", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Earth Island Journal, Environmentalism, Inequality, sotu", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb049\"", "article_summary": "Inequality is inherently unjust, and is the root of an array of environmental, health, and social ills.\nOn the one hand, inequality is a huge problem, with many people prevented from accessing the resources they need for dignified lives.\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s undeniable that worldwide, and especially in the US, we\u2019re already using too many resources.\nIn his State of the Union speech, he declared: \u201cInequality has deepened.\nWe have only one planet, but globally humanity is using raw materials and generating waste at a rate that would take 1.5 Earths to sustain."}
