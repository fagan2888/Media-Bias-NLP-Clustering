Their use among middle and high school students more than tripled between 2011 and 2013, going from 79,000 to 263,000 students, according to an August study. And on Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report showing that 10 states and the District of Columbia don\u2019t restrict e-cig sales to minors, giving over 16 million children access to the devices and liquid nicotine. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stalled passing any sort of regulations on these products, and it\u2019s because of this that a 1-year-old toddler from upstate New York died last week.\n\nThe toddler, from Fort Plain, N.Y., died last Tuesday after ingesting liquid nicotine. It\u2019s believed he\u2019s the first child in the U.S. to die from the product, which is sold in bottles, separate from the e-cigarette devices. After the child was found unresponsive, he was immediately taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, ABC News reported. Although the nicotine is commonly used for e-cigarettes, Fort Plain police didn\u2019t specify in a statement whether it was associated with the device.\n\nThe child\u2019s death brings to the forefront these regulation issues, which have largely gone under the radar since the FDA first proposed new ones in August. \u201cOne teaspoon of liquid nicotine could be lethal to a child, and smaller amounts can cause severe illness, often requiring trips to the emergency department,\u201d the American Association of Poison Control Centers said in a statement on Friday, according to ABC News. \u201cDespite the dangers these products pose to children, there are currently no standards set in place that require child-proof packaging.\u201d\n\nThe Association also said that rates of nicotine exposure, either through ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through skin had risen since 2011, when there were only 271 exposures. As of Nov. 30, there had already been 3,638 exposures in 2014. \u201cThey\u2019re not that difficult to get into,\u201d Dr. Donna Seger, director of the poison control center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told ABC News. With many of these bottles containing colorful, flavored nicotine, such as chocolate, berry, and cotton candy, it\u2019s no wonder kids see them and think they\u2019re something else. Making the issue worse is that it\u2019s not always clear how concentrated the liquid is with nicotine \u2014 they come in strengths ranging from 6 to 24 milligrams.\n\nNicotine poisoning has been associated with symptoms from nausea and vomiting to more dire conditions, such as a slowed heart rate, low blood pressure, seizures, lethargy, paralysis, and coma. According to ABC News, some states have begun implementing laws requiring child-resistant packaging. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign one of these bills within the next few weeks.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "e, cig, liquid, nicotine, linked, 1, year, olds, death, poison, control, centers, say, fda, should", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After a 1-year-old boy died last week from ingesting e-cigarette liquid nicotine, poison control experts are calling for regulations.", "title": "New York Toddler Dies After Ingesting Liquid Nicotine From E-Cigs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cig-liquid-nicotine-linked-1-year-olds-death-poison-control-centers-say-fda-should-314392", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/15/liquid-nicotine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a 1-year-old boy died last week from ingesting e-cigarette liquid nicotine, poison control experts are calling for regulations.", "title": "New York Toddler Dies After Ingesting Liquid Nicotine From E-Cigs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cig-liquid-nicotine-linked-1-year-olds-death-poison-control-centers-say-fda-should-314392", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/15/liquid-nicotine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/15/liquid-nicotine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-15T12:44:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-15T12:44:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After a 1-year-old boy died last week from ingesting e-cigarette liquid nicotine, poison control experts are calling for regulations."}, "article_summary": "Their use among middle and high school students more than tripled between 2011 and 2013, going from 79,000 to 263,000 students, according to an August study.\nThe toddler, from Fort Plain, N.Y., died last Tuesday after ingesting liquid nicotine.\nAnd on Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report showing that 10 states and the District of Columbia don\u2019t restrict e-cig sales to minors, giving over 16 million children access to the devices and liquid nicotine.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not that difficult to get into,\u201d Dr. Donna Seger, director of the poison control center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told ABC News.\nAfter the child was found unresponsive, he was immediately taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, ABC News reported."}
