Todd Young (left), R-Ind., and Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. (Photo: Provided)\n\nA super PAC created to help Republicans keep control of the Senate is trying to boost Rep. Todd Young\u2019s chances of getting the GOP nomination for Senate.\n\nIn the first advertising the Senate Leadership Fund is doing across the nation, the group praises Young as a \u201ctrue Hoosier conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung has stood up to President Obama and his liberal agenda,\u201d says the ad, which is running for a week in the Indianapolis area.\n\nYoung is competing in the May 3 primary against Rep. Marlin Stutzman.\n\nBoth have conservative voting records. But Stutzman has touted his willingness to stand up to not only Obama, but also to his own party leaders. He was bounced from a lower-level position on the House leadership team in 2003 after he crossed leadership on a procedural vote on an agriculture and nutrition assistance bill. And Stutzman was among 25 House Republicans who did not vote for John Boehner to remain as speaker in January 2015.\n\n\u201cMarlin knows when Republicans bend, America breaks,\u201d says the narrator in one of Stutzman\u2019s ads.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s executive director is Steven Law, former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Law is also the president of One Nation, a group that spent $250,000 on television ads praising Young\u2019s record on national security.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund is spending $200,000 on the television ads praising Young, and another $30,000 on digital ads targeting likely GOP primary voters, according to the group\u2019s spokesman.\n\nThe ad touts several aspects of Young\u2019s conservative record, without mentioning Stutzman and the fact he has a similar record. For example, both have top ratings from the National Rifle Association and the National Right to Life Committee, and both have voted to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe ad also says Young has fought Obama\u2019s \u201cillegal amnesty.\u201d\n\nWhile Young voted to bar the administration from spending money to carry out Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, he supported the underlying bill funding the Department of Homeland Security after the immigration defunding language was blocked in the Senate. Young said he wasn\u2019t willing to risk shutting down the department \u201cto make a political point about a distinctly different issue.\u201d\n\nStutzman has highlighted that vote as a key difference between the two. He has said in fundraising appeals that the establishment opposes him because \u201cthey know they can count on Todd Young to vote for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\u201d\n\nStutzman has been endorsed by the political arms of the tea party group FreedomWorks and the conservative Club for Growth and by the Senate Conservatives Fund. But those groups have yet to run ads on his behalf.\n\nYoung is viewed by some as the stronger general election candidate, one reason the Indiana Chamber of Commerce joined the national organization in endorsing Young last week. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending $1 million on ads to help Young.\n\nContact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com or @mgroppe on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1MQyiRY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The ads praising Young are the first foray by the Senate Leadership Fund in primary races around the country.", "og": {"site_name": "Indianapolis Star", "description": "The ads praising Young are the first foray by the Senate Leadership Fund in primary races around the country.", "title": "GOP establishment group running ads to boost Young", "url": "http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/behind-closed-doors/2016/04/05/gop-establishment-group-running-ads-boost-young/82655544/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/indystar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ads praising Young are the first foray by the Senate Leadership Fund in primary races around the country.", "title": "GOP establishment group running ads to boost Young", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc3afdf5fa5dc7f83dd93fbfc29e02a0eb1bef0a/c=43-0-523-480&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/01/INGroup/Indianapolis/635951303945824178-Young-Stutzman.jpg", "creator": "@indystar", "site": "@indystar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=559965350", "fb": {"app_id": 108716282521686}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Marlin Stutzman", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Marlin Stutzman", "title": "GOP establishment group running ads to boost Young", "author": "Maureen Groppe", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/behind-closed-doors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3c86d86fb254391e48c38303b0d159fe1070407e/c=144-0-504-480/local/-/media/2016/04/01/INGroup/Indianapolis/635951303945824178-Young-Stutzman.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc9c98ff85704880aff4877df477ffd221478ed5/c=43-0-523-480/local/-/media/2016/04/01/INGroup/Indianapolis/635951303945824178-Young-Stutzman.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/940b4fd3d2aace9e56993f726788501107d3cebc/c=0-0-599-450/local/-/media/2016/04/01/INGroup/Indianapolis/635951303945824178-Young-Stutzman.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9fef87ad2069afeb2b617ff35ab7757a843ed197/c=0-10-599-348&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/01/INGroup/Indianapolis/635951303945824178-Young-Stutzman.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-05T14:29:12.083000-04:00", "shorthed": "Another group running ads for Young", "articleid": 82655544, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c28d6ace664a6f646ac1d247fd1148e5f3c74eb/c=0-10-599-348/local/-/media/2016/04/01/INGroup/Indianapolis/635951303945824178-Young-Stutzman.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8e9cb4f4a1778145f924d3f4bbfcd9a80854131/c=18-0-287-480/local/-/media/2016/04/01/INGroup/Indianapolis/635951303945824178-Young-Stutzman.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Rep.
