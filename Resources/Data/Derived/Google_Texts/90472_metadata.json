But the proposal vowed victory without an \u201cenduring combat\u201d role for the U.S. \u2013 and a three-year limit on military action before the next president would have to seek additional authority.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough briefed lawmakers on the proposal\u2019s broad outlines Tuesday \u2013 the same day Obama confirmed the death of Kayla Jean Mueller, a 26-year-old U.S. aid worker who spent more than a year in ISIS captivity.\n\nRelated: War Powers for Obama: How Far Should a President Go?\n\nSix months after President Obama announced the U.S. had begun airstrikes against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria and would recruit and train moderate Syrian rebels in the effort, the administration and Congress are finally hashing out specific tactics and goals.\n\nPresident Obama at one time insisted he had adequate congressional authority dating back to the early days of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. But he changed his mind after Republicans took control of Congress in the midterm elections.\n\nObama is clearly walking a tightrope in trying to reassure Democrats and some Republicans that he would not begin another endless conflict in the Middle East like the decade-long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He\u2019s also trying to placate conservative Republicans, including Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who advocate all-out war against ISIS and fear Congress might end up hamstringing the commander-in-chief.\n\nWhile the new war powers language is still sketchy, the proposed authorization seems built on three pillars.\n\nA finite timetable before serious reconsideration and reauthorization of the strategy.\n\nA somewhat more permissive deployment of U.S. ground troops and Special Forces in war zones than Obama\u2019s original \u201cno U.S. boots on the ground\u201d dictum.\n\nThe authority to pursue ISIS and other terror groups beyond the current boundaries of Iraq and Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: McCain: Give Obama More War Powers Against ISIS\n\nSen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) told reporters Obama would seek authorization for the use of force that would expire after three years. It would end the approval for operations in Iraq that Congress passed in 2002. Several other lawmakers said the authority Obama seeks would be targeted exclusively against the fighters seeking establishment of an Islamic state \u2013 wherever they are and whatever name they use.\n\nIn some ways, this last tenet \u2013 essentially allowing the U.S. military and Arab and European allies to hunt ISIS forces or other terrorists groups beyond Iraq and Syria \u2013 suggests a lot more flexibility in Obama\u2019s mandate than some had assumed.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker (R-TN) said in an interview yesterday that President Obama \u201cabsolutely\u201d needs flexibility in targeting ISIS, given the terrorists\u2019 reach into other parts of the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.\n\n\u201cI know at the beginning people were talking about [just focusing on ISIS] in Iraq and Syria, but they\u2019re in eight countries today,\u201d Corker said. \u201cIf the authorization was geography specific, what you would be saying to ISIS is, \u2018If you\u2019re not in these places, you\u2019re safe.\u2019 It has to be very flexible relative to geography.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Far Will GOP Presidential Hopefuls Go to Destroy ISIS?\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), former chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while the White House has outlined the limits on the use of ground troops, \u201cI think the big discussion will be over how you work the language on troops.\u201d Would an aggressive combat effort to weed out the terrorists be permitted, in other words, or would troop activity be confined to protecting other military personnel or U.S. interests?\n\n\u201cThe president should have the ability to use Special Operations, knowing a little about ISIS and their barbarity,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cAs I understand it, the authority doesn\u2019t prevent the use of special operations.\u201d\n\nThe debate over deploying ground troops will be difficult, with many Democrats including Menendez and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) opposed to the use of U.S. ground forces. McCain and other Republicans want to keep the door open on that possibility.\n\nOther Democrats say they\u2019re troubled by the vagueness of Obama\u2019s proposed language, especially his vow to avoid trapping the country in another \u201cenduring combat.\u201d\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) said she has significant questions about the proposal. She said she didn\u2019t know what was meant by the word \u201cenduring\u201d in this context. \u201cI am very apprehensive about a vague, foggy word,\u201d she told the Associated Press.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Muted Response to the ISIS and Ukraine Crises\n\nSome GOP leaders praised Obama for submitting specific proposed language that can be a starting point for lengthy hearings and then a markup of a bill.\n\n\u201cNone of us have seen the exact language, but I think there is a bipartisan desire to work with the president to have this as a collaborative decision of both the executive branch and Congress,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate GOP whip. \u201cFor the American fighting forces in harm\u2019s way, they deserve to know the American people are behind them and that Congress supports what we are asking them to do.\u201d\n\nGraham, who may seek the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, said administration officials had told him the authorization would not provide protection of U.S.-trained Syrian rebel troops on the ground if there were an air attack by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a strategy or authorization that will allow us to protect the people we train to go fight ISIL on the ground from an Assad attack, then it won\u2019t work,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an unsound military strategy. I think it\u2019s immoral that the authorization doesn\u2019t allow for us to counter Assad\u2019s air power.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House on Tuesday began circulating its draft proposal for new war powers to", "title": "Obama Vows No \u2018Enduring Combat\u2019 for U.S. Against ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/11/Obama-Vows-No-Enduring-Combat-US-Against-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama-hagel_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/11/Obama-Vows-No-Enduring-Combat-US-Against-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama-hagel_2.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The White House on Tuesday began circulating its draft proposal for new war powers to", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0893\"", "article_summary": "President Obama at one time insisted he had adequate congressional authority dating back to the early days of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThe White House on Tuesday began circulating its draft proposal for new war powers to combat ISIS terrorists in the years ahead.\nRelated: McCain: Give Obama More War Powers Against ISISSen.
