Lying politicians are not a new phenomenon.

As Will Rogers once said, "If you ever injected truth into politics, you'd have no politics."

But America's contemporary politicians have grown all too comfortable with lying and prevaricating. It's the new normal and it's destroying what is left of the public's already tenuous trust in our government and the politicians who lead it. According to a just-released Pew study, only 19 percent of Americans say they trust government to do the right thing, down from 73 percent when the same question was asked in 1958. Meanwhile, only 22 percent believe that most elected officials put the interests of the country ahead of their own interests.

As the 2016 campaign season heats up, here are just a few of the most damning and damaging falsehoods and untruths we've been hearing from politicians on both sides.
