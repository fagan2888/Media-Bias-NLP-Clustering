Elijah E. Cummings is in South Africa for Nelson Mandela's memorial, but that doesn't mean he's abandoned domestic policy. In fact, Cummings said he and other Democrats in the official delegation have used the trip to debate with Sen. Ted Cruz on Obamacare.\n\n\"He got an earful from many of us -- I mean it was a very good conversation, nothing negative,\" the Baltimore Democrat said in an interview from Johannesburg. \"I just reminded him that I'm concerned about the many people in my state and his state who have no health insurance.\"\n\nCruz -- a Texas Republican best known for his filibuster-like speech ahead of this year's government shutdown -- and Cummings are among about two dozens U.S. lawmakers in an official delegation paying tribute to Mandela.

John Lewis of Georgia and others also spoke with Cruz in what he described as a cordial debate. \"I know he got an earful for 20 hours out and he's going to get another earful for 20 hours on the way back.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-baltimoresun", "description": "Rep.
