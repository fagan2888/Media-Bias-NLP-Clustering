The reporter was seeking a response to the U.S. State Department's critique of the Uzbek human rights record. Karimov ignored the query and Kerry began responding, but the reporter was pushed out of the room before she finished what she was saying. International human rights bodies list Karimov's government as among the world's most repressive. But such issues are not likely to dominate Kerry's agenda. He is on a tour of central Asia and is seeking to persuade governments that Washington's interest in the region, which lies to the north of Afghanistan, is not waning. That message has taken on greater importance as Washington draws down its forces in Afghanistan, concerns mount about the threat to the region from Islamic State, and Russia, fresh from forays into Ukraine and Syria, reasserts its influence. It was Kerry's first meeting as secretary of state with Karimov, who has ruled mostly Muslim Uzbekistan for a quarter of a century since shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "video", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~50X50/0/f/~image_jpeg~9999-1/1/m/v/8/v/a/pejv/reuters04?videoId=113180900", "sailthru.author": "Thomson Reuters", "description": "An American reporter is escorted out of the room where U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was meeting Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov, after she asks a question about the U.S. State Department's critique of the Uzbek human rights record....", "title": "U.S. reporter removed from room during Kerry's Uzbekistan meeting", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "An American reporter is escorted out of the room where U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was meeting Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov, after she asks a question about the U.S. State Department's critique of the Uzbek human rights record....", "title": "U.S. reporter removed from room during Kerry's Uzbekistan meeting", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~1200/0/f/~image_jpeg~9999-1/1/m/v/8/v/a/pejv/reuters04?videoId=113180900", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/video/2015/11/01/us-reporter-removed-from-room-during-ker?videoId=366154657&videoChannel=13421", "video": {"width": 973, "identifier": "http://www.reuters.com/video/2015/11/01/us-reporter-removed-from-room-during-ker?videoId=366154657&videoChannel=13421", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 549}, "article": {"section": "Video - Video", "tag": "politics immigration,news world, video", "published_time": "2015-11-01", "modified_time": "2015-11-01", "author": "Thomson Reuters"}, "type": "video.other"}, "sailthru.description": "An American reporter is escorted out of the room where U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was meeting Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov, after she asks a question about the U.S. State Department's critique of the Uzbek human rights record....", "twitter": {"image": "http://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~1200/0/f/~image_jpeg~9999-1/1/m/v/8/v/a/pejv/reuters04?videoId=113180900", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "U.S. reporter removed from room during Kerry's Uzbekistan meeting"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-01", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "sailthru.title": "U.S. reporter removed from room during Kerry's Uzbekistan meeting", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/home", "sailthru.tags": "politics immigration,news world, video", "WT.cg_n": "Video", "DCSext.rChannel": "Video - Video Page", "WT.cg_s": "Individual Video", "keywords": "politics immigration,news world, video", "DCSext.ContentType": "Video", "sailthru.image.full": "http://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~1200/0/f/~image_jpeg~9999-1/1/m/v/8/v/a/pejv/reuters04?videoId=113180900", "viewport": "width=device-width, shrink-to-fit=no, user-scalable=no", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS"}, "article_summary": "ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: An American reporter was escorted out of the room where U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was meeting Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov in the \"Silk Road\" city of Samarkand on Sunday (November 1).\nIt was Kerry's first meeting as secretary of state with Karimov, who has ruled mostly Muslim Uzbekistan for a quarter of a century since shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe reporter was seeking a response to the U.S. State Department's critique of the Uzbek human rights record.\nKarimov ignored the query and Kerry began responding, but the reporter was pushed out of the room before she finished what she was saying.\nBut such issues are not likely to dominate Kerry's agenda."}
