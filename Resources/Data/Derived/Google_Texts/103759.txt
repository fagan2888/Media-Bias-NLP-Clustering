After a dramatic, hostile and nearly violent week of UFC 178 PR duties, Daniel Cormier admits it hasn’t exactly been one of the his finest moments.

He said that goes both for him and the man on the other side of the feud, UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones.

There was Monday’s brawl in Las Vegas, the subsequent apology tour on ESPN, and eventually the “leaked” footage of the off-air exchange between the two fighters.

It’s undoubtedly built interest in the upcoming title fight, but Cormier admitted on Friday’s edition of “Inside MMA” that perhaps it’s gone a bit too far.

“You’ve got two of the best fighters in the world fighting for a championship,” he said (check out the full interview above). “I think we need to focus more on that than all the stuff that’s happened outside of the cage. The stuff that’s happened outside of the cage isn’t good. It’s not a proud moment for me, and it’s not a proud moment for Jon.

“So we have to carry ourselves better and show people why they’re really tuning into the fight.”

The heavily anticipated bout takes place Sept. 27 at UFC 178, which is slated for MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Jones (20-1 MMA, 14-1 UFC) and Cormier (15-0 MMA, 4-0 UFC) headline the pay-per-view card, which is shaping up to be onet of the year’s best lineups.
