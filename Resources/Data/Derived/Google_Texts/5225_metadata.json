Secular progressives\u2019 words and actions rarely align. This is because the pseudo-utopian, wholly dystopian perch from which they view the world is so detached from reality that, from a cultural and public policy standpoint, they must disguise their intended actions in flowery and euphemistic language, or face near universal rejection.\n\nWhen they don\u2019t like the terms, liberals redefine the terms to mean something they do not, never have, and never can mean. Consider, for instance, the once meaningful words \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201cequality.\u201d\n\nOther \u201cprogressive\u201d doublespeak includes words like \u201cinvest\u201d (meaning socialist redistribution of wealth), \u201ctolerance\u201d (meaning embrace immorality or face total ruin), \u201cdiversity\u201d (meaning Christians and conservatives need not apply), \u201chate\u201d (meaning truth), or \u201cThe Affordable Care Act\u201d (meaning unaffordable, unsustainable, and utterly inferior socialized medicine).\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nEven so, it\u2019s during those rare moments of candor that our cultural Marxist friends\u2019 rhetoric actually aligns with their intended actions. In other words, every so often, and usually by accident, they tell the truth.\n\nTake this recent declaration by President Obama at Georgetown University. He was discussing his contempt for conservative new media in general and Fox News in particular:\n\n\u201c[W]e\u2019re going to have to change how our body politic thinks, which means we\u2019re going to have to change how the media reports on these issues,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nHow Kim Jong-un of him. In sum: Goal 1) Control thought by, Goal 2) Controlling the media.\n\nThis is an idea older than \u2013 and as well preserved as \u2013 Vladimir Lenin himself. How Dear Leader intends to reconcile his scheme to \u201cchange how the media reports on these issues\u201d with the First Amendment\u2019s Free Press Clause, namely, \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom \u2026 of the press,\u201d is abundantly clear.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t.\n\nOur emperor-in-chief will force-feed his once-free subjects yet another unconstitutional executive decree \u2013 a Net Neutrality sandwich with a side of Fairness Doctrine.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nOr take would-be President Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments last month on the \u201crite\u201d of abortion vs. the right of religious freedom.\n\nReports LifeNews:\n\nThe comment has Hillary Clinton essentially saying that Christians must be forced to change their religious views to accommodate abortions. \u201cFar too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth. All the laws we\u2019ve passed don\u2019t count for much if they\u2019re not enforced,\u201d Clinton said, using the euphemism for abortion. \u201cRights have to exist in practice \u2013 not just on paper,\u201d Clinton argued. \u201cLaws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of \u201chave tos.\u201d See the pattern here? Whether it\u2019s Obama saying government will \u201chave to change how the media reports,\u201d or Hillary saying \u201cdeep-seated religious beliefs have to be changed,\u201d such despotic demands should spike the neck hair of every freedom-loving American.\n\nAnd then there are those left-wing extremists whose designs on despotism require that Christians \u201cmust be made\u201d to obey. Homosexual practitioner and New York Times columnist Frank Bruni is one such extremist. In his April 3 column titled, \u201cBigotry: The Bible and the Lessons of Indiana,\u201d Bruni quotes homosexual militant Mitchell Gold, a prominent anti-Christian activist: \u201cGold told me that church leaders must be made \u2018to take homosexuality off the sin list,\u2019\u201d he writes. \u201cHis commandment is worthy \u2013 and warranted,\u201d he adds.\n\nOf course, if homosexual behavior, something denounced as both \u201cvile affections\u201d and \u201can abomination\u201d throughout both the Old and New Testaments, is no longer sexual sin, then there can be no sexual sin whatsoever. To coerce, through the power of the police state, faithful Christians to abandon the millennia-old biblical sexual ethic and embrace the sin of Sodom would likewise require that Christians sign-off on fornication, adultery, incest, and bestiality. Such is the unnatural nature of government-mandated moral relativism.\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t free speech, it\u2019s hate speech!\u201d come the mournful cries of the ill-informed and the ill-prepared, desperately afraid to debate the issues on the merits. \u201cHate speech is excluded from protection,\u201d opines CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in a recent tweet on the topic. \u201cBut there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment,\u201d replies UCLA law professor Eugene Volohk in a Washington Post op-ed. \u201cHateful ideas (whatever exactly that might mean) are just as protected under the First Amendment as other ideas.\u201d\n\nOf course this matters not to those to whom the First Amendment is meaningless.\n\nIndeed, one man\u2019s \u201chate speech\u201d is another man\u2019s truth; and as I\u2019ve often said, truth is hate to those who hate truth.\n\nAnd boy do they hate it.\n\nAnd so they mean to muzzle it.\n\nThe time of which many of us have long warned is no longer on the horizon. The left\u2019s full-on assault against freedom, most especially religious freedom, is at hand. Oddly, or maybe not so oddly, it\u2019s at once the secular left and orthodox Muslims who lead the charge. These strange bedfellows share a common enemy. He is Truth in the person of Jesus Christ. In order to silence Him, they must silence His faithful followers.\n\nWhich brings us to this modern age of American lawlessness. We\u2019re fast moving from a soft tyranny to hard tyranny, and \u201cprogressive\u201d leaders like those mentioned above are, chillingly enough, emboldened to the degree that they will openly call for it.\n\nLike our brothers and sisters around the world, American Christians must prepare for suffering.\n\nBut, like them, we mustn\u2019t despair.\n\nFor there are different kinds of suffering.\n\nSuffering through cancer, for instance, can, and often does, lead to death. Without Christ, who is mankind\u2019s only hope, such suffering is hopeless indeed.\n\nYet when a young mother suffers through child birth, and while she may experience the same level of pain as the cancer sufferer, her crying out elicits an entirely different response\u2013and her pain serves an entirely different purpose. While one type of suffering leads to death, the other leads to life. While one attends sorrow, the other attends joy.\n\nSimilarly, there is a kind of suffering, suffering in sin, which leads to spiritual death, and a kind suffering, suffering in grace, which leads to spiritual life. Anti-Christian persecution, be it efforts to force Christians into disobedience to God, attempts to silence them outright or, worse, the torture, enslavement, and even execution of Christ followers \u2013 now widespread in both Muslim and Marxist nations across the globe \u2013 signifies \u201cthe beginning of birth pains\u201d (see Matthew 24:8).\n\nAnd birth pains lead to new life.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But, we mustn't despair.", "author": "Matt Barber", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "But, we mustn't despair.", "title": "A Warning To American Christians: You \u2018Must Be Made\u2019 To Obey", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WCJ-images-Obama-Iran.jpg", "height": 422}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/a-warning-to-american-christians-you-must-be-made-to-obey/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But, we mustn't despair.", "title": "A Warning To American Christians: You \u2018Must Be Made\u2019 To Obey", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WCJ-images-Obama-Iran.jpg", "creator": "@jmattbarber", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-18T16:41:01-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Culture", "tag": "Marriage", "published_time": "2015-05-18T16:41:01-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "abortion, barack obama, hillary clinton, marriage, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Similarly, there is a kind of suffering, suffering in sin, which leads to spiritual death, and a kind suffering, suffering in grace, which leads to spiritual life.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowWhile actions speak louder than words, words often predict future actions.\nIndeed, one man\u2019s \u201chate speech\u201d is another man\u2019s truth; and as I\u2019ve often said, truth is hate to those who hate truth.\nLike our brothers and sisters around the world, American Christians must prepare for suffering.\n\u201cHate speech is excluded from protection,\u201d opines CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in a recent tweet on the topic."}
