And the deluge is expected to continue, from the first quarter of 2015 through the foreseeable future.\n\nThese initial audits will be conducted during the same time period as Health Effectiveness Data & Information Set (HEDIS) and other plan audits. Now is the time for hospital audit teams to ready their troops for the impending maelstrom.\n\nKnowledge is Power\n\nIt is essential that both parties\u2014payers and providers\u2014understand the types of audits payers are conducting, and the reasons behind them. Often, health plan audits parallel internal and external audits already being conducted by the provider; prior knowledge of this is essential to minimizing redundancies. To that end, providers should educate staff on these six most common health plan audits and their respective timeframes.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nRisk Adjustment and Medical Record Reviews (MRRs): Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and Commercial Audits\u20141Q 2015 through 4Q 2015\n\nHealth plans and payers conduct these audits to ensure medical record documentation validates claims data received, and to determine if other chronic conditions exist that may not have been submitted with the claim. The onus is on plans to prove that their patients have the risks, complications and comorbidities stated in the claims. If proven, Medicare helps subsidize the plans. Risk Adjustment audits are similar to the quality improvement audits conducted by providers and, as such, are important to providers and payers alike.\n\nMedicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV)\u2014Annual 2015 (at CMS\u2019s discretion)\n\nCMS may require health plans to perform RADV audits at any time. In an RADV audit, the health plan has just 45 days to send CMS \u201cone best medical record\u201d that substantiates all submitted reporting.\n\nHealth Effectiveness Data & Information Set (HEDIS) Reviews\u20141Q through 2Q 2015\n\nHEDIS audits review a subsection of the health plan group with a focus on specific measures, such as diabetes monitoring. The information is reported to the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) where a quality report card by health plan is then generated. Additionally, CMS uses HEDIS data to rank health plan performance for the Medicare Advantage health plans; CMS can penalize payers for decreasing quality scores. Providers also benefit from HEDIS performance rankings, because they can be used to gauge the quality of health plans during contract negotiations and as part of accountable care organization (ACO) arrangements. Like the risk adjustment audits mentioned above, HEDIS audits can benefit both sides.\n\nDiagnosis Related Group (DRG) Payment Integrity Reviews\u2014Ongoing through Year\n\nDRG audits check to make sure cases are properly coded and sequenced, and that billed information matches the patient record. It is essentially a comprehensive review of hospital claims that have been submitted to health plans for payment. With ICD-10 looming, look for the number of DRG audits to increase, in lockstep with a steepening learning curve for clinical coders.\n\nCare and Quality Improvement Audits\u2014Ongoing through Year\n\nLike providers, health plans have certain diseases and patient populations that are known high-risk targets. The goal of care and quality improvement audits for both health plans and health providers is to use findings from case review to enroll members into preventative care programs before their conditions progress and hospital admission is required. Both provider and payer are often looking at the same cases during these reviews. Collaboration here would lead to better patient care and reduced healthcare costs.\n\nFive-Star Program (Medicare Advantage)\u2014Ongoing through Year\n\nThe Five-Star Program provides CMS and NCQA with the means to measure the quality of health plans throughout the year. Those that demonstrate continuous improvement in patient experience, reduction in patient complaints, and sustained achievement of quality measures receive a better performance score. Year-over-year results can be used by providers during managed care contract negotiations.\n\nFour Steps to Consider\n\nThis increase in health plan audits underscores the increasingly pressing need for hospitals to centralize all audit management functions. Beyond centralization of audits, streamlining communications with payers, educating audit management teams, and successfully tracking all audit data are important keys to preparing for the year ahead.\n\nCentralization encourages collaboration among team members, while simultaneously leaning processes to save staff time, dollars, resources and streamline denial processing.\n\nFocusing on better communication between providers and payers also trims costs while helping to mitigate the adversarial impact and stress related to commercial audits.\n\nEducation between payer and provider audit teams is essential as both sides attempt to understand requests, process records and meet deadlines.\n\nData analysis of all records sent to plans during audits is essential; the more data gleaned, the greater the support for business intelligence (BI).\n\nRegardless of which health plan auditor sends a record request, providers should capture robust demographic data about each case reviewed. Details should be assimilated into audit intelligence and overall trend results used to steer process improvement efforts, mitigate future revenue risk, and inform managed care contracting. The most important data elements to be captured, tracked and monitored during audits are listed in Table 1. Plans are basing your next contracts on audit cases.
