INDIANAPOLIS -- Another local name may be joining the mayoral race for Indianapolis.

The Rev. Charles Harrison has about a week to decide whether he’ll run for mayor for Election Day on Nov. 3.

Harrison’s supporters filed enough signatures to put the founder of Ten Point Coalition on the ballot. However, Harrison must declare his candidacy by July 15 as an independent.

If he does decide to run, Harrison would face Democratic nominee Joe Hogsett and Republican nominee Chuck Brewer in November.

Harrison said both are good candidates but he wants to make sure the right issues are being addressed.
