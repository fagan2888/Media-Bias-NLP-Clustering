The world is still fighting racism the same way it always has, but under Nelson Mandela things improved, and we were inspired to see change.\n\nPhoto from facebook.com\n\n(CLEVELAND) - Nelson Mandela's name will live through history as one of the world's greatest leaders. He rose to power when he was most needed by a population forced to live as a second-class people. Indeed, he taught us many lessons about life and death and the need to remain strong when faced with an inflexible system created by human beings who truly viewed their existence as more important, more valuable. There truly is not enough space to list the accomplishments of this iconic man who gave people hope and liberty. His legend and sacrifice will endure, while systems like apartheid in the end will crumble. The world is still fighting racism the same way it always has, but under Nelson Mandela things improved, and we were inspired to see change. His legacy must continue to form and shape the thinking in this world, where groups are so often branded as \"terrorists\" simply because they resists a system of dominant racism. Mandela refused to lay down arms and because of this the people of South Africa achieved an impossible dream. - Tim King \u201c Nelson Mandela \u201cGreatness Doesn\u2019t Go On Sale!\u201d Icon! \u201cMany are called but few are chosen\u201d an Icon by name,\n\nIcon is fleeting because it is used so freely as in sports games,\n\nLeaders are cultivated and nourished deep, deep in the valley,\n\nA Chef becomes world renowned w/o struggling in the galley?\n\n\n\nThe world recounts his life and times as an Opera at the Met,\n\nThis is a production that\u2019s years in the making lest any forget,\n\n2 life times to accomplish a mission not by a roll of the dice,\n\nAs Moses spent 40 years in the wilderness and he did it twice.\n\n\n\n\u201cMandela stood up against a great injustice, paying a huge price,\u201d\n\nRick Santorum, but he says the answer wasn\u2019t necessarily right,\n\nWhen an Iconic leader passes upon their death Idiots will arise,\n\nEquating Obamacare a similar struggle controlling peoples lives.\n\n\n\nRacism President Mandela fought against cannot be compared,\n\nTo injustice in America where Germany & Russia might be fair,\n\nAdolph Hitler, Valdimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, oh yeah Idi Amin,\n\nTaking an unjust extended prison term for Nelson\u2019s fame to begin.\n\n\n\nRolihlahla Mandela, Mveao, Union of South Africa, 18th of July,\n\n1994-1999 President of South Africa, 12/5/15 @95, he would die,\n\nMany express remorse & sadness at his passing, question is why?\n\nHe dismantled the legacy of Apartheid setting his standards high.\n\n\n\nTaking on institutionalized racism, poverty, inequality and the like,\n\n1st by a fully representative election to hold office in what was right,\n\nServed as ANC President 1991-1997, Secretary General 1998-1999,\n\nHe has accomplished more in 95 years than billions in their lifetime.\n\n\n\nThere is not enough room or time to list his accomplishments here,\n\nHowever, they must be many because the world holds him so dear,\n\nFor 1 man to garner such global affection from nations free and not,\n\nCan only recall the passing of, \u201cLady Di\u201d when time seemed too stop.\n\n\n\nSadness? Certainly not, thanks to the legacy few have ever seen before,\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln can lay claim to walking through that door,\n\nI\u2019d say no need not take off your shoes let alone count the second hand,\n\nIn the modern world could we name more who have taken such a stand?\n\n\n\nNo! The world should not mourn we should gather together and rejoice,\n\n\u201cGive me liberity or give me death\u201d like Patrick Henry made the choice,\n\nAbraham waited 25 years for the promise, Nelson spent 27 years in jail,\n\nIcons are Icons because they endure, \u201cGreatness Doesn\u2019t Go On Sale!\u201d\n\n\n\nBy Luke Easter\n\n\n\nBy Luke Easter \u201d _____________________________________________ Luke Easter is a poet who writes about things that are very close to the heart of Salem-News.com. Another former U.S. Marine, Luke heals the world with an approach that reaches people on a different level, one known for centuries, yet too often forgotten in the one we live in. We live in a world of social & economic injustice. The main reason for founding America in the first place was to relieve the oppression of the King of England. Patrick Henry said it best, \u201cgive me liberty or give me death.\u201d And yet, all too often death seems to be the only way out. Why is there such a high suicide rate especially among teens, in the land of the free & the home of the brave? What makes headlines? Good news? Ha! More depressing stories than anything else. I feel poetry takes an edge off the hurt of bad news while still delivering it but in a, \u201cglitzy\u201d sort of way. Giving a different perspective. Kind of like slap in the face as opposed to a knife in the back. At least with the slap you\u2019ll live to see another day and you will know whom it\u2019s from. I wasn\u2019t here for the beginning of the world but at 59, I just might be here for the end. Even though it\u2019s still a knife, rhyme poetry helps to dull the blade. And that\u2019s my job.
