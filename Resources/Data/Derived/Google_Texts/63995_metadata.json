Can Hillary Clinton ignite a similar passion? Yes, Clinton has a long history of supporting issues that matter to African Americans, but a younger generation of black activists are much more confrontational in demanding her commitment.\n\n\n\nIn our Meet the Candidates series, we asked the leading candidates of both parties about their policy proposals on issues that are important to our community. Previously we examined Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Now we take a look at Clinton.\n\n\n\nRaising Incomes\n\n\n\nWith the recession now in the rearview mirror, black people want to be part of the nation\u2019s economic recovery. Hillary Clinton proposes a menu of solutions to raise incomes for struggling families. They range from tax cuts for child care to encouraging corporations to share their rising profits with workers.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with The Root, Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser, Maya Harris, underscored the candidate\u2019s plan to \u201cunleash small-business growth.\u201d Harris says black women, who represent the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs, would benefit.\n\n\n\nClinton, who wants to be \u201ca small-business president,\u201d is calling for an expansion of capital and markets, as well as tax relief and simplification for small-business owners.\n\n\n\nFor those on the bottom rung of the income ladder, Clinton declares that they are long overdue for a raise. Clinton supports the Fight for 15 campaign, but unlike some Democrats, she would cap the federal minimum wage at $12 an hour and leave it to local lawmakers to decide if their economy could support anything higher.\n\n\n\nCollege Affordability\n\n\n\nObtaining a higher education has long been the pathway from poverty to the middle class. But a college education doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, black families have taken on more student-loan debt than white families, according to the Urban Institute. In 2013, the think tank says, 42 percent of blacks had student-loan debt, compared with 28 percent of whites.\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of Clinton\u2019s higher education proposal is her College Compact. Her goal is to create a system in which students do not have to borrow money for tuition, books and fees to attend a four-year public college in their state. She also proposes free tuition at community colleges. Her plan would address current and future college debt, as well as focus specifically on historically black colleges.\n\n\n\nStudents would work 10 hours per week as part of their family\u2019s \u201caffordable and realistic contribution.\u201d At the same time, Clinton would create a federal-state partnership and require more school accountability. The price tag is an estimated $350 billion over 10 years.\n\n\n\nHealth Care\n\n\n\nHeath care remains a hot button issue in the election, despite President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to reform the system. African Americans have been among the most ardent supporters of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Yet they are less likely to benefit from it than other racial groups.\n\n\n\nThe Hill explains that blacks live disproportionately under Republican-dominated state legislatures, which refuse to adopt Affordable Care Act rules that allow more low-income families to qualify for Medicaid. Consequently, roughly 1.4 million black people earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private coverage.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic front-runner, a longtime champion of health care reform, plans to fix the \u201cglitches\u201d in Obamacare. She wants to build on what Obama has accomplished. Clinton\u2019s focus would include lowering out-of-pocket costs and trying to prevent excessive premium increases, while lowering health care spending.\n\n\n\nGun Control\n\n\n\nAnother recurring issue is gun control, which painfully struck home when a white supremacist gunned down nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.\n\n\n\nAfrican Americans have long supported gun control legislation\u2014and they still do\u2014even as some research observes a shift in the opposite direction.Clinton touts her record of battling the gun lobby as New York\u2019s senator. If elected president, she promises to continue those efforts, which include closing the so-called Charleston loophole that allowed Dylann Roof, the man charged with the church massacre, to purchase a firearm despite his pending felony charge for drug possession.\n\n\n\nCriminal-Justice Reform\n\n\n\nAnother thorny issue is criminal-justice reform. Many African-American families are quite familiar with the problems associated with our system of mass incarceration and its shocking racial disparities.\n\n\n\nClinton has a list of remedies that includes reforming mandatory-minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenders and ending the privatization of prisons.\n\n\n\nBut her critics say she lacks credibility on this issue. They tie her to President Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cget tough on crime\u201d policies, which resulted in many of today\u2019s disparities.\n\n\n\nBlack Lives Matter\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, a small group of Black Lives Matter leaders confronted the presidential hopeful at a campaign stop in New Hampshire. During the encounter, captured on video, Julius Jones told Clinton that she and the former president are partially responsible for the mass incarceration of black people. At another stop in Atlanta, Black Lives Matter protesters interrupted her rally.\n\n\n\nTo those who doubt Clinton\u2019s passion for criminal-justice reform, the campaign points to \u201cwhat she has actually demonstrated\u201d throughout her public life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to focus on what she has done as a legislator,\u201d Harris says. \u201cAs a senator, she championed a ban on racial profiling. And it\u2019s no coincidence that her first speech was on reforming the criminal-justice system.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoting Rights\n\n\n\nClinton also wants to defend voting rights. Advocates warn that this fundamental right to participate in our democracy is under attack in several states that have enacted various barriers to voting, ranging from requiring photo IDs to limiting early voting.\n\n\n\nAs president, Clinton would support legislation to \u201cfix the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRepairing the VRA is the minimum thing to do,\u201d Harris says. \u201cShe has an agenda that goes further to expand access.\u201d Clinton\u2019s voting-rights agenda includes automatic voter registration and a range of early-voting options.\n\n\n\nBlack voters are most familiar with Clinton out of all the candidates in the race. In fact, her 80 percent favorability rating in the black community is astronomical compared with her competitors.\n\n\n\nAfter acknowledging the numbers, Harris says, \u201cWe\u2019re not taking anything for granted.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton\u2019s favorability lead is significant, Obama won the votes of 93 percent of blacks, who turned out in percentages that outnumbered whites. And according to some estimates, it will take similar numbers of black voters for Democrats to hold on to the White House.\n\n\n\nDespite the widespread support of African Americans, the campaign faces the challenge of energizing black voters to turn out in the historic numbers that they did for Obama.\n\n\n\nReparations\n\n\n\nClinton has avoided taking a definitive position on reparations. When asked at the Brown & Black Forum, the former New York senator said that more investment is needed in neglected neighborhoods. She pointed to Congressional Black Caucus proposals that would direct federal funds to communities that have experienced \u201cdisinvestment or no investment.\u201d\n\n\n\nNigel Roberts is a New York City-based freelance writer.
