NEW YORK (GenomeWeb) â€“ Goldman Sachs today upgraded shares of Alere to a Buy rating, but downgraded Quest Diagnostics' shares to Neutral.

In a research note, analyst Isaac Ro upgraded Alere from a previous Neutral rating and said that he believes that Alere's new management has brought focus to the firm's new products, streamlined its cost structure, and reduced its debt. As a result, he anticipates revenues to grow about 6 percent between the firm's fiscal years 2015 and 2018, and EPS to grow 17 percent during the same period.
