In other words, at the very least a citizen has a right to defend their interests.\n\nBut what if a citizen\u2019s defense is that compliance with the state\u2019s legal mandate is impossible? Interestingly, that is a not a novel legal question. In a number of contexts, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have raised due process concerns in the face of impossibility, especially state-created impossibility.\n\nFor example, in Societe Internationale v. Rogers, the Supreme Court held the trial court improperly dismissed a case for a \u201cfailure to do that which it may not have been in its power to do.\u201d In other words, since the litigant did not have the power to comply with a court production order, it could not be penalized for failing to comply \u2014 especially when that inability is \u201cfostered neither by its own conduct nor by circumstances within its control.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Judge Rovner concurring in Ezelle v. City of Chicago, took aim at the city of Chicago\u2019s efforts to evade the Second Amendment:\n\nStung by the result of McDonald v. City of Chicago . . . the City quickly enacted an ordinance that was too clever by half. Recognizing that a complete gun ban would no longer survive Supreme Court review, the City required all gun owners to obtain training that included one hour of live-range instruction, and then banned all live ranges within City limits. This was not so much a nod to the importance of live-range training as it was a thumbing of the municipal nose at the Supreme Court. The effect of the ordinance is another complete ban on gun ownership within City limits. That residents may travel outside the jurisdiction to fulfill the training requirement is irrelevant to the validity of the ordinance inside the City. In this I agree with the majority: given the framework of District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald, the City may not condition gun ownership for self-defense in the home on a prerequisite that the City renders impossible to fulfill within the City limits. (Internal citations and footnotes omitted.)\n\nOther cases make the same basic point: The state can\u2019t impose penalties for noncompliance with state mandates when compliance is impossible.\n\nThe application to Obamacare is impossible to miss. The administration is on the verge of imposing tax penalties on millions of Americans for their alleged failure to obtain insurance policies they can\u2019t actually obtain. With the recent leak that less than 50,000 Americans have \u201cenrolled\u201d in the federal exchanges (a number that apparently includes thousands who haven\u2019t actually purchased insurance), it is a sad fact that the majority of Americans who want to purchase insurance \u2014 either because they need it or want to escape the tax penalty \u2014 cannot purchase it, and there\u2019s currently no assurance that they\u2019ll have a satisfactory opportunity by the time the penalty applies.\n\nAt the ACLJ we\u2019ve drafted a complaint that we\u2019ll be ready to file the very instant the enrollment period ends, if the exchanges aren\u2019t fixed with adequate time for citizens to enroll.
