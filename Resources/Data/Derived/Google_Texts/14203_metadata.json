Many Republicans already appear willing to block it, and Obama may be forced to rely on Democrats to sustain the veto he would certainly issue if Congress tried to block the deal.\n\nVoting to halt the agreement would \u201cabsolutely\u201d jeopardize foreign relations outside of the Middle East, Kerry said on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a repudiation of President Obama\u2019s initiative and a statement that when the executive department negotiates, it doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore, because we have 535 secretaries of State.\u201d\n\nA vote to kill the deal would only isolate America, he and others have been saying.\n\n\u201cI fear that what could happen if Congress were to overturn it, our friends in Israel could actually wind up being more isolated and more blamed and we could lose Europe and Russia and China with respect to whatever military action we might have to take,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cBecause we will have turned our backs on a very legitimate program that allows us to put [Iran\u2019s nuclear] program to the test.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rejecting the deal sends the message that the U.S. has \"535 secretaries of State,\" he said.", "description": "Rejecting the deal sends the message that the U.S. has \"535 secretaries of State,\" he said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Rejecting the deal sends the message that the U.S. has \"535 secretaries of State,\" he said.", "title": "Kerry says he\u2019d be 'embarrassed' to go out if Congress kills Iran deal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/249071-kerry-would-be-embarrassed-if-congress-kills-iran-deal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/2015-07-23-fr-kerry_john-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-24T11:50:27-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-24T11:50-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/249071-kerry-would-be-embarrassed-if-congress-kills-iran-deal", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-24T09:46-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Iran,John Kerry,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-24T09:46:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T11:50:27-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/249071-kerry-would-be-embarrassed-if-congress-kills-iran-deal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Rejecting the deal sends the message that the U.S. has \"535 secretaries of State,\" he said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kerry says he\u2019d be 'embarrassed' to go out if Congress kills Iran deal"}, "dcterms.title": "Kerry says he\u2019d be 'embarrassed' to go out if Congress kills Iran deal"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88af\"", "article_summary": "Along with fellow Cabinet secretaries, Kerry has made multiple trips to Capitol Hill to urge support for the deal while also seeking to win over the public.\n'Come negotiate with us.'\n\u201cI would be embarrassed to try to go out,\" Kerry said during remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cDo you think the ayatollah is going to come back to the table if Congress refuses this and negotiate this again?\u201d he added.\nVoting to halt the agreement would \u201cabsolutely\u201d jeopardize foreign relations outside of the Middle East, Kerry said on Friday."}
