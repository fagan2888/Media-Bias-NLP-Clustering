(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call File Photo)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 As House Democrats gathered here Wednesday to show their unity, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi indicated there's at least one Democrat who doesn't share their vision for the future: presidential candidate Sen. Bernard Sanders.\n\nSpecifically, Pelosi was addressing Sanders' plan for a single-payer health care system, an idea she's supported in the past but one she said is not politically viable.\n\n\"That\u2019s not going to happen,\" the California Democrat said. \"I mean does anybody is this room think that we\u2019re going to be discussing a single payer?\" she added, looking around to her House Democratic leadership team. The leaders held a news conference upon their arrival in Baltimore before beginning their 2016 issues conference.\n\nPelosi has not formally endorsed in the presidential race, although she has often hinted about her support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, including in a recent interview with Roll Call. At Wednesday's news conference she noted she was proud of all three Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley \u2014 but indicated she does not expect Sanders to prevail as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that Bernie Sanders is enlarging the universe of people paying attention to the election, and we hope that he will bring them to the polls in November to support the Democratic nominee,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nHer dismissal of Sanders' single-payer health care plan was not a statement of opposition to the idea so much as it was a reality check on his ability to deliver on his idea.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been for single payer for 30 years,\" Pelosi said. \"It is a very popular idea in our country, but we have made a decision about where we\u2019re going on health care.\"\n\nPelosi was referring to the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. When drafting the law, Democrats made sure that some popular features of a single-payer health care system were included, she said, citing no preexisting conditions, lifetime limits or annual limits as examples.\n\n\"Right now, we\u2019re proud of what we have and want to build upon that,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi's comments show a contrast between mainstream Democrats and Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats and has portrayed himself as the outsider candidate, at a time when her fellow House Democratic leaders are trying to deliver a message of unity. That is the theme for their annual retreat, which runs until Friday. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. will address members at the retreat Thursday.\n\n\"My own view [is] that the stark difference between the two parties is [the Democrats'] underlying premise is, 'We are in this together,'\" House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., said.\n\n\"In many respects, philosophically, our Republican colleagues believe each of us is on our own: no minimum wage, no healthcare, no rules protecting consumers,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated:\n\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
