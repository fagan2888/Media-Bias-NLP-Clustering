Not so, says Jonathan Moreno, a leading bioethicist who is liberal both politically and bioethically.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to find a conservative intellectual who emphasizes bioethics anymore, a sea change from the era of Bush 43, who devoted a chapter of his memoir, Decision Points, to the debate about human embryonic stem cells,\u201d he writes in the Huffington Post. Instead, after a decade of debate, the liberals have won.\n\nWhat seems clinched the deal for \u201cliberals\u201d was success. After human embryonic stem cells seemed to be useful (even if not as useful as scientists imagined), they became acceptable. Assisted suicide is spreading because baby boomers have to deal with the suffering of helpless parents. When the dust has settled on the Planned Parenthood videos, it seems likely, writes Moreno, that people will still support foetal tissue sales because it will be useful in fighting dementia.\n\nThere are other factors as well. Obamacare has survived a conservative onslaught and will entrench the expansion of government intervention for the common good.\n\nSame-sex marriage is another. \u201cThe seismic shift in attitudes toward gay marriage has also changed the way many Americans think about what it means to be liberal \u2026 And though gay marriage is not on its face a bioethics issue, it has a way of carrying other non-traditional family-making arrangements along with it, like in vitro fertilization and surrogate motherhood.\n\n\u201cSimply put,\u201d says Moreno, \u201cfor all its passion and focus, the conservative bioethics project failed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON THESE TOPICS | bioethics, United States", "article_metadata": {"description": "A decade after the great stem cell debates, America is still", "og": {"site_name": "BioEdge", "description": "A decade after the great stem cell debates, America is still", "title": "BioEdge: Has \u201cconservative bioethics\u201d failed?", "url": "http://www.bioedge.org/bioethics/has-conservative-bioethics-failed/11519", "image": "http://www.bioedge.org/images/2008images/TH_conservative_bioethics.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-9T09:13:00", "type": "article"}, "\u201drobots\u201d": "\u201dindex,follow\u201d", "keywords": "BioEdge, bioethics, bioethics articles, medical bioethics, bioethics issues, bioethical issues, bio ethics, stem cell articles, ethics issues, euthanasia, abortion, organ donation, surrogacy, IVF, cloning articles, human dignity, transhumanism, eugenics, neuroscience", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/BioEdge/295134659033"}, "verify-v1": "K8uk/7dIc762F5DoHQQKlJG+omTQqtA4fFDgY/WGLuQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe1c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSimply put,\u201d says Moreno, \u201cfor all its passion and focus, the conservative bioethics project failed.\u201dMORE ON THESE TOPICS | bioethics, United States\nObamacare has survived a conservative onslaught and will entrench the expansion of government intervention for the common good.\nAfter human embryonic stem cells seemed to be useful (even if not as useful as scientists imagined), they became acceptable.\n\u201cIt's hard to find a conservative intellectual who emphasizes bioethics anymore, a sea change from the era of Bush 43, who devoted a chapter of his memoir, Decision Points, to the debate about human embryonic stem cells,\u201d he writes in the Huffington Post.\nNot so, says Jonathan Moreno, a leading bioethicist who is liberal both politically and bioethically."}
