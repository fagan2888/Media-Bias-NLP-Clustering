(New York\u2019s rate is still lower than that of some other cities, including Phoenix, with 4.7 beds per 1,000 residents, and Dallas with 4.4 beds.)\n\nBrooklyn hospitals have a vacancy rate of almost 30 percent and, with more efficiency, could cut more than 1,200 beds \u2014 the equivalent of three or four community hospitals, according to a recent state report. A large portion of Brooklyn\u2019s more affluent population goes to the more prestigious academic medical centers in Manhattan for care, further weakening the system. About 25 percent of health care spending for Brooklyn residents is on Manhattan doctors and hospitals, according to the state.\n\nGenerally, the Brooklyn hospitals that are in financial straits disproportionately serve patients with Medicaid, which pays less than private insurers, and the uninsured.\n\nKenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, called Brooklyn hospitals \u201cthe poster child for the problems affecting safety net hospitals throughout the entire country,\u201d and said the federal government should step in.\n\nState health officials acknowledged that hospitals have become one-stop shopping centers for health care in poor neighborhoods, a pattern that is hard to break.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf those hospitals simply disappear, you\u2019ll have health care deserts,\u201d Jason A. Helgerson, the governor\u2019s Medicaid chief, said. \u201cIndividuals will have to travel extremely long distances for even the most basic forms of health care services.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, Mr. Helgerson added, the state does not favor the way those hospitals are operated today, each with a heavy emphasis on inpatient care that requires a costly staff and upkeep. In an effort to turn more money over to primary care \u2014 in part because the Affordable Care Act is expected to create a demand for it, as an estimated one million state residents gain coverage \u2014 health officials talk about turning some hospitals into what they call medical villages. Some of those villages, which might include some combination of emergency care, primary care and other services, but not the full array they now provide, would have to send patients to another hospital when they needed to be admitted.\n\nSo the state has pursued a policy of trying to persuade Brooklyn\u2019s unlinked collection of charity institutions to coordinate their services and become more efficient, even if that means that some of them might have to scale down significantly, or even close. (Brooklyn also has three city hospitals.)\n\nIn the crisis of the moment, Long Island College Hospital, also known as LICH, in Cobble Hill and Interfaith Medical Center in Bedford-Stuyvesant are losing money and on the verge of closing. The state has propped up those and other Brooklyn hospitals for decades through loans and grants, but in the current fiscal climate shows little inclination to continue doing so.\n\nSome of the hospitals have resisted consolidation, in part because their governing boards and doctors have a vested interest in keeping them as they are.\n\nOften it is the hospital medical staff, protecting its long-established patient relationships, its billing and perks like teaching, that fights the hardest to keep the facilities independent.\n\nTwo cases in point are Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which has refused a state commission\u2019s recommendation to merge with two other hospitals, and LICH, where the doctors are making a bid to take over the hospital after an ill-fated merger with SUNY Downstate Medical Center.\n\nThe doctors and other hospital employees, with hundreds of jobs at stake, have taken a lead in going to court to stop LICH from closing. Mr. de Blasio, the candidate for mayor who has been the most vocal about protecting the hospitals, has been endorsed by both 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, the hospital workers\u2019 union, and another union, the New York State Nurses Association.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGeorge Gresham, president of 1199, said that whether the state continued to invest in hospitals would reflect its social and political priorities. \u201cThis is an indication of the health care disparity that unfortunately exists on the national level and in New York, particularly with communities of color,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. de Blasio and other mayoral candidates have called on the federal government to approve the state\u2019s application for a $10 billion \u201cMedicaid waiver\u201d to redirect some money toward new ways of delivering health care. But while the candidates have suggested that the waiver could save the struggling hospitals, the Cuomo administration intends to use some of the money, $3.7 billion, to restructure hospital care in the state, particularly Brooklyn, through mergers, consolidations, expanding primary care and other changes.\n\nMr. Helgerson, the state Medicaid chief, noted a 2009 Commonwealth Fund study that ranked New York the second-worst state in the country, after Louisiana, in avoidable hospitalizations. \u201cWhat we are asking for from the federal government is these dollars to be able to make those targeted investments, not money just to keep the same system afloat,\u201d Mr. Helgerson said.\n\nThe Cuomo administration has also proposed inviting private capital to invest in the state\u2019s nonprofit hospital system, a plan that has been rebuffed by legislators worried that it would lead to large for-profit corporations taking ownership of hospitals, which all states except New York allow.\n\nFinally, it has proposed creating a public benefit corporation, with members appointed by the administration, that would become the parent organization for struggling Brooklyn hospitals, with sweeping authority to change their governance and how they deliver care. But the Legislature did not approve the proposal in the last session. Mr. de Blasio, Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson have called for some sort of regional planning entity.\n\nMr. de Blasio and Ms. Quinn have also suggested that city taxpayers might ultimately have to spend money on the hospitals.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think one of the most important things we in the public sector do is protect the public\u2019s health,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at the recent debate, \u201cand whether it takes some city funds, whether it takes state funds or whether it takes the Medicaid waiver that the state has called for which would bring in federal dollars explicitly for hospital restructuring, it\u2019s time for the local governments to take responsibility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130906231156, "twitter": {"description": "While the
