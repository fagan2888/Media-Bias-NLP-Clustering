Taxes are high, sexual promiscuity prevails, universal healthcare doesn\u2019t work, and millions of people don\u2019t even speak English as their primary language! Those who run around screaming about \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d often condemn countries like France, Norway and Switzerland to justify their jingoism. Sadly, the U.S.\u2019 economic deterioration means that many Americans simply cannot afford a trip abroad to see how those countries function for themselves. And often, lack of foreign travel means accepting clich\u00e9s about the rest of the world over the reality. And that lack of worldliness clouds many Americans\u2019 views on everything from economics to sex to religion.\n\nHere are nine things Americans can learn from the rest of the world.\n\n1. Universal Healthcare Is Great for Free Enterprise and Great for Small Businesses\n\nThe modern-day Republican Party would have us believe that those who promote universal healthcare are anti-free enterprise or hostile to small businesses. But truth be told, universal healthcare is great for entrepreneurs, small businesses and the self-employed in France, Germany and other developed countries where healthcare is considered a right. The U.S.\u2019 troubled healthcare system has a long history of punishing entrepreneurs with sky-high premiums when they start their own businesses. Prior to the Affordable Care Act of 2010, a.k.a. Obamacare, many small business owners couldn\u2019t even obtain individual health insurance plans if they had a preexisting condition such as heart disease or diabetes\u2014and even with the ACA\u2019s reforms, the high cost of health insurance is still daunting to small business owners. But many Americans fail to realize that healthcare reform is not only a humanitarian issue, it is also vitally important to small businesses and the self-employed.\n\nIn 2009, the Center for Economic and Policy Research published a study on small businesses around the world and found that \u201cby every measure of small-business employment, the United States has among the world\u2019s smallest small-business sectors.\u201d People in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Belgium and other European countries are more likely to be self-employed\u2014and the study concluded that universal healthcare is a key factor. According to CEPR\u2019s study, \u201cHigh healthcare costs discourage small business formation since start-ups in other countries can tap into government-funded healthcare systems.\u201d\n\n2. Comprehensive Sex Education Decreases Sexual Problems\n\nFor decades, social conservatives in the U.S. have insisted that comprehensive sex education promotes unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. But in fact, comprehensive sex education (as opposed to the abstinence-only programs that are common in the American Bible Belt) decreases sexual problems, and the data bears that out in no uncertain terms. Public schools in the Netherlands have aggressive sex education programs that America\u2019s Christian Right would despise. Yet in 2009, the Netherlands had (according to the United Nations) a teen birth rate of only 5.3 per 1,000 compared to 39.1 per 1,000 in the U.S. That same year, the U.S. had three times as many adults living with HIV or AIDS as the Netherlands.\n\nSwitzerland, France, Germany and many other European countries also have intensive sex-ed programs and much lower teen pregnancy rates than the U.S. Still, far-right politicians in the U.S. can\u2019t get it through their heads that inadequate sex education and insufficient sexual knowledge actually promote teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases instead of decreasing them.\n\n3. American Exceptionalism Is Absolute Nonsense in 2015\n\nNo matter how severe the U.S.\u2019 decline becomes, neocons and the Tea Party continue to espouse their belief in \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d But in many respects, the U.S. of 2015 is far from exceptional. The U.S. is not exceptional when it comes to civil liberties (no country in the world incarcerates, per capita, more of its people than the U.S.) or healthcare (WHO ranks the U.S. #37 in terms of healthcare). Nor is the U.S. a leader in terms of life expectancy: according to the WHO, overall life expectancy in the U.S. in 2013 was 79 compared to 83 in Switzerland and Japan, 82 in Spain, France, Italy, Sweden and Canada and 81 in the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Austria and Finland.\n\n4. Adequate Mass Transit Is a Huge Convenience\n\nWhen it comes to mass transit, Europe and Japan are way ahead of the U.S.; in only a handful of American cities is it easy to function without a car. New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, DC are among the U.S.\u2019 more mass transit-oriented cities, but overall, the U.S. remains a car culture\u2014and public transportation is painfully limited in a long list of U.S. cities. Many Americans fail to realize that mass transit has numerous advantages, including less air pollution, less congestion, fewer DUIs and all the aerobic exercise that goes with living in a pedestrian-friendly environment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lack of worldliness is clouding our vision on everything from sex to economics, and the proof is in our policies", "title": "9 basic concepts Americans fail to grasp", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A lack of worldliness is clouding our vision on everything from sex to economics, and the proof is in our policies", "title": "9 basic concepts Americans fail to grasp", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/9_basic_concepts_americans_fail_to_grasp_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_71599324.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A lack of worldliness is clouding our vision on everything from sex to economics, and the proof is in our policies", "title": "9 basic concepts Americans fail to grasp", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_71599324.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Henderson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, AlterNet, Economics, healthcare, Religion, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Comprehensive Sex Education Decreases Sexual ProblemsFor decades, social conservatives in the U.S. have insisted that comprehensive sex education promotes unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.\nTaxes are high, sexual promiscuity prevails, universal healthcare doesn\u2019t work, and millions of people don\u2019t even speak English as their primary language!\nBut many Americans fail to realize that healthcare reform is not only a humanitarian issue, it is also vitally important to small businesses and the self-employed.\nPublic schools in the Netherlands have aggressive sex education programs that America\u2019s Christian Right would despise.\nUniversal Healthcare Is Great for Free Enterprise and Great for Small BusinessesThe modern-day Republican Party would have us believe that those who promote universal healthcare are anti-free enterprise or hostile to small businesses."}
