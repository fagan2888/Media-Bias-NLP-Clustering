In practice, the Ukraine crisis will likely overshadow those talks.\n\nThe Nuclear Security Summit in the Hague will form the backdrop for an emergency meeting of Group of Seven leaders on Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. It\u2019s a confrontation between Russia and the West reminiscent of the Cold War.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is not attending, instead sending Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is expected to hold talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nBut experts say frantic diplomacy focused on Ukraine shouldn\u2019t divert from the goal of better security of nuclear material.\n\n\u201cInternational attention can turn in a moment,\u201d said Deepti Choubey, a senior director at the non-government Nuclear Threat Initiative. \u201cThe attentions of terrorists do not.\u201d\n\nDelegations from 53 countries, including the leaders of the U.S., China and Japan, have started to arrive in the Hague. They will meet to negotiate on reducing and securing supplies, and keeping them out of terrorists\u2019 hands. The G-7 includes the U.S., Britain, Germany, Japan, France, Italy and Canada.\n\nNotable absentees from the summit are North Korea and Iran, excluded by mutual consent.\n\nThe summit is the third since US President Barack Obama launched the series in 2009 shortly after taking office, saying that reducing the risk of a terrorist attack with either a nuclear weapon or a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d was one of his most important international policy goals.\n\nBecause countries usually regard protecting nuclear weapons and facilities as a confidential sovereign matter, the summits center on individual commitments by participants and conclude with a non-binding accord.\n\nStill, they already have reached tangible results.\n\nThe number of countries that possess enough highly enriched uranium or plutonium to make a bomb has fallen steadily, from 39 before the first conference in Washington in 2010 to 25 at the start of the Hague summit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "World leaders gather for Hague nuclear summit", "title": "World leaders gather for Hague nuclear summit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "World leaders gather for Hague nuclear summit", "title": "World leaders gather for Hague nuclear summit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/world_leaders_gather_for_hague_nuclear_summit/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/netherlands-china-nuclear-security-summit.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "World leaders gather for Hague nuclear summit", "title": "World leaders gather for Hague nuclear summit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/netherlands-china-nuclear-security-summit.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Toby Sterling", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4ca7\"", "article_summary": "The Nuclear Security Summit in the Hague will form the backdrop for an emergency meeting of Group of Seven leaders on Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsAMSTERDAM (AP) \u2014 Nuclear terrorism is officially the main topic for world leaders at a two-day summit in the Netherlands starting Monday.\nBut experts say frantic diplomacy focused on Ukraine shouldn\u2019t divert from the goal of better security of nuclear material.\n\u201cThe attentions of terrorists do not.\u201dDelegations from 53 countries, including the leaders of the U.S., China and Japan, have started to arrive in the Hague.\nThe number of countries that possess enough highly enriched uranium or plutonium to make a bomb has fallen steadily, from 39 before the first conference in Washington in 2010 to 25 at the start of the Hague summit."}
