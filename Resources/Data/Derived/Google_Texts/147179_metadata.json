Kaiser Family Foundation, 44% of Americans haven\u2019t heard anything while 28% have heard only a little about King v. Burwell, a case due to be heard within weeks that could cause millions to lose federal subsidies for health insurance.\n\nThough more people report knowing about the case than did when the Court announced it would take it up, the lack of knowledge isn\u2019t a good sign given the impact the case could have on health insurance for low and middle-income Americans.\n\nAn estimated 6.4 million Americans could lose the federal government\u2019s help in paying for their insurance if the Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe majority of surveyed adults say Congress or the states should act if the Court rules to gut the law, but a larger number of Republicans say neither should act on the issue.\n\nThe Kaiser poll was conducted between June 2 and 9 and 1,200 adults were contacted for the survey.
