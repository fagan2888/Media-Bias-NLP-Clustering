John Kasich\u2019s expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nBy putting more able-bodied, working-age childless adults on Medicaid than Kasich projected, Obamacare expansion is reducing incentives to work and threatening traditional Medicaid recipients\u2019 access to care faster and at greater cost than anticipated.\n\nAfter Kasich expanded Medicaid unilaterally, a state panel approved $2.56 billion in Obamacare spending for the expansion\u2019s first 18 months. The money was meant to last until July, but it ran out in February.\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost $323 million in March \u2014 84 percent greater than estimates revised just six months earlier.\n\nUsing monthly figures released by the Ohio Department of Medicaid, the Republican governor\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost slightly more than $3 billion from January 2014 through March 2015.\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion is on track to cost more than $4 billion by the end of June.\n\nWith federal taxpayers on the hook for all benefit costs and Ohio facing a growing state share in 2017, Obamacare expansion may soon consume 10 percent of Ohio\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cComparing budgets to actual and holding those responsible accountable is how private enterprise would work and, in my opinion, also how government should work,\u201d State Rep. Paul Zeltwanger said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\nExpressing concern over Obamacare expansion\u2019s promised federal funding, Zeltwanger said the federal government \u201calready has way too much debt and cannot support all of these additional costs from Obamacare let alone $1.3 billion overruns from one state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want Ohio to be part of the solution\u201d instead of adding to the $18 trillion national debt, Zeltwanger said. \u201cAs elected officials, we need to show fiscal discipline and restraint. We owe this to our children.\u201d\n\nZeltwanger suggested Medicaid reforms should be put in place before the state even considers expanding the program. In a separate email to Ohio Watchdog, State Rep. Nino Vitale agreed.\n\n\u201cAlthough we want to help people, there does come a time when there is no more money, and we either have to use debt or cannibalize other programs such as education, to offset these programs,\u201d Vitale said.\n\n\u201cOr, we simply have a limit on what we can do,\u201d Vitale continued. \u201cWe all do this in our personal family budgets, or in business, why not in government?\u201d\n\nVitale and Zeltwanger, both Republicans, were elected to their first two-year terms in the Ohio House last fall. Since 2013, conservative and free-market groups have warned lawmakers not to rely on the Kasich administration\u2019s cost and enrollment projections.\n\n\u201cAFP Ohio has said all along that Medicaid expansion would come at a great cost to state and federal taxpayers,\u201d Americans for Prosperity Ohio deputy state director Baylor Myers wrote in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cThese funding levels, which unsurprisingly exceed initial expectations, are unsustainable,\u201d Myers added.\n\nBudget-busting Obamacare expansion costs are resulting from a combination of exploding enrollment and higher-than-expected benefit costs per enrollee.\n\nSince taking effect January 2014, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has enrolled 527,821 people \u2014 44 percent more than the Kasich administration estimated would sign up by July 2015.\n\nAs of February, only 42 percent of the Ohioans enrolled in Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion were employed.\n\nDespite the welfare expansion\u2019s costs, the Republican supermajority in the Ohio House didn\u2019t strip Obamacare expansion funding from the governor\u2019s proposed 2016-17 budget.\n\nSeveral House Republicans criticized Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion before voting in favor of the budget last week. Zeltwanger, Vitale and three other Republicans voted against the budget because of higher spending driven by Obamacare.\n\nThe Kasich administration has not responded to Ohio Watchdog requests for comment as Obamacare expansion\u2019s costs and enrollment have left projections in the dust over the past several months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans' tax burden is already $3 billion heavier thanks to Ohio Gov.
