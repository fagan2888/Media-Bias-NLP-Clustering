In August, the exchange answered 1% of calls within 30 seconds, far short of its 80% goal.\n\nThe average wait time was under five minutes Thursday, according to the exchange.\n\nLee said the exchange is nearly doubling its service-center staff to 1,300 to help more than 1 million Californians renew their health-law policies by Jan. 1. The first batch of renewal notices for 2015 went out this week.\n\nThe state said it has spent $22.6 million on improving the speed and reliability of its website and online enrollment.\n\nCovered California said more than 200,000 people have signed up for Obamacare coverage since regular enrollment ended in April under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut in a sign of the churn in the individual insurance market, an additional 150,000 people dropped out of the exchange after getting health benefits at work or failing to pay their premium.\n\nPeople who move, lose their employer coverage or have some other qualifying event in their life can enroll outside the normal sign-up period.\n\nOverall, Covered California said it has 1.1 million people enrolled now, down from its previous tally of 1.2 million.\n\nPart of that was because the exchange said 81% of enrollees paid their initial premium compared with its earlier estimate of 85%.\n\nOpponents of the health law have criticized the federal and state exchanges for not disclosing detailed enrollment figures in a timely manner.\n\nThe exchange wants to close open enrollment in mid-February with 1.7 million people enrolled.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "California spends $13.4 million to fix Obamacare service woes", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's health insurance exchange hired two outside firms for $13.4 million to address long wait times for consumers calling about their Obamacare coverage.", "title": "California spends $13.4 million to fix Obamacare service woes", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-california-enrollment-20141016-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54403b82/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-california-enrollment-20141016", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, covered california, affordable care act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81699123", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-17", "Description": "California's health insurance exchange hired two outside firms for $13.4 million to address long wait times for consumers calling about their Obamacare coverage.
