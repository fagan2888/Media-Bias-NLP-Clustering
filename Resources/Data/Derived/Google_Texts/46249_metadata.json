Rick Perry is expected to announce his bid to seek the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday. It will be Perry\u2019s second attempt to secure a home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and Perry showed commendable candor in the lead-up to his 2012 bid regarding his unorthodox views about the Constitution. Most politicians who hope to win a national election, for example, would not openly admit that they believe that Social Security and Medicare are unconstitutional.\n\nYet Perry was remarkably honest about his belief that federal programs that millions of American depend upon for their health and livelihood somehow violate America\u2019s founding principles. In 2010, he published a book, Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington, laying out his narrow understanding of the Constitution in considerable detail. He also gave numerous speeches and made multiple television appearances touting his belief that much of the last century of American history was a constitutional error.\n\nHere are some of Perry\u2019s more surprising beliefs:\n\n1) Social Security And Medicare Are Unconstitutional\n\nThe Constitution permits the federal government to \u201clay and collect taxes\u201d and to use the funds raised by these taxes to \u201cpay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\u201d This provision lays out the constitutional basis for federal spending programs such as Social Security, Medicare and numerous other such programs that seek to advance the general welfare.\n\nPerry, however, believes these programs are unconstitutional. \u201cI don\u2019t think our founding fathers when they were putting the term \u2018general welfare\u2019 in there were thinking about a federally operated program of pensions nor a federally operated program of health care,\u201d Perry told the Daily Beast\u2019s Andrew Romano in 2011.\n\nHe offered similar views in a 2010 address to the American Legislative Exchange Council\u2019s (ALEC) National Policy Summit. Proclaiming that \u201cthe nearly unlimited scope of the federal government contradicts the principles of limited, constitutional government that our founders established to protect us,\u201d Perry claimed that an assault on this principles \u201ccontinued into the Roosevelt New Deal.\u201d He then named \u201ca bankrupt Social Security system\u201d as an example of a New Deal program he opposed.\n\nLater, in the same speech, he claimed that President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society \u201cfurther eroded our founding fathers\u2019 boundaries that they had put upon the federal government.\u201d He also specifically named Medicare as an example of Johnson\u2019s supposed sins against the Constitution.\n\n2) All Other Federal Health Programs Are Also Unconstitutional\n\nPerry also listed Medicaid in his ALEC speech as an example of a Great Society program that, he believes, violates the Constitution. Similarly, his statement that Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to spend money does not permit \u201ca federally operated program of pensions nor a federally operated program of health care\u201d sweeps broadly, implicating all federal health care programs. So that means that programs such as the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program or much of the Affordable Care Act would also cease to exist under Perry\u2019s vision.\n\nPerry has also made statements suggesting that any federal laws regulating the health care industry are unconstitutional. \u201cThere is nothing in that Constitution that says Washington D.C. is supposed to be telling us how to deliver health care,\u201d the former Texas governor told a crowd of New Hampshire voters in 2011, reiterating a view he\u2019d expressed on Glenn Beck\u2019s now-defunct Fox News show a few months earlier. Taken to its extreme, this view would not only prevent federal regulation of health insurers and hospitals, but it would also eliminate the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s power to keep dangerous drugs and quack remedies out of pharmacies.\n\n3) Federal Clean Air Laws Are Unconstitutional \u201cNonsense\u201d\n\nPerry also claimed that the notion that the federal government is \u201ctelling us how to . . . clean our air is really nonsense.\u201d It\u2019s likely, moreover, that Perry\u2019s objections to environmental regulations extend far beyond the Clean Air Act. A section of Fed Up! argues that the Supreme Court has read Congress\u2019s power to \u201cregulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states\u201d too broadly. Although Perry does not explain in detail how he would interpret this provision of the Constitution, he does suggest that Congress has overreached its constitutional authority in a long list of policy areas, including \u201cthe environment,\u201d \u201cguns,\u201d and \u201ccivil rights.\u201d\n\n4) Federal Education Programs Are Unconstitutional\n\nIn his Beck interview, Perry denounced federal laws which \u201ctell[] us how to educate our children.\u201d Similarly, in Fed Up!, Perry criticized members of his own party for supporting federal education legislation. Their decision to do so, Perry claims, is a \u201cperfect example of Republicans losing sight of the fact that perfectly laudable policy choices at the local level are not appropriate (much less constitutional) at the federal level.\u201d\n\n5) Nearly All Federal Laws Protecting Workers Are Unconstitutional\n\nFed Up! labels the the New Deal \u201cthe second big step in the march of socialism,\u201d and blames the Supreme Court for allowing New Deal laws to take effect \u201cby abdicating its role as the protector of constitutional federalism.\u201d One decision that Perry singles out for criticism is NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., a 1937 decision upholding the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 \u2014 a federal law that still provides much of the backbone of the nation\u2019s law governing unions. It should be noted that Jones & Laughlin\u2018s reasoning also provides the basis for other federal regulation of the employment relationship, such as minimum wage laws or the ban on child labor. So it is likely that those laws would cease to exist under Perry\u2019s reading of the Constitution as well.\n\nLater in Fed Up!, Perry argues in favor of a kind of special rule permitting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans various forms of employment discrimination, to exist. It\u2019s not entirely clear whether Perry believes that all of the Civil Rights Act is consistent with his idiosyncratic view of the Constitution, or merely its prohibitions on race discrimination. Nevertheless, while Perry would strip away most nationwide protections for workers, he would apparently leave at least some civil rights protections in place.\n\n6) Federal Financial Reform Is Unconstitutional\n\nCiting an announcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking public comment on regulations being considered to implement the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, Perry\u2019s book claims that \u201cthere is a better way to ensure that local communities are represented in government. If the Constitution were shown the appropriate respect, Washington regulation writers wouldn\u2019t have to worry about underrepresented views, because they wouldn\u2019t have control over them in the first place.\u201d It\u2019s unclear just how far Perry would go in rolling back Wall Street regulation, although this passage suggests that he would go quite far.\n\n7) Voters Should Not Be Able To Choose Their Own Senators\n\nPerry also claims that \u201c[t]he American people mistakenly empowered the federal government during a fit of populist rage in the early twentieth century by giving it an unlimited source of income (the Sixteenth Amendment) and by changing the way senators are elected (the Seventeenth Amendment).\u201c The Seventeenth Amendment provides for direct election of senators, rather than having senators be selected by state legislatures \u2014 a process that was abandoned, at least in part, because it led to considerable corruption.\n\n8) Taxing Investment Income Should Be Unconstitutional\n\nThe Sixteenth Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\u201d It was ratified to overrule an 1895 Supreme Court decision which effectively declared taxation of income from capital unconstitutional, though it permitted taxation of income from wages or salaries. The upshot of this decision is that a wealthy heir who lives entirely off of inherited investments would pay no taxes, while the heir\u2019s pool cleaner would be taxed on their wage.\n\nPerry\u2019s claim that the Sixteenth Amendment was a mistake suggests that he would go back to this regime.\n\n9) But Activist Judges Are A Serious Problem\n\nHaving laid out a long list of laws he thinks should be declared unconstitutional, Fed Up! pivots to a rant against Supreme Court justices who act as \u201c\u2018Grand Ayatollahs\u2019 of the Constitution.\u201d He objects to Supreme Court decisions supposedly dictating \u201cwhere we may and may not pray to God, when life begins, whether contraception must be allowed to be sold, whether and how we can celebrate religious holidays, what level of pornography and vulgarity must be allowed, whether those other than man and woman must be allowed to marry, what level of discrimination may or even must be carried out . . . whether a state must allow women to attend an all-male military academy, who may be executed and whether we may execute criminals at all.\u201d\n\nPerry, in other words, believes there should be strict limits on the Supreme Court\u2019s power to hand down decisions he disagrees with, even as he insists upon using the Constitution as a weapon to erase whole swaths of American law.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Perry believes there should be strict limits on the Supreme Court's power to hand down decisions he disagrees with, even as he insists upon using the Constitution as a weapon to erase whole swaths of American law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Perry believes there should be strict limits on the Supreme Court's power to hand down decisions he disagrees with, even as he insists upon using the Constitution as a weapon to erase whole swaths of American law.", "title": "9 Completely Bonkers Things The Newest GOP Presidential Candidate Believes About The Constitution", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/06/04/3665988/9-completely-bonkers-things-newest-gop-presidental-candidate-believes-constitution/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Perry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Perry believes there should be strict limits on the Supreme Court's power to hand down decisions he disagrees with, even as he insists upon using the Constitution as a weapon to erase whole swaths of American law.", "title": "9 Completely Bonkers Things The Newest GOP Presidential Candidate Believes About The Constitution", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Perry-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@imillhiser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Perry.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Perry.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T09:44:18+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice 9 Completely Bonkers Things The Newest GOP Presidential Candidate Believes About The Constitution CREDIT: AP ImagesFormer Texas Gov.\n2) All Other Federal Health Programs Are Also UnconstitutionalPerry also listed Medicaid in his ALEC speech as an example of a Great Society program that, he believes, violates the Constitution.\nPerry has also made statements suggesting that any federal laws regulating the health care industry are unconstitutional.\nYet Perry was remarkably honest about his belief that federal programs that millions of American depend upon for their health and livelihood somehow violate America\u2019s founding principles.\nRick Perry is expected to announce his bid to seek the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday."}
