MSNBC’s Chris Hayes isn’t terribly impressed with Ted Cruz, tonight calling him an elitist attempting to be a “folksy populist” and “inauthentic.” He talked with EMILY’s List spokeswoman Jess McIntosh about the “Fox News primary jockeying” that’s starting to unfold.

Hayes said that despite portraying himself as a man of the people, Cruz has “checked every box of the meritocratic elite.” He pointed to Cruz’s resumé, including going to Princeton and Harvard, and said, “This is the elite of the elite of the elite, and this is the guy who’s gonna come to America and say, ‘I am one of you.'”

He also observed, “There’s something about him that I find so inauthentic at all moments, so overly performative.” Hayes played the clip of Cruz talking about how he started listening to country music and gave up rock after 9/11 and said, “Are you kidding me?”

Hayes was struck by “the level of pandering, the overdetermination to pandering in that answer.”
