Even if it's vicariously.\n\nLittle League pitcher Mo'ne Davis just gave us all that kind of welcome break when she threw a shutout in the Little League World Series that drew praise from the big leagues on down.\n\nIt was the first time a girl had done that.\n\nFans holding up signs that say \"I want to throw like a girl\" may be paying tribute to this 13-year-old's 70-mph fastball. But this isn't just about gender bending.\n\nThis is a different kind of stand-up-and-cheer moment.\n\nMo'ne Davis has talent and confidence and can perform under enormous pressure. It takes tenacity and courage to break the mold and succeed.\n\nShe's also got poise and enough sassiness to remind her elders what life is all about. Asked how she dealt with all the media attention, she replied: \"I can always say no.\"\n\nWhat a concept in a society growing soft on self-indulgence.\n\nNo wonder America is more than ready to say yes to this amazing player.\n\nShe's a perfect counterbalance to a long list of gloom-and-doom news, not to mention those cynicism-inspiring political campaigns.\n\nHeck, yeah. We needed a refresher course in what's right with America, and this youngster delivered.\\\n\n\u2014 Arizona Republic\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1oWMOum", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "This spunky, confident Little League player isn't just about gender bending.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "This spunky, confident Little League player isn't just about gender bending.", "title": "Mo'ne Davis makes us all want to throw 'like a girl'", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2014/08/21/mone-davis-makes-us-want-throw-like-girl/14423289/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This spunky, confident Little League player isn't just about gender bending.", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac25610a19915cf2f305634ed651ea5a40b80e43/c=749-0-3751-3002&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2014/08/21/llwslasvegasphiladwass.jpg", "title": "Mo'ne Davis makes us all want to throw 'like a girl'", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaeae\"", "article_summary": "Little League pitcher Mo'ne Davis just gave us all that kind of welcome break when she threw a shutout in the Little League World Series that drew praise from the big leagues on down.\nMo'ne Davis has talent and confidence and can perform under enormous pressure.\nPhiladelphia pitcher Mo'ne Davis delivers in the first inning of a United States semi-final baseball game against Las Vegas at the Little League World Series tournament in South Williamsport, Pa., Tuesday, Aug. 20, 2014.\nFans holding up signs that say \"I want to throw like a girl\" may be paying tribute to this 13-year-old's 70-mph fastball.\nLas Vegas won 8-1, with Mo'ne giving up three runs in 2 and 2/3 innings."}
