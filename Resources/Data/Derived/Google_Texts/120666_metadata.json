The fresh fast food chain last week launched a new line \u2013 not of food products, but of cups and bags embellished with original short prose works by the likes of Toni Morrison, Malcolm Gladwell, Judd Apatow and Jonathan Safran Foer.\n\nIt\u2019s all thanks to a brainwave by Foer, who was hit by a wave of frustration common to bookworms worldwide while dining on a Chipotle burrito one day. It was a fate worse than death: He was stuck with Nothing To Read.\n\nRelated: Why Fast Food Is Making Us More Impatient\n\nHad he been in a Vienna coffee shop, he could have reached for one of those newspapers displayed on long poles and available for perusal by the cultured patrons. In a Tokyo sushi bar, a small library of manga could have kept Foer\u2019s eyes occupied while he devoured his lunch.\n\nFoer had a brainstorm and, he explained to Vanity Fair, he emailed Chipotle\u2019s CEO Steve Ellis, whom he had met a few years earlier:\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I bet a shitload of people go into your restaurants every day, and I bet some of them have very similar experiences, and even if they didn\u2019t have that negative experience, they could have a positive experience if they had access to some kind of interesting text.\u2019\u201d\n\nEllis agreed, and Foer picked a diverse group of writers to contribute the two-minute reads.\n\nThe ubiquity of smartphones \u2013 and the ready availability of all kinds of written content on them \u2013 means that Chipotle patrons aren\u2019t necessarily counting on the restaurant chain to provide them with something to read, or show up as desperate as Foer was all those months ago.\n\nNor is it likely that this will somehow open up a new gateway to literacy to Chipotle patrons. Let\u2019s face it, if a student is struggling in school, reading philosophical ruminations by likes of Michael Lewis in an essay on the side of a paper bag at a fast food restaurant probably isn\u2019t going to alter much about their life.\n\nRelated: 10 Massive Fast-Food Flops\n\nWhat it could do, however, is help Chipotle Mexican Grill consolidate its brand as somehow distinctive and upmarket from that of other fast food or fresh food companies like McDonald\u2019s and Burger King; Panera Bread, which also emphasizes fresh ingredients; or upstarts with niche concepts like Noodles & Co.\n\nWith the Cultivating Thought initiative, Chipotle is ostentatiously shunning vulgar commercial stuff like profits \u2013 while still making sure that its cups and bags will have a distinctive look if carried out on the street. Clever, clever, clever.\n\nThat alone may not win them an extra dollar of revenue, but to the extent that it tempts the kind of customer who thinks they\u2019re somehow above dropping in to buy a burrito at a chain store \u2013 they\u2019d rather head for that hole-in the-wall indie restaurant, or the local food truck \u2013 it\u2019s a win-win marketing ploy. Oh, and an maybe even an additional outlet for writers in what is a tough era for traditional publishers?\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The fresh fast food chain last week launched a new line \u2013 not of food products, but of cups and bags embellished with original short prose works by the likes of Toni Morrison, Malcolm Gladwell, Judd Apatow and Jonathan Safran Foer.", "title": "Chipotle\u2019s Smart New Way to Spice Up Your Lunch", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/05/19/Chipotle-s-Smart-New-Way-Spice-Your-Lunch", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05192014_Chipotle_Burrito_Bowl.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/05/19/Chipotle-s-Smart-New-Way-Spice-Your-Lunch", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05192014_Chipotle_Burrito_Bowl.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The fresh fast food chain last week launched a new line \u2013 not of food products, but of cups and bags embellished with original short prose works by the likes of Toni Morrison, Malcolm Gladwell, Judd Apatow and Jonathan Safran Foer.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe246e\"", "article_summary": "Chipotle Mexican Grill has a whole new way to spice up its burritos.\nNor is it likely that this will somehow open up a new gateway to literacy to Chipotle patrons.\nIn a Tokyo sushi bar, a small library of manga could have kept Foer\u2019s eyes occupied while he devoured his lunch.\nOh, and an maybe even an additional outlet for writers in what is a tough era for traditional publishers?\nThe fresh fast food chain last week launched a new line \u2013 not of food products, but of cups and bags embellished with original short prose works by the likes of Toni Morrison, Malcolm Gladwell, Judd Apatow and Jonathan Safran Foer."}
