Two forwards desperate to make an impression — rookie Mikko Rantanen and unsigned Jack Skille — both scored in Sunday’s Burgundy/White intrasquad scrimmage at Magness Arena.

Rantanen, 18, tapped the puck in behind goalie Semyon Varlamov to give White a 2-0 lead and the 28-year-old Skille one-timed a rebound past goalie Spencer Martin in the third period for a 3-0 advantage.

Veteran Alex Tanguay, 35, scored the game’s first goal off a beautiful play by Nathan MacKinnon and White went on to win 3-1. Burgundy’s Joey Hishon scored his team’s goal and centered what may have been the game’s best line, with wingers Borna Rendulic and Dennis Everberg.

Rantanen, the No. 10 draft pick in June, continues to prove he’s NHL-ready, and Skille, who is on a professional tryout contract, once again showed he is deserving of a deal as a third- or fourth-line forward.

Rantanen has played in the Finnish pro league since he was 16 and Skille, a 2005 first-round NHL draft pick, played for the Columbus Blue Jackets the last two seasons.

Avs coach Patrick Roy had kudos for a handful of players in tight position battles, including goalies Reto Berra (shutout) and Calvin Pickard (one goal-against) and defenseman Brandon Gormley — who was paired with Tyson Barrie.

Footnotes. Forward Jesse Winchester and defenseman Andrej Meszaros did not participate. Roy said Winchester, who missed all of last season with a head injury, may play in Tuesday’s preseason opener against the visiting Anaheim Ducks. Meszaros, who is on a PTO, has a leg injury and is day-to-day. … Newcomer Black Comeau committed the game’s only penalty, a high-stick to MacKinnon’s face in the second period.
