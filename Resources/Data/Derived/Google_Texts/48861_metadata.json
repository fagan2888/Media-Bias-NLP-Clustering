Here's the view of one faithful GetReligion reader of the Crux feature:\n\nIn this article and the accompanying photos it seems to me as if Crux Now is treating this like they were reporting on and taking pictures at a zoo. \"Oh, look! There's the scarlet Cardinal with flocks of admirers around him! Oh, and see over there? That's the white-hatted, red-breasted lionheart with an old-fashioned chasuble on!\"\n\nI can see some of that, in this coverage of the Cardinal Burke show. However, I was impressed with two elements of this story, which we will get to in a moment. There is one major wince moment at the very end for the suddenly old new Catholic left.\n\nMy problem with this piece? I really like it when journalists quote people to make major, summary points -- as opposed to using that kind of reportorial papal voice with no attributions -- like the following. Let us attend.\n\nThese are the True Believers.\n\nThey comprise a small, vocal, and especially young segment of the Catholic Church. They see the liturgical changes that took place after the Second Vatican Council as ushering in the breakdown of society. Abortion, same-sex marriage, gender theory: these changes are the result of sacrificing beauty and truth, truth with a capital T, on the altar of individualism and reason.\n\nMany are gathered in New York this week for Sacra Liturgia USA, an annual gathering of mostly American and British priests and seminarians to discuss ways to bring the sacred back to Catholic worship. For them, sacred means the use of traditional music, art, and the Latin Mass.\n\nThe main attraction here is undoubtedly Burke, a traditionalist known for his elaborate vestments, outspoken views on traditional worship, and sharp defense of Catholic orthodoxy. That Burke\u2019s been sidelined by Pope Francis, losing his job as head of the Vatican\u2019s supreme court last year and then relegated to a largely ceremonial role at a relatively young age, doesn\u2019t matter here. He\u2019s a rock star.\n\nThe crowd of a few hundred is mostly male, and it\u2019s noticeably youthful. They hang on Burke\u2019s every word, interrupting his keynote address repeatedly with applause.\n\nNow here is the key: Are there any parts of that Crux speech that would be challenged by Catholic traditionalist shareholders, the folks whose lives are most connected to this event? Simply stated: Yes. So why not, in this kind of overture, quote critics of this group and its defenders? I guarantee that the quotes would, yes, be colorful.\n\nHowever, this kind of view-from-on-high narration seems to be the norm in today's world of reported analysis. I still think that a story of this kind should almost go out of its way to make both sides uncomfortable.\n\nWhich leads me to one or my two primary areas of praise for this feature -- its emphasis on the youth of the participants at this conference. Yes, we see young Catholics cheering for the scholarly Pope Benedict XVI and his legacy. From my experience, the Latin Mass crowd in the past leaned toward the gray-hair set. But this piece consistently undercuts that older image.\n\nAnd then, when the on-the-record traditionalist voices arrive, they are very articulate and the content they offer is actually rather complex -- including some praise for Catholic charismatics and others whose liturgical tastes run toward the flexible and modern.\n\nHere is Father Christopher Smith of Prince of Peace Parish in Taylors, SC, which is deep in convert-heavy Bible Belt territory. He notes that:\n\n... Those who practiced the Extraordinary Form after 1970 were viewed with suspicion, that they were driven underground, \u201cmarginalized in a Church subculture that wasn\u2019t always healthy.\u201d With Benedict\u2019s proclamation, however, he believes the Latin Mass, \u201ctaken out of the dustbin of history,\u201d will only grow in popularity.\n\n\u201cLiturgy must draw from all streams,\u201d he said. His parish, with 2,000 families, offers both rites, and he estimates attendance is equal at both.\n\nYou mean these two different packs of worshipers don't fight in the pews between Masses? Then there is another trad voice, who is ultimately given the last word:\n\nThe Rev. Kevin Cusick is pastor of St. Francis de Sales Parish in Benedict, Md., which has been offering a Latin Mass since the 1980s. Though his parish is small, about 150 families, he said members are on board with spending money to beautify the Church, restoring brass candlesticks that were unceremoniously placed in storage after Vatican II.\n\nHe ripped out the sanctuary\u2019s carpeting and brown paneling, restoring the original wall and placing a marble floor. \u201cPeople put marble floors in their bathrooms, so they understand beauty,\u201d he said. But they need to be brought on board with the idea of spending money to renovate the church.\n\nAnd at the very end:\n\nCusick, the priest in Maryland, tells me that he attended a Mass at a parish known for the Latin Mass. This particular liturgy was unexpectedly a contemporary Mass. Up front sat several gray-haired women and men, enjoying the guitar music.\n\nBut in the back, the crowd was younger, disappointed with the worship style. A couple of seminarians, dressed in black cassocks, sat among them.\n\nIn all, these story appears to be a duet between Crux sources -- without attribution -- from the liturgical establishment and the live, human voices from the conference. Crux creates the factual framework in the long chunks of prose built on unattributed material, then the traditionalists at the conference are given a chance to debate that frame game.\n\nIs this the new normal? Can you imagine similar coverage, let's say, of a Catholic gay-rights conference in which all of the framework material is unattributed history and background facts from experts and anonymous voices on the orthodox side and then the Catholic doctrinal left is given a chance to respond?\n\nIt seems like half a story, again. But the half that is there is, I confess, really interesting.\n\nIMAGE: Cardinals in cappa magna, taken from a liturgical reference site.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Try to imagine the mayhem that would be created in the religion blogosphere \r\nif a major controversy hit the news that involved gay rights, Mormonism, \r\natheism and (wait for it) the Latin Mass.
