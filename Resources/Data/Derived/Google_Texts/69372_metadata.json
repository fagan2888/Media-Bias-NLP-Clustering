Now granted teachers are public employees and the school districts have a contract with those educators to be there to help shape and mold young minds, but a lot of them choose not to report to work (after all it is their sick leave). Throw in a crisis like bad weather or the desire to go to the state capital and protest on a school day, (still expecting to get paid) and you will really figure out that teachers don\u2019t have to show up.\n\nDid you know in the military you can be prosecuted and sent to prison for what is called \u201cfailure to go or missing a movement\u201d? This has nothing to do with your digestive system.\n\nIf the Department of Defense tells you to be someplace at a specific time or directs you to move out smartly going from point A to point B and if you do not follow these orders,\u2013you can go to jail.\n\nStriking, liberal grade school teachers who are directed by their school leadership to get out of the capital and get back in the classroom or else, do not go to jail when they fail to be there the next school day to teach your little Tommy.\n\nNow all of the above people could face administrative discipline or even be fired for not performing their assigned work duties, but they are not going to prison and they know it. They may lose their employment, their retirement, their healthcare coverage, and perhaps their self respect if they run like cowards in time of crisis, but they do not get put against a wall and shot at sun rise.\n\nFirst responders know going in that they have chosen to be in a service providing profession that can put them in danger. Look at all the stories of first responders who knew the twin towers in New York were coming down, but still volunteered to rush in and try and save lives.\n\nThe country needs to stop and rethink all the protesting going on now that the two police officers have been assassinated. It is one thing to be willing to risk your life for the public if they appreciate and yes even deserve your dying support. However, when public sentiment and the political sentiment turns against the police\u2013remember the cops do not have to risk their lives to protect you.\n\nHave you ever heard of the \u201cblue-flu\u201d? It is a way the rank and file police can demonstrate their unhappiness with the leadership of their city. They just call in sick, en masse and suddenly there are too few police to protect the streets.\n\nEvery New Year\u2019s Eve as many as a million people can descend on Times Square in New York City. If New York\u2019s Finest feel they are in danger, and that the leadership of the city is not backing them, could you imagine a 48 hour case of the \u201cblue flu\u201d?\n\nThe public cries out about being over-policed, try being under-policed on New Year\u2019s Eve in NYC. In many states if the cops are not there, the citizens can get out their own firearms and protect life and property, but not in New York City. So if the cops are out \u201csick\u201d and the law abiding residents cannot exercise their 2nd amendment right, who do you think will take advantage of that little crisis situation?\n\nOver-policed, under-policed or no police, how well do you figure you will fair in that scenario?\n\nMajor Van Harl USAF Ret. / 23 Dec 2014 / vanharl@aol.com\n\nAbout Major Van Harl USAF Ret.:Major Van E.
