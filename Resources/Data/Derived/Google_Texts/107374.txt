A Gibsonton man faces a murder charge after using his car to chase two people he caught in his yard and fatally shooting one of them during a confrontation, deputies said.

Ruben Rodriguez, 29, told sheriff’s detectives he returned his home, at 6207 Estelle Ave., about 3:30 a.m. Saturday and saw the intruders running away. He then went inside the home and told his girlfriend to retrieve his gun, authorities said.

Rodriguez got back in his vehicle with his girlfriend and drove until he found 36-year-old Enrique Rodriguez Garcia and another man a few blocks away, at Estelle and California Avenue, authorities said.

Rodriguez stopped driving and from his car questioned the men for about five to seven minutes, when he and Garcia began to argue, Hillsborough County sheriff’s spokeswoman Cristal Bermudez Nunez said, citing an arrest affidavit.

Garcia then moved his left arm toward Rodriguez, who fired a shot, killing Garcia, the affidavit said. Garcia was not armed, authorities said.

Rodriguez did not attempt to drive away or remove himself from the situation, Nunez said. After the shooting, he returned to his home, dropped off his girlfriend and the gun, and drove to a friend’s house, according to the affidavit.

The friend called authorities to report the shooting about 4:35 a.m., as deputies were responding to another call about the shooting. They found the body of Garcia in the street with a gunshot wound to the upper body, Nunez said.

Garcia, 36, was homeless, Nunez said.

Deputies went to the friend’s house and met with Rodriguez, who was detained and interviewed. He was later booked at the Hillsborough County Jail without bail.

The man who was with Garcia was at the scene when deputies arrived, Nunez said. He is considered a witness.
