And in New Hampshire that means a lot more options this time around for the nearly 100,000 residents without insurance.\n\nHere's the problem: five insurers offering forty plans, each with varying premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and co-pays. Who could blame you for being confused?\n\nAccording to Dr. John Yindra, medical director of Maine Community Health Options, a co-op expanding into the New Hampshire exchange in 2015, research shows more options tend to produce more confusion.\n\n\"Even when people were given the information,\" says Dr. Yindra, \"they had trouble conceptualizing it. It\u2019s like, 'You mean it\u2019s not going to cost me to see my doctor if I\u2019m going for my diabetes? How\u2019s that work?'\"\n\nIn fact, one recent survey found people think they know more about health insurance than they actually do.\n\nSo, here are a few tips on navigating your options.\n\nListen to the radio version of this story.\n\nTip #1: Get Help\u2026For FREE.\n\nStephanie Dunn is an insurance broker in Alton who works for a company called Health Markets.\n\n\"Why would you do it on your own if you could have someone guide you through the process, make it simpler, faster - and it doesn\u2019t cost you any extra?\" Dunn asks.\n\nThat\u2019s true. Insurance brokers certified by the state (here's a list of about 200 of them, listed by town) can help you find the right plan for your situation. Brokers get paid by the insurance companies \u2013 15 bucks per enrollee per month across the board. So they have no incentive to push you toward any one company.\n\nTip #2: Look Past The Price Tag.\n\nUnlike right now, every New Hampshire hospital will be covered under Obamacare in 2015. But that doesn\u2019t mean every plan covers every hospital.\n\n\"If you have a particular hospital that you want to be attached to - if you have a particular doctor\u2019s practice that you want to continue to use - you\u2019re going to look at what network that doctor is included in,\" says Dunn.\n\nSo get the details from HealthCare.gov, then call the insurers. They\u2019re ready to take your call.\n\n\"We\u2019re able to flex our staffing model so that we can ramp up through November and February,\" says Beth Roberts of Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, a not-for-profit insurer jumping into the New Hampshire exchange. \"They\u2019re being trained on how to handle prospective member calls.\"\n\nTip #3: Shoot For Silver. If You Can.\n\nIf you are within 400 percent of the federal poverty line, you\u2019re eligible for subsidized premiums. But there\u2019s another, less well-known subsidy. Jenny Patterson, with the New Hampshire insurance department, says if you are within 100 to 250 percent of federal poverty, you should seek out a plan rated \"Silver.\"\n\n\"So every time you go to the doctor, you might have a co-pay, you might have a deductible \u2013 those amounts would be substantially less for someone within that income range if they bought the silver plan,\" says Patterson.\n\nIn the first enrollment period nearly half the people who signed up were eligible for this subsidy.\n\nTip #4: Enroll Again.\n\nThis tip is for those 40,000 people who signed up for insurance through the marketplace during the first enrollment period.\n\nEven if you like the plan you bought, you have to get back on healthcare dot gov and resubmit your data. Lisa Guertin, president of Anthem in New Hampshire, says if you don\u2019t, you may be in for a tax headache next year.\n\n\"If you are getting a subsidy, it\u2019s extremely important to make sure you update your information so you get the right subsidy this year\" says Guertin. \"If you don\u2019t do that there could be consequences of not getting as much as you should be getting and, in some cases, not getting anything at all.\"\n\nSmall businesses looking for advice on Obamacare sign-ups? Listen to this...\n\nAnd if you are starting to feel a little overwhelmed with all this information, the next tip is for you.\n\nTip #5: Don\u2019t Delay. Act Now.\n\nOpen enrollment ends February 15. But if you want coverage for January 1, you need to sign up by December 15.\n\n\"Waiting until the last minute is a very bad idea because the volumes are going to be very high,\" says Tom Porlicelli, CEO of Minuteman Health, another co-op joining the marketplace. \"It\u2019s also going to be harder to find someone who has the time to help you.\"\n\nInsurance broker Stephanie Dunn says her schedule is already swamped.\n\n\"All agents expect to be so busy doing open enrollments, that they\u2019re not going to be able to be running around all over hill and dale from town to town to town. And so a lot of times phone appointments are the way to go if you\u2019re not local to an office,\" says Dunn.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true for those folks in rural areas. We'll give Dunn the last word, and final tip.\n\n\"There certainly may be a lot of emotion attached to this Obamacare issue for all of us,\" says Dunn. \"However, it\u2019s here, so we all have to deal with it.\"\n\nLike it or not, there\u2019s nothing confusing about that.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Saturday marked the beginning of the second round of open enrollment for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
