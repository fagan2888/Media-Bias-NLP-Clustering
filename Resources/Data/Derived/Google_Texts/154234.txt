This event is the 20th stop on the 27-circuit tour, positioning Tulsa as a key event for determining the PBR champion later in the year.

That position has led to some exciting moments in bull riding, with Tulsa getting the chance to see rider J.B. Mauney ride one of the toughest bulls on the tour before winning the championship later that year, and a year later to see that bull, Bushwacker, retire.

Several former world champions will be at the two-night Tulsa event, as well as Oklahoma natives Ryan Dirteater and L.J. Jenkins.
