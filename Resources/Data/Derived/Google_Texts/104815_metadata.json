Lang, who is 49 and lives in Fort Mills, S.C., is slowly losing his eyesight to diabetes. Without surgery, he\u2019ll go blind. Those grim facts notwithstanding, some may not find Lang the most sympathetic candidate for charity.\n\nIn the first place, as some observers noted after reading about him in a Charlotte Observer story byAnn Doss Helms, he has a $300,000 home and a wife who doesn\u2019t work; why, they ask, can\u2019t he raise the money from them? In the second place, Lang has had diabetes for years, but has not always followed doctor\u2019s advice to control it. In the third place, he\u2019s a smoker who is still smoking despite his bleak prognosis.\n\nBut there\u2019s a bigger reason some may find it difficult to feel his pain and therein lies a tale. It seems Lang, who is a Republican, knew the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the dreaded \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 required him to buy health insurance, but he refused to do so. He figured he was making a pretty good living as a self-employed handyman and prided himself on paying his own medical bills.\n\nThen came 10 days of grinding headaches, an emergency room visit and a diagnosis that he\u2019d suffered a series of mini-strokes. Then came $9,000 in medical bills, an empty savings account, bleeding in his eyes, a partially-detached retina and an inability to work.\n\nAt which point he tried to buy him some \u201cObamacare\u201d only to discover that he was outside the open enrollment period and that with zero income, he makes too little to get a federal subsidy that would help him buy a private policy. \u201cObamacare\u201d offers expanded Medicaid coverage to help people like him, but South Carolina is one of 21 Republican-led states that have refused to participate in that program.\n\nSo Lang is, well \u2026 out of luck. And who does he blame for that state of affairs? Well obviously, it\u2019s President Obama\u2019s fault for passing flawed legislation.\n\nYou see, though he refused to buy coverage, Lang thought it would be available to him in an emergency. His wife, Mary, feels he \u201cshould be at the front of the line, because he doesn\u2019t work and because he has medical issues.\u201d Which is not unlike refusing to buy auto insurance, but expecting Geico to sell you a policy after you total the Toyota.\n\nStill, if Lang doesn\u2019t exactly tug at your heart like baby seals do, he is getting traction. At this writing, he\u2019s over half way to his goal, most of it raised from liberals taking the occasion to rip his and his party\u2019s failings. Many skip the donation and go straight to the scorn.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d writes Joel, \u201cI\u2019m way too busy thinking only about myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall Mitt Romney or Jeb Bush,\u201d writes Jeannie, \u201cthey have plenty of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to donate enough to really help you out,\u201d writes Ed, \u201cbut I can\u2019t figure out how to get GoFundMe to accept bootstraps.\u201d\n\nLang\u2019s response? \u201cIt turned into a political thing,\u201d he complained. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d\n\nBut how could it not be political? Lang\u2019s party claimed healthcare reform would send death panels after Nana, that \u201cself-reliance\u201d could cure cancer, that emergency rooms provided all the healthcare poor people need. In a nation of government-funded police, fire departments, schools, libraries and road maintenance, it argued that government-funded health care was somehow a moral crime.\n\nLang apparently bought it all. Now, the bill comes due, and whatever he thought of \u201cObamacare\u201d as a model for financing healthcare, surely Lang must concede that GoFundMe is even worse. Yet, that\u2019s the fix he finds himself in.\n\nSo yes, he\u2019d like you to send him some money.
