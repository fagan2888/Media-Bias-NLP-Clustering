(Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nAt the defense's rate, Florence might need new helmets by the end of the season.\n\nLike many high school teams, they get stickers for achieving certain goals. And in Friday night's 12-0 win against Tri-Peaks League foe Manitou Springs, they reached quite a few.\n\nLinebacker Cory Simolon said the team gets them for: a shutout, a three and out on the first drive of the first half, the same for the second half, a three-turnover game, five tackles behind the line of scrimmage, and a win.\n\nThey achieved all but one.\n\nThe unit had one interception, one fumble and three turnovers on downs. They also forced a three and out on the first drive of the first half, had 13 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, got the shutout and the win.\n\nIt was the unit's first shutout since Oct. 18, 2013, when it held Dolores Huerta scoreless. The Scorpions aren't close to the caliber team the Mustangs are, though.\n\nTough schedules, tough teams\n\nBoth Florence and Manitou Springs have played their share of big games against big-name teams this season.\n\nThey have each played Faith Christian, who earlier this season was ranked tops in the Class 2A Associated Press media poll. Florence won its game by six, and Manitou Springs lost its game by three.\n\nThe Mustangs also have losses against Class 1A power Buena Vista, 2A eighth-ranked Eaton, La Junta, and now fourth-ranked Florence.\n\n\"They haven't played any cupcakes either,\" Mustangs coach Monte Gutowski said. \"They stacked their schedule just as we did. I think that showed tonight because that was a physical freaking football game.\"\n\nDuring non-league games, Florence played three Class 3A teams along with Faith Christian.\n\nThe Mustangs entered the season ranked one spot higher than the Huskies. Manitou Springs beat Florence last year and won the T-PL.\n\nSimolon turning into offensive weapon\n\nAlec Lucero during the Florence Huskies' 12-0 win against the Manitou Springs Mustangs on Friday night at Husky Stadium. (Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nOffensive coordinator Darin Serfoss found himself a little surprise.\n\nWhen freshman tight end Jeremiah Spears went down with an injury, it forced the Huskies to move slightly out of their platoon system of each player only playing offense or defense.\n\nSerfoss acquired the services of Simolon, who has turned in several solid performances. He had a 25-yard touchdown reception Friday night, and in past games he's rushed the ball effectively, once for a 30-yard touchdown.\n\nSimolon also plays on special teams. The only time he came out of Friday night's game, he said, was for the team's three kickoffs.\n\n\"It's killer. It takes it out of you,\" he said.\n\n\"He works hard each week,\" head coach Jeremy Nix said about Simolon. \"We're a little beat up right now, we're trying to heal up some guys. He's got to go both ways right now, but we're hoping that doesn't have to happen too much longer.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_26662281/florence-huskies-defense-meets-goals-t-pl-win", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26662281:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-04T16:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "At the defense's rate, Florence might need new helmets by the end of the season.\n\n\nLike many high school teams, they get stickers for achieving certain goals.", "title": "Florence Huskies' defense meets goals in T-PL win against Manitou Springs Mustangs", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_26662281/florence-huskies-defense-meets-goals-t-pl-win", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1003/20141003__07drffow~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "modificationDate": "2014-10-03T23:51:48-0600", "endDate": "2024-10-03T23:50:13-0600", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record", "byline": "By Brandon Hopperhopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2014-10-03T23:52:36-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-04T16:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Florence Huskies' defense meets goals in T-PL win against Manitou Springs Mustangs", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1003/20141003__07drffow~2_300.jpg", "description": "At the defense's rate, Florence might need new helmets by the end of the season.\n\n\nLike many high school teams, they get stickers for achieving certain goals.", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.tags": "Florence Huskies, Manitou Springs Mustangs", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_26662281/florence-huskies-defense-meets-goals-t-pl-win", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1003/20141003__07drffow~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "At the defense's rate, Florence might need new helmets by the end of the season.\n\n\nLike many high school teams, they get stickers for achieving certain goals.", "title": "Florence Huskies' defense meets goals in T-PL win against Manitou Springs Mustangs"}, "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1003/20141003__07drffow~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4c1\"", "article_summary": "Florence notches shutout of Manitou SpringsJared Bombardier during the Florence Huskies' 12-0 win against the Manitou Springs Mustangs on Friday night at Husky Stadium.\nSimolon turning into offensive weaponAlec Lucero during the Florence Huskies' 12-0 win against the Manitou Springs Mustangs on Friday night at Husky Stadium.\nAnd in Friday night's 12-0 win against Tri-Peaks League foe Manitou Springs, they reached quite a few.\nTough schedules, tough teamsBoth Florence and Manitou Springs have played their share of big games against big-name teams this season.\nManitou Springs beat Florence last year and won the T-PL."}
