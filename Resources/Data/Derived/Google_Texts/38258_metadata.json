The rate of abortions among this group also fell by 42 percent. Births to unmarried women under 25 who have not finished high school also plummeted.\n\nTwo factors have been highlighted from the study. The fact the contraception was free, and that long acting reversible contraception, referred to as LARC, and with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, appears to be growing in popularity with younger women. This is true at the Springfield clinic of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.\n\n\"Since 2009, PPLM's Springfield health center has seen the number of LARCs provided to patients triple - an increase that has been particularly profound among its patients ages 19 and younger,\" said Danielle Roncari, PPLM's medical director.\n\nRoncari added that the \"findings from Colorado's initiative are impressive and clearly demonstrate the tremendous public health benefits that are achieved when every woman has true access to the full range of contraceptive options, including long acting reversible contraception.\"\n\n\"PPLM is committed to providing every patient the care and information she needs to make an informed decision about which birth control method is best for her,\" said Roncari, referring to the fact that the Springfield clinic offers a range, including birth control methods in the form of implants, pills and shots as, well as fertility awareness.\n\nTeen birth rates have been decreasing in Massachusetts (pdf) over several decades, and the commonwealth has one of the lowest rates in the country.\n\nHolyoke has the highest teen birth rate in the state, and Springfield is second, though there are ongoing efforts to address reduce this by 10 percent by over the next five years.\n\nImplants and intrauterine devices are the most effective reversible methods of birth control. An IUD is a small, T-shaped, plastic device that is inserted into and left inside the uterus, in some cases for 10 years. The birth control implant is a small flexible rod that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm for up to three years.\n\nThese methods can be costly and not every federally qualified health center offers on-site contraceptive implants, even though free contraception is mandated under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Colorado study was funded by Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Anne-Gerard Flynn | aflynn@repub.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Massachusetts, Springfield, Colorado, The New York Times, birth-controle, contraception, health-care, health-headlines, planned-parenthood, news", "title": "Planned Parenthood's Springfield clinic sees growing demand for long acting contraception", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Planned Parenthood\\u0027s Springfield clinic sees growing demand for long acting contraception\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/07/planned_parenthoods_springfield_clinic_sees_growing_demand_for_long_acting_contraception.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/07/08/18278662-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16452757\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-09T13:11:05Z\", \"author\": \"Anne-Gerard Flynn | aflynn@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"birth-controle\",\"contraception\",\"health-care\",\"health-headlines\",\"planned-parenthood\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@masslivenews", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/07/08/18278662-standard.jpg", "description": "Colorado study credits its popularity with significant drop in birth rates among teens.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aflynn2"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, July 09, 2015,  9:09 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Planned Parenthood sees long term birth control demand\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/breakingnews/photo/2015/07/08/plannedparenthoodjpg-872109e54254dc6d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"aflynn\", \"author_nickname\": \"Anne-Gerard Flynn | aflynn@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"2776\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Colorado study credits its popularity with significant drop in birth rates among teens.", "title": "Planned Parenthood's Springfield clinic sees growing demand for long acting contraception", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/07/planned_parenthoods_springfield_clinic_sees_growing_demand_for_long_acting_contraception.html", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/07/08/18278662-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, July 09, 2015,  9:04 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Colorado study credits its popularity with significant drop in birth rates among teens."}, "article_summary": "The birth control implant is a small flexible rod that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm for up to three years.\nImplants and intrauterine devices are the most effective reversible methods of birth control.\nThe fact the contraception was free, and that long acting reversible contraception, referred to as LARC, and with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, appears to be growing in popularity with younger women.\nThese methods can be costly and not every federally qualified health center offers on-site contraceptive implants, even though free contraception is mandated under the Affordable Care Act.\n\"Since 2009, PPLM's Springfield health center has seen the number of LARCs provided to patients triple - an increase that has been particularly profound among its patients ages 19 and younger,\" said Danielle Roncari, PPLM's medical director."}
