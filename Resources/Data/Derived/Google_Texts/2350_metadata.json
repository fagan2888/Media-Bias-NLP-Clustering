He has also announced that he\u2019ll leave the Senate at the end of his term in early 2017.Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), one of Yucca\u2019s most vocal supporters in the House and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Environment and Economy subpanel, has long been open to negotiating incentives, in addition to the funds that have already been paid locally to monitor the area.\u201cThese funds allow those closest to the project to actively participate in the debate and continued study of the site,\u201d Shimkus wrote in April in the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\u201cBeyond these established benefits, I\u2019ve also personally offered to discuss additional benefits with state, local and tribal leaders \u2014 including financial, infrastructure, transportation and resource requests,\u201d he said.Some of the incentives that Nevadans might be open to would be building the proposed Interstate 11 between Las Vegas and Phoenix, getting more rights to the water in the Colorado River or establishing a nuclear research hub.Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), another vocal Yucca backer, is also supportive of the idea.Will Boyington, a spokesman for Newhouse, said the congressman \u201chas expressed general support for potential accommodations for the state but would wait for a specific proposal to comment.\u201dBecause of its ardent opposition to Yucca as a nuclear waste site, the state has historically not been open to an incentives plan. But that started to change in March, when freshman Rep. Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.) wrote in the Review-Journal that the state should be open to discussing benefits.\u201cWhat if Nevada were to receive a larger share of water rights from the Colorado River, or obtain greater leverage in our quest for better transportation and infrastructure funding across the state,\u201d he wrote.He also mentioned school funding and resources to create improve scientific research at the state\u2019s university system.Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno, said Hardy allowed a small amount of discussion in the state about Yucca that had not happened in decades.\u201cHardy kind of opens a crack in the door, to where people are now at least talking about it, barely,\u201d he said.Most of Nevada\u2019s leaders and representatives immediately shot back at Hardy and said that Yucca \u2014 benefits or no \u2014 is going nowhere in the state.\u201cWhen it comes to protecting the health and safety of Nevadans from a potential environmental catastrophe, there is no benefit worth bargaining for,\u201d Reid said in a statement.\u201cThe entire conversation is a non-starter,\u201d said Caitlin Teare, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.).Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Reid, similarly called the idea a \u201cnon-starter.\u201dStill, Herzik said there\u2019s reason to be optimistic that Nevada is slightly warming to the idea of incentives.\u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve had any kind of discussion about the possibility of benefits,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is something new,\u201d Herzik said of Hardy\u2019s opinion piece. \u201cIt\u2019s very modest, but compared to where we were on this issue, it is a change.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of America's Nuclear Energy Future series, sponsored by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
