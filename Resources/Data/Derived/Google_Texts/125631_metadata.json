The region\u2019s Shiite powerhouse, Iran, looms as a potential key backer.\n\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz said the United States was \u201cconcerned with this unilateral step\u201d but insisted that the Houthis\u2019 declaration as the true government of Yemen after a four-month insurrection would not affect U.S. counterterrorism efforts there.\n\nHouthi supporters filled the central square in Sana, the Yemeni capital, to celebrate the culmination of their coup. They exploded firecrackers and waved banners bearing their slogan \u201cDeath to America, death to Israel, a curse on the Jews and victory to Islam.\u201d\n\nHouthi leaders declared that their Revolutionary Committee \u2014 a panel of top security and intelligence officials \u2014 was Yemen\u2019s new governing authority.\n\nThe declaration, read on the rebels\u2019 Al-Masseria TV network, envisaged \u201ca new era that will take Yemen to safe shores.\u201d\n\nBut the Houthis, traditionally based in Yemen\u2019s north bordering Saudi Arabia, don\u2019t control the entire country. Secessionist forces and powerful tribes in the largely Sunni south are likely to confront with violence any effort by the Houthis to exert control there.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shiite rebels in Yemen dissolve parliament in government takeover", "title": "Shiite rebels in Yemen dissolve parliament in government takeover", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/06/shiite-rebels-in-yemen-dissolve-parliament-in-government-takeover/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150206__20150207_A17_ND07YEMENp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150206__20150207_A17_ND07YEMENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-06T18:22:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T00:19:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42b9\"", "article_summary": "SANA, Yemen \u2014 Yemen\u2019s Shiite rebels proclaimed a formal takeover of the Arab nation Friday, dissolving parliament in a move that completes their power grab in the region\u2019s poorest nation where an al-Qaeda terrorist offshoot flourishes.\nThe unrest could strengthen Yemen\u2019s al-Qaeda branch, considered the world\u2019s most dangerous wing of the terrorism movement, and complicate U.S. counter-terrorism operations.\nAlthough Houthi rebels are bitter enemies to al-Qaeda, they also are hostile to the United States and the predominantly Sunni Saudis.\nDemonstrators protested the rebels\u2019 move in rallies in several cities, raising fears of a full-blown sectarian conflict between Yemen\u2019s new Shiite tribal rulers, known as Houthis, and the disenfranchised Sunni majority.\nHouthi supporters filled the central square in Sana, the Yemeni capital, to celebrate the culmination of their coup."}
