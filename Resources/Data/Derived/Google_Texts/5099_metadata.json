They called it \u201cAirbed and Breakfast\u201d and Gebbia and Chesky made $1,000 on the first weekend. Airbnb was then launched with Mr Chesky as chief executive, Mr Gebbia as chief product officer and Mr Blecharczyk as chief technology officer.\n\nAirbnb now lists nearly 500,000 properties, including 20,000 in the UK, and has found accommodation for 9m guests, including 5m in the past nine months. It says 150,000 guests stay in one of its members\u2019 properties every night.\n\nMr Blecharczyk told The Sunday Telegraph: \u201cInterContinental and Hilton have more than 650,000 rooms. We have 500,000, though they have a much higher occupancy rate.\u201d\n\nAsked if he expects Airbnb to overtake the two groups next year, he replied \u201cyes\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our historical growth curve, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change very quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing bookings and revenues two to three times every year and I would expect that to continue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Room-letting network plans to overtake...", "title": "Airbnb Is On Track To Be The World's Largest Hotelier", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-largest-hotelier-2013-11", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/528812d8ecad049f0c842e7f-506-253/airbnb-is-on-track-to-be-the-worlds-largest-hotelier.jpg", "site": "bi_contributors", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "retail-contributor,retail,sai,main-contributor", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "The Telegraph, AirBnB, Hotels, Andrew Cave", "description": "Room-letting network plans to overtake...", "author": "Andrew Cave, The Telegraph", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-16", "sailthru.title": "Airbnb Is On Track To Be The World's Largest Hotelier", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/528812d8ecad049f0c842e7f-50-50/airbnb-is-on-track-to-be-the-worlds-largest-hotelier.jpg", "news_keywords": "The Telegraph, AirBnB, Hotels, Andrew Cave", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/528812d8ecad049f0c842e7f/airbnb-is-on-track-to-be-the-worlds-largest-hotelier.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-11-16", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "sailthru.description": "Room-letting network plans to overtake...", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Room-letting network plans to overtake...", "title": "Airbnb Is On Track To Be The World's Largest Hotelier", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-largest-hotelier-2013-11", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/528812d8ecad049f0c842e7f-1190-625/airbnb-is-on-track-to-be-the-worlds-largest-hotelier.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Airbnb Is On Track To Be The World's Largest Hotelier", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/528812d8ecad049f0c842e7f/airbnb-is-on-track-to-be-the-worlds-largest-hotelier.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "retail-contributor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb99d\"", "article_summary": "Airbnb was then launched with Mr Chesky as chief executive, Mr Gebbia as chief product officer and Mr Blecharczyk as chief technology officer.\nRoom-letting network plans to overtake InterContinental Hotels Group and Hilton Worldwide next yearAirbnb, the room-letting network regarded as one of Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest properties, expects to overtake InterContinental Hotels Group and Hilton Worldwide to become the world\u2019s largest hotelier next year.\nThe company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, who met when Mr Blecharczyk answered an advert for a roommate.\nMr Blecharczyk told The Sunday Telegraph: \u201cInterContinental and Hilton have more than 650,000 rooms.\nThey called it \u201cAirbed and Breakfast\u201d and Gebbia and Chesky made $1,000 on the first weekend."}
