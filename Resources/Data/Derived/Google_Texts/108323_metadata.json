And compliance issues come up in those expanded business models.\u201d\n\nBecause of this emerging dynamic, Stone said, \u201cCCOs really can be an invaluable partner to the CFO like never before.\u201d\n\nAnother area in which a CCO can impact the performance of a healthcare organization is by ensuring compliance with regulations to protect patient records, Stone says.\n\n\u201cPrivacy and confidentiality are core to the integrity of a healthcare organization,\u201d he said.\n\n[See also: Strategic concerns drive healthcare M&A.]\n\nEven though CCOs have no revenue-generating responsibilities, Stone said, they perform a valuable function in that area.\n\n\u201cMany of the industry-specific regulations promulgated by federal and state regulators affect reimbursement,\u201d he said. \u201cMedicare regulations from CMS govern how you can bill and collect, what services you can bill and collect for, and what types of relationships you can have with physicians.\u201d\n\nStone says that while the role of CCO is not new, it is evolving to meet the shifting healthcare landscape.\n\n\u201cBest practices are emerging,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/growing-profile-hospitals-chief-compliance-officer", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/responsibilities.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Seismic changes altering the healthcare industry are creating an increasing number of compliance requirements for hospitals and health systems to meet.
