It is deeply disturbing to read the stories outlined by Lynn M. Paltrow and Jeanne Flavin (\u201cPregnant, and No Civil Rights,\u201d Op-Ed, Nov. 8), of women forced to undergo cesarean sections, or prosecuted for \u201cattempted fetal homicide\u201d after falling down a flight of stairs, or jailed for second-degree murder because of unexplained vaginal bleeding that turned out to be a miscarriage.\n\nThese stories and others demonstrate failure in all four of these moral areas.\n\nLaws that criminalize pregnant women undermine their autonomy to make medical decisions that are right for them. They drive a wedge between patients and doctors and damage our ability to provide the best possible care.\n\nThese laws are harmful and dangerous to my patients\u2019 health and are deeply unjust, particularly because it is most often minority women and those living in poverty who are subjected to this unconstitutional treatment.\n\nNo one should lose her ability to make medical decisions or the right to bodily integrity because she is pregnant. When a woman is pregnant, she does not become less of a person herself.\n\nNANCY L. STANWOOD\n\nNew Haven, Nov. 11, 2014\n\nThe writer is board chairwoman of Physicians for Reproductive Health.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThe report of women having forced cesarean sections shines light on the concept of patient autonomy and informed consent. Informed consent for a procedure requires that the patient understand the risks and benefits and consent to the procedure.\n\nThis fundamental ethics principle is universally accepted by doctors and is codified in the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics and in the federal regulations about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf doctors ignore this basic principle of shared decision-making, they become mere technicians working at the behest of third parties. Judges and courts do not make diagnoses or treat patients. Doctors should not treat patients in any nonemergency situation (including under a court order) in the absence of a valid informed consent.\n\nHERBERT RAKATANSKY\n\nProvidence, R.I., Nov. 9, 2014\n\nThe writer is clinical professor emeritus of medicine at Brown University.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAll the case law discussed in the article is premised on the proposition that the state has a right to regulate pregnancy that trumps any right to privacy.\n\nThis is a two-edged sword, because the right to regulate gives the state a right to preserve a pregnancy but also to require the termination of a pregnancy.\n\nIt is best not to allow the state the right to meddle with reproduction but to leave the right to privacy intact.\n\nNEAL F. DEVITT\n\nSanta Fe, N.M., Nov. 9, 2014\n\nThe writer practices family medicine.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141112191714, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors discuss medical ethics and the concepts of patient autonomy and informed consent.", "title": "The Civil Rights of Pregnant Women", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/opinion/the-civil-rights-of-pregnant-women.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003231258"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/opinion/the-civil-rights-of-pregnant-women.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003231258", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/opinion/the-civil-rights-of-pregnant-women.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "The Civil Rights of Pregnant Women", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 12, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Pregnancy and Childbirth,Women's Rights,Women and Girls,Civil Rights and Liberties,Law and Legislation", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Doctors discuss medical ethics and the concepts of patient autonomy and informed consent.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Doctors discuss medical ethics and the concepts of patient autonomy and informed consent.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 12, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-11-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Law and Legislation", "published": "2014-11-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "l13pregnant", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141113000002, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/opinion/the-civil-rights-of-pregnant-women.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Doctors discuss medical ethics and the concepts of patient autonomy and informed consent.", "title": "The Civil Rights of Pregnant Women"}, "pdate": 20141112, "des": "Law and Legislation", "articleid": 100000003231258, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Civil Rights of Pregnant Women", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c02\"", "article_summary": "Laws that criminalize pregnant women undermine their autonomy to make medical decisions that are right for them.\nNo one should lose her ability to make medical decisions or the right to bodily integrity because she is pregnant.\nIt is best not to allow the state the right to meddle with reproduction but to leave the right to privacy intact.\nThey drive a wedge between patients and doctors and damage our ability to provide the best possible care.\nWhen a woman is pregnant, she does not become less of a person herself."}
