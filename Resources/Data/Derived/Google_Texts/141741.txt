Could this be a look at the Broncos’ future?

Late in the fourth quarter Saturday on fourth-and-2 at the Chiefs’ 7-yard line, Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler spins out of Kansas City pressure and connects with Andre Caldwell in the end zone for a touchdown.

The score cut Kansas City’s lead down to 29-13 with 1:45 to go in the game, which would end up being the final score.

For his efforts, Osweiler finished the game completing 14-of-24 passes for 146 yards, one TD and one interception.
