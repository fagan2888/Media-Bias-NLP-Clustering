OK? It's just a fact\u201d, said Kasich.\n\nKasich's attack was in response to Jeb Bush\u2019s attack, saying that Kasich expanded Medicaid in Ohio and embraced \"Obamacare\". The word \u201cObamacare\u201d sends shivers down the spines of Republicans when its pointed out that they embraced it to their voter base. When Jeb Bush was Governor there was no Obamacare, but that did not stop him from expanding Florida\u2019s Medicaid program to help the sick and the poor.\n\nAccording to The Urban Institute report in 2002, Florida\u2019s Medicaid budget did rise rapidly during Bush\u2019s first term, largely due to more spending on long-term care. The report says that Florida had \"a full-blown crisis\" in nursing homes.\n\n\"Chronic staffing shortages led to an erosion in quality of care, which in turn led to lawsuits that resulted in extremely large awards for complainants and skyrocketing liability insurance rates for the industry,\" the report said.\n\nIn 2013, Governor Kasich expanded Medicaid in Ohio over the objections of republican legislators in his state, and in the debate this past Saturday, he was asked how the \u201cgrowth\u201d in the \u201cfederal welfare program\u201d fits with conservative ideals of \u201csmall government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they don't live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons and we save $22,500 a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess what else? They get their lives back. And the working poor, they're now getting health care. And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer,\u201d said Kasich.\n\nIf you are asking yourself, how come two Presidential candidates are attacking each other for helping the sick and the poor with healthcare? Or how can helping the sick and the poor be seen as a bad thing by two Christians and their base of voters who are also mostly Christians? Then you\u2019re most likely not a Republican.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the last Republican Presidential Debate on Feb.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/kasich-and-bush-attack-each-other-over-helping-poor-people-with-healthcare", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/c3/76/c376e2216ea48ce7d86b723a23c6ad01.jpg?itok=tLI737gy", "type": "article", "title": "Kasich and Bush attack each other over helping poor people with healthcare"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the last Republican Presidential Debate on Feb.", "creator": "@YodasWorld", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/c3/76/c376e2216ea48ce7d86b723a23c6ad01.jpg?itok=tLI737gy", "title": "Kasich and Bush attack each other over helping poor people with healthcare", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2016-02-17T07:28:10-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Elections Topics, 2016 Presidential Election, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Medicaid, Republican Debate", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-17T07:28"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ea6\"", "article_summary": "Kasich's attack was in response to Jeb Bush\u2019s attack, saying that Kasich expanded Medicaid in Ohio and embraced \"Obamacare\".\nIf you are asking yourself, how come two Presidential candidates are attacking each other for helping the sick and the poor with healthcare?\nIn the last Republican Presidential Debate on Feb. 13, in South Carolina, Governor John Kasich (R-OH) and former Governor Jeb Bush (R-FL) attacked each other for helping the sick and the poor with healthcare by expanding Medicaid in each of their states.\nWhen Jeb Bush was Governor there was no Obamacare, but that did not stop him from expanding Florida\u2019s Medicaid program to help the sick and the poor.\n\u201cFirst of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand (sic) his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine."}
