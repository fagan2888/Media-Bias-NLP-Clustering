Joe Swan, who sits on the corporation\u2019s board, said it was \u201cinadequate\u201d making the senior wait so long.\n\nNot until three days ago did the exterminator show up to inspect the apartment.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed,\u201d said Swan, who\u2019s been on the board since before it adopted a strict bed-bug policy in 2011.\n\nSunday, Woolner said he was told the service would return later this week but his place hadn\u2019t been treated yet.\n\n\u201cThe things are driving me up the bloody wall \u2014 there\u2019s more every day,\u201d Woolner said as a reporter toured his apartment. He pulled up his pant leg to reveal dozens of bites above his sock.\n\n\u201cYou see them in there, running around like a bunch of scared rabbits \u2014 more and more every day,\u201d he added, motioning toward the tub that was crawling with the tiny insects that feed on blood.\n\nSwan, along with housing corporation board member Bob Sexsmith and chair Doug Reycraft, said property managers are required to respond to bed bug complaints immediately.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is within 24 hours we\u2019d have an investigation and an action plan for it,\u201d Swan said.\n\nThat\u2019s the expectation, housing executive director Steve Matthews said.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to this man and anybody dealing with these things,\u201d said Matthews. \u201cI can look into the specific circumstance . . . these things are awful and we feel so bad for our tenants.\u201d\n\nThe housing corporation, the region\u2019s largest provider of rent-geared-to-income housing, with nearly 3,300 units, claims to have knocked down a once-spiralling bed bug problem that erupted in 2011/2012, as the critters made a nasty comeback in apartment buildings and hotels across North America.\n\nSince then, the agency\u2019s pest control budget has ballooned to about $325,000 from about $80,000, with most of it for eradicating bed bugs. It claims a success rate of more than 80%.\n\nBut the get-tough policy clearly wasn\u2019t followed at Woolner\u2019s high-rise at 304 Oxford. St.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re no fun to have around here,\u201d Woolner said, noting regular visitors quickly left after being bitten on his couch. Even his home care nurse refused to visit during the past two weeks, he said.\n\nA friend in the building said she first phoned its emergency maintenance line March 8, asking someone to help.\n\n\u201cI told them, this man is 81, he\u2019s had a stroke and his place is infested and I\u2019ve been bit,\u201d the woman said.\n\nShe said she called several days in a row after that, but still no one called Woolner.\n\nMeanwhile, Woolner also was calling. \u201cI called a week ago Sunday (March 9) night, then Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, then the next Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday this week,\u201d he said, rhyming off the phone number. \u201cOne time they hung up on me.\u201d\n\nFinally, fed up for Woolner and worried about their own units, other tenants say they notified the public health unit and faxed their property manager.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just disgusting how they handled this,\u201d said the friend who originally called.\n\njennifer.obrien@sunmedia.ca\n\n--- --- ---\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAID\n\n\u201cNobody should have to live like that . . .
