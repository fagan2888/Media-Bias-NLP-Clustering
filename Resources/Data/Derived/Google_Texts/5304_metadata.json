He went to a nearby McDonald\u2019s, which, despite the bloodshed just outside its doors, was still open for business. In the bathroom, Onyshchenko washed his face and picked human remains from his blood-matted hair.\n\nHe took a moment to compose himself, and then he walked back toward the sound of gunfire to rejoin the revolution.\n\nDays later, Ukraine\u2019s former president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia. The revolution was over\u2014but the celebration was short lived.\n\nWeeks later, Russia launched a hybrid warfare campaign in Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, ultimately annexing the territory in a move that a U.N. General Assembly resolution later declared illegal. The Kremlin also launched subversive military operations in eastern Ukraine, plunging the region into war.\n\nMore than two years after the revolution, a bespectacled Onyshchenko sits in an underground bar in Kyiv. He speaks quickly and fluently in English.\n\nOnyshchenko was haunted for months by his memories of the revolution. He had nightmares about the man shot by the sniper. The face is gray and lifeless; the man\u2019s hands are stretched out, reaching for something.\n\nThe nightmares have since faded, but so have Onyshchenko\u2019s revolutionary passion and his hope for Ukraine\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cDuring the revolution, especially at the most critical days, you could literally feel that special atmosphere in the air, and maybe for a second you could think, \u2018Now, as people are united so much, we can achieve anything, we can change the country,\u2019\u201d Onyshchenko said.\n\n\u201cBut if we throw away the emotions, I definitely knew that the revolution would only let us get rid of one, two, maybe three corrupted bastards,\u201d Onyshchenko said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t change the system, and definitely wouldn\u2019t destroy the \u2018Homo sovieticus\u2019 that is, unfortunately, still prospering among our people, especially those 40 plus years old. Nothing will change them. No revolution will explain to them that bribing a cop is bad, or taking a bribe is bad. I respect our nation, I really do. But it\u2019ll take lots and lots of time until something will really change.\u201d\n\nReality Check\n\nA string of recent events at home and abroad have strained Ukrainians\u2019 faith in the twin pillars of the 2014 revolution\u2014closer ties to Europe and the fight against corruption.\n\nIn the span of one week beginning April 6, Dutch voters rejected ratification of a long-awaited EU-Ukraine trade deal, putting Ukraine\u2019s aspirations of European integration in jeopardy; the Panama Papers exposed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s offshore assets, sparking a media firestorm in Ukraine; and Ukraine\u2019s prime minister resigned after months of political turmoil, sparking a political clash in the search for his replacement.\n\n>>>Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Calls It Quits, Pressure Mounts to Form New Coalition\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing war in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region is steadily worsening, and a ceasefire that never fully took hold is teetering on the edge of collapse.\n\n\u201cNo, of course the revolution didn\u2019t achieve its goals,\u201d Onyshchenko said. \u201cPeople are definitely frustrated, but they are too tired to make another revolution.\u201d\n\nThe April 6, Dutch referendum vote was a high profile stumble in Ukraine\u2019s incremental westward pivot, and was predictably lauded by the Kremlin. Yet, most Ukrainians and European political observers say a Continent-wide Eurosceptic movement fueled the rejection. Worries about refugees, terrorism, and economic malaise trumped any specific aversion to Ukraine, some claim.\n\n\u201cThe initiators are driven by anti-government and anti-EU feelings rather than by anti-Ukraine feelings,\u201dMarcel Van Herpen, director of the Cicero Foundation, a Dutch think tank, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThis movement is clearly a part of the broader anti-EU and anti-refugee movement in other EU countries,\u201d Van Herpen said. \u201cPeople are looking for simple, populist solutions\u2014close the door for refugees from Islamic countries, but also for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, the Panama Papers revealed that Poroshenko has assets in a holding company in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nSome politicians and media outlets accused the Ukrainian president of moving his money offshore to skirt paying taxes. Poroshenko denied wrongdoing, claiming he handed over control of his assets to a team of advisers after he took office in 2014. Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor said Poroshenko had not broken the law.\n\nDespite the media outcry, most Ukrainians shrugged off the allegations against Poroshenko with fatalistic indifference, reflecting an already crumbled confidence in the post-revolution government.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d said Bogdan Logvynenko, 27, a Ukrainian journalist and political activist, reacting to Poroshenko\u2019s inclusion in the Panama Papers. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy to give his business away when he became president. I don\u2019t agree with it, but I understand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing was shocking,\u201d Onyshchenko said. \u201cPoroshenko is an oligarch, and what oligarch wouldn\u2019t have an offshore account? The real disappointment was a few years ago when he was elected.\u201d\n\nAgents of Change\n\nLast week\u2019s referendum in the Netherlands was a symbolic blow to Ukraine because the EU-Ukraine trade pact in question was the original impetus for the 2014 revolution.\n\nIn November 2013, Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian former president, made a last minute decision to cancel ratifying the agreement in favor of closer ties with Russia, spurring protests on Kyiv\u2019s central square, the Maidan.\n\nThe pro-EU demonstrations\u2014originally called the \u201cEuroMaidan\u201d\u2014did not call for Yanukovych\u2019s ouster at first.\n\n\u201cWe were willing to wait until the next election to vote him out,\u201d said Dmytro Kryvonog, who participated in the protests, referring to Yanukovych. \u201cBut everything changed when they beat up the students.\u201d\n\nThe tipping point, those who took part in the revolution say, was when the Berkut (a now-disbanded special police force dating from the Soviet era) attacked protesters on Nov. 30, 2013.\n\nThe images of bloodied and terrified students, some helplessly sprawled on the ground in fetal positions as packs of Berkut laid into them with nightsticks, ignited pent up anti-government anger nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe protests became about the fact that you cannot beat up the students, it became about that,\u201d Onyshchenko said. \u201cIt started about the EU, but it became about us not being like Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much about Europe as about not being a part of Russia,\u201d Logvynenko told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cWe know what the Putin regime is, and no one wants that,\u201d Logvynenko said. \u201cWe saw the example of Belarus, and we saw that their freedoms disappeared. Yeah, the highest inspiration among my friends on the Maidan was to not be like Russia.\u201d\n\nAcross the country Ukrainians from a broad demographic scope, including those from both predominantly Ukrainian- and Russian-speaking areas, set off for Kyiv to join the gathering crowds on the Maidan. Those who couldn\u2019t travel organized local protests.\n\nThe \u201cEuroMaidan\u201d became known simply as the \u201cMaidan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not purely about the EU agreement, but it was a trigger,\u201d said Svitlana Kisilova, 26, a Ukrainian political activist who was active on the Maidan.\n\nKisilova added:\n\nFor me it was very important to live in a free democratic country, where you can openly express your views. That is why when Yanukovych tried to push on us by limiting our freedom of speech and being totalitarian I knew that my duty was to fight for my rights, my country and the things I believe in.\n\nLearning Curve\n\nMore than two years after the revolution, corruption still plagues Ukraine.\n\nPaying bribes is a fact of life, practically required for things like passing university exams, finding a parking spot, or seeing a doctor.\n\nMany Ukrainians acknowledge, however, that systemic corruption is not only a political problem. Some say the tolerance for corruption in day-to-day life is a cultural leftover from the Soviet era, when such practices were more about survival than greed.\n\nSome also blame a weak legacy of civil society institutions, as well as national journalism outlets, which operate more like mouthpieces for the various oligarchs that own them rather than watchdogs against government malfeasance.\n\n\u201cUkraine still has an enormous amount of problems and it will take us a lot of time to fight corruption, up and down, and vice versa; to teach people to be responsible for decisions they are making at the elections and to be responsible citizens,\u201d Kisilova said. \u201cWe have a very weak civil society and people\u2019s engagement into the public sphere is very low. But it\u2019s only the beginning of a new society in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe slow pace of change has dimmed support for Ukraine\u2019s post-revolution government. A Gallup poll released in December revealed that Ukrainians have less confidence in their government now than they did prior to the 2014 revolution.\n\n\u201cAnother challenge the Rada (Ukrainian parliament) faces is that many of the well-known activists who were elected on the wave of the Maidan are now realizing that political activism is not the same thing as governing and legislating,\u201d Luke Coffey, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s foreign policy center, said. \u201cSo there is a learning curve, which only adds to the existing challenges.\u201d\n\nThe New Normal\n\nDespite certain advances after the revolution, most Ukrainians\u2019 lives are now occupied with the day-to-day reality of existing on salaries that are worth one-quarter what they were two years ago, as well living in a country hounded by the omnipresent spectre of war and civil unrest.\n\nHowever, on the streets of Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, life appears to be improving. New coffee shops and restaurants seem to be popping up on every street corner. There are fresh art venues, a hipster movement has taken off, and many young people say they want their city to become the \u201cnew Berlin.\u201d\n\nBut most of the visible progress in Kyiv is a fa\u00e7ade. Across the Dnieper River from central Kyiv and its Orthodox cathedrals and blocks of colorful Stalinkas (neoclassical buildings built in the Stalin era) is what Kyivans call \u201csleepy town.\u201d\n\nThis part of Kyiv is a concrete and steel forest of endless rows of Khrushchyovkas\u2014the monolithic, drab apartment blocks that epitomize Soviet sprawl and enforced equality.\n\nDuring the workweek, the streets in central Kyiv are slow until about 10 a.m. while residents from \u201csleepy town\u201d commute in. Rent is too expensive for most Ukrainians to live in the city center.\n\nYet, Ferraris, Land Rovers, Mercedes, BMWs, Bugattis, and Bentleys are common sights on the streets of central Kyiv, a stark reminder of the extravagant lifestyles enjoyed by oligarchs, corrupt public officials and their families (the \u201cgolden children\u201d) while the rest of the country exists on an average income of about $175 a month.\n\nIn rural Ukraine, life is a step back in time. Many homes still have outhouses, livestock wander the streets, and the roads are potholed disasters liable to rip off on axle over 20 miles per hour.\n\nUkrainians describe the economic demographics of their country as the shape of an apple core\u2014broad at the top and the bottom of the economic spectrum, but with almost no middle class.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, civil society was stifled and it was all but impossible for citizens to question government authority and organize grassroots efforts to effect political change. Many say the legacy of Soviet civil society and what Ukrainians call the \u201costrich mentality\u201d (keep your head down and don\u2019t cause trouble) is a key obstacle to Ukraine\u2019s contemporary post-revolution progress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Helenka, a 23-year-old university student studying public health, said. \u201cI have friends who say they love their parents and grandparents, but they also admit that they\u2019re waiting for the day when those generations have died so that we can finally leave the Soviet past behind.\u201d\n\nAnd the War\n\nThe war against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine sucked the oxygen out of anti-corruption reforms after the 2014 revolution.\n\n\u201cUkrainians are learning that political reform while fighting a war is like building a ship while you\u2019re already at sea,\u201d Coffey said.\n\nInstead of anti-corruption housecleaning, political triage in Kyiv has favored pushing through emergency economic measures to avert an economic tailspin.\n\nAccording to government data, territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region accounted for 10 percent of Ukraine\u2019s pre-revolution GDP and about 15 percent of the country\u2019s industrial output.\n\nThe country\u2019s economy dropped 10 percent in 2015 and 6.8 percent the year prior. And the national currency, the hryvnia, has depreciated to one-quarter of its value against the dollar from before the revolution.\n\nDespite Ukraine\u2019s economic woes, some say the most damaging and least quantifiable consequence of the war has been the diverted energy and patriotism of those who protested on the Maidan.\n\nRather than holding political leaders accountable to their revolutionary promises, Ukraine\u2019s millennial generation, the driving force in 2014, has been focused on supporting the war effort.\n\nMillennials played a key role in forming the volunteer combat battalions that stepped in for a floundering regular military in the early days of the war. And the grassroots volunteer movement, which supports the war effort in myriad ways from building drones to providing post-traumatic stress counseling, is almost entirely dependent on the efforts of Ukrainians aged 18 to 35.\n\n\u201cThe past two years have been challenging for the Ukrainian generation of millennials,\u201d Iryna Fedets, 28, a research associate with the Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting, a Ukrainian think-tank, told The Daily Signal.\n\nFedets said, \u201cThe 2008 recession never really ended for them, as it turned into economic stagnation under Yanukovych, and later, Russian occupation of the Crimea and the war in the east brought down the economy throughout the country.\u201d\n\nStay or Go?\n\nOnyshchenko risked his life in the 2014 revolution. He has a job, a girlfriend, family, and friends in Ukraine. Yet, he admits, if given the chance to live abroad he would take it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say 80 percent of my friends are already abroad or plan to move abroad,\u201d Onyshchenko said.\n\nMany reform-minded Ukrainian millennials who played a key role in the 2014 revolution now want to leave Ukraine for a new life abroad. Others are determined to stay in Ukraine to fight for change.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I could do anything here before the revolution,\u201d Logvynenko said. \u201cNo one felt like you could change anything. Now change is possible, but many people don\u2019t see the opportunities.\u201d\n\nAt a high school classroom in Kyiv, when a group of students was asked if they would rather stay in Ukraine or move abroad, only one student out of a class of 17 preferred to live in Ukraine.\n\nThe combination of the war and the slow pace of reform has accelerated a trend of Ukrainian youth opting to leave the country.\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey jointly funded by the United Nations and the Ukrainian government, 55 percent of Ukrainians aged 14 to 35 said they would like to go abroad temporarily or for good.\n\nEconomic opportunities were the top reason for emigrating, followed by the explanation, \u201cthere is no real democracy and legality in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nWar was another key consideration: 34 percent of those surveyed cited the ongoing conflict in the Donbas as a reason for leaving the country.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014, the number of Ukrainian students studying abroad increased 79 percent, reflecting a trend that predates the 2014 revolution. In the past two years the number of Ukrainian students going abroad jumped 22 percent, comprising 47,724 Ukrainian students studying in 34 countries, according to CEDOS, a Kyiv-based think tank.\n\n\u201cThere had been the tendency of a gradual increase of Ukrainian students who were leaving to study abroad, which could be attributed to conventional negative factors: lower quality of education in Ukraine, less economic opportunities, corruption in education, and others,\u201d Fedets said.\n\n\u201cBut in 2014, new challenges\u2014the war, occupation, and crisis in the country\u2014contributed to the rise of the amount of Ukrainian students abroad,\u201d she added.\n\nUndimmed Hope\n\nDespite the post-revolution setbacks, there is a persistent grassroots reform effort in Ukraine, mainly led by millennials who have chosen to commit their futures to the country.\n\nLogvynenko was living in Poland during the Maidan revolution, but decided to return to Ukraine to take advantage of greater economic and political freedoms in the post-Yanukovych era. He says the revolution was a success.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy the revolution happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t happen I don\u2019t think I would ever have come back to Ukraine. And now I want to stay here.\u201d\n\nKisilova has also taken Ukraine\u2019s challenges in stride. She acknowledged that meaningful reforms would take years, perhaps decades to realize. But she pointed to the volunteer and pro-reform movements among millennials as proof that Ukraine is slowly making good on the promises of the 2014 revolution.\n\n\u201cFor the last one and a half years I have seen so many young and bright people who are working for our better future, and I believe we will have it,\u201d Kisilova told The Daily Signal. \u201cI know it\u2019s not enough to change everything in a year or two, because it is the beginning of a hard way.\u201d\n\nFedets added that despite limited economic opportunities and a shaky security situation, many millennials will opt to stay in Ukraine if they believe they have a realistic chance to effect change.\n\n\u201cFor reform-minded young people who would like to enter civil service and bring changes in Ukraine, a sign from the government that their initiatives will have impact and their ideas will be heard should be sufficient to be willing to stay in the country,\u201d Fedets said.\n\nPotential\n\nThe top of Institutskaya Street in central Kyiv has become hallowed ground.\n\nThe laid-brick street steeply ascends from the Maidan around the side of the monolithic Soviet-era Hotel Ukraine.\n\nTrees dot a patch of ground behind a small rise at the top of the street. This is where Berkut snipers gunned down protesters on Feb. 20, 2014. More than two years later, bullet holes still pockmark trees, street signs and planters.\n\nToday, where dozens of protesters vainly crouched behind sign poles and trees for safety, there is a monument to the fallen\u2014two rows of steel-framed photos beneath a cross.\n\nEvidence of the violence that happened here in 2014 seems impossibly out of place on this spring evening.\n\nIt has just rained. The sunset-illuminated clouds and the green of the budding leaves on the trees glow in that airbrushed, after-rain way.\n\nYoung couples stroll by, some holding hands, some pushing a stroller.\n\nA father leans down to his son, a toddler, pointing to the memorial, whispering something to him.\n\nTwo soldiers in uniform pause at the memorial; their faces and gaits are stiff. They stand silently for a moment before carrying on.\n\nEarlier, at a caf\u00e9 in downtown Kyiv, Onyshchenko adjusted his eyeglasses and explained the duality of his love for, and disappointment in, Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI was trying to make Ukraine better,\u201d Onyshchenko said. \u201cI grew up here; I love the people. But I don\u2019t think things will improve drastically in the next 10 to 15 years. At the same time, I want to see Ukraine be a success. There is so much potential here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A series of political crises has added to an ongoing decline in Ukrainians\u2019 confidence toward their post-revolution government.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A series of political crises has added to an ongoing decline in Ukrainians\u2019 confidence toward their post-revolution government.", "title": "Recent Crises Deal Ukraine a Reality Check", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160414_RealityCheck_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-15T12:53:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VsFg2O"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A series of political crises has added to an ongoing decline in Ukrainians\u2019 confidence toward their post-revolution government.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160414_RealityCheck_Peterson.jpg"}, "title": "Recent Crises Deal Ukraine a Reality Check", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2016-04-14T17:42:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T12:53:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Lavrov, U.S. Army, Victory Day, May 9, World War II, Great Patriotic War"}, "article_summary": "However, on the streets of Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, life appears to be improving.\nMany reform-minded Ukrainian millennials who played a key role in the 2014 revolution now want to leave Ukraine for a new life abroad.\nEarlier, at a caf\u00e9 in downtown Kyiv, Onyshchenko adjusted his eyeglasses and explained the duality of his love for, and disappointment in, Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin also launched subversive military operations in eastern Ukraine, plunging the region into war.\nEconomic opportunities were the top reason for emigrating, followed by the explanation, \u201cthere is no real democracy and legality in Ukraine\u201d."}
