TRENTON — Donald Trump denounced a new Pacific Rim trade agreement championed by President Obama on Tuesday night, saying during the fourth Republican presidential debate that it's "a horrible deal" that will lead lead to "nothing but trouble."

Obama has said the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a pact the U.S. negotiated with 12 countries in the Pacific Rim — will boost the U.S. economy and help provide more jobs for the middle class. Republican-controlled Congress still needs to ratify the agreement, but Obama, a Democrat, said he is optimistic it will pass.

But Trump compared the 6,000-page deal to Obamacare, saying it's "so complex that no one's read it."

"This is one of the worst trade deals," the billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino tycoon said during the main debate Tuesday in Milwaukee. "I would rather not have it. I'd rather make individual deal with individual countries."

Trump, a real estate magnate who leads the GOP race in many national polls, added that despite his opposition to the deal, he is in favor of free trade.

"I love trade," he said. "I'm a free trader, 100 percent."

Trump added the pact doesn't even addressed China's alleged currency manipulation. Earlier in the day, the businessman released a policy paper accusing China of manipulating currency and warning that he would stop that practice if he's elected to the White House.

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky interjected: "We might want to point out, China is not part of this deal."

Trump, however, said that the agreement will "allow China to take advantage of everybody."
