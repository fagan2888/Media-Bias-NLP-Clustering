(WBNG Binghamton) UHS is offering free help to Greater Binghamton residents who still need to sign up for a health care plan before the Feb. 15 deadline.

A UHS patient financial advocate will be available one-on-one to help UHS patients, and non-patients, at either Wilson Medical Center or Binghamton General Hospital.

The financial advocate will help guide anyone trying to enroll through nystateofhealth.ny.gov as well as healthcare.gov.

The 2015 deadline to sign up for a plan under the Affordable Care Act is Sunday, Feb. 15. But citizens can sign up for a qualified health plan any time of the year if they have had a life-changing event, such as a job loss.

Financial advocates can also assess if a person is eligible for Medicaid.
