THE CANADIAN PRESS/Michelle Siu\n\nTORONTO \u2013 The New Democrats and Liberals will elect their candidates for the upcoming byelection in a downtown Toronto riding Sunday, setting the stage for an epic battle in the next general election.\n\nThe New Democrats have two high-profile women vying for the nomination: Linda McQuaig, an author and intellectual, and former broadcast journalist and digital expert Jennifer Hollett, who both live in the riding.\n\nSusan Gapka, a singer and activist, is also on the ballot.\n\nThe Liberals, meanwhile, will choose between author and journalist Chrystia Freeland, bank executive Diana Burke and Todd Ross, a community organizer.\n\nThey\u2019re competing for the seat left vacant by former Liberal leader Bob Rae, who stepped down this summer.\n\nThe race in Toronto Centre is more important than most, said Peter Loewen, a politics professor at the University of Toronto. If the Opposition NDP is going to win a majority, they would do well to win this type of riding.\n\nBut it will be difficult to dislodge the Liberals, who\u2019ve held the riding for a long time, he added.\n\n\u201cIt gives us some bellwether or some reading of the NDP strength versus the Liberal strength,\u201d Loewen said.\n\nMcQuaig agrees. One of the reasons the race is attracting a lot of attention and well-known candidates is because it comes at such an \u201cinteresting, exciting moment in Canadian politics,\u201d she said.\n\nThe governing Conservatives are in serious trouble in the wake of the Senate expense scandal and seem to be unable to recover, she said. It creates an \u201cincredible dynamic\u201d of which of the two opposition parties will likely emerge as the alternative to the Tories in the next general election.\n\n\u201cSo it really does set up a kind of fascinating competition that could, in fact, create momentum for 2015,\u201d said McQuaig. \u201cLike whichever party wins \u2026 it would look like the pendulum was swinging towards that party.\u201d\n\nBut the big-name candidates have also attracted a lot of attention. Loewen noted that the NDP won many seats in Quebec in the 2011 election even though many of their candidates were inexperienced unknowns.\n\nSo the byelection will provide a sense of how the party will campaign with a well-known candidate, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is really a bit of a showcase of what the next election\u2019s going to look like, where Justin Trudeau\u2019s going to attract high level, quality candidates, like Chrystia Freeland, and Thomas Mulcair\u2019s going to do the same,\u201d Loewen said.\n\nHollett, who was inspired to run after Jack Layton\u2019s death, said she\u2019s not worried about competing against a star Liberal candidate if she wins the nomination.\n\n\u201cWe must not forget that at the doors, voters don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a journalist, or you went to Harvard, or you wrote a book,\u201d said Hollett, who graduated from the world-renown university.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care. They want to know that you\u2019re committed to representing them.\u201d\n\nBoth say affordable housing and reducing poverty are big issues in the densely populated riding, whose residents live in low-income neighbourhoods as well as some of the most expensive homes in the city.\n\nThe NDP are well-suited to replace the Liberals in Toronto-Centre because their policies address those concerns, McQuaig said.\n\n\u201cSo I would argue that this is fertile ground for the NDP,\u201d she said.\n\nFreeland \u2014 whose impressive resume includes degrees at both Harvard and Oxford, editor-at-large of Thomson Reuters and award-winning author \u2014 said she\u2019s discovered firsthand just how diverse the riding is.\n\nWhile door-knocking over the past few days, she\u2019s met a python expert, a Russian architect and poet and a former diplomat who divides his time between his art gallery and a business in Latin America.\n\nFreeland\u2019s top-notch campaign organizers \u2014 and her move back to Toronto from New York with her husband and three children \u2014 have raised questions about whether the nomination race is as open as Trudeau claimed.\n\nThere have been complaints about party rules preventing hundreds of supporters from casting a ballot.\n\nBurke signed up new members only to learn Aug. 27 that they couldn\u2019t vote if they hadn\u2019t met the Aug. 20 cutoff. She said the retroactive membership cutoff likely affected all of three candidates in the nomination race.\n\nRay Heard, who served as communications director for former prime minister John Turner and supports Burke, urged the party to extend the deadline, saying it would quash concerns that it was set to enhance Freeland\u2019s prospects.\n\nFreeland said it\u2019s wonderful how many people have rallied around her, but that\u2019s really due to her team\u2019s efforts \u2014 the \u201cbuilding of a new coalition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Toronto Centre, in some ways, is going to be the first act of the 2015 general election,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think the stakes are very high and it is a very consequential moment. And that, to me, is one of the reasons to do this.\u201d\n\nBurke and Ross may not have the same name recognition, but they do have strong community ties from being active in the riding for years.\n\nThe bank executive, who has lived in the riding for 25 years, said she has a lot to offer: real world business and technology experience as well as strong local ties.\n\n\u201cAs a senior executive at the Royal Bank, I had global responsibilities,\u201d Burke said.\n\n\u201cI was negotiating national agreements, multinational contracts and sitting on various international boards. So I have a pretty strong global network.\u201d\n\nRoss, a community organizer who works with a number of groups focusing on health care, aboriginal and LGBT issues, and human rights, has been politically active in the local scene for 19 years.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I think that it\u2019s important to be connected to the community, to understand the issues in the community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s my advantage and I think that members will be looking at that on Sunday.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "iPolitics", "description": "NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair, left, greets Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, right, as they attend the annual Church on Church Street service before Toronto\u2019s Pride Parade on Sunday, June 30, 2013.
