After murdering a dozen people and wounding 70 more in the Colorado movie theater massacre, James Holmes has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

A 12-member jury reached the decision unanimously after deliberating for nearly seven hours. CNN reports:

James Holmes will spend the rest of his life in prison for killing 12 people and wounding 70 more at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater.

A jury was unable Friday to reach a unanimous sentencing verdict, which results in life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty for Holmes, who had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2012 shootings. He was convicted last month of 24 counts of first-degree murder — two for each of the slain victims. The 12-member jury reached a decision after deliberating almost seven hours since late Thursday. As they walked back into the courtroom shortly after 5 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), they made no eye contact with anyone. Some had a grim face. Some were ashen.

The site goes on to discuss Holmes’ demeanor in the courtroom, and more:

Holmes stood with his hands in his pockets as Judge Carlos Samour read the sentencing verdicts. One female juror later told reporters that there was no way to resolve the disagreement on what the sentence should be. “There was one firm holdout against the death penalty and two … who were on the fence,” said the juror, who would not give her name. “I don’t know if they could have been swayed or not.” She said the graphic nature of the evidence made the 15-week trial very difficult. She called it a life-changing experience.

We hope that the victims and their families are able to find peace now. Leave your thoughts below.
