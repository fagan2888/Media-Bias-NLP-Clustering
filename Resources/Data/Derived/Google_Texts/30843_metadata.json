Free trade pacts as a possible venue of bipartisan collaboration might not work quite as well today as they did nearly a quarter-century ago between Republicans and Democrats\u2014or even between Democrats and Democrats. Although some congressional Republicans and Democrats are working cooperatively to get the Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty completed and approved by giving the President \u201cfast track\u201d authority, Zach Mitcham, the editor of the Madison County Journal, was reminded of the late comedian George Carlin\u2019s quip: \u201cBipartisanship usually means that a larger-than-usual deception is being carried out.\u201d\n\nNAFTA probably isn\u2019t a great example of free trade bipartisanship for Gingrich to cite, as many Democrats and much of organized labor think that NAFTA didn\u2019t quite pan out as President Clinton said it would. \u201cOver and over again, we\u2019ve been told that trade deals will create jobs and better protect workers and the environment,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey (D-PA). \u201cThose promises have never come to fruition.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t stopping President Obama, who has been raising the stakes for support of his 12-nation Pacific trade deal\u2014and sparking the ire of many of his politically progressive allies. In a speech to the Organizing for Action group that grew out of the Obama campaign\u2019s Organizing for America, the president was none too kind to the opponents of his free trade agenda, \u201cWhen people say this trade deal is bad for working families, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d the president said. \u201cI take that personally. My entire presidency has been about helping working families.\u201d\n\nThe president also compared claims about the lack of transparency in the trade agreement to Sarah Palin\u2019s charge that the Affordable Care Act contained requirements for \u201cdeath panels.\u201d His actual statement was a little worse than that, couched in language that reflected his displeasure with the critics:\n\n\u201cNow, some of these folks are friends of mine. I love them to death. (Laughter.) But in the same way that when I was arguing for health care reform I asked people to look at the facts\u2014somebody comes up with a slogan like \u2018Death Panel,\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. Look at the facts. The same thing is true on this. Look at the facts. Don\u2019t just throw a bunch of stuff out there and see if it sticks.\u201d\n\nAnd he challenged his critics to tell him specifically\u2014and accurately\u2014what was wrong with the Pacific trade deal, not to explain what was wrong with a quarter-century old NAFTA.\n\nWhere\u2019s the nonprofit angle in this? It is the relationship of the president to ostensibly independent nonprofits. Organizing for Action is the 501(c)(4) successor to Organizing for America, which was part of the Obama election campaign. Its website URL is none too subtle: barackobama.com. On the website, OFA\u2019s seven issue priorities do not include free trade, and even within the description of the issue most likely to reference trade, \u201ceconomic opportunity,\u201d the word \u201ctrade\u201d doesn\u2019t appear.\n\nIn a second speech to OFA, at the OFA dinner that followed the OFA summit where he issued his \u201cdeath panel\u201d comparison, the president joked about OFA\u2019s independent identity: \u201cWhat OFA has been able to accomplish so that now it\u2019s no longer about reelecting me\u2014it never technically was, but\u2014(laughter)\u2014or moving our agenda forward\u2014but I just wanted to make that point.\u201d\n\nWriting for the New Republic, Danny Vinik suggests that the actual impact of the Trans- Pacific Partnership is, at this moment, unclear\u2014probably not as big and good as the free-traders suggest, but not as big and bad as TPP opponents fear. What\u2019s really at stake is beyond the specifics of the TPP. It\u2019s a question of the trustworthiness of government and the transparency of the government\u2019s relationships with the big corporate interests that increasingly dominate government, regardless of the political parties occupying the White House and Congress.\n\nThe president\u2019s rallying of OFA to line up behind the TPP and fast-track trade authority contains echoes of the formation of the previously unknown Progressive Coalition for American Jobs, the ostensibly progressive coalition that has endorsed the president\u2019s trade position. OFA\u2019s presumed independence from the president is pretty thin, its openness about whether it has a specific position on trade is hard to determine, and its connection to the formation of PCAJ palpable (notably through the involvement of Mitch Stewart, who was in 2013 announced as the first director of Organizing for Action). As the president looks to OFA to rally to his TPP position, which seems a signpost for the president\u2019s increased isolation from other political progressives on the issue of this trade deal, it weakens OFA\u2019s ability to be credible in the independence of its community organizing around its core issues of climate change, immigration reform, expanding equality, preventing gun violence, health care, women\u2019s issues, and economic opportunity.\n\nWhat is happening to the president\u2019s position, and potentially to OFA, is that the trade pact is is about more than trade. It is about governance. Mitcham writes the following:\n\n\u201cOn matters of big money\u2014of true clout\u2014the two parties are more alike than different. And we\u2019re all going to pay for an increasingly rigged game. The fact that there\u2019s bipartisan support for a secretive deal like this should alert you to the fact that you\u2019re not being adequately represented\u2026If this was on the up and up, we could speak up on the details of what\u2019s in the deal and be heard and fairly considered on each point. That\u2019s how our government is supposed to work, right?\u201d\n\n\u2014Rick Cohen", "article_metadata": {"description": "The struggle within the Democratic Party over President Obama\u2019s plans for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fast-track trade authority has nonprofit dimensions, exemplified by President Obama\u2019s comments about TPP opponents at the summit of the Organizing for Action network.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/05/01/obama-s-tpp-testiness-emerges-at-organizing-for-action-summit/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "The struggle within the Democratic Party over President Obama\u2019s plans for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fast-track trade authority has nonprofit dimensions, exemplified by President Obama\u2019s comments about TPP opponents at the summit of the Organizing for Action network.", "title": "Obama\u2019s TPP Testiness Emerges at Organizing for Action Summit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2015/05/No-TPP2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-01T15:07:59+00:00", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/05/01/obama-s-tpp-testiness-emerges-at-organizing-for-action-summit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2015/05/No-TPP2.jpg", "description": "The struggle within the Democratic Party over President Obama\u2019s plans for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fast-track trade authority has nonprofit dimensions, exemplified by President Obama\u2019s comments about TPP opponents at the summit of the Organizing for Action network.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s TPP Testiness Emerges at Organizing for Action Summit - Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/05/01/obama-s-tpp-testiness-emerges-at-organizing-for-action-summit/", "article": {"tag": "Organizing for Action", "published_time": "2015-05-01T13:43:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T15:07:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "bipartisanship,  economic opportunities,  Organizing for America,  progressive action,  Progressive Coalition for American Jobs,  progressive politics,  Trans-Pacific Partnership, Barack Obama, Organizing for Action"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb91b\"", "article_summary": "What is happening to the president\u2019s position, and potentially to OFA, is that the trade pact is is about more than trade.\nOrganizing for Action is the 501(c)(4) successor to Organizing for America, which was part of the Obama election campaign.\n\u201cOver and over again, we\u2019ve been told that trade deals will create jobs and better protect workers and the environment,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey (D-PA).\nMitcham writes the following:\u201cOn matters of big money\u2014of true clout\u2014the two parties are more alike than different.\nDon\u2019t just throw a bunch of stuff out there and see if it sticks.\u201dAnd he challenged his critics to tell him specifically\u2014and accurately\u2014what was wrong with the Pacific trade deal, not to explain what was wrong with a quarter-century old NAFTA."}
