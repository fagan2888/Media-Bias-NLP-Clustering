Lake Madison, SD

Thanks to the strong winds off the frozen body of water, cabins and houses on the shore of Lake Madison are dealing with high snow drifts.

Nancy Bain built a house on Lake Madison in 1998, and has lived there permanently since 2009.

When the winter comes, she says the strong winds make high drifts that pile up to the top of houses and clog the roads.

The road that she lives on is a private road so it's the residents’ responsibility to clean the snow off.

Bain says the body of water she lives by creates the strong winds that might not reach other homes around the area.

“Because of the lake the wind is probably in its biggest force coming across and the around the building and pushing the snow across the buildings. So it can be quite calm out on the highway and yet we're still snowed in here,” Bain said.

Bain says this winter is mild compared to winters in the past.
