At the same time, his defense hasn\u2019t publicly suggested who else might be responsible for Jose Banda\u2019s shooting death.\n\nBarajas\u2019 trial is set to begin Monday in a case with many complexities: No weapon was recovered, no witnesses identified him as the shooter and many in Barajas\u2019 community have strongly sympathized with him, with some saying they might have taken the law into their own hands if faced with a similar situation.\n\nLegal experts acknowledge prosecutors could face a greater challenge than simply proving who committed the shooting, similar to another Texas case from 2012 in which a grand jury declined to indict a father who killed a man who molested his child.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the right way to do it, but jurors a lot of times make judgments based on moral responsibility, not legal responsibility,\u201d said Joel Androphy, a Houston defense attorney who isn\u2019t connected to the case.\n\nThe trial will focus on prosecutors\u2019 allegations that Barajas shot 20-year-old Banda in the head in December 2012 near Alvin, about 30 miles southeast of Houston. Minutes earlier, Banda\u2019s car struck Barajas\u2019 sons as they pushed the family\u2019s broken-down truck down a dark, narrow road just 50 yards from their home. Twelve-year-old David Jr. died at the scene; 11-year-old Caleb died at a hospital.\n\nIf convicted of murder, Barajas faces up to life in prison.\n\nMany in the community have rallied around the 32-year-old father, including setting up a Facebook page called \u201cFree David Barajas,\u201d which details fundraising events and where individuals have expressed their support.\n\nBut Banda\u2019s family says their loved one\u2019s fate should have been decided by the justice system and no one else.\n\n\u201cWhat (Barajas) did wasn\u2019t right,\u201d said Felicia Leija, 22, Banda\u2019s common-law wife. The couple has a 2-year-old daughter, Alisa, who was born a few months before the crash. \u201cFor other people to say they would have done the same thing \u2026 you don\u2019t know what you would have done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trial of Texas father raises legal, moral issues", "author": "Juan A.
