And they\u2019ve had some tantalizing findings: Imaging tests have found unusually low amounts of age-related plaques along with more brain mass related to attention and memory in these elite seniors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living long but we\u2019re not necessarily living well in our older years, and so we hope that the SuperAging study can find factors that are modifiable and that we\u2019ll be able to use those to help people live long and live well,\u201d said study leader Emily Rogalski, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University\u2019s cognitive neurology and Alzheimer\u2019s disease center in Chicago.\n\nThe study is still seeking volunteers, but chances are you don\u2019t qualify: Fewer than 10 percent of would-be participants have met study criteria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve screened over 400 people at this point and only about 35 of them have been eligible for this study, so it really represents a rare portion of the population,\u201d Rogalski said.\n\nThey include an octogenarian attorney, a 96-year-old retired neuroscientist, a 92-year-old Holocaust survivor and an 81-year-old pack-a-day smoker who drinks a nightly martini.\n\nTo qualify, participants have to undergo a battery of mental tests. Once enrolled, they undergo periodic imaging scans and other medical tests. They also must be willing to donate their brains after death.\n\nThe memory tests include lists of about 15 words.\n\n\u201cSuper agers can remember at least nine of them 30 minutes later, which is really impressive because often older adults in their 80s can only remember just a couple,\u201d Rogalski said.\n\nSpecial MRI scans have yielded other remarkable clues, Rogalski said. They show that in super agers, the brain\u2019s cortex, or outer layer, responsible for many mental functions including memory, is thicker than in typical 80- and 90-year-olds. And deep within the brain, a small region called the anterior cingulate, important for attention, is bigger than even in many 50- and 60-year- olds.\n\nThe super agers aren\u2019t just different on the inside; they also have more energy than most people their age and share a positive, inquisitive outlook. Rogalski said the researchers are looking into whether those traits contribute to brain health.\n\nOther research has linked a positive attitude with overall health. And some studies have suggested that people who are \u201ccognitively active and socially engaged\u201d have a reduced chance of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nBut which comes first \u2014 a healthy brain or a great attitude \u2014 isn\u2019t known, said Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nEdith Stern is among the super agers. The petite woman looks far younger than her 92 years, and is a vibrant presence at her Chicago retirement home, where she acts as a sort of room mother, volunteering in the gift shop, helping residents settle in and making sure their needs are met.\n\nStern lost most of her family in the Holocaust and takes her work seriously.\n\n\u201cWhat I couldn\u2019t do for my parents, I try to do for the residents in the home,\u201d she said, her voice thick with the accent of her native Czechoslovakia.\n\n\u201cI grasp fast,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf people say something, they don\u2019t have to tell me twice. I don\u2019t forget it.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s different in other ways, too.\n\n\u201cWhen you get old, people are mainly interested in themselves. They talk about the doctor, what hurts,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not so important that you just concentrate on yourself. You have to think about other people.\u201d\n\nKen Zwiener, of Deerfield, Ill., is another super ager. His kids encouraged him to enroll.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Dad, your brain is the best thing about you,' \u201d the 81-year-old retired businessman recalled.\n\nZwiener uses an iPad, recently went hot-air ballooning and is trying to learn Spanish. He also pours himself a vodka martini every night and is a pack-a-day cigarette smoker, but says he doesn\u2019t think his habits have made much difference. His healthy brain, he says, may be due to heredity and genes, but Zwiener said he hopes the study comes up with more \u201cscientific insights.\u201d\n\nZwiener\u2019s motivation for joining the study was simple: The best man at his wedding died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease before age 50.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/09/superagerA-cropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Researchers wonder which comes first: a healthy brain or a great attitude"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca813\"", "article_summary": "The super agers aren\u2019t just different on the inside; they also have more energy than most people their age and share a positive, inquisitive outlook.\nEdith Stern is among the super agers.\nBy LINDSEY TANNERAP Medical WriterThey\u2019re called \u201csuper agers\u201d \u2014 men and women who are in their 80s and 90s, but with brains and memories that seem far younger.\nOnce enrolled, they undergo periodic imaging scans and other medical tests.\nThey show that in super agers, the brain\u2019s cortex, or outer layer, responsible for many mental functions including memory, is thicker than in typical 80- and 90-year-olds."}
