I find that the board did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner in entering into the agreement,\u201d McGahey wrote in his decision.\n\nChristo hailed the decision in a statement on Friday.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the Colorado court\u2019s decision to uphold the State Parks agreement,\u201d Christo said. \u201cWe have now cleared two of the three legal hurdles that need to be overcome and I look forward to the federal court making its decision on the third case still pending.\u201d\n\nThat federal case \u2014 also brought by Rags Over the Arkansas River \u2014 challenges the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the project.\n\n\u201cThe hurdle that is left is a big hurdle,\u201d ROAR spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said, adding that her group was disappointed by the ruling and is pondering an appeal.\n\nAn appeal of the district court decision and a lengthy federal trial would even further delay the project, which 78-year-old Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude first floated in the early 1990s and formally proposed in 1997. Jeanne-Claude died in 2009.\n\nEarlier this month, the ever-moving Christo toured Colorado, giving speeches and speaking with reporters about a proposed project in the United Arab Emirates, upcoming exhibitions in Germany and New Mexico and his daily exercise regimen and diet.\n\nHe declined to speculate when Over the River would begin, but has long said the process of approval, review and appeals are part of his art, stirring discussion and emotions.\n\nThe federal lawsuit is a final stand for opponents of Christo\u2019s Over the River. Even though the ROAR group has lost two legal fights \u2014 an appeal of the BLM approval to the U.S. Department of Interior and Thursday\u2019s district court decision \u2014 the federal lawsuit continues and the group counts the ongoing delays of Over The River as a victory.\n\n\u201cAs a consequence of ROAR\u2019s work, Over the River has been indefinitely delayed,\u201d Anzelmo said. \u201cROAR believes the BLM does not have the authority to approve this project because the impact to Bighorn Sheep Canyon from a massive, industrial art project is simply not allowed under the area\u2019s existing land use management plan, which instead directs that BLM will protect Bighorn Sheep Canyon as an area of critical environmental concern.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Christo\u2019s \u201cOver the River\u201d art project clears another legal challenge", "title": "Christo\u2019s \u201cOver the River\u201d art project clears another legal challenge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/06/christos-over-the-river-art-project-clears-another-legal-challenge/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__07DROTRp1.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__07DROTRp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-06T16:05:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T13:21:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda082\"", "article_summary": "Artist Christo\u2019s grand plan to drape shimmering fabric over 6 miles of the Arkansas River has cleared another legal hurdle, thwarting his opponents.\n\u201cI am very happy with the Colorado court\u2019s decision to uphold the State Parks agreement,\u201d Christo said.\nThe group Rags Over the Arkansas River sued in July 2011, asking the court to dismiss and deny the project, arguing the Colorado State Parks decision failed to properly analyze the myriad impacts of the project.\nA Denver District Court judge on Thursday supported Colorado State Parks\u2019 June 2011 decision to allow the artist to use portions of the Arkansas River Headwaters Recreation Area between Salida and Ca\u00f1on City for his long-planned Over the River art installation.\nThe federal lawsuit is a final stand for opponents of Christo\u2019s Over the River."}
