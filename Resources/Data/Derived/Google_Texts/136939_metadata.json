And for weeks, the number remained stuck there, right up until Saturday\u2019s auction, suggesting, perhaps, that after years on a book shelf and in a drawer, the District of Columbia plates \u2014 yellow, with \u201cGG-300\u2033 stamped in black on each \u2014 weren\u2019t as valuable as their owner imagined.\n\nRelated A grim keepsake: Heritage puts license plates from JFK's Dallas limousine on auction block\n\nBut then came Saturday and the first round of bidding, via the Internet. The price rose quickly, to $75,000. Then came the live round, at Heritage\u2019s home office, where, historically, the crowds are small. And, again, the price tag skyrocketed until, finally, they were going, going, gone for $100,000 to a bidder who was in attendance and raised the winning paddle. (The plates actually went for around $80,000, but the auction house\u2019s cut of give-or-take $20,000 is included in the final price.)\n\nHeritage says the winner wishes to remain anonymous; Heritage spokesman Noah Fleisher will only identify their new owner as a \u201cardent Kennedy collector.\u201d (Which means he\u2019s not sure if it was Gordon Keith, though The Ticket co-host and Dallas Morning News columnist prefers his Kennedy keepsakes a bit larger.) Which means it\u2019s now unclear what will happen to the plates, which had been returned to Dallas for the first time since the president was assassinated in Dealey Plaza on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nBefore the auction they\u2019d been in the trash, tossed by Secret Service agents following the Lincoln Continental\u2019s return to the same Cincinnati, Ohio, coach-maker factory where the car received its presidential makeover in 1961. They were retrieved by Hess & Eisenhardt co-founder Willard C. Hess, who put them on a shelf between some books for decades.\n\nAfter his death his daughter Jane Walker inherited license plates and put them in a drawer. If someone wanted to see them, she\u2019d pull them out for a brief show and tell. She told The Dallas Morning News in October she decided to sell them only because \u201cI woke up one morning and thought, \u2018It\u2019s time to get rid of these.\u2019 People need to know they\u2019re available and around. They\u2019ll be lost to history if they\u2019re not gotten rid of soon.\u201d\n\nAnd now they\u2019re in the hands of a collector who paid a fortune for the plates.\n\nThe plates were sold on Nov. 7. Today, Nov. 8, marks the 55th anniversary of Kennedy\u2019s election as president.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2xpY2VuY2UtcGxhdGVzLWZyb20tamZrcy1kZWFsZXktcGxhemEtbGltb3VzaW5lLXNlbGwtZm9yLTEwMDAwMC1hdC1kYWxsYXMtYXVjdGlvbi5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "When Oak Lawn-based Heritage Auctions put the license plates from John Kennedy's Dealey Plaza limousine on the auction blocks weeks ago, the bidding opened at $40,000.
