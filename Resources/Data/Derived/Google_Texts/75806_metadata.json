But if I am not happy with how the world is whirling, I don\u2019t just ask to get off. I get up and so something about it.\n\nAnger should lead to effective action, not ineffective meanderings.\n\nGranted, lots of Americans are angry. Obamacare, terrorism, lawlessness, cronyism, and corruption abound. Yet ingenuity, hard work, and a dedication to principles pave the pathway to success, even if the world seems dead-set against you.\n\nWhatever you and I can\u2019t take anymore, we can do something about it, whether in the work place (get a better job) or in our relationships (change your mind, speak your mind, and mind your own business).\n\nAnd even at the ballot box.\n\nSo, I get angry, but I am not defined by anger. I get angry, but I am not going to vote that way.\n\nI am still moved by hope. As a consistent yet concerned conservative, I embrace a presidential candidate who not only portrays a better future, but has already fought for one.\n\nSuper Tuesday was indeed super for my presidential pick Ted Cruz \u2026 and for me.\n\nYeah, yeah \u2026 Trump \u201cwon\u201d states, but Cruz came in a close second in key races.\n\nHis campaign is playing strategically, winning more delegates, and now surging into second place. They even took over Alaska, depriving the current front-runner another symbolic victory through a now less-esteemed endorsement he had received one month ago.\n\nSorry, Sarah, but the kingmaker you hoped to be is not quite yet to be.\n\nI may feel upset about Washington, but I am not about to let anger, blind to the facts and alienated from the truth, decide for whom I cast my ballot.\n\nMore people I talk to do not want Donald Trump. Conservative writers everywhere are exposing his litany of liberalism. The guy loved\u2014still loves!\u2014Planned Parenthood. Whether you love or hate PP, why is this private institutions getting million dollar taxpayer-funded handouts?\n\nTrump and Kasich think that Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk, should have handed out the \u201cgay\u201d marriage licenses. Kasich even wants every baker to give up their freedom of conscience and \u201cBake that gay wedding cake!\u201d\n\nBut who stood with Kim Davis? Ted Cruz.\n\nWho called \u201cDitch\u201d Mitch McConnell a liar for reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank? Cruz. Who has exploited crony bankruptcy laws? The Donald.\n\nWho will stand with Israel without doubting? Cruz. I don\u2019t have to name those who have called \u201cneutral\u201d on the conflict.\n\nI do not want a deal maker. I want a mover and shaker.\n\nAnd yet the loudest critics of the first-time US Senator keep claiming that he lives in the pockets of the Big Banks and Big Business. Look at the votes, people. Where has he stood on issue after issue? Don\u2019t like some of the floor speeches? How about the fact that he has rejected every bloated budget coming out of the Washington Cartel?\n\nConservatives have complained for decades that the Government taxes and spends too much, with more regulations and rules to frustrate commerce and delay prosperity.\n\nWho stood for 22 hours exposing the economic and moral terrors of Obamacare? Ted Cruz.\n\nAdam Corolla has advised his conservative viewers: \u201cDon\u2019t vote for someone who says \u201cI will fight for you.\u201d That\u2019s fine. Ted Cruz is already fighting for me, because he has pushed for a retraction of the state into our lives, walking the walk, talking the talk on the floor of the US Senate and on the field of public opinion.\n\nWho else is left to run for president?\n\nJohn Kasich? This man parades his anti-conservatism and calls it good. Toss that cupcake!\n\nTo my good and consistent conservative friends who are banking on Rubio, now is the time to let the Rubio charm rub off and away.\n\nI esteem his foreign policy chops, but on other issues which matter\u2014liberty, immigration, and leadership qualities\u2014the one-time junior US Senator from Florida comes off as just that: junior. Not ready for the big leagues, and certainly not in league with executive necessities, which stake out clear principles from campaign to retirement and stick to them. I am certain he has big hands (and yes, probably larger than Trump\u2019s), but I am not ready to hand him the presidency. Private sector experience suits you best, and then come back to fray when you are ready to fight for our rights.\n\nAnd as for Donald Trump \u2026\n\nHe comes off as a Big Government nationalist. Yes, I want secure borders, but I don\u2019t want to be a victim to a domestic despot who will expand the state, and loves that Obamacare mandate. I want a candidate who is pro-America, but understands what American entails\u2014and defines: pro-liberty, pro-limited government, pro-constitutional rule; free markets, free enterprise, and free people. I want more than platitudes about a big wall, or fixing things, or making deals.\n\nWe don\u2019t need someone who pounds the pavement with \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d on a banner behind. I want someone who recognizes what makes America great. For me, that means the real deal presidential candidate who has fixed our nation\u2019s eyes back on the supremacy of our Constitution\u2014and the rule of law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everybody has those days..05/26/2016 19:48:52PM EST.", "author": "Arthur  Schaper", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Everybody has those days.", "title": "Arthur  Schaper  - I Still Choose Ted Cruz", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/arthurschaper/2016/03/03/i-still-choose-ted-cruz-n2128172", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/62/b15ee91c-73ca-4974-a405-3344f7c77bcf.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Everybody has those days.", "title": "Arthur  Schaper  - I Still Choose Ted Cruz", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/arthurschaper/2016/03/03/i-still-choose-ted-cruz-n2128172", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/62/b15ee91c-73ca-4974-a405-3344f7c77bcf.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "I Still Choose Ted Cruz, Arthur  Schaper , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Super Tuesday was indeed super for my presidential pick Ted Cruz \u2026 and for me.\nTed Cruz is already fighting for me, because he has pushed for a retraction of the state into our lives, walking the walk, talking the talk on the floor of the US Senate and on the field of public opinion.\nYeah, yeah \u2026 Trump \u201cwon\u201d states, but Cruz came in a close second in key races.\nAdam Corolla has advised his conservative viewers: \u201cDon\u2019t vote for someone who says \u201cI will fight for you.\u201d That\u2019s fine.\nBut if I am not happy with how the world is whirling, I don\u2019t just ask to get off."}
