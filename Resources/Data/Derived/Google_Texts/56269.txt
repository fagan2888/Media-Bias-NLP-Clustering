Independence Street on the north side of the fire is closed because of parked fire trucks.

No word yet on how many cars are on fire or what started the fire.

Shortly after 6:15 a.m. firefighters were sent to the fire at Superior Auto Salvage and Recycling in the 5500 block of East Archer.

The Tulsa Fire Department said it took about three hours to put out a large fire at an auto salvage business early Wednesday.

They said the fire may have started due to a lightning strike.

Shortly before 6:30 a.m. firefighters were sent to the fire at Superior Auto Salvage and Recycling in the 5500 block of East Archer.

The salvage yard is in an industrial area north of Interstate 244 and between Darlington and Hudson.

Fire officials say 70 to 80 cars were on fire when they arrived at the business.

District Chief Pete Matlock said because the cars were stacked at least three to four high, they used a fork lift to make a path into the fire scene and put out each car fire individually.

Independence Street on the north side of the fire scene was closed because of fire trucks and hoses across the street.

Firefighters said there are no reports of any injuries.

They said surveillance video shows a lightning strike just before the fire started.
