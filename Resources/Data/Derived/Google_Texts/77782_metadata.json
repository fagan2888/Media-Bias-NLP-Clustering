Hospitals and health plans lacked the incentive to more closely coordinate, he said, but the more expensive healthcare grows, the more price-sensitive consumers become.

The move by Anthem and health systems to compete with Kaiser Permanente suggests that rising healthcare prices have \u201creached the breaking point,\u201d Gruber said.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's new insurance markets and publicly reported premium prices have also made consumers more aware of price, giving plans and providers more incentive to find new ways to compete on cost, he said.The network of seven health systems joining hands with Anthem\u2014 Cedars-Sinai Health System , Good Samaritan Hospital and UCLA Health, all in Los Angeles; Huntington Memorial Hospital, Pasadena; Memorial Medical Center, Torrance; MemorialCare Health System, Fountain Valley; and PIH Health, Whittier\u2014will work to coordinate medical care for patients and manage medical costs.\n\nClick to enlarge.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaiser officials touted their organization's integration as an advantage after Wednesday's announcement. \u201cThe fact that our system is not just stitched together from existing parts, but has actually been built with this integration as the goal, will be difficult for others to copy,\" said Peter Andrade, senior vice president of California sales and account management for Kaiser.\n\n\n\nAnthem and its partner health systems risk losses unless all members perform well. Profits and losses will be shared equally among the members, said Anthem's Pam Kehaly.\n\n\n\nThe participants' shared earnings or losses on the venture will depend on what remains of the premium revenue after medical and administrative expenses. The plan will be marketed to fully insured employer groups starting Oct. 1 and may expand into California's health insurance exchange--but not before the partners gain experience.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to be purposefully small,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don't want it to fail right off the bat.\u201d Anthem may eventually expand the approach to other markets.\n\n\n\nThe model is similar to accountable care contracts that have emerged in the private insurance market and in Medicare under the Affordable Care Act. Accountable care ties financial incentives to targets for reduced health spending and quality.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a pretty bold play,\u201d said Leemore Dafny, former deputy director for healthcare and antitrust with the Federal Trade Commission and professor with Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. \u201cIt's not obvious how they're going to reduce hospital occupancy and come out on top.\u201d But success will require clear communication and tight coordination of medical care across seven independent health systems, something with which single health systems struggle.

Recent deals have created new regional mega-systems, such as the The partners' willingness to enter into such a risky agreement reflects the mounting pressure faced by health insurers, hospitals and doctors to blunt rising medical costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, too, has created new incentives, increased price transparency and created a new market for the newly insured.\u201cThe current market is in such turmoil that people are willing to agree to a lot of things,\u201d said Mark Pauly, a professor of health management at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThey don't know where history is going to end up, but they want to end up on the right side of history.

Recent deals have created new regional mega-systems, such as the proposed merger of Advocate Health Care and NorthShore University Health System in the Chicago suburbs. Others have united rivals under new joint ventures to operate health systems, health insurers or post-acute care, as has been the case with a string of recent agreements secured by Ascension Health. One, for example, will unite Michigan hospitals owned by Ascension Health and CHE Trinity Health to jointly contract across the entire state.\n\nAccountable care: More results, little change", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "News of an unusual joint venture between Anthem Blue Cross and seven Los Angeles health systems signaled new competition for Kaiser Permanente, the integrated health system with one of California's largest insurers.
