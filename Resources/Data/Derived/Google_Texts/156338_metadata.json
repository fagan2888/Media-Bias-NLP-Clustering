Of those surveyed, 15 percent said they\u2019d use their refund for everyday expenses, 7 percent said they\u2019d take a vacation, and 7 percent said they\u2019d make a major purchase such as a car or appliance.\n\nRelated: The Best Way to Handle Your Tax Refund\n\nEnough people spend at least a portion of their tax refunds that several industries, such as auto dealerships, airlines, and electronics companies, report a boost during \u201ctax buying season,\u201d as consumers with cash to burn make for extra sales.\n\nSome 84 percent of filers have received a refund \u2013 and there are plenty of sensible things to do with a few \u201cextra\u201d thousand dollars, says Ben Barzideh, a wealth advisor with Piershale Financial Group in Crystal Lake, Ill, That includes creating or shoring up an emergency fund or retirement savings; paying down debt; or funding a college savings plan for your kids. If your savings accounts are all fully funded, Barzideh recommends pampering yourself in another way, like investing in a gym membership or taking classes to advance yourself professionally.\n\nSome people, of course, find less practical ways to spend their refund from Uncle Sam. Here are a few of their stories:\n\nThe Great Gourmet Getaway\n\nLos Angeles resident Andrew Park spent about $1,000 \u2014 all of his tax refund and a little more \u2014 on a culinary adventure in San Francisco over President\u2019s Day weekend. He hopped on a flight to San Francisco and spent one night each in top-rated hotels near Pier 39 and Union Square.\n\nRelated: Taxpayer Alert \u2013 IRS Has $917 Million in Unclaimed Refunds\n\n\u201cBeing the huge foodie that I am, I thought it would be nice to treat myself to fancy dinners and indulge in whatever food and drinks I wanted,\u201d says Park, a 25-year-old PR rep. \u201cI spent about $100 each night on myself at dinner and $75 for a Sunday brunch, where I had the best Bloody Mary I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d\n\nHis entire weekend was about food. He waited in line in Chinatown for 40 minutes to taste a bakery\u2019s famous egg custard tarts; tried a sushi burrito; and sampled oysters while enjoying the ocean view.\n\nThe weekend was pricey \u2014 but Park left with a full belly and great memories. \u201cI have absolutely no regrets.\u201d\n\nNovel Aspirations\n\nDoug Howery, a 53-year-old water treatment plant supervisor, says he recently spent his $2,000 tax return to hire an e-book cover designer and an editor for his unpublished novel, The Grass Sweeper God. He\u2019s been working on the tome for 20 years.\n\nHowery says the investment will allow him to market his book himself, bypassing the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the publishing industry. \u201cI may have blown my whole tax return, but I will eventually blow the gatekeepers\u2019 doors down because my work is valid \u2013 it is good,\u201d Howery says. \u201cI will be on the e-best sellers list, just like Fifty Shades of Gray, another e-book!\u201d\n\nBurning Man or Bust\n\nMelodie Hilton, 52, is a single working mother of two grown kids, with a home in Napa, Calif., that needs maintenance. Her property\u2019s outdoor areas require repairs and she hasn\u2019t contributed to a retirement fund in longer than she cares to remember.\n\nThe marketing exec thought about using her tax refund for repairs, but ultimately chose to \u201ctake a detour and grow through experiences.\u201d Hilton says she\u2019s been on a \u201cbona fide\u201d vacation only once in the last decade. So to the heck with everything: This year she used $5,000 of her tax refund to buy a 1979 Dodge RV complete with orange shag carpet and to fund her first trip to Burning Man, an art and music festival in the Nevada desert each August.\n\nShe\u2019s been planning the trip with a friend since last year. \u201cSometimes you commit and nothing comes of it. Sometimes, all the planets and motivation aligns and things happen. I\u2019m taking the plunge,\u201d she says.\n\nRelated: The Tax Man Catches Up to Small Businesses\n\nGlobe-Trotting\n\nTwenty years after she traveled the world, Teresa Mears is still full of memories, thanks to refunds from Uncle Sam. She tucked away two years\u2019 worth of tax refunds, about $,4,000 and $5,000 each, and then quit her job as an editor for the Miami Herald to take a nine-month world tour of 16 countries across Europe, Asia and Australia. Among her stops: Ireland, Spain, Norway, West Germany, Istanbul, and China.\n\n\u201cI was turning 30 at the time and realized I had never been anywhere, despite the fact that I had always wanted to travel,\u201d Mears says. \u201cI spent a year planning the trip, reading travel books and magazines. It kept me sane during a difficult year at my job.\u201d\n\nMears was lucky enough to be rehired by the newspaper when she returned from her trip, and she\u2019s been more prudent with her tax refunds ever since. \u201cThat was my one big splurge,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter that, I spent my tax return on things like installing central air in my house.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While it might make financial advisors frown, some people find can\u2019t help splurging on their tax refunds.
