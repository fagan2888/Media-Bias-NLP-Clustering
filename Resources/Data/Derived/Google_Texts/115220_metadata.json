But then he reversed course the next day and issued an executive order intended to do the same thing.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s veto comes on the heels of several high-profile prosecutions for corruption of highly placed state politicians of both parties, including Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a powerful Democrat.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCuomo vetoed the two bills on Friday, saying they were \u201cmyopic.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]hese bills are myopic in their scope and focus only on one branch of government,\u201d Cuomo said in his veto message. \u201cThis would only serve to perpetuate a fractured system of transparency and data production by intentionally excluding other branches of government.\u201d\n\nThe Governor\u2019s actions, though, angered reformers, who were hoping to make changes to the laws and who had said that they were the best bills the state could get on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe think they\u2019re mom and apple pie bills,\u201d John Kaehny of Reinvent Albany said earlier this year. \u201cThere\u2019s no opposition to them whatsoever and, really, they\u2019re about increasing transparency of state government.\u201d\n\nOne of the bills would have reduced the time government agencies have to appeal court rulings granting access to public records cutting the current nine months to only two months. The other bill would have forced state agencies to pay legal fees and court costs when a judge rules against decisions to deny access to records.\n\nActivists were disappointed with the veto.\n\nReinvent Albany and eight other government groups issued a combined statement, saying, \u201cOur groups are deeply disappointed that in the midst of unprecedented scandals in Albany, Governor Cuomo vetoed two bills that would have made New York\u2019s government more transparent and accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor was given a clear choice between being part of the problem in Albany or part of the solution,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThese vetoes call into question the governor\u2019s commitment to transparency and Freedom of Information.\u201d\n\nBut the following day, Cuomo issued an executive order meant to address the same issue, after claiming that his office would \u201cnot let the Legislature off the hook for not being subject to FOIL.\u201d\n\nThe executive order expedites the appeals process once a FOIL request has been denied, by setting a 60-day window for appeal or other legal response. However, it still allows for exemptions for \u201cextremely complex matters or extraordinary circumstances outside agency control.\u201d\n\nActivists are worried that Cuomo\u2019s exemptions could make his order toothless. They are also critical that there is no concrete idea of just what would happen if state agencies persist in ignoring the rules.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NY Gov.
