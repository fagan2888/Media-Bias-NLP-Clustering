He's small, but really tough. Some people say he's arrogant. He has been known to fly into a competitive rage and punch people, even his own teammates.\n\nThis is not the NFL player you expect to be walking around with a study Bible.\n\nSo I was fascinated, the other day, when Sports Illustrated ran one of its patented player profiles that hint at faith themes and realities -- but the team then drops the ball on specifics. For example, read the following overture:\n\nSmith leaves football at the team facility. \u201cI actually love to read,\u201d he says, citing business texts such as The Richest Man in Babylon and motivational works like A Tale of Three Kings and The Last Lecture among his favorite books. He collects passport stamps, traveling through China, Italy, Australia and all over Africa; he\u2019s been to Jerusalem, Barcelona, London and Paris. He says things like \u201cTanzania is known for tanzanite.\u201d At one point Smith pauses because he knows this all sounds strange coming from, well, Steve Smith. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception of me that I\u2019m a hothead and an idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cThat because I\u2019m aggressive on the football field, I\u2019m a thug. But look, just because you see me [doing one thing] in my workplace doesn\u2019t mean I walk around stiff-arming people and spinning cantaloupe in the grocery store.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is what the 35-year-old Smith is known for, a career spent in perpetual combat: three documented fistfights with teammates, scores of altercations with opponents, countless spins of the football in defiant celebration after every catch, even in practice.\n\nSo the story lists many of Smith's tips for success, such as \"play angry.\" That's the thug hothead, right?\n\nBut then readers hit the following short passage:\n\nThe fifth trick: collect quotes. Smith stores dozens of them in a folder on his smartphone, from the Bible and football coaches and philosophers, and he will glance at them in moments that require inspiration, affirmation, guidance. The origin of his favorite quote is unknown: \u201cNever be ashamed of a scar. It simply means you were stronger than whatever tried to hurt you.\u201d\n\nThe Bible?\n\nAnd then there is this anecdote about Smith the man and his friends in unusual places:\n\nIn the 2010 off-season Smith traveled to Australia, and on the flight he was seated next to the agent for one of his own celebrity superfans: John Isner. A 6\u2019 10\u201d professional tennis player, and now the highest-ranked American male, Isner (who grew up in Greensboro, N.C.) had been a die-hard Panthers supporter since the team\u2019s inception, in 1995. The agent played matchmaker, and Smith watched the Australian Open that year from Isner\u2019s box. Isner later attended Smith\u2019s practices, and they swapped tennis rackets for game-worn cleats. Isner says that his signed number 89 Panthers jersey is among the first things he would grab if his house ever caught on fire.\n\nFor all that separated Smith and Isner -- 13 inches in height and about 2,500 miles, from Greensboro to Smith\u2019s hometown of Los Angeles -- the two men weren\u2019t so different. They shared faith and family and Carolina football.\n\nFaith and family? That angry guy spiking a defensive back into the turf?\n\nBut what about his personal life?\n\nThe calming influence, the driver behind Smith\u2019s evolution, is Angie. The 11th trick: marry well. The couple met at Utah, married soon after and had four children. \u201cThe way my wife makes me feel is that she should be the one on the field, and I should be in the stands,\u201d Smith says. Before his high school reunion, Smith got excited about rubbing his success in the faces of his doubters. Angie is the one who asked, Are you going with the right motives? \u201cI can embarrass her sometimes,\u201d he confesses when asked about the time he broke a teammate\u2019s nose. \u201cThere have been some things in my career, in my life, where I\u2019ve let her down.\u201d\n\nNow that's what you were expecting, right? You were expecting Smith to talk about his life as a path of redemption? You were expecting him to be committed to faith-based work with street people, right?\n\nNow, these are the hints. Did anyone involved in reporting this profile stop and connect the dots? Did anyone say, \"What?!?\" Where are the facts? Where are the details that flesh out the hints?\n\nOr is religious faith, again, something that just isn't REAL ENOUGH to take seriously?", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you follow the National Football League at all, then you know that wide \r\nreceiver Steve Smith -- formerly of the Carolina Panthers, now with the \r\nBaltimore Ravens -- has a reputation.
