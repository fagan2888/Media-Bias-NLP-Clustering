The state has cut the number of uninusured Marylanders eligible for private health plans under the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent, the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange announced Monday.

Nearly 162,000 Marylanders have signed up for private insurance through the state's online exchange since it opened three years ago. An estimated 240,000 people who are eligible still do not have insurance.

Additionally several hundred thousand of undocumented immigrants also may not have insurance, but do not qualify under the federal law.

When Medicaid enrollees are included, more than 1 million Marylanders have gotten insurance through the state exchange.
