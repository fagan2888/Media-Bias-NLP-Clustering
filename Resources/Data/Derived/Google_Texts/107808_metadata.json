To date, Def Leppard have sold over 100 million records worldwide, and acts as diverse as Slayer, Metallica, Taylor Swift, and Tim McGraw cite them as a major influence.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to ride that wave? Founding guitarist, vegan kickboxer, and one of the nicest guys in rock, Phil Collen, gets it all down in his new memoir, Adrenalized: Life, Def Leppard, and Beyond. We caught up with him to talk about the book and the band\u2019s forthcoming album \u2013 their 11th \u2013 the self-titled Def Leppard.\n\nSo what\u2019s the key to playing guitar with your shirt off at age 57 & still looking great?\n\nIt\u2019s a really easy fix but no one\u2019s prepared to do it, y\u2019know? Eating right and not drinking alcohol. Or if you are drinking, not much of it. And being a bit active. Honestly, it\u2019s that simple. It amazes me no one will do that!\n\nYeah, but you\u2019re not just fit, you\u2019re jacked.\n\n\n\nWhen I was lifting heavy I would have a vegan protein powder, and I still do occasionally but I try to balance it out. I\u2019ve always done a lot of martial arts and I take a kick bag on tour and do a lot of drills so that keeps me loose and supple and basically young. That\u2019s the fountain of youth part. I actually screwed my back up a few months ago and I could only do two things that didn\u2019t hurt \u2014 push-ups and pull-ups on a bar. So that\u2019s all I did with some really light crunches. I\u2019ve been doing this a lot of years so I\u2019ve been able to figure out what works and what does not. You can get away with a lot less, just by tweaking it here and there.\n\nYou mention working with legendary kickboxer Benny \u201cThe Jet\u201d Urquidez. Have you ever sparred with Duff McKagan?\n\n\n\nI haven\u2019t! I trained with Benny in the late 90s and I believe Duff still trains with him now. Duff and I have spoken about it since we have such fond memories of Sensei Benny.\n\nA revelation from Adrenalized \u2013 you\u2019re still not an official member of Def Leppard.\n\nRight! (laughs) I think they did sneak me in there somewhere though.\n\nWhy did you decide to write a memoir now?\n\nI didn\u2019t, actually. I was at the Gerson Institute for a fund raiser and a friend of mine, Chris Epting, who\u2019s my co-writer, suggested I write a book. I don\u2019t really like the idea, as it seems egotistical but Chris convinced me we could do it in a different sort of way.\n\nThis was my takeaway on the secret of Def Leppard\u2019s success: You were frugal, loyal and never forgot your working class roots.\n\nI\u2019d say you hit it bang-on the head. That\u2019s it in a nutshell. It\u2019s like fitness in that it\u2019s not rocket science, but few are willing to do it. Our parents grew up in war-torn England with the Blitz going off trying to kill them and buildings blowing up here and there and they took that value system and instilled it into us. I think the further you get away from that sort of suffering and hard work, the less respect and honor people have in their everyday lives. All the guys in Def Leppard had that same working class background and it was based on those values. Even down to things like not wasting water, because there were rations.\n\nI loved the part where you\u2019re on the biggest tour in the world but you still refuse limos.\n\nAbsolutely! But then again, we were also surrounded by really cool people. At first we said, \u201cLimos are great!\u201d Then Peter Mensch, our former manager, would say \u201cGuys, let me break it down for you\u2026\u201d\n\nSo we were fortunate that we had people who would nurture us and explain those things. A lot of bands don\u2019t know or simply don\u2019t care. Even with our management, it was very much a team and a family. And it still is to this day.\n\n\n\nMy wife and I watched the In the Round DVD recently. How were multi-tracked masterpieces likePyromania and Hysteriarecreated so faithfully? I heard you didn\u2019t use tracks.\n\nAh, In the Round! No [recorded] backing vocals, no tracks. Every member of this band is a bad-ass singer and we thought it was a cop out out to rely on tracks.\n\nYou guys are working double up, every song on that show. Rick Savage is singing harmony, playing bass, guitar, keyboards, samples\u2026.\n\nHere\u2019s a fun story for you. When we recorded \u201cLove Bites\u201d we were never in the same room at the same time. We all sang on it but most of the backing vocals were Mutt Lange, he\u2019s the one you hear more than anyone else and Mutt\u2019s an amazing singer.\n\nSo we release the album and \u201cLove Bites\u201d goes to Number One. We\u2019d never played it! It was so hard to work out how to play guitar and sing those parts at the same time. We had to come up with hybrid parts because before, where there had been eight guitar parts \u2014 you had to choose the most prominent ones and make a collage of sorts. Same thing with the vocals. I remember we had two days off but instead of taking the downtime we actually went into a studio just to practice that song and try to work it out. Again, it goes back to that thing: you want to be proud of your work.
