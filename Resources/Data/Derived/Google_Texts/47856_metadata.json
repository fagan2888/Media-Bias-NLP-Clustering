A long list of groups that support amnesty, including labor and immigration organizations, signed onto the letter.\n\nIt\u2019s far from the first push by the left for Obamacare coverage to be extended to those present in the country illegally. The California Endowment, a nonprofit created out of an insurance company split is actively pushing for the state Obamacare exchange to extend benefits to illegal immigrants.

Out of 8 million sign-ups, at least 2.9 million applications had some type of inconsistency regarding citizenship or immigration status.\n\nMonths later, the federal government has still been unable to resolve over 300,000 of the problems \u2014 leading the administration with no choice but to terminate customers\u2019 coverage if they don\u2019t submit further documentation by within the next several weeks. Some critics, including Florida\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist, have asked the administration to ignore its own standards and allow those without verifiable immigration status to keep their coverage.
