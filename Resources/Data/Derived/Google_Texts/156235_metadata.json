For all the opposition there\u2019s been to Obamacare, the GOP candidates have been surprisingly muted on the topic.\n\nSurprising, because one of the absolute bedrock positions of the Republican Party has been that Obamacare would be a \u201cdisaster.\u201d This formulation of \u201cdisaster\u201d or some close variant of \u201cdisaster\u201d was near unto holy writ. It did not need to be explained in any detail. \u201cDisaster\u201d would suffice.\n\nIt was an article of faith on the order of the certainty that climate science was \u201cmade up.\u201d\n\nToo bad that just like with climate, continuous measurement happens out there in the real world. And just like with climate, the numbers stubbornly refuse to follow GOP orthodoxy. Obamacare is working, more or less as advertised.\n\nAnd health care is real enough to people that they actually want to have some. They have a strange disinclination to suffer a disease and go bankrupt, just to satisfy a party\u2019s orthodoxy.\n\nSo IS there a demand to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare? Only to the extent that people would like to go all the way to single payer so they can stop worrying about the subject altogether.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Got to admit it's getting better.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tomtoles", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Got to admit it's getting better.", "title": "The only alternative to Obamacare is more Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2016/04/08/the-only-alternative-to-obamacare-is-more-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/04/blog4-8-16.0001.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2016/04/08/the-only-alternative-to-obamacare-is-more-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare is working, obamacare heading towards single payer, no repeal and replace", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tomtoles"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare is working, obamacare heading towards single payer, no repeal and replace"}, "article_summary": "For all the opposition there\u2019s been to Obamacare, the GOP candidates have been surprisingly muted on the topic.\nSo IS there a demand to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare?\nSurprising, because one of the absolute bedrock positions of the Republican Party has been that Obamacare would be a \u201cdisaster.\u201d This formulation of \u201cdisaster\u201d or some close variant of \u201cdisaster\u201d was near unto holy writ.\nObamacare is working, more or less as advertised.\nIt was an article of faith on the order of the certainty that climate science was \u201cmade up.\u201dToo bad that just like with climate, continuous measurement happens out there in the real world."}
