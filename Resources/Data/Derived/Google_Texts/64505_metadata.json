They face the shock of a close call; their initial recovery may take longer than they expect; and, to top it off, they get a new regime of medications, diet and exercise.\n\nIt can be overwhelming.\n\nA heart attack also can serve as a wake-up call and compelling motivation to make changes in lifestyle and behavior. Even so, many people are apprehensive about exercise after experiencing a heart attack.\n\nUnderstandably so: We read in the newspaper about heart attack deaths from shoveling snow and think it\u2019s best to keep exertion to a minimum.\n\nDoctors thought the same thing early in the past century, says Michael Chen, a cardiologist at the University of Washington\u2019s Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.\n\n\u201cPatients were put on bed rest for days to weeks,\u201d he said, \u201cas doctors feared activity would cause more damage to the heart.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s well accepted that physical activity is beneficial to heart attack survivors and is key to preventing a second attack. And it begins right away.\n\n\u201cPhase 1 of cardiac rehabilitation starts in the hospital,\u201d Chen says, where patients are encouraged to get up and walk as soon as 12 hours after treatment for heart attack.\n\nStill, there are barriers to starting and sticking to an exercise program. The usual culprits include time (in our too-busy lives) and opportunity (a gym membership or some convenient place to bike, walk or run). Particular obstacles that can crop up after a heart attack include feelings of vulnerability and helplessness.\n\nThere also is fear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exceedingly common for someone to feel anxious after a heart attack,\u201d says Una McCann, a Johns Hopkins psychiatrist who studies anxiety and depression in the context of heart disease, \u201cor to want to avoid situations that remind them of a recent traumatic health event such as a heart attack.\u201d\n\nFor some people, fear can become pathological. Anxiety disorders, whether pre-existing or triggered by the heart attack, can interfere with patients\u2019 following their treatment plans and can impede recovery. In such cases, a mental health professional can help.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, which might include relaxation techniques and reframing of automatic negative thoughts, is the first-line treatment, McCann says. In some cases, psychiatric drugs may also be prescribed.\n\nThe best way to start an exercise program is through a formal cardiac rehabilitation program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the standard of care,\u201d Chen says, \u201cand a central component of cardiac rehab is supervised exercise.\u201d\n\nIn a cardiac rehab session, the patient is monitored by a nurse or an exercise physiologist while walking on a treadmill or pedaling an exercise bike. After a warm-up period, the patient is asked to increase the intensity.\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s a conservative goal, such as increasing the patient\u2019s heart rate by 20 beats per minute,\u201d Chen says.\n\nAs a general rule, cardiac rehab does not involve high-intensity exercise, Chen says. Patients should be able to carry on a conversation while working out. The exercise portion of rehab usually includes light weights and stretching.\n\nA formal cardiac rehab program has an important advantage, providing an expert to monitor your activity and offer advice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important when you\u2019re at high risk to get help,\u201d says Caroline Richardson, a family medicine doctor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who researches how best to incorporate physical activity in patients with chronic diseases.\n\n\u201cSome patients have never really exercised before, so it may be their first time feeling short of breath from exercise,\u201d Chen says.\n\nMonitored exercise sessions help patients learn what the signs of good exercise are \u2014 as well as the signs of overdoing it.\n\nSpecific warning signs to a heart patient include chest pain or pressure, heart palpitations, dizziness and shortness of breath out of proportion to the exercise", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/07/heart_wings.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd45a\"", "article_summary": "A heart attack also can serve as a wake-up call and compelling motivation to make changes in lifestyle and behavior.\nParticular obstacles that can crop up after a heart attack include feelings of vulnerability and helplessness.\nUnderstandably so: We read in the newspaper about heart attack deaths from shoveling snow and think it\u2019s best to keep exertion to a minimum.\nEven so, many people are apprehensive about exercise after experiencing a heart attack.\nAnxiety disorders, whether pre-existing or triggered by the heart attack, can interfere with patients\u2019 following their treatment plans and can impede recovery."}
