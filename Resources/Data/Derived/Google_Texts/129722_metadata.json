Sex trafficking is horrifying. Which is why it\u2019s being exploited by social conservatives to push an anti-sex agenda under an anti-trafficking banner.\n\nJust recently, this longstanding tactic became front-page news. A pending Senate bill on sex trafficking was all set to pass\u2014until Democrats discovered that it expands a longstanding policy known as the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer money from being used to fund abortions. Under the proposed law, that policy would now also cover a dedicated fund for victims of sex trafficking.\n\nSneakily, the bill does so only by cross-referencing another law without even mentioning what it is. Democrats say they had no idea the provision was even in there. But now, their objections to it have stalled the law and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is stalling Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination to be attorney general until the stalemate is resolved.\n\nAlthough this is its first time in the headlines, the sex trafficking shell game is not new; it\u2019s been going on for some time now, away from the limelight, in at least five distinct ways.\n\n1. Money with Religious Strings Attached\n\nThe first is when money designed to fight sex trafficking is used to advance a conservative ideological agenda. In 2006, for example, the Bush administration granted $19 million to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (the same conservative Catholic network that would later fight for religious exemptions to ObamaCare) to oversee the government\u2019s services to women under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n\nAs revealed in a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, the USCCB gave the money disproportionately to religious groups, and demanded that not a penny provide counseling for either abortion or birth control. This was even true for victims of rape.\n\nIn other words, precisely the provision at issue in the Senate bill was already the policy under the USCCB sub-grant, which was discontinued by the Obama administration.\n\n2. Crack Down on Prostitution Instead\n\nA second tactic is to obtain federal grants to combat human trafficking, but actually crack down on prostitution instead. For example, Las Vegas\u2014Sin City itself\u2014received a two-year, $500,000 federal grant in 2009 to combat trafficking, and the majority of the money went to overtime for vice cops arresting prostitutes. At the end of the grant period, Las Vegas could only report 10 cases of trafficking that they had busted as a result.\n\nThis is not an accident. Last year, Maggie McNeill, writing in The Washington Post, revealed internal documents of the anti-prostitution group Demand Abolition that said, \u201cFraming the Campaign\u2019s key target as sexual slavery might garner more support and less resistance, while framing the Campaign as combating prostitution may be less likely to mobilize similar levels of support.\u201d\n\nSo sexual slavery is just a rhetorical frame for eradicating prostitution.\n\nYet, as McNeill also pointed out, the two are often at cross purposes. If you really want to eliminate sex trafficking and sex slavery, the best policy choice would be to legalize and regulate prostitution. When this was tried in Australia and New Zealand, sex trafficking virtually disappeared. But of course, that\u2019s the last thing that sex trafficking activists from far-right institutions like Regent University want. Which is why it is never on the agenda.\n\nGiven the choice between fighting trafficking and fighting prostitution, social conservatives pretend to do the former, but actually do the latter.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Recast Prostitutes as \u2018Victims\u2019\n\nPart of the \u201creframing\u201d of prostitution is to cast all pimps as traffickers, and all sex work as coercive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone\u2019s open to prostitution unless you\u2019ve been traumatized or abused,\u201d one New York judge recently told The Daily Beast. \u201cYou\u2019d beg, you\u2019d go on welfare, you\u2019d shoplift, for goodness\u2019 sake. These people need to be treated as victims.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, that judge works in New York\u2019s Human Trafficking Courts, set up to protect actual victims of trafficking\u2014but which now \u201cprotect\u201d all \u201cvictims,\u201d even adults who say they chose sex work voluntarily. As far as the system is concerned, those people are a null set.\n\nNot only is this an affront to sex workers\u2019 autonomy and humanity, it also leads to bad policy. In New York, sex workers are shipped off to \u201ccounseling\u201d with the foregone conclusion that their choices are wrong. That takes them away from their work, wastes money and time, and doesn\u2019t help make them safer.\n\nIndeed, as the Beast article showed, the revamped system perpetuates racial profiling (blacks make up 69 percent of defendants in New York\u2019s human trafficking courts), stigma, and the risk of police violence.\n\nAnd what \u201ccounseling\u201d do sex workers receive? Like that annoying pop song, often it\u2019s just\u2026\n\n4. Take them to Church\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\u2019s Project ROSE (\u201cReaching Out on Sexual Exploitation\u201d) purports to protect sex workers, but as Vice reported in a long- form expose of the program, Project ROSE is actually a front for conservative religious \u201cre-education.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, the project has made over 350 arrests. But that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. The law is deliberately vague, allowing police to \u201ccontact\u201d anyone who appears to be \u201cmanifesting prostitution.\u201d Surprise, surprise\u2014that has led to a disproportionate \u201ccontacting\u201d of transgender women of color, who have been routinely harassed by police and civilians alike.\n\nOnce \u201ccontacted,\u201d suspects are brought to a church, and threatened with arrest unless they enroll in a religiously-affiliated \u201cdiversion\u201d program. Since they haven\u2019t technically been arrested yet, they don\u2019t have the right to have lawyers present. Not surprisingly, many opt toward the \u201cdiversion\u201d program, which includes moral education courtesy of Catholic Charities. That means, of course, no condoms, no child-care, and no counseling on contraception or abortion. Just heavy doses of shaming, threats, and conservative moralism.\n\nThis is legal because it\u2019s \u201csecular\u201d counseling for victims of \u201ctrauma.\u201d Even if it just happens to comport with conservative Catholic dogma.\n\n5. Co-Opt the Narrative\n\nFinally, the whole narrative of anti-trafficking work has been co-opted by evangelicals and other social conservatives.\n\nPreviously, anti-trafficking was a feminist issue. It was about women kidnapped, brutalized, and subjugated by men.\n\nBut now, it\u2019s a religious issue. Two years ago, 60,000 conservative Christians gathered in the Georgia Dome \u201cfor worship and inspiration at the Passion 2013 conference\u201d designed \u201cto shine a light on modern-day slavery.\u201d\n\nDenuding \u201cslavery\u201d of its racial meaning (and thus its relevance for race issues today), conservative Christians cast themselves as the new abolitionists, \u201crescuing\u201d prostitutes from truck stops and rallying to end all forms of human trafficking\u2014even those which sex workers themselves say are non-exploitative.\n\nTo evangelicals, this is about victims and evildoers, not women and men. And the conceptual slippage is apparent.\n\nOne leading anti-trafficking activist told Slate that \u201call prostitution is inherently harmful. Whether or not it\u2019s consensual, whether or not they want to do it, if it\u2019s high-end or streetwalking, it\u2019s harmful, and it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nThat is an anti-feminist message; it\u2019s telling women that there is only one right way to use their bodies\u2014and just coincidentally, it\u2019s the way centuries of patriarchal religion have taught.\n\nLikewise, one evangelical pastor said recently that pornography contributes to sex trafficking. \u201cThe more people who watch pornography, the more they\u2019ll want sexual fulfillment through prostitution and so that desire drives men and women to engage in physical prostitution, even virtual prostitution. And so you\u2019ve got this relationship between pornography feeding prostitution and that increasing the demand for sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nAnd, he added, \u201cThe same Gospel that compels us to war against sex trafficking compels us to address sexual immorality in all its forms.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is the main point. Religious crusaders against sex trafficking say they\u2019re against trafficking\u2014but really, they\u2019re against sex.\n\nTrafficking is the \u201ctip of the wedge,\u201d where evangelicals might make common cause with liberals and feminists. But ultimately, the wedge includes pornography, sex work, homosexuality, sex for pleasure, abortion, contraception\u2014anything that might be construed as \u201csexual immorality.\u201d That broader agenda is evident in the way that sex trafficking laws have been written and enforced, and in the way the religious anti-trafficking movement has cast the struggle.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jaymichaelson"}, "keywords": "Google, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201503192338, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Republicans are insisting on tacking anti-abortion language onto an anti-sex-trafficking bill\u2014and it\u2019s just their latest effort to exploit the issue to fight \u201csexual immorality.\u201d", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The GOPs Sex Trafficking Shell Game: How Laws Against Sex Trafficking End Up Hurting Women", "tags": "syndication:syndication-google,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The GOP\u2019s Sex Trafficking Shell Game: How Laws Against \u2018Sex Trafficking\u2019 End Up Hurting Women\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/19/the-gop-s-sex-trafficking-shell-game-how-laws-against-sex-trafficking-end-up-hurting-women.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/19/the-gop-s-sex-trafficking-shell-game-how-laws-against-sex-trafficking-end-up-hurting-women/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47561949.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/19/the-gop-s-sex-trafficking-shell-game-how-laws-against-sex-trafficking-end-up-hurting-women\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-19T23:38:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jay Michaelson\",\"tags\":[\"syndication-google\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Google, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jay Michaelson", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-03-19T23:38:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jay-michaelsonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/19/the-gop-s-sex-trafficking-shell-game-how-laws-against-sex-trafficking-end-up-hurting-women", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Republicans are insisting on tacking anti-abortion language onto an anti-sex-trafficking bill\u2014and it\u2019s just their latest effort to exploit the issue to fight \u201csexual immorality.\u201d", "title": "The GOP\u2019s Sex Trafficking Shell Game: How Laws Against \u2018Sex Trafficking\u2019 End Up Hurting Women", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/19/the-gop-s-sex-trafficking-shell-game-how-laws-against-sex-trafficking-end-up-hurting-women.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/19/the-gop-s-sex-trafficking-shell-game-how-laws-against-sex-trafficking-end-up-hurting-women/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1426858486884.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jay-michaelson", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "But of course, that\u2019s the last thing that sex trafficking activists from far-right institutions like Regent University want.\nReligious crusaders against sex trafficking say they\u2019re against trafficking\u2014but really, they\u2019re against sex.\nIf you really want to eliminate sex trafficking and sex slavery, the best policy choice would be to legalize and regulate prostitution.\nUnder the proposed law, that policy would now also cover a dedicated fund for victims of sex trafficking.\nLikewise, one evangelical pastor said recently that pornography contributes to sex trafficking."}
