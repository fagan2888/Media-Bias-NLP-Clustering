Thirty years later, the Romans began killing Jews in a more systematic way. Between 67 and 136, over the course of a three-phase war, the Romans destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem and killed thousands, perhaps even millions, of Jews, in communities across the Mediterranean.\n\nIt was during this period that the Gospels were written, offering the first accounts we have of Jesus\u2019 life. Somehow, we tend to forget this, but Christianity was born as a Jewish sect, during a time of terrible violence. We read about Jesus\u2019 life through a prism of strife. \u201cThe Christian movement,\u201d James Carroll told me, \u201cis stamped with a case of communal PTSD.\u201d\n\nCarroll is a journalist, columnist, novelist and scholar. A devout Catholic, he used to be a priest. In his new book, \u201cChrist Actually,\u201d Carroll chronicles how the Roman war pushed early Christians to define themselves in opposition to Judaism, and to divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots.\n\nThat antagonism would lead to other wars against the Jews centuries later, one of which would outstrip even Rome\u2019s. For Carroll, the Holocaust is a defining moment for Christians, one that requires a new look at the religion\u2019s history.\n\nCarroll isn\u2019t interested in pinning down the exact historical details of Jesus\u2019 life, though. Instead, in \u201cChrist Actually,\u201d he seeks an interpretation of Jesus that isn\u2019t quite so warped by hostility and war. The interpretation that emerges is of a resolutely nonviolent, wholly Jewish figure\u2014a figure, in short, who offers little traction for anti-Semitism and holy war.\n\nReached by phone, Carroll spoke with Salon about religious violence, Pope Francis and why Christians should bring their Jewish friends to church.\n\nOriginally, Christianity was a Jewish sect. Eventually, it became something religiously distinct\u2014and, often, hostile to Judaism. Where exactly does that divergence begin?\n\nIt is not a specific historical point. Into the third century, there are some people who are observing Shabbat on Friday evenings and also going to the eucharistic table on Sunday. There are some Jewish people who are observing kosher but also remembering Jesus as Messiah. The final and complete break is with the conversion of Constantine [in the fourth century], which is the conversion of the Roman Empire to the Church\u2014when the Empire begins to enforce the boundary with violence.\n\nThat\u2019s part two of the break. Part one of the break, I\u2019m arguing, is the Roman war against the Jews. Let\u2019s say there were five separate parties of Judaism in the 60s of the first century. Sadducees, Pharisees, the priesthood, the Essenes, the Jordan Valley\u2014multiple ways of being Jewish. All of them were destroyed in the Roman war except two: the party associated with the rabbis, who left Jerusalem and refused to be part of the war against Rome. And the other party, the Jesus people, who also split from Jerusalem and set up in Galilee. It\u2019s because they refused to be part of the violent resistance against Rome that they survived at all. Two new religions come out of the destruction of the Temple [during the Roman war].\n\nAnd begin to diverge.\n\nAnd then they begin to argue with each other over who can claim the legacy of Israel. Who is the true Israel? And the argument, as you know, becomes ferocious, which is what informs the conflict in the Gospel between Jesus and the, quote, Jews, unquote. The Gospels are written over three decades. You can track the increased levels of hostility between those two groups of Jews by the number of times the polemical phrase \u201cthe Jews\u201d shows up in the text. In Mark, the oldest Gospel, it shows up a few times. By the time you get to John, written 30 years later, it shows up dozens of times. In the Acts of the Apostles, all of it is laid at the feet of the Jews\u2014quote-unquote \u201cthe Jews.\u201d\n\nJews become a symbol to push back against.\n\nAbsolutely, yes. That\u2019s why, decades later, when the Jewish Christians are gone, the gentiles read these texts, and it\u2019s easy for them to imagine that Jesus isn\u2019t a Jew, which is the beginning of the problem.\n\nChristians go to church week in and week out and hear gospel passages read, and they don\u2019t even understand that they\u2019re getting a kind of anti-Jewish propaganda. Take, for example, the parable of the Good Samaritan. Sweet story, right? No, actually. The parable of the Good Samaritan could also be called the parable of the Bad Jews, because it\u2019s a non-Jewish guy who\u2019s coming along who rescues the poor schmuck who\u2019s laying on the side of the road, having been beaten by thieves. Before he gets there, it\u2019s the priest, the scribe\u2014the Jews\u2014who won\u2019t rescue the guy.\n\nThe Good Samaritan assumes the Bad Jew; it\u2019s a bipolar structure of the imagination. Good Christians, bad Jews. New Testament, Old Testament. Grace, law. Generosity, greed. Mercy, revenge. The God of love versus the God of judgment, the merciless God from whom Jesus\u2019 God rescues us. You see what we\u2019ve got here? It\u2019s a bipolar, anti-Semitic structure of the imagination. If I get one thing out of the publication of the book, it\u2019s that a few more people understand that\u2019s how deep into us this problem goes. That\u2019s what I\u2019m after here.\n\nYou write in the book that you hear sermons every week in church that promote this kind of polarized thinking.\n\nI heard one last week. The scripture put before Christians and Catholics was about Jesus\u2019 attack on the Temple. That\u2019s a classic case of this problem. Jesus is understood as going into the Temple and defending what he calls \u201cmy father\u2019s house\u201d against the avaricious Jews. He upends the tables of the money-changers as if the money-changers are medieval Jewish lenders. That\u2019s the way the story is heard.\n\nIt\u2019s an outrage to imagine that Jesus was in any way opposed to the normal business of the temple. If there was money-changing going on at the Temple, it was because people, Jews from all over the Mediterranean world, were showing up there regularly, and they all had different currencies. In order to have the currency required to buy the sacrificial offering, they had to have a way to change their money. It was a service, in other words. There\u2019s no way Jesus would have regarded that as offensive. So if Jesus committed some disturbance at the Temple\u2014and scholars seem to agree that he did\u2014it has to be understood in defense of the Temple, not in opposition to it.\n\nThat\u2019s a subtlety that Christian preachers don\u2019t have. They don\u2019t get it.\n\nI imagine that the people with you in church on Sunday are perfectly kind to their Jewish neighbors. When you\u2019re sitting in church and hearing a sermon like this, is it almost as if there are two distinct ideas of Jewishness?\n\nHere\u2019s what I recommend for every Christian: bring your Jewish friend to church with you, and let your Jewish friend listen to the text, and then ask your Jewish friend how they felt. Jewish folks listening to these very common texts\u2014the Good Samaritan parable, the attack on the Temple, any number of them\u2014or the way that polemical phrase, \u201cthe Jews, the Jews, the Jews\u201d keeps showing up \u2026\n\nThink of all of this as a bug in the software of Christianity; how do we de-bug it? Number one, we have to understand how the texts came to be written this way. Number two, we have to hear the anti-Jewish texts as if we\u2019re Jews; we have to learn how to do that. Number three, we have to measure everything we say and believe about Jesus against the fact that he was authentically, fully an Orthodox Jew until the day he died.\n\nI have a theology professor friend at Boston College, where you have to have very high SATs to get in. He would ask, at the beginning of the year, a set of questions to get a sense of where people were coming from. One of them, typically, was \u201cWhat religion was Jesus?\u201d And the answer, overwhelmingly, comes back, \u201cChristian.\u201d Just a basic question.\n\nAnother version of the question was, \u201cWhat religion were the Romans?\u201d and one student raised his hand and said, \u201cThe Romans killed Jesus, right?\u201d The professor thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019s progress. At least he knows the Romans killed Jesus,\u201d and he said yes, the Romans killed Jesus. And the kid replied, \u201cWell, then they were Jews.\u201d\n\nOuch.\n\nI\u2019m lifting up the level of education we\u2019re confronted with.\n\nThat seems like a daunting task. Just the other day, a Catholic in a large Mexican city shied away from me and said, \u201cOh, you killed Jesus!\u201d when he learned that I was Jewish. That experience is not unusual. Where will this kind of education have to come from?\n\nIn Latin America, that myth still holds to a larger extent than in English-speaking countries.\n\nA tremendous religious educational revolution did take place in the Catholic Church over the last generation, even to get rid of the Christ-killer myth. I\u2019m a baby boomer, but people younger than me in the Catholic tradition have never heard this Christ-killer business. There was a tremendous religious education revolution after the second Vatican Council in the early \u201960s. It\u2019s possible. It just hasn\u2019t gone far enough.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The brilliant scholar James Carroll on anti-Semitism, Pope Francis and how liberals can be honest believers", "title": "James Carroll on disarming the memory of Jesus: \u201cAmerica threatens the world with violence in ways that no other country does\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The brilliant scholar James Carroll on anti-Semitism, Pope Francis and how liberals can be honest believers", "title": "James Carroll on disarming the memory of Jesus: \u201cAmerica threatens the world with violence in ways that no other country does\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/20/james_carroll_on_disarming_the_memory_of_jesus_america_threatens_the_world_with_violence_in_ways_that_no_other_country_does/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/christ_actually.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The brilliant scholar James Carroll on anti-Semitism, Pope Francis and how liberals can be honest believers", "title": "James Carroll on disarming the memory of Jesus: \u201cAmerica threatens the world with violence in ways that no other country does\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/christ_actually.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Schulson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, James Carroll, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb73b\"", "article_summary": "At least he knows the Romans killed Jesus,\u201d and he said yes, the Romans killed Jesus.\nThere\u2019s no way Jesus would have regarded that as offensive.\nReached by phone, Carroll spoke with Salon about religious violence, Pope Francis and why Christians should bring their Jewish friends to church.\nInstead, in \u201cChrist Actually,\u201d he seeks an interpretation of Jesus that isn\u2019t quite so warped by hostility and war.\nFor Carroll, the Holocaust is a defining moment for Christians, one that requires a new look at the religion\u2019s history."}
