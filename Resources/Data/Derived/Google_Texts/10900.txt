A portion of Simms Street just south of Coal Mine Avenue that has been closed since July 15 due to large sinkhole will re-open to two-way traffic Friday.

The sinkhole first appeared on June 25 and the county closed a portion of the road until it was decided to shut the road down completely for repairs.

Jefferson County Road and Bridge Division operations manager Mike Secary said there was enough of a breakthrough Thursday that it should allow the county to reopen the road Friday.

Contractors from Pascal Construction have been working on the 54-inch galvanized steel pipe that failed, causing the 20-foot by 20-foot sinkhole.

The traffic setup will be similar to the first few weeks after the sinkhole, with just two of the lanes open. Secary said his hope is that the road will be back to normal in September. He estimated the cost to the county at about $240,000.

“It’s just been horrible,” Secary said of the work involved.
