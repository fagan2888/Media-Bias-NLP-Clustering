Local residents came out to the bi-annual Mothers of Preschoolers Mega Yard Sale Saturday.

The group puts on the event twice a year in hopes to raise money to help pay for daycare for the children. Over 40 spots were occupied at the yard sale, as the spaces to participate in the sale were sold to people from the Meridian area.

"We ask people to come and pay $15 for a spot or $25 for two, so we give them a deal," vendor Shannon Wright says. "And they bring anything they have to sale and we make money off of the concession stand and selling the spots to pay for our childcare during our meetings."

The organization was established through 15th Avenue Baptist Church to give moms of preschoolers an adult outlet to socialize.
