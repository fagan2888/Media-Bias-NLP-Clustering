Qatar Airways has withdrawn its Airbus A380 superjumbo, saying the still undelivered plane is not yet ready.\n\nAt the July 11-13 Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) in England, visitors were disappointed after Lockheed Martin Corp\u2019s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet failed to make the military air show.\n\nAn engine fire has triggered a fleetwide grounding of the Pentagon\u2019s newest warplane \u2013 and the world\u2019s single most expensive weapons program - but officials are still hoping the stealth fighter will be cleared to fly at Farnborough.\n\nRIAT visitors drawn by posters making it one of the most anticipated aviation events had to settle for a \u201cstress ball\u201d shaped like an F-35 but saw a dazzling display of other planes.\n\n\u201cIt was the main reason for us to come here - to see the F-35; it is a big disappointment,\" said Jan Corstjens, a retired Dutch pharmaceutical executive with a private pilot's license.\n\nThe U.S. Navy said on Friday it was not yet ready to lift the flying ban on F-35B and F-35C models.\n\nTensions over the crisis in Ukraine have also depleted this year\u2019s Farnborough show with Russia adopting a scaled-down presence, focusing on civil displays and the space industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that because of tensions with Western governments over differences between Russia and Ukraine, the military presence is really scaled down at this year\u2019s Farnborough,\u201d said Alexander Velovich, sales representative for Russian and Ukrainian clients at the Farnborough Airshow.\n\nMany Russian visitors have struggled to obtain British visas and on Friday more than 100 of the expected 450 delegates were yet to receive clearance, said Velovich.\n\nSomewhat more predictable is the drumbeat of civil orders led by leasing firms, despite fears of airline overcapacity and a peak in the aerospace cycle that have caused the U.S. sector to underperform wider stocks by around 10 percent this year.\n\nAirbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N) are expected to grab more than 500 orders worth well over $50 billion, including a major 100-plane order for Airbus aircraft from leasing company SMBC, reported by Reuters on Thursday.\n\nQatar Airways may finalize an order for 50 Boeing 777X jets and order Airbus small A320 jets, while Boeing could confirm the defection of UK's Monarch Airlines from Airbus as both planemakers pursue a relentless battle for market share.\n\nBut analysts are likely to scrutinize the announcements more closely than ever to see how much is genuinely new business.\n\n\"With the usual Airshow games, we could see some previously announced orders being firmed up, and unidentified orders being identified,\" RBC analyst Rob Stallard said in a note.\n\nA330 RE-LAUNCH\n\nMost attention will be on Airbus as it kicks off the show by launching a revamped and rebranded version of the A330 jetliner.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong likelihood it will be announced at Farnborough,\" a senior airline industry source said.\n\nAirbus hopes to generate more than 1,000 new sales with new engines and curved aerodynamic winglets, but is also preparing to back away from the newer A350-800 which it once hoped would replace the A330 and underpin its new A350 jet family.\n\nAirbus has only 34 A350-800s left on order, including Hawaiian Airlines which is being courted for the revamped A330.\n\nThe airline has previously been reluctant to change to a different model, but a spokeswoman told Reuters it was ready to examine the A330neo since the A350-800 may not be built.\n\nBoeing officials say the change demonstrates its rival\u2019s wavering strategy and that the market will be both far smaller than Airbus hopes - closer to 400 aircraft - and short-lived.\n\nStill, the launch is expected to lead to stiff competition as Boeing tries to limit any damage to margins and sales of its carbon-fiber 787.\n\nIn a last-minute switch, the upgraded model may be named A330-800/900neo - instead of the -200/-300 tags used in pre-marketing - in an effort to smooth the end of the A350-800 and add a new tier in Airbus's portfolio.\n\nUnmanned vehicles will also be a big topic at the show as the United States wrestles with export policy while Europe struggles to close a gap with Israel and the United States.\n\nFew will be able to forget that the air show is also taking place under the shadow of Malaysian Flight MH370.\n\nThe reasons for the jet\u2019s disappearance remain a mystery, but the fruitless international search could fuel interest in tracking technology and more maritime surveillance aircraft, with U.S. and European models on display as Britain ponders whether to replace its recently scrapped Nimrod aircraft.\n\nThe aerospace industry is itching for Britain to open bids for a replacement after cancelling the delayed BAE Systems (BAES.L) Nimrod MRA4 in 2010, but Defence Minister Philip Hammond has suggested it may study a more complex solution including unmanned vehicles rather than a quick plane order.\n\n(Additional reporting by Karen Jacobs; Editing by Mark Potter and Jason Neely)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tim Hepher, Andrea Shalal and
