She\u2019s heard she will have to have insurance next year but like her cousin Lena Cunningham they are unclear how to get it or again how to pay for it.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have an income then how can I pay the premium?\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nOpen enrollment in the new Health Insurance Marketplace in Georgia begins Tuesday as the biggest and most significant piece of the Affordable Care Act. The Department of Health and Human Services said that premiums in the exchanges are actually lower than expected in Georgia and nationally are about 16 percent below what was projected. And many families will qualify for tax credit subsidies.\n\nBut even those charged with implementing the enrollment and the new coverage acknowledge the launch is likely to be bumpy. Some expect that it will be similar to the beginning of the last massive federal health benefit program, which was the Med\u00adicare Part D prescription drug coverage that began in January 2005. Many people did not have their cards, help lines were jammed and pharmacists were frustrated in the early going.\n\nMedicare Part D had \u201creally significant problems in the early weeks and months,\u201d said Gary Cohen, the deputy administrator and director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cThe same thing is going to happen with this program.\u201d\n\nIN GEORGIA, many of those who are supposed to be helping with enrollment are scrambling to complete the training required to become a navigator. Only three had actually been licensed by the state as a navigator but nine more were just waiting to clear the background check before they could be licensed and \u201cthat could be completed this week,\u201d said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens. Twenty people have taken the test needed to be licensed under Georgia law \u2013 with 16 passing \u2013 and another 13 have registered to take the test, he said.\n\nIn Augusta, outside of 2.5 positions that will be helping to enroll people through the Community Health Centers of Christ Community Health Services and Medical Associates Plus, there is a great need for volunteers to come forward and help answer questions, said Janice Sherman, the CEO of Medical Associates. The center said there are an estimated 50,000 uninsured in Augusta and 19,000 in Columbia County alone.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want are some volunteers to help expand the capacity because we really don\u2019t have the capacity based on what the potential demand is,\u201d she said. Sherman hopes retired will come forward to help answer questions.\n\nAND THERE ARE a lot of questions, said Terri Gant, the community outreach manager at Medical As\u00adsociates and a navigator in training.\n\nAs she goes to events to help educate people about what is coming, Gant says she is typically greeted with, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about Obamacare. What is it?\u201d\n\nSo she starts \u201cfrom the beginning, letting them know the correct name is Affordable Care Act. We\u2019re kind of starting from there and going through the whole gamut, letting them know what it is all about, who is eligible, what the enrollment process is going to look like for them. Also teaching them about this is what you need when you come to the table.\u201d\n\nPeople can enroll online through healthcare.gov, they can contact a call center or they can get the forms and mail it in, Gant said. Going through the Web site allows them to see what subsidies they might be eligible for to help pay premiums. People can go in and record their information and then come back later to enroll if they want to do further research. As they research plans, there will be a link to see what a plan\u2019s provider network looks like, Cohen said. They will be able to look at different copays and deductibles, Sherman said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played around with the information to see if it is really complex and it\u2019s really not,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just more time-consuming and it really has to do with each individual\u2019s ability to grasp that, from a literacy standpoint.\u201d For some people, it may be necessary to explain what some of these insurance concepts mean. Before it begins, it is hard to know where the pitfalls will be, Sherman said.\n\n\u201cThe best way to really understand how much more education is needed is just to start enrolling people,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we really aren\u2019t going to know until you get on the site.\u201d\n\nOne thing working against them is the low level of penalty for not having health insurance, which Gant said was $95 or 1 percent of income the first year. The penalty increases sharply in subsequent years, she said.\n\nCHRIST COMMUNITY was hiring people last week to help and are hoping they get up to speed soon, said Ron Skenes, the director of communications and development.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, it\u2019s just a matter of getting the people on board, getting them up to speed on the whole process of identifying what\u2019s available and who\u2019s qualified and then what the process is for getting them signed up,\u201d he said.\n\nProbably about half of Medical Associates\u2019 patients will be eligible for coverage, Sherman said. About 60-75 percent of Christ Community\u2019s patients right now are uninsured, Skenes said.\n\n\u201cWe want to do what we can to help them understand what their options are and see what\u2019s available that they might be eligible for,\u201d he said.\n\nThough open enrollment starts Tuesday, federal health officials said they don\u2019t expect a rush in the first weeks or months. Judging by enrollment in other programs, people will wait until just before the deadline to do it, which would likely be December if they want coverage in January or just before the open enrollment period ends on March 31, said Julie Bataille, the director of the Office of Communications for CMS.\n\nThat\u2019s an important point for patients to remember \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be done this week, Sherman said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Latest News, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Open enrollment in the new Health Insurance Marketplace in Georgia begins Tuesday as the biggest and most significant piece of the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;", "title": "Questions abound as health care enrollment begins", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2013-09-28/questions-abound-health-care-enrollment-begins", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/12658277.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "Open enrollment in the new Health Insurance Marketplace in Georgia begins Tuesday as the biggest and most significant piece of the Affordable Care Act.\nAND THERE ARE a lot of questions, said Terri Gant, the community outreach manager at Medical As\u00adsociates and a navigator in training.\nThough open enrollment starts Tuesday, federal health officials said they don\u2019t expect a rush in the first weeks or months.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so high with the money they make he wouldn\u2019t bring anything home,\u201d she said outside the Medical Associates Plus at Belle Terrace clinic in south Augusta.\nBut even those charged with implementing the enrollment and the new coverage acknowledge the launch is likely to be bumpy."}
