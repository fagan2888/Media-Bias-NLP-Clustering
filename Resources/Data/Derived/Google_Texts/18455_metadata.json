Her title is now Director of Public Relations.\n\nIn an internal memo, she received high praise. \u201cThis year she broke records we never considered,\u201d wrote Sara Olson, Executive Director of Media and Marketing. \u201c\u2026Bottom line: Olivia knows what it takes to get people talking about Politico.\u201d\n\nSee the full memo below\u2026\n\nSubject: Great news\n\nAll \u2013\n\nI wanted to take a minute to recognize and congratulate the person who powers POLITICO\u2019s hype Jets: The talented and dedicated Olivia Petersen.\n\nOver the last two years, Olivia has worked tirelessly to get POLITICOs on television and radio. Just this year \u2013 along with Suzie Romeo and Cate Martel\u2019s hard work\u2013 she broke records we never even considered. In October alone, POLITICO reporters and editors (you all!) did more than 800 television and radio appearances. This is an outstanding number.\n\nOn top of overseeing the strategic direction of the booking department, Olivia has also been instrumental in promoting POLITICO\u2019s new products, special projects and events. This fall that included: three Pro launches, POLITICO Magazine, Women Rule, the Obamacare Guide, Capital New York, our Va. Poll, POWERJobs and too many events to count. She\u2019s secured placement in everything from Ed Week to Zagat to The Weather Channel to The New York Times.\n\nBottom line: Olivia knows what it takes to get people talking about POLITICO. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to share that Olivia has been promoted to Director of Public Relations.\n\nIn this position, Olivia will continue to oversee the TV/Radio department but will take a larger role in managing the promotion of the company\u2019s biggest initiatives and partnerships.\n\nPlease take a moment to congratulate Olivia on her much-deserved promotion!\n\nSara", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Betsy Rothstein", "description": "Just in time for the holidays, Olivia Petersen, a publicist for Politico, is getting her present early in the form of a promotion.
