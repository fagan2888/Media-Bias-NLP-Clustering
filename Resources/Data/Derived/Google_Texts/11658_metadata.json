The ACA made many screenings and preventive services available with no cost-sharing, meaning that they\u2019re free, as long as you pay your monthly health insurance premiums. But don\u2019t assume everything is automatically covered. Read on to learn what you should investigate before going in for care and prescriptions.\n\nWhich birth control is covered under Obamacare?\n\nBirth control methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration are largely covered with no cost-sharing. This includes most oral contraceptives (birth control pills), intra-uterine devices (IUDs), injections, diaphragms, vaginal rings and emergency contraceptive pills.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that you could be charged if you elect a brand-name contraceptive when a generic version is available. If you have a legitimate medical reason for needing the brand-name pill over the generic, you may be able to work with your doctor in getting a waiver from your insurance carrier, allowing you to receive the more expensive birth control without charge.\n\nSome health insurance companies are more restrictive than others when it comes to determining which contraceptives to cover. Though they are required to cover several different classifications of contraceptives, they can group these offerings and only offer one from each group. For example, your health insurance carrier may require you to pay for a vaginal ring if it covers other contraceptives considered \u201chormonal methods.\u201d Again, by working with your physician, you may be able to have these costs waived if covered alternatives wouldn\u2019t be medically appropriate.\n\n\n\nYour health insurance must be ACA-compliant. Some health insurance plans are \u201cgrandfathered,\u201d that is, they were in existence before March 23, 2010 and are therefore exempt from the rules set forth by the Affordable Care Act. If your health insurance is a grandfathered plan, you may be subject to cost-sharing copays and out-of-pocket expenses not seen in newer ACA plans.\n\nServices and prescriptions must come through in-network providers. Your health insurance will cover your preventive care and contraceptives at no cost to you only if your medical provider is in-network. If you go out of the carrier\u2019s network of doctors, you could find yourself owing more out-of-pocket.\n\nSome employer-based coverage is exempt from providing free contraception. If you work for a religious organization, your insurance may not cover birth control pills and other forms of contraceptives. This exemption can also apply to religious hospitals and colleges that object to providing such coverage.\n\nOther free well-woman care\n\nIn addition to contraceptives, health insurance plans must cover a wide array of preventive services exclusively for women. These include but aren\u2019t limited to:\n\nAnnual well-woman visits\n\nMammograms\n\nCancer screenings, including genetic tests for high-risk patients\n\nScreenings for sexually transmitted infections\n\nDomestic violence screenings and counseling\n\nBreastfeeding support\n\nOsteoporosis screening for women over age 60\n\nThe value of free contraceptives and preventive care\n\nThe number of privately insured women who received free birth control pills rose from 15% in fall 2012 to 67% in spring 2014, marking the effects of the ACA goal to ensure women receive contraception at no cost. The new study from Guttmacher Institute indicates the number of women benefiting from free birth control will increase further in 2015.\n\nA NerdWallet analysis earlier this year found the benefits of receiving free preventive care to be extremely valuable to women. Comparing what an uninsured woman would pay out-of-pocket for yearly preventive care to what a woman would receive through her ACA-compliant health insurance, NerdWallet found the average insurance premiums to be a money-saver, without taking into account additional doctor\u2019s visits and health care expenses.\n\nThrough the ACA, preventive care including contraceptives is free for women. Knowing your health insurance plan, understanding the network it covers and learning about your birth control options can ensure you receive the care you need with no cost-sharing.\n\n[4 in 5 medical bills contain errors.
