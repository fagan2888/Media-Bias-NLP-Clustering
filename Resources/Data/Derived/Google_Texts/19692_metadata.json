Submit it here and veteran reporter Deb Pressey will chase down an answer.\n\nThis week ...\n\nQ: My company offers a family health plan, but it\u2019s gotten so expensive I\u2019m thinking about dropping out of it and going the Obamacare route while I have the chance. Is that allowed and what are the things to consider?\n\nA: Unless your salary is very low, the law doesn\u2019t work in favor of dropping out of an employer plan and signing up for a government marketplace plan.\n\nHere\u2019s what largely keeps people seeking cheaper coverage outside an employer plans stuck: Nothing stops you from enrolling in Obanacare if you want. But under the rules, if you\u2019re offered health coverage at work that covers the required basics and it\u2019s considered affordable, you don\u2019t qualify for a tax subsidy that lowers the premium costs on Obamacare health plans, according to Champaign County Health Care Consumers Organizer Jen Tayabji.\n\n\u201cAffordable\u201d specifically means your share of the premium cost for the health plan that would cover only you (not your family) is less than 9.56 percent of your family income.\n\nThe fact that family coverage costs so much more than the individual coverage used in the calculation is how this provision became known as the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in the law, Tayabji said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest things that needs to be fixed,\u201d she added.\n\nThe average cost of an entire year\u2019s family premium (employer and employee shares combined) is running $17,545, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation 2015 Employer Health Benefits Survey. That\u2019s more than an entire year\u2019s salary for a minimum wage worker.\n\nThat said, here are some possible options to a family health plan that is squeezing your budget:\n\n\u2014 You or you and your spouse go back to individual coverage at work and you pick up individual coverage elsewhere for just your kids. Children can be less expensive to cover separately, even without the help of subsidies, and depending on how much your share of the premium costs for single coverage at work, the total cost of individual plans for everybody in the family can add up to less than an expensive family health plan.\n\n\u2014 Your children may also qualify for coverage under the Illinois\u2019 All Kids program, Tayabji said. See this link for the guidelines at www.allkids.com/income.html\n\n\u2014 If your pay is very low, you may qualify for coverage through Medicaid yourself.\n\nFor anyone considering jumping from an employer plan while the government marketplace open enrollment is under way (Nov. 1, 2015-Jan. 31) here are some important things to keep in mind:\n\nWeigh the entire premium cost and whether your employer is currently helping pay for it. If you take on the premium alone in the marketplace without a subsidy, you\u2019ll be footing the entire bill yourself.\n\nLook at what all your costs will be, not just the premium, and what benefits will you stand to gain or lose. For example, does your employer plan include dental coverage? Obamacare plans don\u2019t include dental. You can add dental, \u201cbut it will cost you more,\u201d Tayabji said.\n\nCarefully check the provider network of the plan you\u2019re considering. Your doctors or hospital may or may not be in it.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Champaign,Urbana,Danville,Paxton,Rantoul,Mahomet,Monticello,Tuscola,East Central Illinois,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,News", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-11-04/health-reporter-nov-4-2015.html", "image": "/sites/all/files/images/2015/11/04/1104_loca_health_copy.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "My company offers a family health plan, but it\u2019s gotten so expensive I\u2019m thinking about dropping out of it and going the Obamacare route while I have the chance.
