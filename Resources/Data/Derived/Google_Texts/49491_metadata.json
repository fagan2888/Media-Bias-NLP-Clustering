The U.S. economy is in the early years of a 16-year long period of expansion, the Cold War is over, globalization is kicking into high gear and the Internet is emerging as the Thing That Changes All Things. Sounds like a pretty good time to start a business, right?\n\nIndeed it was, as members of the Class of \u201994, which includes Amazon and Yahoo, will tell you. But 20 years later, here\u2019s something to chew on: according to data from S&P CapitalIQ, of all the companies founded in 1994 that are still traded on a major index today, only six have made more than a billion dollars in cumulative profit in the two decades since.\n\nAnd Amazon is far from the leader of that pack. In fact, if you\u2019re looking for pure profit, you\u2019d have been better off with video game retailer GameStop, or kidney dialysis provider DaVita HealthCare Partners. And Yahoo, long derided in the media for losing touch with the cutting edge of the dotcom business, is running rings around all of them.\n\nHere are the details of the six members of 1994\u2032s billion-dollar club:\n\nYahoo CEO Marissa Mayer delivers a keynote address at CES in Las Vegas.

But one thing the company has been consistently able to do is make money, reporting annual profits of more than $500 million every year since 2004 (and more than $1 billion every year since 2010). They last year Yahoo reported a loss was way back in 2001.\n\nLiberty Interactive chairman John Malone Asa Mathat\n\n2) Liberty Interactive Corp.\n\n$5.28bn in cumulative profit, $14bn market cap\n\nFormerly known as Liberty Media Corporation, the company has a convoluted history as part of media tycoon John Malone\u2019s decades of complex deal making and restructuring. The present iteration of the company includes a portfolio of home shopping and e-commerce brands, as well as controlling stakes in TripAdvisor and Expedia and investments in both Time Warner and Time Warner Cable. Its total profit since 1994 is a tale of two very different decades: It lost about $12.5 billion from 1995 to 2004, and then pulled in about $17.7 billion in profit from 2005 to 2013.\n\nKen Thiry, CEO of DaVita HealthCare Ray Ng\n\n3) DaVita HealthCare Partners\n\n$4.39bn in cumulative profit, $15.3bn market cap\n\nIf you want a nice stable way to earn money, offering dialysis services for patients suffering from kidney failure seems like a good way to do it: the company now serves 165,000 patients in almost 2,100 clinics around the country, and hasn\u2019t reported an annual loss since 1999.\n\nBloomberg News\n\n4) GameStop\n\n$2.34bn in cumulative profit, $5.3 billion market cap\n\nThe video game retailer has been profitable for 12 of the 15 years it has been reporting results, but is dealing with with a slowdown in physical game sales. The company is trying to navigate the transition to mobile gaming and the rise of app stores, downloads and streaming games, and has been trimming its store count by 1% to 2% each year in recent years.\n\nAmazon Fresh trucks sit parked at a warehouse in Inglewood, California. Getty Images\n\n5) Amazon\n\n$2.2bn in cumulative profit, $147bn in market cap\n\nThe magic of Amazon\u2019s giant revenues, sky-high valuation and almost comical indifference to making a profit has been well documented. It made less money than GameStop in the last 20 years, but its investors are much more interested in the next 20, when its dominance of online retailing should, they hope, eventually turn into a river of profits.\n\nAn image from Aimco\u2019s multi-year redevelopment at Lincoln Place in Venice, CA, from the company\u2019s 2013 annual report. Aimco\n\n6) Apartment Investment & Management Company (Aimco)\n\n$1.83bn in cumulative profit, $5bn market cap\n\nAimco, a Denver-based real estate investment trust, owns about 41,000 apartments spread across 117 apartment communities. And as any rent-paying observer knows, the landlord rarely loses: In the case of Aimco, it has only lost money in three of the 20 years it has reported annual results, during the housing crisis years of 2009-12.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "You would think 1994 was a good time to start a business, but of all the companies founded that year who are still listed today, just six have made more than a billion dollars in cumulative profit in the last 20 years.", "title": "The Class of \u201994: Is Amazon Really King?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/28/the-class-of-94-is-amazon-really-king/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DV491_amznph_P_20140724210223.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "The Class of \u201994: Is Amazon Really King?", "description": "You would think 1994 was a good time to start a business, but of all the companies founded that year who are still listed today, just six have made more than a billion dollars in cumulative profit in the last 20 years.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "You would think 1994 was a good time to start a business, but of all the companies founded that year who are still listed today, just six have made more than a billion dollars in cumulative profit in the last 20 years.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-28T17:45:47-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/28/the-class-of-94-is-amazon-really-king/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5224", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "You would think 1994 was a good time to start a business, but of all the companies founded that year who are still listed today, just six have made more than a billion dollars in cumulative profit in the last 20 years.", "title": "The Class of \u201994: Is Amazon Really King?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/28/the-class-of-94-is-amazon-really-king/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DV491_amznph_P_20140724210223.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5224", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-28T20:28:45-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1cf\"", "article_summary": "Indeed it was, as members of the Class of \u201994, which includes Amazon and Yahoo, will tell you.\nAimco6) Apartment Investment & Management Company (Aimco)$1.83bn in cumulative profit, $5bn market capAimco, a Denver-based real estate investment trust, owns about 41,000 apartments spread across 117 apartment communities.\nGetty Images5) Amazon$2.2bn in cumulative profit, $147bn in market capThe magic of Amazon\u2019s giant revenues, sky-high valuation and almost comical indifference to making a profit has been well documented.\nAn image from Aimco\u2019s multi-year redevelopment at Lincoln Place in Venice, CA, from the company\u2019s 2013 annual report.\nBloomberg News4) GameStop$2.34bn in cumulative profit, $5.3 billion market capThe video game retailer has been profitable for 12 of the 15 years it has been reporting results, but is dealing with with a slowdown in physical game sales."}
