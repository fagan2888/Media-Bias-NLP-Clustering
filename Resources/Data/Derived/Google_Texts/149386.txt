KPMG LLP has agreed to acquire the assets of health-care consulting firm Beacon Partners Inc., as the Big Four accounting and professional-services giant continues beefing up its services to clients in the health-care industry.

Financial terms aren’t being disclosed for the deal, which KPMG announced Sunday.

Beacon Partners, based in Weymouth, Mass., provides management consulting services to hospitals, physician groups and other health-care providers. The firm has annual revenue of more than $60 million.

KPMG’s agreement to buy Beacon is the latest step in the bigger firm’s attempt to strengthen its position in the health-care industry, especially in terms of information technology. Health-care consulting is expected to grow significantly in the coming years as a result of the Affordable Care Act health-care law and trends like the growth of “big data.”

Last June, KPMG bought Zanett Commercial Solutions, a Cincinnati-based technology-consulting firm with a significant focus on health care. KPMG also acquired Cynergy Systems Inc., a digital and mobile technology business, in February 2014.
