The works sold at New York's Affordable Art Fair run on the compact side.

"Our apartments tend to be small here," said Cristina Salmastrelli, the fair's director.

In contrast with similar sales held in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Stockholm, New Yorkers are more willing to purchase "works that you have to look at and spend time with to learn to love," Ms. Salmastrelli said. The fall fair, which takes place over the weekend, includes painting, photography, sculpture and mixed-media works from 57 galleries world-wide.

"New York City loves photography," Ms. Salmastrelli said. "We make sure we have photography on site."

Works for sale start at $100 and cap at $10,000, with half of it priced under $5,000. The average price is $2,000-$3,000, tens of thousands of dollars below the prices at major art fairs and auctions. Here's a sampling of what you can score at (relatively) bargain prices:
