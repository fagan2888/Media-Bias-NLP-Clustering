Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, as a preoccupied Senate and House scramble to hammer out a budget deal before the holidays.\n\nIn the House, where individual committees take the lead in drafting major legislation, Judiciary Chairman Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., has been hesitant to move on Chaffetz\u2019s proposal.\n\nBut the duo remain upbeat that they can advance the legislation during the omnibus appropriations process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really optimistic on this one,\u201d Chaffetz told CQ Roll Call. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the appropriators now.\u201d\n\nSo far, GOP leadership has remained quiet on this issue.\n\nThe Utah Republican first ignited the debate in July, when he introduced the Remote Transactions Parity Act. At the time, Chaffetz said the legislation aimed to restore the balance between traditional brick-and-mortar businesses and online retailers.\n\n\u201cThe current tax loophole skews the free market,\u201d Chaffetz said in July. \u201cIt allows businesses that employ fewer people and contribute to the economies of fewer states to avoid collecting sales taxes.\u201d\n\nAt issue is whether, as Alexander and Chaffetz propose, a state may compel an out-of-state retailer or other vendor to collect sales taxes from its residents. Should Ohio, for example, be able to force an online Indiana business to collect the Buckeye State\u2019s sales tax from customers who live in Ohio?\n\n>>> Commentary: What\u2019s Wrong With the Latest Internet Sales Tax Bill\n\nIn the 1992 case Quill v. North Dakota, the Supreme Court ruled that a state can\u2019t do that. Instead, taxation is tied to geography, the court ruled: A business incurs the burden of collecting sales tax only if it has an actual physical presence in that state.\n\nAlexander introduced similar legislation in the Senate, the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has spearheaded opposition to changing the status quo. In a letter to congressional leadership sent on Cyber Monday, Rubio warned that \u201conline sales tax legislation would stifle small business growth and job creation.\u201d\n\nFellow Republicans who cosigned the Rubio letter\u2014Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, and Steve Daines of Montana\u2014also criticized Alexander\u2019s bill for targeting Internet business \u201cas a new source of tax revenue to fund bigger government.\u201d\n\nNow online retailers on both sides of the issue are crowdsourcing support for and against the legislation.\n\nSome large electronic commerce conglomerates such as Amazon.com support an online sales tax\u2014and they\u2019re already enforcing it. In 26 different states since February, the Internet\u2019s largest retailer has collected from the consumer and returned sales tax to those governments.\n\nA sales tax likely wouldn\u2019t come as a shock to consumers. A 2013 market research study found that half of online shoppers already paid sales taxes. But it could prove a logistical logjam for small online businesses.\n\nOn Friday, eBay came out swinging in opposition, encouraging its users to \u201ctell Congress not to pass harmful year-end sales tax legislation.\u201d\n\nThe online auctioneer warned that the measures in the Senate and House would force online retailers \u201cto adhere to tax laws in more than 9,600 tax jurisdictions\u201d and prepare for the risk of \u201caudits and enforcement by far-away state tax enforcement agencies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThe current tax loophole skews the free market,\u201d Rep.
