Jim Webb (D-Va.) launched his longshot presidential campaign 11 days ago, some skepticism was in order. Anytime a national candidate kicks off a campaign with a lengthy, poorly formatted blog post , published on the eve of a holiday weekend, it\u2019s bound to raise questions about the seriousness of the enterprise.\n\nAs msnbc\u2019s Alex Seitz-Wald reported , those questions got a little louder yesterday.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Jim Webb said his party has \u201cmoved way far to the left\u201d and is \u201cnot my Democratic Party in and of itself\u201d in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cI believe we can bring a different tone to the Democratic Party,\u201d Webb told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. \u201cYou\u2019re right, the party has moved way far to the left. That\u2019s not my Democratic Party in and of itself. We need to bring working people back into the formula.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a tip for Democratic presidential candidates: try to avoid going on Fox News and criticizing your party\u2019s ideology. It might help in the primaries.\n\nPart of the problem is that Webb\u2019s critique is just factually wrong. For one thing, Democrats continue to champion a policy agenda focused on the interests of working people. For another, when the former senator says the party has \u201cmoved way far to the left,\u201d he should probably be more specific about his concerns. Because on nearly every major issue, the Democratic position is largely in line with the American mainstream\u2019s position \u2013 which is generally a good thing for political parties, not a problem to be avoided.\n\nIf Webb wants to argue that the country has moved to the left in the Obama era, he\u2019d be on firmer ground, but again, the Virginian needs to explain why this disappoints him.\n\nIn the same interview, Webb added, \u201cNext Saturday, in the far southwest of Virginia, there\u2019s going to be a medical clinic, a remote area medical clinic to take care of people who don\u2019t have medical insurance. It\u2019s out at the wise county fairgrounds. I hope Fox will go down there and take a look at it. They\u2019re going to take care of about 6,000, at least, if historical records hold, people with no medical care. They\u2019ll pull 3,000 teeth. And these are people forgotten by both parties. And I think they need a voice.\u201d\n\nBut again, these people haven\u2019t been forgotten by both parties. Democrats have championed the Affordable Care Act that\u2019s intended to provide coverage to the exact people Webb is concerned about.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to Donald Trump, Webb denounced \u201cdivisive, inflammatory rhetoric,\u201d but he quickly added a both-sides-do-it addendum: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen from the liberal side as well, we\u2019ve seen this kind of rhetoric as it goes to Southern white cultures.\u201d\n\nIt was an informative comment. Webb sees the modern Democratic coalition as incomplete \u2013 he remembers when white, working-class Southerners voted Democratic, and the former senator wants to be their candidate. He believes he can appeal to these voters with a combination of economic populism and cultural conservatism, including an embrace of, as Webb put it, \u201c Southern white cultures.\u201d\n\nThe problem, of course, is that these same voters are now die-hard Republicans in the GOP\u2019s most reliable region. Webb is running for the Democratic nomination while appearing on Fox, making appeals to the other party\u2019s base.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Jim Webb remembers when white, working-class Southerners voted Democratic, and the former senator wants to be their candidate.
