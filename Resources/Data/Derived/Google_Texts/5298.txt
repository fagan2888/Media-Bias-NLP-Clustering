Rowena, SD

Authorities confirm a Sioux Falls teenager was killed in a Sunday night car crash on Highway 42. 18-year-old Meg Raj Gajmer was driving east, toward Rowena, when his car crossed the center line and hit 26-year-old Michael Fedt's pickup truck, which was going west. The cars went into the north ditch.

A day later, tire marks and pieces of cars litter the snow. The impact of the crash that killed Gajmer goes beyond the side of the road.

"I feel horrible. I have a 19-year-old son. I don't mean to cry, but I feel horrible that someone's child - and they're never going to kiss them, hug them, and tell them they love them again," Julie Watters said.

Watters drove by the crash while she was on her way home from her parents' house, who live four miles away from the crash site.

She said the area smelled like gasoline, and steam was coming from the cars.

"You could hear, 'Psh, psh,' coming from the other car. It was eerie," Watters said.

Authorities say Gajmer was wearing a seat belt. Fedt was not wearing one and has serious injuries, but authorities say they are non-life threatening. His passenger, Jessica Loosbrock, has minor injuries. Authorities are still investigating what actually caused the crash. Watters said she pulled over to try to help.

"I focused on the people that were in the truck and he was saying he was dizzy and stuff, so I told him he could sit in my car, or he finally sat on his bumper. He was in shock," Watters said.

She says she at the time, she didn't know if Gajmer was ok or not. She says his car was totaled.

"The tire to the front of the passenger side was clear up by the motor. It was horrible," Watters said. "All you can do is pray and hope everybody's ok. Didn't turn out that well."
