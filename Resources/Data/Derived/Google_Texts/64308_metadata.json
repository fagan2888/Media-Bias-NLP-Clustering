It\u2019s a thorny problem for Republicans. Why\u2019s that? Because right now one of those candidates, Donald Trump, is loud enough to drown out all the other \u201cmajor\u201d candidates.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be fun if the nomination contest was more like a basketball tournament? Then top-seeded Donald Trump would face 16th seed Ohio Gov. John Kasich in a battle of ideas. Or how about dropping the bunch in the jungle Naked and Afraid. We could even start voting and eliminate a candidate every week, until it\u2019s just the Republican versus a Democrat.\n\nEnough. Back to the chaos. And Donald Trump.\n\nAs The Washington Post put it on Sunday: \u201cFor yet another week, Trump talk dominated the Sunday morning political shows, with several devoting roundtable discussions to his disruption of the GOP presidential primary and at least two of his GOP rivals using their clashes with him in recent days as a means of securing interviews on the shows \u2014 during which they continued to clash with him.\u201d\n\nOn August 6 in Cleveland the first debate is set, an opportunity to raise serious issues. As if. It\u2019s more likely that it will be Trump versus the other nine candidates tossing one-liners back and forth.\n\nOf course American Indian and Alaska Native issues don\u2019t get attention this early anyway. Usually that happens late in the campaigns, during the general election, when a position paper is released that outlines the candidate\u2019s official policy. That\u2019s too bad. It would be good to press candidates from both parties about how they see treaties, the federal-Indian relationship, and the management of federal programs that serve Native Americans.\n\nThen again it\u2019s pretty clear where most stand. The Tea Party wing of the Republicans \u2014 Trump, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul \u2014 would dramatically cut federal spending. Paul has even called for the elimination of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and drastic cuts at the Indian Health Service. If any of this happened, the Sequester would be the Good Old Days.\n\nEven a self-described serious candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, suggests its time to reshape government. A few days ago in Tallahassee, he said that as governor he used a hiring freeze to shrink state government. He suggested the same approach would work in Washington where only one employee could be hired for every three who retire or leave government service. Bush also said it ought to be easier to fire federal employees. \u201cThere are a lot of exemplary employees in the federal government, but they\u2019re treated no better than the bad ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bad ones are almost impossible to effectively discipline or remove.\u201d\n\nCandidate Kasich was chairman of the House Budget Committee when President Bill Clinton declared the \u201cera of big government is over.\u201d That suited Kasich then. And now. One proposal at the time was to \u201creinvent\u201d the Bureau of Indian Affairs with a block grant program. \u201cThe reinvented Bureau of Indian Affairs would provide block grants, rather than engaging in the direct provision of services or the direct supervision of tribal activities,\u201d the House proposal said. This \u201cwould reduce the central office operations of the BIA by 50 percent and eliminate funding for the Navajo and western Oklahoma area offices. It would eliminate technical assistance of Indian enterprises, through which technical assistance for economic enterprises is provided by contracts with the private sector or with other Federal agencies.\u201d Congress would have ended direct loans and reduce loan guarantees.\n\nThe Republicans running for president all share contempt for the Affordable Care Act (and most don\u2019t know that would include the provisions of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.) All are also supportive of more development, such as the Keystone XL Pipeline, and generally dismissive of any action to limit climate change.\n\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still partial to a Naked and Afraid competition.\n\nMark Trahant is an independent journalist and a member of The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes.
