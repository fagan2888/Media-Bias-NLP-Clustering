Sometimes, it\u2019s because a physician has multiple offices, and not all are in network, as in Durocher\u2019s case. Sometimes, it\u2019s because a participating hospital relies on out-of-network doctors, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists.\n\nConsumer advocates say the sheer scope of such problems undermine promises made by proponents of the Affordable Care Act that the law would protect against medical bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair and probably not legal that consumers be left holding the bag when an out-of-network doctor treats them,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. Jost said it\u2019s a different matter if a consumer knowingly chooses an out-of-network doctor.\n\nDurocher learned only after getting her surgeon\u2019s bill that just one of his two offices participated in her plan and she had chosen the wrong one. She said the doctor\u2019s staff later insisted that they had raised the issue during her initial consultation, but she doesn\u2019t recall that, possibly because she was distracted by her cancer diagnosis.\n\nAdding insult to injury, insurers are not required to count out-of-network charges toward the federal health law\u2019s annual limit on how much of their medical costs patients can be asked to pay out of their own pockets.\n\nEfforts by doctors, hospitals and other health providers to charge patients for bills not covered by their insurers are called \u201cbalance billing.\u201d The problem pre-dates the federal health law and has long been among the top complaints filed with state insurance regulators.\n\nBecause the issue is complex and pits powerful rivals against one another\u2014 among them, hospitals, doctors and insurers\u2014 relatively few states have addressed it. What laws do exist are generally limited to specific situations, such as emergency room care, or certain types of insurance plans, such as HMOs.\n\nThe federal health law largely sidesteps the issue as well. It says insurers must include coverage for emergency care and not charge policyholders higher copayments for ER services at non-network hospitals, because patients can\u2019t always choose where they go. While the insurer will pay a portion of the bill, in such cases, doctors or hospitals may still bill patients for the difference between that payment and their own charges.\n\nThat means that in spite of having insurance, a consumer involved in a car wreck and taken to a non-network hospital might receive additional bills, not just from the hospital, but from the radiologist who read his X-rays, the surgeon who repaired his broken leg and the laboratory that processed his blood tests.\n\n\n\n[ALSO: How to Make the Most of Free Preventive Care Under the ACA]\n\nNetworks Get Narrower\n\nAdvocates believe a growing number of consumers are vulnerable to balance billing as insurance networks grow smaller in the bid to hold down costs.\n\nFor example, there were no in-network emergency room physicians or anesthesiologists in some of the hospitals participating in plans offered by three large insurers in Texas in 2013 and 2014, according to a survey of state data by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a Texas advocacy group.\n\nSmaller networks are also becoming more common in employer-based insurance: About 23 percent of job-based plans had so-called \u201cnarrow networks\u201d in 2012, up from 15 percent in 2007, according to a May report from the Urban Institute and Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\nTo protect consumers, advocacy groups, including Consumers Union and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, want regulators to strictly limit balance billing when an insured person gets care in a medical facility that is part of an insurer\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cWithout protection from balance billing, the cost of out-of-network care can be overwhelming,\u201d wrote Consumers Union in a recent letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which is updating a model law that states could adopt to regulate insurance networks.\n\nNAIC\u2019S current draft does not directly address the issue of balance billing and consumer efforts have drawn sharp opposition from insurers, hospitals and doctors.\n\nSome states have taken other steps to protect consumers:\n\nEarlier this month, California set out new rules requiring some insurers to provide accurate lists of medical providers in their networks.\n\nNew Jersey specifies that insurers guarantee that certain providers be available \u201cwithin 20 miles or 30 minutes average driving time.\u201d\n\nColorado insurers must pay non-network medical providers their full charges, not discounted network rates, for care at in-network hospitals.\n\nIn Maryland, insurers must pay for \u201ccovered services,\u201d which includes emergency care, but the state sets standardized payment rates.\n\nStarting in April, New Yorkers won\u2019t face extra bills for out-of-network emergency care, when an in-network provider is unavailable or when they aren\u2019t told ahead of time that they may be treated by a non-participating provider. Instead, the bills must be settled in arbitration between the providers and the insurance companies.\n\nCost Trade-Offs\n\nInsurers defend the move to smaller networks of doctors and hospitals as a way to provide the low-cost plans that consumers say they want. Since insurers can no longer reject enrollees with health problems or charge them more, the plans are using the tools left to them to reduce costs.\n\n\n\n[MORE: Employees Paying More for Premiums, Deductibles]\n\nIf regulators required them to fully cover charges by out-of-network doctors, that could reduce \u201cincentives for providers to participate in networks\u201d and make it harder to have adequate networks, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the insurers\u2019 trade group, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association wrote in a joint letter to the NAIC.\n\nIt would also raise premiums.\n\nInstead, AHIP says, states could require out-of-network doctors to accept a benchmark payment from insurers, perhaps what Medicare pays, rather than balance billing patients.\n\nPhysicians, meanwhile, blame insurers for inadequate networks.\n\n\u201cIt is the limited coverage, not the physician bill, which is the cause of the unfairness,\u201d the Texas Medical Association wrote to the NAIC.\n\nAt the very least, doctors and hospitals say insurers need to do a better job of educating policyholders that their plans may not cover care provided by some doctors and hospitals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018free\u2019 anywhere,\u201d said Lee Spangler, vice president of medical economics with the Texas Medical Association. \u201cYou either pay for the coverage through premiums, or you pay for service when you receive it.\u201d\n\nDoctors choose whether to balance bill, he added \u2013 and some don\u2019t.\n\nBut he noted that patients \u201chave received professional services in the expectation that they will get alleviation of what ailed them, and the physicians provided it in the expectation they would be paid. There\u2019s no in between,\u201d Spangler said.\n\nFor patients like Durocher, who got billed even after doing everything she was told, the only recourse is to negotiate with the physician or hospital to ask them to lower or drop the charges.\n\n\u201cFortunately for me,\u201d Durocher said, \u201cthis doctor was very nice and wrote off almost $7,000 of the bill.\u201d\n\nHow To Protect Yourself From \u201cBalance\u201d Bills\n\n1) Do Your Homework. Check your insurer\u2019s website to verify that the hospital or doctor you want to use is listed, and then call the provider to be sure. Use in-network providers whenever possible. Be aware that some health-care providers may be in-network only at specific offices. Make sure you go to the right one.\n\n2) Be aware you could be billed by an out-of-network doctor even at an in-network hospital. Some plans will cover those costs fully, especially for emergency care, but many do not. When possible, request a network doctor, anesthesiologist or specialist in advance of elective surgery. But accept that it\u2019s not possible once you\u2019re in the hospital to screen every doctor who comes into your room for their network affiliation. If you are billed by a non-network provider, call your plan to find out if it will cover the bill because you were at an in-network hospital.\n\n3) If you get a balance bill, double-check to make sure the doctor or hospital is not part of your network. If they are not in your plan, check with your state insurance regulator to see if there are rules that might protect you, especially in an emergency situation. Ask the doctor or hospital to reconsider. If they won\u2019t, complain to your health plan and whoever regulates it, as well as to your state\u2019s consumer assistance program, if there is one.\n\n4) Negotiate. If there are no plan policies or state rules to prevent the billing, negotiate with the providers to lower their charges to an amount close to what an insurance plan would pay. Your insurer\u2019s website might have pricing information that can help. Websites, such as Fair Health or Health Care Bluebook can also help determine the prices of various procedures.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Staying active, losing weight, managing your blood sugar and not smoking can help prevent heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Out-of-network doctors and other loopholes can hike up the price of care.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Out-of-network doctors and other loopholes can hike up the price of care.<br>", "title": "Even Insured Consumers Get Hit With Unexpectedly Large Medical Bills", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/19/even-insured-consumers-get-hit-with-unexpectedly-large-medical-bills", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/07/1c/528b604d42239308b8aa66a8ebe4/150219-insurance-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Out-of-network doctors and other loopholes can hike up the price of care.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Even Insured Consumers Get Hit With Unexpectedly Large Medical Bills - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-02-19", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/de941e3/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F07%2F1c%2F528b604d42239308b8aa66a8ebe4%2Fresizes%2F500%2F150219-insurance-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "Pulse,Kaiser,health care,health insurance,Affordable Care Act,medical coverage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-02-19"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z6xubr", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "health insurance, Obamacare, network, medical bills, balance bill, Affordable Care Act, loophole"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb77f\"", "article_summary": "Websites, such as Fair Health or Health Care Bluebook can also help determine the prices of various procedures.\nSometimes, it\u2019s because a participating hospital relies on out-of-network doctors, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists.\nBecause the issue is complex and pits powerful rivals against one another\u2014 among them, hospitals, doctors and insurers\u2014 relatively few states have addressed it.\nNAIC\u2019S current draft does not directly address the issue of balance billing and consumer efforts have drawn sharp opposition from insurers, hospitals and doctors.\nWhat laws do exist are generally limited to specific situations, such as emergency room care, or certain types of insurance plans, such as HMOs."}
