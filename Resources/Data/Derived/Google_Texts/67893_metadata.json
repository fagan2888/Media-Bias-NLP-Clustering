You know, totalitarian communism, when taken for a good thing, can lead to some predictable troubles. (Ayn Rand wrote a novel about it, one that, as all right-thinking Americans know, is evil, idiotic and absurd and has nothing to tell you about life on earth.)\n\nBut Padgett drops in a rather jaw-dropping bit of \"plague on both their houses\" moral equivalence in the middle, blaming Venezuela's problems not on socialism, communism, or political management of the economy per se, but just on ideology, which is always bad, right? After all:\n\nThis didn't happen just because the Venezuelan revolution\u2019s policies are leftist. It\u2019s because \u2013 from reckless social spending to the senseless nationalization of businesses \u2013 they\u2019re blindly ideological. Like, say, the dogmatically right-wing economic agenda here \u2013 from reckless financial deregulation to the senseless concentration of wealth \u2013 which shot down the U.S. during the 2000s as blindly as Dick Cheney fired buckshot on quail hunts. Ideologues are always right, everyone else is always wrong \u2013 and the results are almost always catastrophic, from the Great Recession of 2008 to the Venezuelan Meltdown of 2015.\n\nIrony becomes our only defense here. Yes, people unable or unwilling to pay their mortgages leading to powerful and politically influential financial intermediaries losing big bucks, most of whom had their troubles made good by government action and most of whom made their bad decisions in the first place knowing that would be the case, leading to slowdowns in employment and GDP growth, are \"catastrophic\" on the same level as people standing in line all days for food that often isn't there, and medical care becoming more or less impossible.\n\nAnd catastrophic in the same way across \"ideological lines\"\u2014leftism and \"right wing\" thought (search hard for the \"right wing\" agenda in America's post-2008 troubles largely caused from personal problems, bad business decisions, and cronyism) equally bad, equally catastrophic. Don't get me wrong, reader, because I can see and report the travails of socialism that are right before anyone's eyes! Believe me, I know the \"right\" is also to blame, for something, somewhere.\n\nSome recent writings here on Venezuela's troubles from Ed Krayewski and J.D.
