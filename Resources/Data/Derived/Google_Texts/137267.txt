Bruce Jenner, who confirmed Friday night that he is transitioning into a woman, told Diane Sawyer that he is a Republican and a Christian.

When asked about President Obama’s comments on LGBT rights in his State of the Union address, the 65-year-old former Olympic athlete said that didn’t affect him much.

“I’ve always been more on the conservative side,” Mr. Jenner said, the Daily Caller reported Friday.

Ms. Sawyer, shocked by Mr. Jenner’s response, asked him if he identifies as a Republican, to which Mr. Jenner answered “yes.”

Ms. Jenner also revealed that he is a Christian and that he has struggled to reconcile his faith with his identity.

“I would sit in church and always wonder, ‘In God’s eyes, how does he see me?’” Mr. Jenner said in the interview, the Daily Caller reported.

But Mr. Jenner said he now believes that his transition to a woman is part of his purpose in life.
