Ryan said in a series of televised interviews on Sunday that he would not work with the Obama administration on changing immigration policy, effectively pushing off the issue to at least 2017.\n\n\u201cLook, I think it would be a ridiculous notion to try and work on an issue like this with a president we simply cannot trust on this issue,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cHe tried to go it alone, circumventing the legislative process with his executive orders, so that is not in the cards.\u201d\n\nThe message from Mr. Ryan, who was elected speaker on Thursday, signaled an antagonism toward the White House that both echoed his predecessor, John A. Boehner, and is likely to appeal to the party conservatives who forced Mr. Boehner\u2019s resignation.\n\nMr. Ryan taped five Sunday morning news shows, in which he laid out his agenda for unifying his party and his approach to relationships with congressional colleagues, Mr. Obama and Republican presidential candidates.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the statements about immigration, a White House spokesman referred to a news briefing Friday by Josh Earnest, the press secretary, who described the speaker\u2019s stance as \u201ca source of deep disappointment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ryan said that if the Republicans were to be a successful opposition party between now and the presidential election, they would need to become an aggressive \u201cproposition party,\u201d laying out a clear policy vision with alternatives to Democrats, like plans for overhauling the tax code and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe have been too timid for too long around here,\u201d Mr. Ryan said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe have been bold on tactics but not on policy, not on an agenda. We have to show people what our alternatives are, and that is the kind of leadership I think people are hungry for here.\u201d\n\nSuch proactive agenda-setting, Mr. Ryan added, will help avert the kind of brinkmanship over spending that was common under Mr. Boehner\u2019s leadership. It also requires that congressional leaders be \u201chonest with people up front about what it is you can and cannot achieve,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in response to a question on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d about defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nMr. Ryan repeatedly made it clear that he would take an approach different from that of Mr. Boehner, whose almost five-year tenure as speaker was rife with Republican Party infighting. In a nod to the conservatives who have demanded that power in the House be decentralized, Mr. Ryan said the speaker\u2019s job was to facilitate consensus, not to be \u201cdictator of the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think leadership should be trying to, you know, covet power and write legislation,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI think I want to have a more participatory process, which is really what the founders envisioned the House to look like. And that is something that so many of us, myself included, have been concerned about the way this place has been run.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan, the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, said he would remain neutral in the Republican presidential nomination race. The Republican presidential aspirants, he added, have offered a model for the kind of policy alternatives he hopes to see in the House.\n\n\u201cI looked at that stage and said every one of these people would be a far better president than Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said on ABC.\n\nMr. Ryan briefly addressed his personal qualms with taking the speaker\u2019s job, which he said he had never wanted. His thinking underwent \u201ca metamorphosis over a few weeks,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, as he realized the role he could play in \u201cwiping the slate clean\u201d in the House and the way it conducts business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs he made clear when he was being courted to accept the position, Mr. Ryan said that as speaker he would continue commuting every week between Washington and his home in Janesville, Wis., where his wife and three young children live. In Washington, he will continue to sleep in his old office in the House, rather than the speaker\u2019s suite, which members of his staff were trying to rid of the odor from Mr. Boehner\u2019s cigarettes.\n\nAsked by \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d how long he expected his honeymoon as speaker to last, Mr. Ryan offered a quick joke.\n\n\u201cAbout 35 minutes,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151101115552, "twitter": {"description": "In a series of interviews televised on Sunday, the new House speaker signaled an antagonism that is likely to appeal to the conservatives within the Republican Party.", "title": "Paul Ryan Says He Won\u2019t Work With Obama on Immigration Reform", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/us/politics/paul-ryan-says-he-wont-work-with-obama-on-immigration-reform.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004012185"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/30/us/30ryan/30ryan-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/us/politics/paul-ryan-says-he-wont-work-with-obama-on-immigration-reform.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004012185", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/us/politics/paul-ryan-says-he-wont-work-with-obama-on-immigration-reform.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Ryan Objects to Reforming Immigration With Obama", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 1, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Ryan  Paul D Jr,Immigration and Emigration,United States Politics and Government,House of Representatives,Republican Party,Obama  Barack", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Nicholas Fandos", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By NICHOLAS FANDOS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In a series of interviews televised on Sunday, the new House speaker signaled an antagonism that is likely to appeal to the conservatives within the Republican Party.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/30/us/30ryan/30ryan-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "In a series of interviews televised on Sunday, the new House speaker signaled an antagonism that is likely to appeal to the conservatives within the Republican Party.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-11-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2015-11-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "02ryan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151102234506, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/us/politics/paul-ryan-says-he-wont-work-with-obama-on-immigration-reform.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/30/us/30ryan/30ryan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In a series of interviews televised on Sunday, the new House speaker signaled an antagonism that is likely to appeal to the conservatives within the Republican Party.", "title": "Paul Ryan Says He Won\u2019t Work With Obama on Immigration Reform"}, "pdate": 20151101, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000004012185, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Paul Ryan Says He Won\u2019t Work With Obama on Immigration Reform", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/30/us/30ryan/30ryan-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Asked by \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d how long he expected his honeymoon as speaker to last, Mr. Ryan offered a quick joke.\nMr. Ryan briefly addressed his personal qualms with taking the speaker\u2019s job, which he said he had never wanted.\nMr. Ryan taped five Sunday morning news shows, in which he laid out his agenda for unifying his party and his approach to relationships with congressional colleagues, Mr. Obama and Republican presidential candidates.\nPhotoWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Paul D.
