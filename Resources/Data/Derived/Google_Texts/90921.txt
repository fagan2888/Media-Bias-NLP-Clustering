Almost 200 customers lost power Saturday morning after an SUV crashed into a power box, knocking it over.

Witnesses told police the driver sped off from the scene after hitting the box. Lt. Graves with the Colorado Springs Police Department says that while there is no suspect description, pieces of the SUV were left at the scene.

"[We] might be able to match the parts with the damage," Graves said.

The crash was reported just after 7 a.m. on the 5500 block of Prairie Schooner Drive, near Powers and Woodmen. All police know right now is that the driver was in a silver SUV.

Anyone with information that could lead to the driver is asked to call CSPD at 444-7000.

Power to affected customers was restored within a couple of hours.
