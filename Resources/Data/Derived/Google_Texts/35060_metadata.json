Mark Schauer is an attractive candidate in many respects, and we agree with him that some of the priorities of the Governor and his party were wrong and, at times, patently undemocratic. Like many Michiganders, it is hard for us to forget the rank power plays of our legislature\u2019s last lame duck session, later signed into law by Governor Snyder. No doubt that episode disappointed many and tarnished his appeal.\n\nYet, the progress in Michigan these past four years has been undeniable. And Governor Snyder has been no mere bystander; he has led. For example, the Governor\u2019s Healthy Michigan Initiative has been a game changer for so many Michiganders and for our hospitals and health providers. Against strong opposition from some in his party, Governor Snyder pushed to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. So far, more than 400,000 people in the state have enrolled.\n\nWe also give Governor Snyder credit for vetoing Republican-sponsored H.B. 5061, S.B. 803 and S.B. 7544 \u2014 legislation that would have added \u201cproof of citizenship,\u201d \u201cphoto I.D.\u201d and \u201cvoter registration training\u201d requirements to Michigan voting laws.\n\nWe believe this kind of legislation is a barely veiled effort to depress voting by minority citizens. Yet, Republican governors in many other states are signing those kinds of bills. Not Governor Snyder.\n\nFinally, there is Governor Snyder\u2019s relationship with the City of Detroit. He has been as accessible and responsive to the city as any recent governor in our memory. He has also continuously reminded the rest of the state about the importance of our great city.\n\nThe Detroit bankruptcy is perhaps Governor Snyder\u2019s most defining legacy as governor. He boldly led the process of taking the city into the historic bankruptcy \u2014 preventing the financial collapse of Michigan\u2019s largest city \u2014 and he is guiding the city quickly through the bankruptcy process. We do not know of a governor before him who would have had the fortitude to do so. In a way, once he appointed an emergency manager for the city, he, in effect, staked his entire political career on Detroit making it through its financial crisis. That appears now to have been a winning bet, as a significant portion of the city\u2019s almost $19 billion debt is on the cusp of being wiped away.\n\nAlso, the \u201cGrand Bargain,\u201d a major part of the Detroit bankruptcy deal, would not have been possible without the leadership of Governor Snyder. He pulled together leaders from across the state, and across various sectors and industries, to support a deal that works in a just manner for everyone affected \u2014 and gives the city its first real opportunity in a generation to prosper.\n\nWe admire that Governor Snyder does not shy away from the tough decisions. During his first term in office, he has shown that. On several important occasions, he has been willing, against political considerations, to \u201ctake the bull by the horns\u201d to make the right call. We believe that Michigan and Detroit would benefit from four more years of that kind of leadership.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michigan Chronicle", "description": "Despite our disagreements with some decisions Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has made over the past four years, we believe voters in next Tuesday\u2019s election should vote to continue his tenure as governor of our state.
