Between 1980 and 1995, the government spent only 9 percent of its disaster relief money on administrative costs, including expenses like employee salaries, travel expenses and rent at field offices \u2013 but between 2004 and 2011, that amount surged to 18 percent.\n\nThe increase in administrative costs has outpaced spending on temporary housing subsidies, medical expenses and counseling, noted Fierce Homeland Security, which tracks government developments.\n\nAt the same time, disaster spending has become more and more expensive. In the last two decades, natural disaster costs have soared from $100 billion to nearly double that amount, according to Munich-Re, the world\u2019s largest re-insurance agency.\n\nAuditors have previously suggested that FEMA address the spending issues and set goals to reduce the percentage of disaster relief spent on administrative costs. As of July, though, FEMA had not followed up on the GAO\u2019s recommendations.\n\nRelated: FEMA Standoff Ends As Disaster Victims Still Suffer\n\nThe auditors also raised issues over the government\u2019s increasing response to \u201csmaller\u201d disasters. Presidents have declared an average of 60 \u201cmajor disasters\u201d per year since 1996\u2014roughly more than one a week, says the GAO. However, many of these involved spending less than $10 million, suggesting they were likely relatively minor events.\n\nWhen the government declares a given situation a \u201cdisaster,\u201d it pays 75 to 100 percent of the response costs. Auditors cautioned that responding to smaller events could impede FEMA\u2019s response to major disasters.\n\n\u201cThe damage threshold upon which FEMA makes recommendations on disaster requests should be raised significantly to ensure the availability of federal assistance when truly needed, help stem rising disaster losses, and encourage state and local self-reliance for \u2018ordinary\u2019 disasters,\u201d Daniel Sutter, economics professor and senior affiliate scholar at George Mason University, wrote in congressional testimony.\n\nThe GAO also flagged FEMA\u2019s preparedness grant programs and said most of the programs \u201chave similar goals, fund similar types of projects, and are awarded in many of the same urban areas.\u201d Concerns about these programs prompted the Obama administration to propose the National Preparedness Grant Program in its budget requests for fiscals 2013, 2014 and 2015.\n\nThis would consolidate most of FEMA\u2019s grant proposals to prevent any overlap. Congress, however, has yet to take up any action to consolidate the grant programs.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "At a time when natural disasters are more expensive than ever, the agency", "title": "GAO Flags FEMA\u2019s Spending Practices", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/28/GAO-Flags-FEMA-s-Spending-Practices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/28/GAO-Flags-FEMA-s-Spending-Practices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "At a time when natural disasters are more expensive than ever, the agency", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce5b\"", "article_summary": "Related: FEMA Funding Moves Center Stage in CampaignNo wonder: Since the 1990s, FEMA\u2019s administrative costs have doubled.\nA new report from the Government Accountability Office, the congressional watchdog, expresses concern over the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s soaring administrative costs.\nAt the same time, disaster spending has become more and more expensive.\nThis would consolidate most of FEMA\u2019s grant proposals to prevent any overlap.\nThe increase in administrative costs has outpaced spending on temporary housing subsidies, medical expenses and counseling, noted Fierce Homeland Security, which tracks government developments."}
