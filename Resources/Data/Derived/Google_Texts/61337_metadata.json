Bigras will join Geertsen as a professional with the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League this week.\n\nBigras\u2019 season with the Owen Sound Attack of the Ontario Hockey League ended Sunday, and Avs coach Patrick Roy said Monday that Bigras will finish the season with Lake Erie.\n\nBigras, 20, is not a candidate to play in Colorado\u2019s final three NHL games this week, and he might not immediately play at Lake Erie because of a late-season injury. It is unclear if he\u2019ll burn the first year of his entry-level contract or finish the season on a amateur tryout (ATO) contract.\n\nThe Monsters, who are not in position to make the AHL playoffs, have seven remaining games beginning Tuesday at Chicago. The season finale is April 18.\n\nBigras, 20, had 71 points (20 goals) in 62 regular-season games for Owen Sound, plus three points (goal) in five playoff games. He was Colorado\u2019s second pick in 2013 (32nd overall), in a draft class that included forward Nathan MacKinnon (first), major-junior goalie Spencer Martin (63rd), Geertsen (93rd), University of Denver defenseman Will Butcher (123rd) and St. Cloud State defenseman Ben Storm (153rd).\n\nGeertsen recently signed with Colorado and reported to Lake Erie after finishing his junior season with the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League. Geertsen, 6-foot-4, who was named the Giants\u2019 MVP, is scoreless in three games with the Monsters.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about having these two guys,\u201d Roy said about Bigras and Geertsen. They\u2019re coming from the same draft. We\u2019re working on building the goaltending with Spencer Martin and the defensemen (at Lake Erie).\u201d\n\nThe Avs are equally excited about 2014-drafted 6-5 defenseman Kyle Wood of the OHL\u2019s North Bay Battalion\n\n\u201cWe have Wood doing well, Butcher here (at DU) and Storm,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe have a lot of Ds that are coming along. Now we have to look at the forwards.\u201d\n\nConner Bleackley of the WHL\u2019s Red Deer Rebels is Colorado\u2019s top drafted prospect up front. He was the team\u2019s first-round draft pick (23rd overall) in 2014.\n\nBleackley has 49 points (27 goals) in 51 games for Red Deer, but has missed 21 games to injury.\n\n\u201cUp-and-down season in Red Deer,\u201d Roy said of Bleackley, 19.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche draftee Chris Bigras to turn pro and join Mason Geertsen in minors", "title": "Avalanche draftee Chris Bigras to turn pro and join Mason Geertsen in minors", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/06/avalanche-draftee-chris-bigras-to-turn-pro-and-join-mason-geertsen-in-minors/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-06T13:52:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T13:52:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce61c\"", "article_summary": "Bigras will join Geertsen as a professional with the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League this week.\nBigras\u2019 season with the Owen Sound Attack of the Ontario Hockey League ended Sunday, and Avs coach Patrick Roy said Monday that Bigras will finish the season with Lake Erie.\nThe Avalanche is high on 2013-drafted defensemen Chris Bigras and Mason Geertsen.\nBleackley has 49 points (27 goals) in 51 games for Red Deer, but has missed 21 games to injury.\nGeertsen recently signed with Colorado and reported to Lake Erie after finishing his junior season with the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League."}
