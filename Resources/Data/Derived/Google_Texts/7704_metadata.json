A study by Eric M. Lamberg and Lisa M. Muratori at Stony Brook University found that distracted walkers veer off course by as much as 61 percent while texting and walking.\n\nWhen about to collide with a distracted walker, I used to politely say, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d to get the person\u2019s attention. But I\u2019ve become so annoyed by this behavior that I now harshly proclaim, \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d My friends of a certain age are frankly scared that they will be knocked down and injured by a distracted walker.\n\nDistracted walking is most common among millennials ages 18-34, but women 55 and older are most likely to suffer serious injuries, including broken bones, according to a 2013 study in Accident Analysis & Prevention. Visits to emergency rooms for injuries involving distracted pedestrians on cellphones more than doubled between 2004 and 2010 and continue to grow. Among more than 1,000 people hospitalized after texting while walking, injuries included a shattered pelvis and injuries to the back, head and neck.\n\nAccording to the National Safety Council, \u201cThe rise in cellphone-distracted walking injuries parallels the eightfold increase in cellphone use in the last 15 years.\u201d Although the council found that 52 percent of distracted walking episodes occurred at home, the nationwide uptick in pedestrian deaths resulting from texting while walking has prompted the federal government to offer grants of $2 million to cities to combat distracted walking.\n\nAccidents among digitally distracted walkers can be as serious as being hit by a vehicle, falling down a flight of stairs, tripping over a curb, walking into a glass door or falling into a fountain or swimming pool.\n\nA Brooklyn acquaintance tripped, fell and fractured her ankle, not while talking on her cellphone but when she looked down to put the phone away. And a walking and texting woman from South Bend, Indiana, fell off a pier into 6 feet of cold Lake Michigan water. Although embarrassed by the accident, the woman, who was rescued by a 19-year-old, said she hoped \u201cit would make people understand that texting while walking can be a problem.\u201d\n\nAlas, most people seem to think the problem involves other people. They\u2019re not the ones who walk distracted. A new survey of some 6,000 people 0, NOT 6,000 ... released last week by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons found that while 74 percent said that \u201cother people\u201d were usually or always walking while distracted, only 29 percent said the same about themselves. And only 46 percent considered the behavior \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nSeventy percent of millennials surveyed said they thought distracted walking was a serious issue, compared with 81 percent of those 35 and older. Half the millennials said they considered distracted walking \u201cembarrassing \u2014 in a funny way,\u201d which suggests they don\u2019t really think it\u2019s all that serious.\n\nThe survey, conducted for the academy by Ipsos Public Affairs in October, found that among residents in eight major cities, New Yorkers were most likely to consider distracted walking a serious issue (86 percent), but they were also more likely to walk while distracted than those in the seven other cities.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of folks who were injured when they tripped on a curb, walked into a pothole or were hit by a car they didn\u2019t see, though they rarely admit they were distracted by their phones,\u201d said Dr. Claudette M. Lajam, an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langone Medical Center and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. \u201cYet you know many were because when they\u2019re in my office and should be interacting with me, all they\u2019re doing is looking at their phones or answering a call.\u201d\n\nHer advice: \u201cLook where you\u2019re walking. Look in front of you, not down at your phone.\u201d Peripheral vision can drop to 10 percent of normal when a person is texting or talking on a phone while walking.\n\nDespite the widespread belief, especially among younger people, that multitasking is both possible and safe, Lajam echoed the warning issued by a number of experts that \u201cyou can\u2019t really pay attention to more than one thing at a time.\u201d That, the experts say, is how the human brain evolved, and to think otherwise is a recipe for disaster.\n\nTeenagers, however, rarely see it as a problem. Multitasking is central to their world. They talk, text and listen to music all at the same time. Even if not using a smartphone, my 15-year-old grandsons think they can stay tuned to music on noise-blocking headphones, watch for traffic and cross the street at the same time. What, I wonder, might happen if they intersect with a distracted driver?\n\nThe orthopedic surgeons academy, which has joined other safety conscious organizations with a public service announcement called \u201cDigital Deadwalkers,\u201d noted that the busy holiday season is prime time for distracted walking incidents. To help pedestrians stay injury-free, it suggests:\n\n\u2022 When using headphones, keep the volume low enough to be able to hear surrounding traffic.\n\n\u2022 Stay focused on the people, objects and obstacles in front of and around you. Window shoppers are especially prone to pedestrian collisions.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t jaywalk. Use crosswalks, and obey traffic signals. Be especially aware of bicycles coming your way.\n\n\u2022 Look ahead of you, not down, when stepping on or off a curb or approaching stairs or escalators.\n\n\u2022 Stay alert to vehicles pulling in or out of parking lots, especially in winter months when it gets dark early (to which I would add, wear reflective or at least light-colored outer clothing so drivers and cyclists can see you better).\n\n\u2022 If you find it necessary to make or take a call or send a text while walking, stop, step out of the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and resume walking only when the task is completed.\n\nMy addendum to subway riders: Don\u2019t stop at the top, bottom or in the middle of a stairway to take or make a text or call lest a fellow passenger trip over you.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/08/1003240057-FL_SAR_HFWELL04.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "While distracted driving has commanded lots of attention (albeit not a commensurate amount of correction), another digital hazard \u2014 distracted walking \u2014 is on the rise, with sometimes disastrous consequences.\nAmong more than 1,000 people hospitalized after texting while walking, injuries included a shattered pelvis and injuries to the back, head and neck.\nAccording to the National Safety Council, \u201cThe rise in cellphone-distracted walking injuries parallels the eightfold increase in cellphone use in the last 15 years.\u201d Although the council found that 52 percent of distracted walking episodes occurred at home, the nationwide uptick in pedestrian deaths resulting from texting while walking has prompted the federal government to offer grants of $2 million to cities to combat distracted walking.\nHalf the millennials said they considered distracted walking \u201cembarrassing \u2014 in a funny way,\u201d which suggests they don\u2019t really think it\u2019s all that serious.\nDistracted walking is most common among millennials ages 18-34, but women 55 and older are most likely to suffer serious injuries, including broken bones, according to a 2013 study in Accident Analysis & Prevention."}
