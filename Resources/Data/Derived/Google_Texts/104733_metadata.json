The network is airing the pro-nuclear documentary Pandora\u2019s Promise on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe scientists\u2019 letter is a window onto a battle within the climate movement. It's about whether expanded nuclear power is needed to enable the steep global emissions cuts that many scientists say must occur to avoid the most dangerous climatic changes.\n\n\n\nMany environmentalists and prominent groups, such as the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, oppose nuclear power due to accident risks, radioactive waste that plants create, and other factors.\n\n\n\nClimate activists that oppose nuclear power say scaled-up use of green energy sources like wind and solar power, expanded efficiency, and other tools can bring steep carbon emissions cuts without constructing new nuclear plants.\n\n\n\nThe four scientists say safety advances can make new nuclear plants much safer than the current generation.\n\n\n\n\u201cQuantitative analyses show that the risks associated with the expanded use of nuclear energy are orders of magnitude smaller than the risks associated with fossil fuels. No energy system is without downsides. We ask only that energy system decisions be based on facts, and not on emotions and biases that do not apply to 21st-century nuclear technology,\u201d the letter states.\n\n\n\nNuclear energy provides roughly 20 percent of U.S. electricity.\n\n\n\nSouthern Co. and SCANA Corp. are building new reactors in Georgia and South Carolina, respectively. But low natural gas prices, Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi catastrophe and other factors have clouded prospects for a major nuclear build-out.\n\nThis post was updated at 9:30 a.m. on Nov. 4", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The scientists say continued opposition \"threatens humanity's ability\" to avoid climate change.\u201d", "description": "The scientists say continued opposition \"threatens humanity's ability\" to avoid climate change.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ben Geman", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The scientists say continued opposition \"threatens humanity's ability\" to avoid climate change.\u201d", "title": "Climate scientists: Embrace nuclear power", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/189068-climate-scientists-to-green-activists-embrace-nuke-power", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-04T09:28:31-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2013-11-04T09:28-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/189068-climate-scientists-to-green-activists-embrace-nuke-power", "dcterms.date": "2013-11-03T10:43-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ben Geman", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Climate change, nuclear,James Hansen,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-03T10:43:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-04T09:28:31-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/189068-climate-scientists-to-green-activists-embrace-nuke-power", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The scientists say continued opposition \"threatens humanity's ability\" to avoid climate change.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Climate scientists: Embrace nuclear power"}, "dcterms.title": "Climate scientists: Embrace nuclear power"}, "article_summary": "Four prominent climate scientists are urging environmentalists to embrace nuclear power to help fight global warming, arguing that \u201ccontinued opposition .\nClimate activists that oppose nuclear power say scaled-up use of green energy sources like wind and solar power, expanded efficiency, and other tools can bring steep carbon emissions cuts without constructing new nuclear plants.\nIt's about whether expanded nuclear power is needed to enable the steep global emissions cuts that many scientists say must occur to avoid the most dangerous climatic changes.\nThe four scientists say safety advances can make new nuclear plants much safer than the current generation.\nThe scientists\u2019 letter is a window onto a battle within the climate movement."}
