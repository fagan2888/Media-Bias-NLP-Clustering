A Russian crew is already being trained on the ship, currently berthed in the French port of Saint-Nazaire.

Stopping delivery of the carrier isn\u2019t a private-property issue, either, given that the French government owns 75 percent of DCNS, the French shipbuilder.\n\nFrench officials have been reluctant to discuss the carrier contract, telling me that they have no comment. When asked last Friday at a news conference about the carrier contract, President Hollande replied, \u201cAs far as other sanctions, notably military cooperation, that is the third level of sanctions.\u201d But as recently as a March 7 news conference (more than a week after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea), Hollande appeared unwilling to touch the issue. The Voice of Russia reported:\n\nFrance continues to comply with the terms of the contract and will supply Moscow with two Mistral-class helicopter carriers, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced: \u201cWe keep to the terms of the signed contracts. Right now we have no plans to cancel them and we hope to avoid this.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is certainly aware of the carrier issue. On Saturday, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian of France and U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had lengthy \u201creviews of bilateral military cooperation with Russia,\u201d according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. The Pentagon has announced a suspension of all of its military cooperation with Russia and is reviewing its own purchases of Russian rocket engines.\n\nBut France has made no decision on the carriers, infuriating at least one former French military official I spoke with here. \u201cCanceling the contracts is in part being treated as an issue of 1,000 jobs for the vulnerable shipbuilding industry,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this is about the very credibility of our foreign policy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, at the United Nations, France has been a staunch opponent of Russia\u2019s aggression, helping to lead the Security Council last Saturday to a 13-to-one vote against Russia (China abstained). \u201cIt is extremely dangerous if we accept that a country simply takes over a territory by force,\u201d G\u00e9rard Araud, France\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., told reporters. \u201cWe are going back to 1914, and we are in 2014. It is the message we were trying to send to the Russians. You cannot simply use force to solve your problems.\u201d\n\nTrue enough, which is why it\u2019s important for the West to act decisively if it hopes to deter future aggression. John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., notes that China has laid down territorial claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea and has sometimes sent military forces to occupy them. \u201cYou can bet they\u2019re watching the West\u2019s response to Crimea,\u201d he told me.\n\nOther countries \u2014 such as Iran \u2014 are undoubtedly also watching. In 1975, France signed a nuclear-cooperation deal with Saddam Hussein and sold Iraq an Osiris-class nuclear reactor and 75 kilograms of enriched uranium. France insisted that the reactor was designed in such a way that it could never be used for military purposes, but Hussein publicly declared at the time that his efforts to buy a reactor were \u201cthe first Arab attempt at nuclear arming.\u201d The American private intelligence agency Stratfor later concluded that by 1981, Iraq\u2019s Osirak uranium-fueled reactor \u201cwas believed to be on the verge of producing plutonium for a weapons program.\u201d That concern prompted Israel to launch Operation Opera, a preemptive air strike that destroyed the reactor. In a 2005 interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, former president Bill Clinton praised the Israelis for the strike: \u201cEverybody talks about what the Israelis did at Osirak, in 1981, which, I think, in retrospect, was a really good thing. You know, it kept Saddam from developing nuclear power.\u201d\n\nKeeping helicopter carriers out of Vladimir Putin\u2019s hands would also be \u201ca really good thing.\u201d What respect could the Russians possibly have for the West if France actually delivers sophisticated helicopter carriers that can ferry the Spetsnaz, the Russian military\u2019s elite commando forces, to the next target of Russia\u2019s choosing?\n\n\u2014 John Fund is a national-affairs columnist for National Review Online.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "The Appeasement of Paris", "sailthru.author": "John Fund", "description": "Paris \u2014 As Russia absorbs Crimea and masses 60,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s border, is the West serious about sanctions against Moscow?\n\nThe best test could come this Tuesday, when the defense and foreign ministers of Russia and France are scheduled to meet for long-planned talks on relations between the two countries.
