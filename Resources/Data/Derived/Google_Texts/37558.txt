HBO GO went down during Sunday night's season four premiere of "Game of Thrones," one of the network's most highly anticipated broadcasts since last month's finale of "True Detective" when... well... the service also choked.

Instead of getting the show, many viewers got the image you see above. HBO GO acknowledged the problems on Twitter:

Looks like there's trouble in the realm. Apologies for the inconvenience. We'll be providing updates, so please stay tuned. #GameofThrones — HBO GO (@HBOGO) April 7, 2014

In another tweet, HBO instructed viewers having problems to "send a raven."

It really overburdened the system when Obamacare began allowing children to stay on their parents' HBO GO until age 26. — James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) April 7, 2014

Even HBO suggested that its subscribers -- actual subscribers -- still had an option for watching the show:

We're sorry for all of the trouble, but if you're an @HBO subscriber, the @GameOfThrones premiere replays at 11 PM EST. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) April 7, 2014

Everyone else... there are always other ways to stay occupied.

I'm not keeping score or anything, but books: 1, HBO GO: 0. — Harper Perennial (@HarperPerennial) April 7, 2014
