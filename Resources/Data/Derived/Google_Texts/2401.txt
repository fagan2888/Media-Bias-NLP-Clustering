Sterling Partners Invests in Surgical Solutions

In January the PE firm invested in health care data group Q-Centrix

Sterling Partners has invested in Surgical Solutions, which makes medical equipment.

Surgical Solutions, headquartered in Henderson, Kentucky, provides medical equipment and services to surgeons. The company has technicians that set up before operations, provides intraoperative technical support, and post-operative room turnover, in addition to equipment.

Chicago-based Sterling has about $5 billion in capital under management. The firm has invested in several other health care businesses, including Q-Centrix, which provides outsourced health care data-collection services. Sterling made that investment in January.

The firm also invests in business services and education companies. In January, the firm closed a $109 million deal for e-commerce services provider Innotrac, which provides fulfillment and logistics services to retailers, including J. Crew and Zara.
