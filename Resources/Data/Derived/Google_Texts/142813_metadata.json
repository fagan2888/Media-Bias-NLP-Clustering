When measured properly \u2014 over an infinite time horizon \u2014 the difference between all projected future government spending and all projected future government revenue and resources over time is $210 trillion, far greater than the $13 trillion usually cited.\u201d A disparity that large coupled with Congress' penchant for expanding rather than reforming \u2014 much less cutting \u2014 existing programs means massive tax increases would be necessary to close the gap. \u201cThe true fiscal gap is 12 times the size of the US economy, and about 10.5 percent of the present value of all future US GDP,\u201d add Kotlikoff and Michel. \u201cTo eliminate the shortfall solely through tax increases, the government would have to immediately and permanently raise all federal taxes \u2014 personal and corporate income taxes, excise taxes, and Social Security taxes \u2014 by 58 percent.\u201d Last fall the Congressional Budget Office reported that the budget deficit for FY 2014 was a relatively small $486 billion, but it also expects that number to climb back north of $1 trillion \u2014 courtesy of ObamaCare and retiring baby boomers.
