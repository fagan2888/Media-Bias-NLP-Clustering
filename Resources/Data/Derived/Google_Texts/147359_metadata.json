That no longer having a preexisting medical condition will bar you from getting affordable care.\"\n\nPelosi made similar comments to reporters on Thursday, saying the website \u201chas to be improved.\"\n\n\u201cI hope that we would have some answers soon and that the answer would be: OK, we\u2019ve found the glitch or whatever it is, it\u2019s been corrected and here\u2019s a demonstration of how people, when they approach it now, will be received,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nThe White House has been working to fix the glitches since Oct. 1, the first day people were allowed to enroll in the new coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPelosi's not the only one to express frustration over the website's issues. President Barack Obama, who is expected to address the problems Monday during an event at the White House, told his team they had to own up to the fact that there were no excuses for not having the health care website ready on Oct. 1.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
