REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nEating blueberries every day might improve borderline high blood pressure in middle-aged women, according to a small U.S. study.\n\nWomen who ate freeze-dried blueberries for two months had lowered blood pressure and increased levels of a chemical that relaxes blood vessel walls.\n\n\u201cThis tells us that blueberries may improve the health of blood vessels in addition to reducing blood pressure,\u201d said Sarah Johnson, a nutrition and exercise researcher at Florida State University in Tallahassee who led the study.\n\nJohnson and her coauthors do not suggest that blueberries should replace hypertension medications. But they say the berries might help offset a tendency toward rising blood pressure and stiffening blood vessels after menopause that raises women\u2019s heart disease risk.\n\nPast research has suggested that blueberries may help lower blood pressure, the authors write in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Some studies have also indicated that the flavonoids and other healthy plant compounds in blueberries may help to boost nitric oxide, a chemical that affects the cells that line blood vessel walls.\n\nThe 48 women in the study were all past menopause, with an average age of 55 and borderline high blood pressure.\n\nFor eight weeks, half the women consumed 22 grams (about 1.5 tablespoons) of freeze-dried blueberry powder every day (equivalent to a cup of fresh blueberries) and the other half consumed an identical-looking powder that didn\u2019t contain blueberry.\n\nAt the beginning of the study, then four and eight weeks later, researchers measured their blood pressure and the stiffness of their arteries.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, a blood pressure reading of less than 120 mm Hg for the top number and less than 80 mm Hg for the bottom number is considered healthy. All the women in the study were either close enough to the top of the healthy range to be considered \u201cpre-hypertensive\u201d or already in the low end of the hypertension range.\n\nAt the start, the average blood pressure in both groups of women was 138/79 mm Hg. After four weeks, it hadn't changed in either group.\n\nAfter eight weeks, however, women who had been eating blueberry powder had an average blood pressure of 131/75 mm Hg, representing a drop of 5 to 6 percent. The readings of women eating the fake powder had not changed.\n\nThe researchers also found that blood nitric oxide levels rose by 68 percent among women eating the real blueberry powder. The rise in nitric oxide, which would relax and widen blood vessel walls, could have contributed to their lower blood pressure, according to Johnson.\n\nShe said the blood pressure decrease in the blueberry group is significant when compared to blood pressure medications and other types of interventions, but that it also depends on the individual.\n\n\"People respond differently to medications and in some people medications are even less effective than this,\" she said. \"Some medications may work better but may also have negative side effects.\"\n\nFreeze-dried blueberry powder is available in stores and online for around $2 to $5 per ounce.\n\nFor women in the 50 to 55 age range who have borderline high blood pressure, medication isn\u2019t always recommended, according to Dr. Chileshe Nkonde-Price, director of the Penn Women\u2019s Cardiovascular Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\u201cMenopausal women who are often in that \u2018gray zone\u2019 can manage their blood pressure by maintaining a normal body weight through diet and exercise and watching their sodium intake,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that can be hard to implement in everyday life.\u201d\n\nNkonde-Price thinks adding a cup of blueberries to a daily diet is \"simple\" and something her patients can easily handle.\n\nMore research into understanding how blueberries affect arterial function is needed, however, Nkonde-Price said.\n\n\u201cThis study opens the gateway for other foods or other drugs that could lower blood pressure through the same mechanism,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more studies that show why foods or drugs work through this pathway.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1C5buor Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, online January 8, 2015.\n\n(By Linda Thrasybule)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "blueberries, may, help, control, blood, pressure", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Middle-aged women could improve borderline high blood pressure by eating blueberries every day, according to a new study.", "title": "Blueberries May Help Control Blood Pressure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blueberries-may-help-control-blood-pressure-321276", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/blueberries.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Middle-aged women could improve borderline high blood pressure by eating blueberries every day, according to a new study.", "title": "Blueberries May Help Control Blood Pressure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blueberries-may-help-control-blood-pressure-321276", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/blueberries.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/blueberries.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-02-07T10:56:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-07T10:57:21-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Middle-aged women could improve borderline high blood pressure by eating blueberries every day, according to a new study."}, "article_summary": "But they say the berries might help offset a tendency toward rising blood pressure and stiffening blood vessels after menopause that raises women\u2019s heart disease risk.\nShe said the blood pressure decrease in the blueberry group is significant when compared to blood pressure medications and other types of interventions, but that it also depends on the individual.\nWomen who ate freeze-dried blueberries for two months had lowered blood pressure and increased levels of a chemical that relaxes blood vessel walls.\nPast research has suggested that blueberries may help lower blood pressure, the authors write in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\nThe rise in nitric oxide, which would relax and widen blood vessel walls, could have contributed to their lower blood pressure, according to Johnson."}
