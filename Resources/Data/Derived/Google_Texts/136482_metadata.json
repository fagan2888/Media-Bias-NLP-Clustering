A question which clearly was in response to recent ads by the Hillary campaign that depicts the candidate making comments that \u201cwomen should be believed\u201d, with regards to allegations of sexual assault.\n\nCandidate Hillary quickly responded, \u201cWell, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence\u201d. Her response was followed by her smiling broadly, obviously pleased with herself for her deft handling of a potentially difficult and embarrassing question. A question obviously long ago anticipated by her campaign staff, and one which she clearly had practiced and rehearsed her response to, and was well prepared to answer the way that she did.\n\nUnfortunately the lady who posed this question to candidate Clinton was unable to follow up on her query. Had she been able to do so she could have asked Hillary directly, \u201cjust what evidence are you referring to, Madam Secretary?\u201d\n\nInterestingly Hillary\u2019s supposed sharp legal mind failed to recognize that in many sexual assault cases successfully prosecuted in courtrooms all across America every year there often is very little evidence beyond the allegations of the female victim.\n\nDNA and other evidence is not always present to back up the woman\u2019s allegations, sometimes it simply comes down to who is more believable. A man who has a history of claims of sexual misconduct made against him, or the scared, and scarred victim of a sexual assault who is simply seeking justice ?\n\nAnd often times the woman\u2019s allegations alone can result in a conviction. After all, in Hillary\u2019s own campaign advertisement isn\u2019t that what she is telling us all, that those who make these allegations \u201cshould be believed\u201d?\n\nWhat was also troubling for me was to see Hillary smiling so broadly after her response, as well as the audience of supporters who applauded the candidate, obviously an adoring crowd - Minus one anyway.\n\nThe image of Hillary smiling in self-congratulations at her handling of this situation reminded me of her pounding the table in front of her during her first Benghazi testimony, loudly proclaiming \u201cWhat difference does it make\u201d! Another stellar performance by someone well-rehearsed and well-prepared to respond to difficult questions about contemptible behavior.\n\nThe New Hampshire woman\u2019s question was one about a very serious subject, one supposedly of great importance to Hillary. One would think it was important anyway since she has long tried to portray herself as the \u201cchampion of women\u201d.\n\nTheir champion as long as they weren\u2019t making allegations against her husband or presented a potential political embarrassment for Hillary. But one certainly would expect a more serious demeanor and response from Hillary, not the behavior of someone who was looking for \u2018high fives\u2019 from those around her.\n\nI can hear her loyal campaign aides following the New Hampshire event telling the former first lady how she \u201cknocked it out of the park\u201d again, just like the \u2018e-mail high fives\u2019 she was given by aides following her first Benghazi testimony, and that have been revealed in her State Department e-mails that continue to be released to the public in dribs and drabs.\n\nBut clearly throughout her career Hillary has had to deal with questions about her husband\u2019s serial sexual predations. She\u2019s become accustomed to having allegations of sexual misconduct arise, and just as accustomed to orchestrating the attacks against the accusers as a defense to help her contain any political damage.\n\nHillary\u2019s goal for the last thirty-plus years has been to protect her own political ambitions, not to support her husband Bill\u2019s. Bill Clinton and his political career has always been nothing more than a means to an end for Hillary. Which is also why she\u2019s tolerated his sexual perversions and infidelities.\n\nShe really could care less what Bill does with his zipper as long as it doesn\u2019t create problems for her. When in the past Bill\u2019s indiscretions have created a potential threat to her own political aspirations she has quickly \u2018pivoted\u2019 into damage control mode. Not to protect Bill politically because she cared about him or his political future, but to protect Bill because she knew he was the key to her achieving her own political goals.\n\nWatching Hillary answer the woman\u2019s question about the sexual assault allegations against her husband Bill Clinton angered me, and brought to mind for me the appropriate response from the pivotal scene of the movie \u2018Network\u2019, when actor Peter Finch as newsman Howard Beale says, \u201cWe\u2019re mad as hell and we\u2019re not going to take this anymore !\u201d\n\nWell Hillary, the American people indeed are mad as hell. We\u2019ve had enough lies Hillary, and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore. We\u2019ve had enough cover up Hillary, we\u2019re mad as hell and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore. We\u2019ve reached Clinton overload, and we simply just don\u2019t want you anymore! We\u2019ve had enough of Hillary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently, on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton, was asked by a member of the audience about her position on whether or not women who made accusations of sexual assault against her husband Bill should be believed..05/26/2016 18:19:11PM EST.", "author": "D.W.
