U.S. employers added 223,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent, a seven-year low. But the rate has dropped because more and more Americans have given up on trying to find a job.

The percentage of Americans working or looking for work fell to a 38-year low, suggesting rising discouragement about the economy.

Employers also added 60,000 fewer jobs in April and May combined than the government had previously estimated.

Meanwhile wages are stagnant and economists now say the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates in September in order to give the economy more time to recover.
