Sioux Falls, SD

The 4th of July Celebration hit South Dakota's largest city Saturday.

The parade rolled through downtown Sioux Falls. The festivities also included a fun run in Falls Park as well as a performance by the Sioux Falls Municipal Band.

Sherry Cook came in from Council Bluffs to enjoy the 4th with her family, and she was impressed with the celebration.

"I think the weather plays a big role in people's overall disposition and it just makes it more fun to be able to enjoy it and be able to be outside. Have a lot more fun," Cook said.
