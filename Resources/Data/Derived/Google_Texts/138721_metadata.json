Voting blocs like Mexican-Americans in border states and Cuban-Americans in South Florida are becoming less monolithic and more difficult to predict.\n\nOne of the commonly-held notions of 2014 is that Latino voter turnout for midterm elections is, in historical terms, less than that of other groups \u2013 a situation that analysts are suggesting will be compounded this November by a limited number of closely-contested races in the more demographically Latino-heavy areas of the country.\n\nAnd while polls confirm that many Hispanic Americans care deeply about traditional hot-button issues like immigration reform, for many Latinos bread-and-butter economic issues may be more of a deciding factor in how they vote.\n\nIt is clear that this election cycle, Latino voters say they have a feeling of abandonment by both political parties, caused by the stalling out of immigration reform in Congress and the political football party leaders have played with the border crisis and deportations.\n\nSome observers, however, say that there are at least a handful of gubernatorial and congressional races where Hispanics can \u2013 and likely will \u2013 play a key role in deciding who is elected. Some of which might even have an impact on the presidential election come 2016.\n\nCandidates in tightly contested races in states such as Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Texas are vying for the Latino vote, of course, but so are candidates in less traditionally Hispanic states such as North Carolina and Kansas.\n\n\u201cAt the state level, Latino voters will prove decisive in Colorado for U.S. Senate and in Florida and Illinois for gubernatorial elections,\u201d Matt Barreto, a pollster for Latino Decisions told Fox News Latino via email. \u201cBeyond these three states there are another four states we are tracking as possible Latino-influence states that few people are talking about. These states are North Carolina, Kansas, Georgia and Michigan. All of these states will have very close Senate elections in 2014 and they all have very fast growing Latino populations. \u201c\n\nRocky Mountain Battle\n\nColorado is widely deemed to be the state where the Latino vote will have the biggest impact, especially in the governor\u2019s race. A recent poll conducted by the Denver Post puts incumbent Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in a virtual tie with Republican challenger Bob Beauprez at 45 percent and 43 percent respectively.\n\nRobert Preuhs, a professor of political science at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, said that Latinos in the Centennial State lean Democrat and that thanks to a number of canny moves\u2013 granting driver\u2019s license and identification cards as well as in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants \u2013 the governor has gained a distinct advantage over Beauprez.\n\n\u201cThere has been movement on a couple of policy issues that favor Latinos from the governor,\u201d Preuh told FNL. \u201cBeauprez can\u2019t really benefit from anything because the GOP is not even focusing on immigration.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado U.S. Senate race is also in the limelight. Republican U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner is trying to unseat incumbent Democrat Mark Udall.\n\nFor the most part, Udall has polled better with Latinos, possibly thanks to Gardner\u2019s strict stance on border security and immigration and his conservative views on the Affordable Care Act, another issue of particular interest to Latinos.\n\nWhile currently, \u201cthere is not any movement of Latinos away from the Democrats,\u201d according to Preuhs, the Republican's principal hope to win over enough of the Latino vote came from Pres. Obama.\n\nBy delaying executive action on immigration until after the elections, it could swing Latino voters to the Republican side. Or convince enough of them to stay home on election day.\n\n\u201cThe president's postponed executive action may have helped Democrats fighting to hold onto their seats in tough Senate races,\u201d the Denver Post reported. \u201cBut there are questions as to what it will do for Colorado Democrats Mark Udall and [the other U.S. Senator from Colorado] Michael Bennet, who have both come out in support of immigration reform. Colorado is a state with a large Latino community \u2014 an estimated 21 percent of the population \u2014 and strong immigration-rights movement.\u201d\n\nSB 1070, Immigration And Arizona's House Races\n\nTo the immediate southwest of Colorado sits another state where Hispanics could play a key role in deciding what lawmakers will be on Capitol Hill next term. Arizona has two key congressional races where immigration, border security and other issues of concern to Latinos are front and center.\n\nTwo Democratic incumbents \u2013 Ann Kirkpatrick and Ron Barber \u2013 are facing off against Arizona\u2019s Republican House Speaker Andy Tobin and former retired Air Force Colonel Martha McSally in the state\u2019s first and second U.S. Congressional districts.\n\nBoth Tobin and McSally support the state\u2019s SB 1070 law that requires police officers to ask people detained for documents proving legal residency \u2013 a law that is controversial with the state's Hispanic voters. Tobin came under fire by Latino groups when he suggested months ago that migrant children from Central America might be carrying the Ebola virus.\n\nStill, neither congressional district is overwhelmingly Latino in its electorate so wins for the incumbents aren't anywhere near guaranteed.\n\nNeither Democrat has avid support from Latinos. Kirkpatrick received an 82 percent rating on the \u201c2014 National Immigration Score Card,\u201d which is compiled by a number of prominent Latino advocacy groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the League of United Latin American Citizens. Barber\u2019s rating is 73 percent \u2014 the lowest of the five Democrats in the Arizona House delegation.\n\n\u201cKirkpatrick and Barber\u2019s political survival may depend upon drawing sharp contrasts with their Republican challengers on immigration and mobilizing marginal Latino voters,\u201d David Damore, a political scientist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and a senior analyst at Latino Decisions wrote in the Washington Post.\n\nSunshine State Showdowns\n\nIn another battleground state, Florida Republicans are trying to maintain their traditional hold on Cuban-American voters even as this voting bloc appears to be drifting more and more toward the blue.\n\nFor decades, the GOP relied on the state\u2019s conservative, anti-Castro Cuban-American population. But statistics from the Pew Research Center shows that the percentage of Cuban-American registered voters that identify as being or lean toward voting Republican has dropped from 64 percent in 2002 and 57 percent in 2006 to just 47 percent in 2013, while the Democratic numbers have doubled in that timeframe, from 22 percent in 2002 to 44 percent in 2013.\n\nThat shift has been reflected in presidential elections. In 2004, 78 percent of Cubans in Florida voted for George W. Bush, but in 2012, Barack Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state\u2019s Cuban vote in a generation.\n\nThis year's gubernatorial race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Charlie Crist has seen both sides courting the Cuban-American vote in South Florida.\n\nIn February, Scott made Cuban-American politician Carlos Lopez-Cantera the first Hispanic lieutenant governor in Sunshine State history, solidifying his support with voters in Miami-Dade County.\n\nTrying to horn in on that action, Crist announced in July that Miami-Dade Democratic Party chief and state party vice-chairwoman Annette Taddeo-Goldstein \u2013 a Colombian-American \u2013 would be his pick for lieutenant governor.\n\nThis, however, seems to have had a little effect on Crist's chances winning over Latino voters. In April, a Survey USA poll showed Scott led Crist among Cuban-Americans by 52-46 percent. In late August, a new poll found that Cuban-Americans now favored Scott over Crist by 63 to 30 percent.\n\n\u201cMy suspicion is that there is not much enthusiasm for Crist among Democrats,\u201d Nelson Diaz, chairman of the Miami-Dade Republican Executive Committee told Fox News Latino earlier this month.\n\nOne of the most heated races in the state is between Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia and Carlos Curbelo, a Republican Miami-Dade County School Board member.\n\nFor his part, Garcia has been attacking Curbelo\u2019s background as a political lobbyist while playing up his family's Cuban background.\n\n\u201cWhen the Castro regime took over, Joe Garcia\u2019s grandmother had the courage to leave Cuba to protect her family,\u201d a recent television spot in Florida stated.\n\n\u201cShe taught Joe Garcia to do what\u2019s right, no matter what. So, when the president threatened to cut Medicare, Joe Garcia worked with both parties to protect those benefits \u2026 because it was the right thing to do for South Florida,\" the ad continued. \"But Carlos Curbelo is just out for himself. Carlos Curbelo takes money from tea party backers and wants to end the Medicare guarantee, hurting seniors. Now we learn that Carlos Curbelo has a lobbying firm \u2026 and he\u2019s hiding the firm\u2019s client list from us.\u201d\n\nCurbelo for his part, has taken Garcia to task over allegations that his former chief of staff, Jeffrey Garcia (no relation) was involved in electoral fraud from the 2012 election when Joe Garcia defeated the incumbent Republican, David Rivera.\n\n\u201cThis is all part of the political circus created by Joe Garcia and others which has already landed three people in jail,\u201d Curbelo said, according to the Sunshine State News. \u201cPoliticians like Joe Garcia seem to be willing to do anything to get elected. His recklessness has brought shame and embarrassment upon the residents of Congressional District 26 in South Florida.\u201d\n\nThe effort seems to be paying off for the Republican. The Miami Herald earlier this week cited a report paid for by the Curbelo campaign showing that he holds a four-point lead in the race, and also holds a 51-38 percent among voters who have \"seen, read or heard something\" about Garcia\u2019s ethics problems.\n\nIncludes reporting by Francisco Alvarado.\n\nFollow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "POLITICS/Elections, POLITICS/Immigration, POLITICS/White House, COUNTRIES/USA, POLITICS/US Congress", "dcterms.modified": "2014-09-18 10:18:52 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "There are at least a handful of gubernatorial and congressional races where Hispanics can \u2013 and likely will \u2013 play a key role in deciding who is elected.
