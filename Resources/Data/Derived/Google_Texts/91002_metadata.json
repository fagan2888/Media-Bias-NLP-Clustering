John Delaney talks with Richard Blair, Mayor of Midland, Md., before a \u201cState of the District Roundtable\u201d with elected officials from Allegany and Garrett counties on Jan. 30 in Frostburg, Md. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nTwo winters ago, John Delaney was just a wealthy financier, with a mansion in Potomac, a quick commute to his Chevy Chase office and a host of fellow millionaires on speed dial.\n\nThis month, Delaney stood in a cold room at the snow-covered Allegany County fairgrounds, listening to farmers complain about cow manure.\n\nHis journey from chairman of a highly regarded lending company to one of the most junior members of the least powerful cohort on Capitol Hill \u2014 House Democrats \u2014 has prompted much head-scratching, and a lot of speculation that Delaney is eyeing a statewide race.\n\nHe has criticized Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D) over the Affordable Care Act. He has positioned himself as a centrist in his district, which leans blue to the east, red to west. Last summer, he drew attention with his announcement that he would invest personal funds in a campaign to raise Maryland\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nAnd then there was the telephone poll conducted last month that asked about Delaney along with a list of candidates who are running for governor.\n\nWho sponsored the poll is unclear. Delaney would say only that he does \u201cmany polls\u201d about lots of subjects. He said he expects to be running for Congress this year, not governor. But in the longer term, \u201cif I think I can make a bigger difference in a different office, I would do that.\u201d\n\nMuch to learn\n\nDelaney didn\u2019t just take on a new role when he was elected in 2012. He also took on a steep learning curve in a new seat, a gerrymandered behemoth that stretches from Potomac to the West Virginia border. It includes a good chunk of wealthy, liberal-leaning Montgomery County. It also includes Garrett County, a swath of heavily Republican, largely rural territory with a per-capita income half that of Montgomery.\n\nSo in addition to taking on weighty national concerns such as whether the United States should bomb Syria, he\u2019s learned that the big NewPage paper mill in Western Maryland can\u2019t run on natural gas because it\u2019s too expensive to get the gas there. He\u2019s learned that some Marylanders must drive to Martinsburg, W.Va., to find the nearest veterans hospital and that television viewers in Garrett County can get broadcasts only from Pennsylvania stations.\n\nDelaney also has discovered that Maryland farmers are unhappy about state rules requiring them to put fences around streams so their animals don\u2019t pollute water that eventually feeds the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAs one farmer put it to Delaney in Cumberland, if anyone sees one of your cows wandering into a stream, \u201cthey\u2019ll call someone, and \u2014 pardon the language \u2014 all H is going to break loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve had to learn a lot about, which I didn\u2019t appreciate, is how disconnected Western Maryland feels from the rest of Maryland \u2014 that they feel like their voice isn\u2019t heard,\u201d Delaney said.\n\nDelaney has tried to carve a middle path, taking pains to tell all kinds of audiences that he sees both sides of policy arguments. He was one of just two Maryland House members to support the recently approved farm bill, and he has said that the controversial practice of obtaining natural gas through hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d should be allowed \u201cin a safe and responsible way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say bad things about my Republican colleagues, ever,\u201d Delaney told a group of local officials gathered in a Frostburg meeting room. \u201cPeople ask, \u2018How do you work with the other side?\u2019 Well, I start by not saying bad things about them.\u201d\n\nDelaney takes pride in the fact that he has drawn a bipartisan list of sponsors to his biggest legislative project \u2014 a bill to create a national infrastructure fund that would be financed by private companies that repatriate cash they\u2019ve been keeping overseas.\n\nHe has criticized both parties on health-care reform and has been particularly outspoken about Maryland\u2019s problem-plagued state insurance exchange, even though Annapolis is dominated by his fellow Democrats. (Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, who has been in charge of implementing the law, is running for governor.)\n\nDelaney has called on the state to allow its residents to use the federal exchange. But the O\u2019Malley administration has responded largely by \u201cignoring\u201d his suggestion, Delaney says, and he thinks he knows why.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, agreeing to do that would be admitting that you spent $100 million or $150 million to build something and you failed,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cAnd I think politically the administration doesn\u2019t want to do that. You know, that\u2019s fine if it doesn\u2019t affect people, but I think this is going to affect a bunch of people, and I find that really troublesome.\u201d\n\nDisrupting the plan\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Delaney has been willing to buck some top Maryland Democrats since he got to Congress, given how he won the job in the first place.\n\nAfter the 2010 Census, Democratic leaders in Annapolis redrew the 6th District with two goals \u2014 to make longtime GOP Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett vulnerable in 2012, and to give Robert J. Garagiola, then the majority leader in the state Senate, a tailor-made seat in Congress.\n\nBut Delaney disrupted that plan. He pumped in some of his own money, raised more from outside donors than Garagiola did, and trumpeted an endorsement from former president Bill Clinton. Delaney won the primary and the general election with ease.\n\nSome party power brokers warned early that Delaney had his sights set beyond Congress.\n\nHe must first win a second term, likely against former Secret Service agent and 2012 Senate candidate Daniel Bongino (R). The Democratic tilt of the district and Delaney\u2019s wealth make him the clear favorite.\n\nIf Delaney does find he needs help on the campaign trail, he can always call on his old friend Clinton. (He\u2019s also close to Hillary Rodham Clinton; he raised more than $800,000 for her 2008 presidential campaign and is eager to see her run again in 2016.)\n\nDelaney has another good friend in politics who lives just across the Potomac River \u2014 Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.).\n\nWarner, who made a fortune in the telecommunications industry before serving as Virginia\u2019s governor, has complained that the slow pace and dysfunction of Capitol Hill are difficult for someone accustomed to being an executive.\n\nBut Delaney said he doesn\u2019t share Warner\u2019s frustration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed it, truly, to the surprise of many of my friends,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly interesting . . . to learn about so many issues that you never really had to go deep on. That\u2019s been great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "john delaney, maryland congress, maryland 6th congressional district, maryland 6th district, martin o'malley, fracking, maryland, mdpolitics governor's race, montgomery county, allegany county, garrett county", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Delaney\u2019s journey has prompted a lot of speculation that he is eyeing a statewide race.", "title": "John Delaney makes the transition from financier to life as a Md. congressman", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/2014/02/09/16d06bbe-8ea3-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/04/Local-Politics/Images/delaney071391546472.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Delaney\u2019s journey has prompted a lot of speculation that he is eyeing a statewide race.", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "john delaney, maryland congress, maryland 6th congressional district, maryland 6th district, martin o'malley, fracking, maryland, mdpolitics governor's race, montgomery county, allegany county, garrett county", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "16d06bbe-8ea3-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9de7\"", "article_summary": "Rep.
