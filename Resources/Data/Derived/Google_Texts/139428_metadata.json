Now in its sixteenth day, the shutdown began on October first when Tea Party activists drove conservative House members to change or defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare as part of any budget deal. Due to the shutdown, federal workers deemed nonessential have been furloughed. We interviewed a federal employee who spoke out about his frustration, how it affects him and his department and the impact the shutdown would have on local economies and the environment.\n\nRobert, not his real name, is unhappy with what he calls being held hostage.\n\n\u201cI am not very pleased with being a pawn used by the political parties,\u201d said the central Virginia resident, who has worked for the United States Department of the Interior for 13 years. \u201cThis entire situation is disgraceful, embarrassing\u2026\u201d\n\nFor the last two weeks, Robert has been furloughed from his job as a supervisor. He did not want to disclose which agency within the Interior Department he works for, but did say that his duties involved monitoring environmental resources, including water.\n\n\u201cIf we went back to work tomorrow, things financially wouldn\u2019t be so bad,\u201d Rob stated. \u201cBut if this goes on into November, we could be looking at problems.\u201d\n\nWhile Robert\u2019s wife has a good job with an export firm in Richmond, her salary is only a fraction of their pre-shutdown income. \u201cWe still have bills coming, including car payments, a mortgage and the credit cards.\u201d In addition, Robert\u2019s seven year old son is attending parochial school near the family\u2019s home.\n\nBefore he was furloughed as a nonessential employee, Rob acted in anticipation of the shutdown lasting longer than this month.\n\n\u201cI have called the credit card people and the people who have our loans and explained the situation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Robert, the companies understood matters and worked out an adjusted payment schedule.\n\n\u201cApparently a lot of their clients are government employees,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cNone of this came as a surprise to me or anyone I work with,\u201d commented Robert on his unemployment. \u201cWe got an e-mail on September 30, informing us to report to work the next day for only fours hours.\u201d\n\nIn that time, his staff was instructed to tie up any loose ends, including removing personal items and leaving messages on their office phones, informing all callers that they are closed until further notice.\n\n\u201cNow, my boss is working,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd he can decide who is essential and therefore can work.\u201d\n\nOne of the ironies of the government shutdown is that Rob\u2019s job survived the imposition of sequestration on the federal budget at the start of 2013. \u201cWe were able to absorb the five percent cuts that took place,\u201d said Robert. \u201cIf we could work then, we can still work now. Our agency still has the funding.\u201d\n\nThe branch of the Interior Department that employs him receives only partial funding from tax payer dollars, according to Robert. \u201cWe collect environmental data and market the information to states and municipalities. That is where most of our budget comes from.\u201d\n\nRobert added that a continued shutdown could be detrimental to data gathering efforts. \u201cThe local and state governments look at what we do in real time,\u201d Rob explained, adding the longer his agency is inactive, the greater chance the information could be out of date.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say there would be nearly zero impact on local economies,\u201d Robert said, regarding the effects of his office\u2019s inability to function.\n\nHe did, however, state that local governments take into account information gathered by his agency when making long term plans for water treatment facilities.\n\nHe added such a facility would have to monitor flows of local lake and rivers when discharging water. This is mandated by law,\u201d Robert added. \u201cSo they need to have real time information in these matters.\u201d\n\nConcerns about local ecology are a more pressing concern. \u201cOperators of water treatment facilities and nuclear power plants need to know what water flow levels in their area are like in order to make safe discharges of water,\u201d Bob explained. If this is done with inaccurate information, he added, the results could be harmful to the environment.\n\n\u201cFortunately, there is no danger, we could go for another two to three weeks,\u201d said Bob. However, monitoring equipment requires periodical maintenance. \u201cIf that\u2019s not done, there is a risk of inaccurate information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way I\u2019m upset about this,\u201d added Robert. \u201cIf I were paying for this service, I would be pretty upset.\u201d\n\nThe government shutdown has taken its toll on all federal employees but some more than others. What became evident during this interview was that even in the same department there are remarkable differences. When he was working, Robert supervised a staff of six people and they still meet for lunch every week to keep morale up.\n\n\u201cSome of us are doing okay financially and some of us are not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talk about the situation and how we are doing. The main thing I want to do is maintain team unity.\u201d\n\nRobert has also been in communication with his bosses, but stated no one has any idea when he and his people will return to work.\n\n\u201cYou can guess as well as I can,\u201d he remarked.\n\nRobert also voiced suspicion that the current shutdown will not be the last. \u201cThe limit on the federal debt ceiling is coming,\u201d he noted. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t settled, we may find ourselves doing this again.\u201d\n\nAt the close of the interview this federal employee added, \u201cI know that when this is all over, we will get our back pay. That will be good in the future, but it would be better to be working right now.\u201d The government shutdown hasn\u2019t been good for anyone. And if our lawmakers don\u2019t cut a deal soon, things will get a lot worse for everyone, the world over.\n\nOp-ed\n\nBy: Philip Perry and Donald M.
