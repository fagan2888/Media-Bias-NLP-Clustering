And it is brilliant here. I love it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lisa\u2019s story\n\nLisa Hayler, 24, moved to Phoenix House following family problems and is now settling in to her new flat at Beaconsfield House. She is studying maths at Seetec in Lowestoft and hopes to become a care worker.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have been waiting since October for this place. We have all been excited for it. Before I was at Phoenix House. The staff have been very supportive and then they said I could come to Beaconsfield House to be independent, see how it goes from there and hopefully move on.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Remell\u2019s story\n\nRemell Davis, 19, moved to Beaconsfield House this month. Born in London, he lived with his uncle before moving to a hostel in Ipswich and eventually to Phoenix House in Kirkley, Lowestoft.\n\nHe said he had fallen out with his uncle and \u201cmessed up\u201d at a number of hostels in Ipswich so Phoenix House had been his last option.\n\nSince moving to Lowestoft and receiving support from Access Community Trust (ACT), Remell has secured an apprenticeship coaching children at Lowestoft Town Football Club.\n\nThe striker was also signed to the club\u2019s first team in November.\n\nHe said staff at ACT, including senior support worker Janice Garvey, had helped him turn his life around.\n\n\u201cPeople have helped me, like Janice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPhoenix House was a good stepping stone for me. I probably would have been up to mischief otherwise. I don\u2019t know what I would have been doing. I probably would have done something wrong.\u201d\n\nHe added that he had been ready to move on from Phoenix House and Beaconsfield House had been what he was looking for.\n\n\u201cIt is about having my own space,\u201d he said. \u201cI can go to bed when I want and it is more grown up.\u201d\n\n\u2022 There are still a number of vacancies at Beaconsfield House.
