It has produced a more liberal, better-educated and wealthier Democratic Party with many minorities and a more conservative, blue collar, less educated, predominantly white GOP. The latter groups provide support to Trump.\n\n\u2022The slow recovery from the Great Recession. It left many middle-income Americans struggling to stay afloat economically and keep their homes. The growing gap between rich and poor, and resulting resentment, has fueled two main anti-establishment candidates, Republican Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u2022Antagonism toward President Barack Obama. It often extends beyond differences over policies and opposition to his aggressive use of executive power to a more personal level, including the strains of racism among \"birthers\" who denied the president's Hawaiian roots and contended he was born in Kenya. Many Republicans believe that, including Trump.\n\n\u2022Republicans want a strong leader. They believe Obama hasn't stood up sufficiently for American exceptionalism, apologized too much for the country's past failings and is a weak leader against global terrorism, underestimating for political reasons the danger to the homeland.\n\n\u2022Reaction to the last Republican presidency. Many \"small government\" Republicans accused George W. Bush of over-spending at home and abroad and opposed the 2008 Wall Street bailout, two factors that helped spawn the Tea Party.\n\n\u2022Republican support for so-called \"outsider\" candidates. It stems from the belief the GOP establishment nominated weak, insufficiently conservative presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012 and the anger that its congressional majorities failed to repeal Obamacare and stop other presidential initiatives.\n\n\u2022The growing cultural divide. Many Republicans are turned off by the cultural liberalism of the two coasts \u2014 embrace of secular attitudes in general and of gay marriage in particular \u2014 and tend to reflect the more traditional attitudes of middle America. Religious conservatives form a significant component of the modern GOP, especially in Iowa and the South, though Trump is not their first choice.\n\n\u2022Immigration concerns spurred by trade agreements. The two-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement and the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership have exacerbated long-standing economic and racial fears that immigration, both legal and illegal, threatens American jobs.\n\n\u2022Resistance to renewed U.S. overseas military involvement. Years of bloody and inconclusive wars in the Middle East have taken a toll on domestic support for sending troops into foreign entanglements. The all-volunteer army has meant that its victims, both dead and injured, are more likely to come from mainstream America than the wealthy elites.\n\n\u2022Renewal of anti-foreign attitudes. Such attitudes have recurred throughout American history, from the know-nothings of the 19th Century to the pre-World War II isolationists, accompanied occasionally by strains of anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish and anti-black feelings and, more recently, by antagonism toward Mexicans and Muslims.\n\n\u2022An increasingly intensive, competitive media environment. The expanded emphasis on television ratings and Internet clicks has helped Trump's outrageous comments and outsized personality to dominate coverage, forcing rivals to spend time responding to him and scrambling for attention while overshadowing serious policy discussions.\n\n\u2022Trump's inherent abilities as a salesman and his celebrity prominence. They have enabled him to personify the GOP's anti-establishment attitudes. Polls generally show he has both the largest plurality support within the party and stirs the strongest opposition among those backing his rivals \u2014 and among non-Republicans.\n\nOnly next year's caucus and primary voters can tell if the Trump tsunami will gain strength, blow out, or if it will \u2014 as most giant storms do \u2014 cause significant damage to the GOP's 2016 landscape.\n\nCarl Leubsdorf is the former Washington bureau chief of the Dallas Morning News. carl.p.leubsdorf@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "12 reasons for America's fascination with Donald Trump", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "author": "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "Like a tornado or a typhoon, the political tsunami that is Donald Trump is a complex coalescence of current and historical forces whose unforeseen power threatens to wreak havoc on the 2016 political landscape.", "title": "12 reasons for America's fascination with Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-oped-donald-trump-carl-leubsdorf-20151225-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-567e1985/turbine/fl-oped-donald-trump-carl-leubsdorf-20151225", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.17", "twitter": {"site": "@sunsentinel", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, President Obama", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402230662, app-argument=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/deeplinkid/85418011", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 64829476886, "app_id": 728754867160252}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-12-25", "Description": "At least 12 specific factors have helped to create what could prove for Republicans to be a perfect storm \u2014 or a historic disaster \u2014 in the political tsunami that is Donald Trump.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, President Obama"}, "article_summary": "The growing gap between rich and poor, and resulting resentment, has fueled two main anti-establishment candidates, Republican Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders.\nThe latter groups provide support to Trump.\nReligious conservatives form a significant component of the modern GOP, especially in Iowa and the South, though Trump is not their first choice.\nLike a tornado or a typhoon, the political tsunami that is Donald Trump is a complex coalescence of current and historical forces whose unforeseen power threatens to wreak havoc on the 2016 political landscape.\nMany Republicans believe that, including Trump."}
