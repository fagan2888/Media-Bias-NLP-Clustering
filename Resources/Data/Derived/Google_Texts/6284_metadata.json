All that stands between its passage in the Senate on Tuesday is a series of competing amendments that would alternatively eliminate the gas or shorten the House\u2019s version to allow for a possible increase in the levy after this year\u2019s election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdvocates on both sides of the gas tax debate have begun attempting to influence lawmakers on the amendments.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), which represents more than 900 manufacturers of construction, agricultural, forestry, utility and mining equipment, I want to urge you to support S. Amdt. 3583 (Carper-Corker-Boxer) during this week\u2019s debate over H.R. 5021 (Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014),\u201d AEM President Dennis Slater wrote in a letter to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI also strongly urge you to reject S.

The lawmakers argue that the shorter deadline would allow lawmakers to debate a long-term infrastructure funding extension during the lame duck session after the November midterms.\n\nRepublicans have opposed the shorter deadline because they have accused Democrats of trying to \u201csneak\u201d an increase in the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax past voters.\n\nThe gas tax has been the traditional source for transportation projects since the creation of the Highway Trust Fund in the 1950\u2019s. The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and it has struggled to keep pace with infrastructure expenses as cars have become more fuel efficient.\n\nConservative groups in Washington are urging lawmakers to support Lee\u2019s amendment, which would gradually reduce the gas tax from its current rate to 3.7 percent.\n\nDuring the same time period the gas tax is being reduced, Lee\u2019s amendment would transfer authority over federal highways and transit programs to states and replace current congressional appropriations with block grants.\n\nThe concept is commonly referred to as \u201cdevolution\u201d in transportation circles.\n\nThe Heritage Action foundation is urging lawmakers to vote against moving the expiration of transportation funding up until December and vote in favor of Lee\u2019s amendment.\n\n\u201cIntroduced by Sen.
