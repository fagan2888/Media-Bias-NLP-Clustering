The governor said the U.S. needs to secure the border and create a guest-worker program, but that he would not support mass deportation or driving out the entire 11 million-person undocumented population.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich said in Saturday's GOP debate that allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S. was not out of step with Americans -- but it clearly was out of step with much of the debate stage.

"I couldn't even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they've been here, leaving their children in the house," he said. "That is not, in my opinion, the kind of values that we believe in."

"At the end of the day, Americans would support a plan like this," he added.

Kasich said he would present an immigration plan to Congress within his first 100 days as president and that he thinks it would pass.

Right afterward, Ted Cruz talked up his plans to force undocumented immigrants out.
