Hildy Angius. \u201cWelcome Back the Trout is our annual event to show the community that fishing is alive and well in Bullhead City and Mohave County. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say this program offers the best fishing in Arizona \u2014 maybe even the entire west coast.\u201d\n\nThe second year for the stocking event and fishing clinic was organized by Arizona Game and Fish Department to commemorate the return of the popular sport fish to the waters south of Davis Dam.\n\nDuring the clinic hours, entrance to the county park was free and people could fish without a license.\n\nAlex Felix brought his kids, and an optimistic attitude.\n\n\u201cWe moved here two years ago and haven\u2019t caught a fish yet,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe today will be our lucky day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the gear,\u201d said 13-year old Alexis Felix. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try.\u201d\n\nWalmart and Riviera Marina donated raffle items for the event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for the community,\u201d said Rusty Braun of Riviera Marina. \u201cYou can see by how many people have shown up how much support there is for trout fishing.\u201d\n\nMarci Alderman, Game and Fish sport fishing education coordinator, believes in encouraging families to get outdoors to fish.\n\n\u201cThis program educates people around the state about fishing in Arizona, with a focus on letting kids have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cFishing is an opportunity for the whole family to have fun. We\u2019re pleased there\u2019s such a good turnout today, people were here 2 hours early.\u201d\n\nThe stocking program is possible because of the partnership between Mohave County and AGFD, said Sup. Angius.\n\n\u201cAny time agencies partner, more gets done,\u201d said Matt Chmiel, AGFD fisheries program manager. \u201cIn this case, Mohave County provided $50,000 to buy the fish to use to stock south beach. Fishing contributes greatly to this area\u2019s economy, so stocking fish and providing people with the opportunity to catch fish benefits everyone.\u201d\n\nMore than 3,800 pounds of rainbow trout were released Saturday morning, said Lonell Crowther, owner of Crowther\u2019s Fresh Water Trout fishery of La Jara, Colorado. The fishery owner recently marked his 300th delivery of fish to Arizona waters over a 20-year period.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing to stock the Colorado from Colorado,\u201d Crowther said. \u201cSince this is a special day for the fish, I groomed each one, brushed their teeth, and polished them up so they look great.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the recreational and economic benefit of rainbow trout restocking, it is hoped that a regular stocking program will help bring the Colorado River\u2019s booming caddisfly population under control, said Don Hendron, Bullhead City pest abatement district president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fast solution, but it is the long-term solution,\u201d he said. \u201cSpraying programs are not effective against caddisflies, and without the trout, they have few natural enemies.\u201d\n\nTrout stocking south of Davis Dam went on hiatus for nearly a year after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it was terminating the rainbow trout propagation program at the Willow Beach facility in Nov. 2013 due to insufficient funds to repair a broken water line that delivers water from Lake Mohave to the trout ponds at the hatchery.\n\nAn agreement was reached in March between AGFD, Mohave County, and the USFWS to restore rainbow trout stocking at Willow Beach National Fish Hatchery, located along the Colorado River south of the Hoover Dam.\n\n\u201cI attended a meeting recently where we learned that the decision to stop stocking trout in 2013 led to the growth in the caddisfly population,\u201d Hendron said. \u201cTrout will eat caddis fly larvae, and the more trout we get into the river, the faster the problem will come under control.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to re-stock the trout two more times before June, he said.\n\n\u201cHildy Angius has done an incredible job getting the trout returned to the area,\u201d Hendron said. \u201cEveryone involved in the program has been terrific, from AGFD to individuals like Nathan Michaels of Desert Recreation, who donated $5,000 towards getting more trout to reduce the caddisfly population.\u201d\n\nWhile it has been a tough year, Sup. Angius said, she\u2019s pleased with the progress that has been made.\n\n\u201cAGFD has been a terrific partner,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope to have an announcement soon regarding Willow Beach and the fish hatchery.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Mohave Daily News", "description": "BULLHEAD CITY \u2014 There were almost as many reasons to celebrate as there were trout released Saturday morning at Welcome Back the Trout.", "title": "Anglers anxious for rainbow reward", "url": "http://www.mohavedailynews.com/news/anglers-anxious-for-rainbow-reward/article_26d04b56-90ef-11e5-a656-27865b366618.html", "image": {"width": 366, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/mohavedailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/79/e7982886-90ef-11e5-a029-73b7cef68a93/5651785b00a77.image.jpg?resize=366%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "BULLHEAD CITY \u2014 There were almost as many reasons to celebrate as there were trout released Saturday morning at Welcome Back the Trout.", "fb": {"app_id": 1483756238503897}, "keywords": "news,local,featured", "news_keywords": "news,local,featured"}, "article_summary": "Hundreds of hopeful fisher folk cast their lines as 7,000 rainbow trout were released into Davis Camp\u2019s south beach waters.\n\u201cThis is terrific,\u201d said Mohave County Sup.\n\u201cI attended a meeting recently where we learned that the decision to stop stocking trout in 2013 led to the growth in the caddisfly population,\u201d Hendron said.\n\u201cWelcome Back the Trout is our annual event to show the community that fishing is alive and well in Bullhead City and Mohave County.\n\u201cIn this case, Mohave County provided $50,000 to buy the fish to use to stock south beach."}
