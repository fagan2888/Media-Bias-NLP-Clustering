4. Mechanical trouble hampers space station operations

NASA was forced to scale back work aboard the International Space Station on Wednesday after a cooling-system pump shut down. Engineers suspect a valve malfunctioned, but they couldn't immediately come up with a way to fix it. Astronauts might have to do repairs on a space walk.

Michigan lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill banning insurance plans in the state from covering abortion unless the woman's life is at risk. The law will force women who want the procedure covered to purchase a separate abortion rider. Opponents call it "rape insurance," because women would have to buy the insurance before being raped to be covered. Supporters say it just means that people opposed to abortion won't have to pay for plans that cover it. [Huffington Post]

9. India's high court revives ban against gay sex

India's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that consensual homosexual sex is illegal in the country, overturning a lower court ruling.
