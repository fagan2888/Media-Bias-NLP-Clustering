So-called open-bank mergers and acquisitions, or mergers between healthy banks, ground to a halt during the crisis but have started again in recent years.\n\n\u201cIndustry consolidation has resumed, so I think there will be opportunities to invest in banks that have done what they can to take advantage of their local markets, but are at the point where it\u2019s sensible to partner with a larger bank,\u201d Mr. Moore said.\n\nThe Banc Funds will also selectively provide capital to banks that have a good economic outlook, but are undercapitalized or burdened with bad loans.\n\nThe firm\u2019s investments range from as little as $500,000 to roughly $10 million, and it has investments in dozens of banks at any time, Mr. Moore said. The firm has already made about 50 investments from the new fund totaling 40% of the new capital, thanks to money raised through earlier closings.\n\nOne successful consolidation-themed investment from the new fund was Valley Financial Corp. in Roanoke, Va. The firm provided capital to improve operations before it sold last year to BNC Bancorp, the parent of Bank of North Carolina.\n\nAt the end of last year the firm also recapitalized a Midwestern bank with about $1 billion in assets, which had been well-managed but still found itself overextended due to the legacy of the financial crisis. The Banc Funds provided a $6 million recapitalization and worked with the bank to help reduce its overextended branch network.\n\n\u201cThe company adopted our franchise-reduction suggestions, we provided additional capital, and we think the company is now in a position to grow in a responsible and careful way,\u201d said Mr. Moore.\n\nWrite to Chris Cumming at chris.cumming@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Banc Funds, a Chicago-based private equity fund focused on the banking industry, is adapting its strategy to a post-Lehman world after closing its ninth fund with $536 million.", "title": "The Banc Funds Adapts Strategy to a Post-Lehman World", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/03/24/the-banc-funds-adapts-strategy-to-a-post-lehman-world/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NG095_PiggyB_P_20160324094946.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "The Banc Funds Adapts Strategy to a Post-Lehman World", "description": "The Banc Funds, a Chicago-based private equity fund focused on the banking industry, is adapting its strategy to a post-Lehman world after closing its ninth fund with $536 million.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "The Banc Funds, a Chicago-based private equity fund focused on the banking industry, is adapting its strategy to a post-Lehman world after closing its ninth fund with $536 million.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-03-24T14:26:02-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/03/24/the-banc-funds-adapts-strategy-to-a-post-lehman-world/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19689", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Banc Funds, a Chicago-based private equity fund focused on the banking industry, is adapting its strategy to a post-Lehman world after closing its ninth fund with $536 million.", "title": "The Banc Funds Adapts Strategy to a Post-Lehman World", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/03/24/the-banc-funds-adapts-strategy-to-a-post-lehman-world/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NG095_PiggyB_P_20160324094946.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19689", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-03-24T14:27:16-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The Banc Funds provided a $6 million recapitalization and worked with the bank to help reduce its overextended branch network.\nThe Banc Funds will also selectively provide capital to banks that have a good economic outlook, but are undercapitalized or burdened with bad loans.\nBanc Fund IX will also invest in consolidation opportunities.\nEight years later and armed with $536 million for its ninth fund, the firm is taking a different approach, according to Charles Moore, who founded The Banc Funds back in 1986.\nThe firm\u2019s investments range from as little as $500,000 to roughly $10 million, and it has investments in dozens of banks at any time, Mr. Moore said."}
