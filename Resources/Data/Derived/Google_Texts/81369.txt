J.R. Bohannon of Ancient Ocean.

It seems somehow fitting that J.R. Bohannon started writing the track “Absolution” in a church: the leader of the Brooklyn drone act Ancient Ocean says the idea for the track came from “an internal struggle” over the notion of absolution from sin. The song premieres today on Speakeasy.

The hypnotic 11-minute instrumental track builds slowly from distant, shuddering atmospherics to an imposing sound that is at once monolithic and spacious. “Absolution” is based on a two-chord guitar progression that he wrote during a sound check in an old church before a gig. “It transformed over the course of a year in a live and studio setting,” he says by email.

The setting certainly ties in with the theme that Bohannon had in mind while writing the tune, which is on Ancient Ocean’s upcoming debut LP, “Blood Moon.”

“‘Absolution’ came from an internal struggle over the idea that one can be absolved from all their sins in one fell swoop,” Bohannon says. “The idea that one’s moral dilemma can be defined by a religious establishment, then ultimately relinquished, was something that left me pondering over the true value of the act of absolution. It always seemed like a double-edged sword.”

“Blood Moon” is due June 30 on Beyond Beyond Is Beyond Records. What do you think of the track? Leave your thoughts in the comments.
