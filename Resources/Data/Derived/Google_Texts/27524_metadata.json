In this case, the price went from $13.50 a tablet to $750.\n\nIn other words, it has been a good few days for connoisseurs of business predators.\n\nNo doubt I, like anyone who points out ethical lapses on the part of some companies, will be accused of demonizing business. But I\u2019m not claiming that all businesspeople are demons, just that some of them aren\u2019t angels.\n\nThere are, it turns out, people in the corporate world who will do whatever it takes, including fraud that kills people, in order to make a buck. And we need effective regulation to police that kind of bad behavior, not least so that ethical businesspeople aren\u2019t at a disadvantage when competing with less scrupulous types. But we knew that, right?\n\nWell, we used to know it, thanks to the muckrakers and reformers of the Progressive Era. But Ronald Reagan insisted that government is always the problem, never the solution, and this has become dogma on the right.\n\nAs a result, an important part of America\u2019s political class has declared war on even the most obviously necessary regulations. Too many important players now argue, in effect, that business can do no wrong and that government has no role to play in limiting misbehavior.\n\nA case in point: Last week Jeb Bush, who has an uncanny talent for bad timing, chose to publish an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal denouncing the Obama administration for issuing \u201ca flood of creativity-crushing and job-killing rules.\u201d Never mind his misuse of cherry-picked statistics, or the fact that private-sector employment has grown much faster under President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cjob killing\u201d policies than it did under Bush\u2019s brother\u2019s administration.\n\nWhat are the terrible, unjustified regulations Bush proposes to scrap?\n\nCarbon regulation must go, of course, because doing nothing about climate change has become an essential part of the Republican identity. So must Obamacare.\n\nBut Bush also proposes doing away with rules regarding the disposal of coal ash, a byproduct of coal-burning power plants that contains mercury, arsenic and other contaminants that can cause serious health problems if they leak into groundwater or are blown into the air as dust. Does trying to limit these risks sound like an arbitrary, pointless action?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s for-profit education, an industry wracked by fraud \u2014 because it\u2019s very hard for students to assess what they\u2019re getting \u2014 that leaves all too many young Americans with heavy debt burdens and no real prospect of better jobs. But Bush denounces attempts at a cleanup.\n\nOh, and he denounces the administration for \u201cregulating the Internet as a public utility,\u201d which can sound odd until you realize that what\u2019s actually being regulated are Internet service providers, who face little or no competition in many local markets. Did I mention that in Europe, where Internet providers are required to accommodate competition, broadband is much faster and much cheaper than it is here?\n\nLast but not least, Bush calls for a rollback of financial regulation, repeating the thoroughly debunked claim that the Dodd-Frank law actually encourages banks to become too big to fail. (Markets disagree: Judging by their borrowing costs, big banks have lost, not gained, since Dodd-Frank went into effect.) Because why should we think that letting banks run wild poses any risks?\n\nThe thing is, Bush isn\u2019t wrong to suggest that there has been a move back toward more regulation under Obama, a move that will probably continue if a Democrat wins next year. After all, Hillary Clinton released a plan to limit drug prices at the same time Bush was unleashing his anti-regulation diatribe.\n\nBut the regulatory rebound is taking place for a reason. Maybe we had too much regulation in the 1970s, but we\u2019ve now spent 35 years trusting business to do the right thing with minimal oversight \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nSo what has been happening lately is an attempt to redress that imbalance, to replace knee-jerk opposition to regulation with the judicious use of regulation where there is good reason to believe that businesses might act in destructive ways. Will we see this effort continue? Next year\u2019s election will tell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Item: The CEO of Volkswagen has resigned after revelations that his company committed fraud on an epic scale, installing software on its diesel cars that detected when their emissions were being tested, and produced deceptively low results.Item", "title": "Paul Krugman: Why judicious business regulations are necessary", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150927/LOCAL1/150929823", "image": {"width": "192px", "identifier": "http://local.montereyherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/montereyherald.png?052016", "height": "192px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Paul Krugman: Why judicious business regulations are necessary"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "Item: The CEO of Volkswagen has resigned after revelations that his company committed fraud on an epic scale, installing software on its diesel cars that detected when their emissions were being tested, and produced deceptively low results.Item", "title": "Paul Krugman: Why judicious business regulations are necessary", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150927/LOCAL1/150929823", "image": {"src": "http://local.montereyherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/montereyherald.png?052016"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Commentary, Columns", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Commentary, Columns"}, "article_summary": "As a result, an important part of America\u2019s political class has declared war on even the most obviously necessary regulations.\nNo doubt I, like anyone who points out ethical lapses on the part of some companies, will be accused of demonizing business.\nIn other words, it has been a good few days for connoisseurs of business predators.\nToo many important players now argue, in effect, that business can do no wrong and that government has no role to play in limiting misbehavior.\nMaybe we had too much regulation in the 1970s, but we\u2019ve now spent 35 years trusting business to do the right thing with minimal oversight \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t worked."}
