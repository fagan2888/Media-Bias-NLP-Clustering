Comparing the scandal of child sexual abuse to racism, the 72-year-old Dawkins sought to frame the issue in a historical context, noting the changing mores of society and otherwise adding nuance to an issue typically seen in terms black and white.\n\n\u201cI am very conscious that you can\u2019t condemn people of an earlier era by the standards of ours,\u201d Dawkins told Times magazine. \u201cJust as we don\u2019t look back at the 18th and 19th centuries and condemn people for racism in the same ways as we could condemn a modern person for racism, I look back a few decades to my childhood and see things like caning, like mild pedophilia, and can\u2019t find it in me to condemn it by the same standards as I or anyone would today.\u201d\n\nDawkins recalled a day of his boyhood at a boarding school in Salisbury, England, when one of the schoolteachers \u201cpulled me on his knee and put his hand inside my shorts,\" he said. He and others were molested by the same teacher. However, Dawkins said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he did us any lasting harm.\u201d\n\nDawkins then suggested in the interview that \u201cmild touching\u201d should not be held in the same category as more aggravated forms of sexual assault, provoking anger from advocates for child sexual abuse. Peter Watt, director of child protection at the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, castigated the evolutionary biologist\u2019s comments as a \u201cterrible slight\u201d to victims of abuse who often suffer for decades afterward. \u201cMr. Dawkins seems to think that because a crime was committed a long time ago we should judge it in a different way,\u201d Watt told reporters. \u201cBut we know that the victims of sexual abuse suffer the same effects whether it was 50 years ago or yesterday.\u201d\n\nPeter Saunders, founder of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, told the newspaper that he found Dawkins' comments disturbing, too, as a victim of childhood sexual abuse. \u201cAbuse in all its forms has always been wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cEvil is evil and we have to challenge it whenever and wherever it occurs.\"\n\nDawkins' book was released on Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "richard dawkins, pedophilia, richard dawkin autobiography", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Advocates for child sexual abuse victims took umbrage at author Richard Dawkins' attempt to add nuance to a recent pedophilia scandal in the UK.", "title": "Richard Dawkins Slammed For Downplaying British Pedophilia Scandal", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/richard-dawkins-world-renowned-atheist-slammed-abuse-victim-advocates-downplaying-pedophilia-256400", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/richard-dawkins-criticized-remarks-pedaphilia-scandal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Advocates for child sexual abuse victims took umbrage at author Richard Dawkins' attempt to add nuance to a recent pedophilia scandal in the UK.", "title": "Richard Dawkins Slammed For Downplaying British Pedophilia Scandal", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/richard-dawkins-world-renowned-atheist-slammed-abuse-victim-advocates-downplaying-pedophilia-256400", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/richard-dawkins-criticized-remarks-pedaphilia-scandal.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/richard-dawkins-criticized-remarks-pedaphilia-scandal.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-11T14:07:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T14:13:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Advocates for child sexual abuse victims took umbrage at author Richard Dawkins' attempt to add nuance to a recent pedophilia scandal in the UK."}, "article_summary": "One of the world\u2019s most prominent atheists, author and provocateur Richard Dawkins drew ire from child protection agencies and others after downplaying a recent child sexual abuse scandal in the United Kingdom.\n\u201cI am very conscious that you can\u2019t condemn people of an earlier era by the standards of ours,\u201d Dawkins told Times magazine.\nDawkins seems to think that because a crime was committed a long time ago we should judge it in a different way,\u201d Watt told reporters.\n\u201cBut we know that the victims of sexual abuse suffer the same effects whether it was 50 years ago or yesterday.\u201dPeter Saunders, founder of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, told the newspaper that he found Dawkins' comments disturbing, too, as a victim of childhood sexual abuse.\nHowever, Dawkins said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he did us any lasting harm.\u201dDawkins then suggested in the interview that \u201cmild touching\u201d should not be held in the same category as more aggravated forms of sexual assault, provoking anger from advocates for child sexual abuse."}
