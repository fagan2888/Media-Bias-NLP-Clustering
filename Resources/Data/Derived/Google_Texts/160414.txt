In the Avalanche’s season finale Saturday night, defenseman Duncan Siemens will wear the No. 16 sweater and partner with Tyson Barrie in making his NHL debut against the playoff-bound Chicago Blackhawks at the Pepsi Center.

Siemens, 21, was selected by Colorado 11th overall in the 2011 NHL draft. He is in his second pro season and was called up by the Avs on Friday to replace the injured Brad Stuart. Among 11 first-round defensemen in his draft class, Siemens will be the last one to make his big-league debut.

“Pretty cool feeling, taking a look around, knowing that tonight was going to be the night that I was dreaming since I was 3 years old,” Siemens said after the morning skate. “It’s all about taking it in and focusing on what I have to do.”

Siemens has played in 51 games for the American Hockey League’s Lake Erie Monsters this season. He has six points (all assists) and 57 penalty minutes.

The Avs are not expected to re-sign defensemen Jan Hejda and Ryan Wilson, but six other blue-liners are under contract next season. Siemens will have a tough time making the 2015-16 season out of training camp — particularly because the team will likely sign at least one high-priced defensemen in free agency — but Siemens is excited about making a good first impression.

“Huge opportunity,” he said. “Everyone says you can only make one first impression.”

The Avs’ injured players — including Erik Johnson, Nathan MacKinnon, Jamie McGinn and Patrick Bordeleau — were interviewed after the morning skate and their thoughts about next season are here.
