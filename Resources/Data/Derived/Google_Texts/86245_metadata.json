That has prompted employers across the country, including in Massachusetts, to study whether to cut the number of hours in a typical workweek and eliminate coverage for spouses who can get insurance through their own employer, among other changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe potential cutbacks in coverage come just months before the law requires most Americans to obtain health insurance by Jan. 1. Some Massachusetts industry leaders say they are worried that progress made under the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation health reform law will stall \u2014 or that advances will be lost.\n\n\u201cIt only takes one or two companies like UPS to start the trend. And that makes me nervous because in Massachusetts, there\u2019s nowhere to go but backwards,\u201d said Kristen Lepore, vice president for government affairs at the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest employer association. \u201cBoth small and large employers are concerned.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty is echoed by other New England business groups, which are watching Massachusetts companies closely as they weigh whether to drop health insurance coverage and move workers into government-run marketplaces where many will qualify for federal subsidies to buy private insurance.\n\nNICO GARSTMAN/AFP/GETTY IMAGES Delta is reducing benefits to avoid a new tax.\n\nCompanies in New England that are known to be considering coverage cutbacks refused to speak on the record because they do not want to incite employee backlash before a decision has been made and risk losing workers to competitors, say trade group representatives.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still trying to figure this out, and they don\u2019t want to tip their hand,\u201d said Don Nokes, president of the Rhode Island Business Group on Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar concerns were raised in 2006, when Massachusetts passed its health reform law on which the federal legislation was modeled.\n\nAt the time, businesses worried that costs would skyrocket and eat into their bottom lines. Consumer advocates worried employers would drop coverage.\n\nThe fears proved unfounded. The number of employers offering health insurance grew from 70 percent in 2005 to 76 percent in 2011 \u2014 compared to a stagnant 60 percent nationally, according to a report by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation.\n\nNow Massachusetts employers are increasingly worried about the ramifications of the federal law, which, in some instances, imposes more stringent \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 requirements than the state law.\n\nThe federal law requires companies with 50 or more employees to offer insurance to full-time workers \u2014 those working 30 or more hours a week. The state law, on the other hand, defines full-time as over 35 hours a week.\n\nAs a result, Lepore and others said, many companies that employ low-wage, seasonal, or part-time workers \u2014 including retail and fast-food businesses, and even colleges and universities \u2014 are contemplating reducing employees\u2019 schedules to under 30 hours a week so they do not have to bear the cost of providing health insurance.\n\nTo mitigate employer concerns and give businesses across the country time to adjust, the Obama administration announced this summer that it would delay the employer mandate to offer health insurance by one year, to 2015.\n\nAfter 2015, large companies that do not offer their full-time employees insurance will be fined $2,000 per employee. In comparison, the fine for not covering employees in Massachusetts was $295, but that has now been abolished to make way for the federal penalty.\n\nNotwithstanding the Obama administration's decision to put off the employer mandate for a year, some companies have already decided to cut employee hours, which would enable them to provide coverage to fewer workers when the law does go into full effect.\n\nForever 21, a national teen clothing chain, said in August that it will cut the hours for full-time nonmanagement staff to 29.5 hours a week. The company denied the change was made in response to the federal law, known as the Affordable Care Act, or, colloquially, as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nSome advocates for expanding health care have said companies are using the law as a scapegoat in explaining coverage cutbacks.\n\nUPS, the shipping company, recently said it will not cover spouses of employees if the spouses have jobs that provide health coverage. The company said that the decision, which will affect 15,000 spouses, was made in part because of higher costs associated with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis change is consistent with the way many large employers are responding to the costs associated with the health care reform legislation,\u201d said the company in a memo to employees. Before reaching its decision, UPS said it studied other companies\u2019 health benefits and determined that 35 percent plan to exclude working spouses in 2014.\n\n\n\nDelta Airlines has reduced the generous health benefits offered to its pilots in order to avoid a new federal tax on costly health plans, known as the \u201cCadillac tax.\u201d Starting in 2018, most employers must pay a 40 percent excise tax on the amount that premiums for a health plan exceed $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for a family.\n\n\u201cGiven enough years, all plans will eventually risk being subject to the Cadillac tax and as they do, the natural reaction will be to continually reduce benefits provided,\u201d wrote a Delta executive in a memo.\n\nThe myriad new taxes imposed under the federal law make Massachusetts companies nervous, Lepore said. Many are awaiting insurance rates for Jan. 1 to be announced before making a decision on benefits.\n\n\u201cIf prices keep going up, they may entertain a plan with less coverage,\u201d said Ryan Kearney, general counsel of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, which represents smaller businesses. \u201cFor some businesses, depending on how their numbers work out, it may be more optimal for them to drop coverage and just pay the fine.\u201d\n\nAmong the primary concerns for companies with fewer than 50 employees is that the federal law requires Massachusetts to dismantle its own insurance rating system that allowed insurers to consider about 10 factors in setting the rates for small businesses.\n\nThe federal law mandates that insurers use only four rating factors \u2014 age, number of family members, geographic area, and tobacco use \u2014 and does not take into account the size of the company, a change that small businesses fear will drive costs up by more than 50 percent.\n\nThe federal government has agreed to allow Massachusetts to phase in the change over three years, but the Bay State business community, as well as the Legislature, will continue seeking a federal waiver.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get the waiver and some employers see those big rate increases, we might see some employers dropping coverage,\u201d said Richard Lord, president and CEO of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts.\n\nIn Warwick, R.I., a manufacturing company employing about 100 workers has eliminated health coverage for employees\u2019 spouses, going as far as calling the spouses\u2019 employers to check whether they offer health insurance, said Amy Gallagher, vice president of major accounts at the Cornerstone Group, a benefits advisory firm based in Rhode Island.\n\nThe company expects the move to save 15 to 20 percent in health benefit costs, Gallagher said. Gallagher said the company\u2019s owner did not want the business to be named.\n\nWhile national business groups have been hostile to some elements of the federal law, Massachusetts companies for the most part bought into the state\u2019s reform efforts in 2006, a key reason why the state law has been so successful, advocates and business leaders say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critically important to maintain the underpinnings of what made health reform successful in Massachusetts, which includes employer responsibility,\u201d said Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of the Boston-based Health Care For All.\n\nIndeed, the Obama law has spurred at least one Massachusetts company to expand employee access to health coverage beyond federal requirements.\n\nFramingham-based Cumberland Gulf Group, which owns the Cumberland Farms convenience stores and Gulf Oil gas stations, is reclassifying more than 1,200 part-time workers to full time to make them eligible for health insurance beginning Oct 1. The company said the move will cost the company several million dollars but will help it retain valued workers, which it said would please customers and pay off in the long run.\n\n\u201cSome companies are taking full-time people and converting them to part time. We\u2019re taking the opposite approach,\u201d said John McMahon, Cumberland Gulf Group\u2019s senior vice president and chief human resources officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also a good business decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "2.1.3510206392", "eomportal-id": 475020, "description": "Massachusetts businesses are considering trimming employee health benefits, following recent announcements by several national firms, including shipping giant UPS and Delta Airlines, that they would scale back benefits as a result of President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.
