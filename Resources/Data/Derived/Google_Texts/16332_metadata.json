I have often speculated that this is largely due to the success the right wing noise machine has had in demonizing the word liberal. Americans come out more liberal than would be expected by these poll findings when we look at individual issues.\n\nWhile the pendulum swings both ways, the trend has been toward more liberal policies over the years. Most people wouldn\u2019t think of returning to the days of child labor. Medicare and Social Security are deeply entrenched, to the point that even when Republicans vote for ending Medicare as we know it they realize they have to hide what they are doing. Recent polls show increases in the number of people who support legalization of same-sex marriage and legalization of marijuana. A majority even supports the individual components of Obamacare when asked without identifying the policy as Obamacare.\n\nJohn Sides reviewed a recent book to argue that many conservatives are really liberals:\n\nIn Ideology in America, Christopher Ellis and James Stimson describe a striking disjuncture. When identifying themselves in a word, Americans choose \u201cconservative\u201d far more than \u201cliberal.\u201d In fact they have done so for 70 years, and increasingly so since the early 1960s. But when it comes to saying what the government should actually do, the public appears more liberal than conservative. Ellis and Stimson gathered 7,000 survey questions dating back to 1956 that asked some variant of whether the government should do more, less, or the same in lots of different policy areas. On average, liberal responses were more common than conservative responses. This has been true in nearly every year since 1956, even as the relative liberalism of the public has trended up and down. For decades now there has been a consistent discrepancy between what Ellis and Stimson call symbolic ideology (how we label ourselves) and operational ideology (what we really think about the size of government). Looked at this way, almost 30 percent of Americans are \u201cconsistent liberals\u201d \u2014 people who call themselves liberals and have liberal politics. Only 15 percent are \u201cconsistent conservatives\u201d \u2014 people who call themselves conservative and have conservative politics. Nearly 30 percent are people who identify as conservative but actually express liberal views. The United States appears to be a center-right nation in name only. This raises the question: why are so many people identifying as conservative while simultaneously preferring more government? For some conservatives, it is because they associate the label with religion, culture or lifestyle. In essence, when they identify as \u201cconservative,\u201d they are thinking about conservatism in terms of family structure, raising children, or interpreting the Bible. Conservatism is about their personal lives, not their politics. But other self-identified conservatives, though, are conservative in terms of neither religion and culture nor the size of government. These are the truly \u201cconflicted conservatives,\u201d say Ellis and Stimson, who locate their origins in a different factor: how conservatives and liberals have traditionally talked about politics. Conservatives, they argue, talk about politics in terms of symbols and the general value of \u201cconservatism\u201d \u2014 and news coverage, they find, usually frames the label \u201cconservative\u201d in positive terms. Liberals talk about policy in terms of the goals it will serve \u2014 a cleaner environment, a stronger safety net, and so on \u2014 which are also good things for many people. As a result, some people internalize both messages and end up calling themselves conservative but having liberal views on policy. Ideology has two faces: the labels people choose and the actual content of their beliefs. For liberals, these are mostly aligned. For conservatives, they are not. American conservatism means different things to different people. For many, what it doesn\u2019t mean is less government.\n\nThis idea that nearly 30 percent of self-identified conservative are really liberals would explain the increased support for liberal positions despite a majority identifying themselves as conservatives.\n\nThere are some limitations to this, largely due to problems with these labels. It seems to use a simplistic definition of liberals as being for more government and conservatives being for less, but that does not really explain the differences. There are many areas where I am for less government. There is nowhere that I support more government for the sake of more government.\n\nI supported the Affordable Care Act because financing of health care is an area where the market has failed, as insurance companies found it more profitable to find ways to collect increased premiums while finding ways to avoid paying out claims. Conservatives opposed the Affordable Care Act based upon greatly-exaggerated arguments that it is more government (ignoring its similarities to health plans previously advocated by conservatives). Republicans widely supported an individual mandate to buy health insurance until this became part of the plan supported by Barack Obama (who ran against Hillary Clinton opposing the individual mandate). Similarly, conservatives previously supported ideas comparable to the health care exchanges.\n\nOn the other hand, conservatives support more big government when it comes to military spending, mandatory vaginal probes, and other intrusions into the private lives of individuals. Even Ron Paul, who voted no on virtually any spending by the federal government, would allow for far greater government restrictions on individual liberties if it came from the state or local level.\n\nRepublicans in office generally perform different than their rhetoric would, with big increases in the size of government under Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. This has been described as being \u201cideologically conservative, but operationally liberal.\u201d If we just go by their effects on the size of government, Reagan and Bush were the liberals while Barack Obama has been the most conservative president since Dwight Eisenhower. Part of this is because Republican rhetoric is incompatible with actually governing, leading Reagan and Bush to promote far more government spending than would be expected by their rhetoric. Many conservatives realize they didn\u2019t get what they wanted from Bush, but continue to buy the myth of Ronald Reagan as a supporter of small government.\n\nAnother problem is a concentration on economic issues and the size of government, as misleading as those issues can be in assigning labels. How would they classify someone who wants to ban abortion, limit access to contraception, opposes same-sex marriage, and supports everyone carrying a concealed weapon, but doesn\u2019t follow the entire Republican line on economic policy? I bet a lot of self-identified conservatives would have no real opposition to a modest tax increase on the wealthy and increasing some government economic regulations (especially if they don\u2019t affect them personally) while holding a number of other conservative positions.\n\nToday many are self-identified conservatives based upon social issues. This didn\u2019t always identify conservatism. Barry Goldwater was a strong opponent of the religious right. He sure called it right in 1994:\n\nMark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they\u2019re sure trying to do so, it\u2019s going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can\u2019t and won\u2019t compromise. I know, I\u2019ve tried to deal with them.\n\nOr maybe they just like being members of the club. They like to listen to people like Glenn Beck and agree with what they say. However Beck has previously described himself as \u201ca rodeo clown\u201d and conceded, \u201cIf you take what I say as gospel, you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\nOriginally posted at Liberal Values", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "Polls have generally showed self-identified conservatives outnumbering liberals, with a recent slight increase in the number of liberals.
