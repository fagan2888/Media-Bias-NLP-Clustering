It\u2019s a goal that tugs at the heartstrings of Democrats, but pursuing it usually invites political peril.\n\nNow Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are clashing over this core question for liberals, making it a wedge issue in the party\u2019s presidential primary.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nIt\u2019s a choice between his conviction that a government-run system would be fairer and more affordable, and her preference for step-by-step change at a time of widespread skepticism about federal power.\n\nThe late Sen. Edward Kennedy once championed a Sanders-like \u201csingle-payer\u201d system, yet during nearly 47 years in office Kennedy also embraced less sweeping and more politically feasible ideas. Health care realists greeted President Barack Obama\u2019s law as vindication. But with 29 million still uninsured and deductibles of over $3,000 for taxpayer-subsidized coverage, some Sanders supporters call it the \u201cUnaffordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHealth care for everyone remains the aim for Democrats. The differences are over the best way to get there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s compelling to see the longstanding argument over big, revolutionary change versus more incremental change personified in two candidates, Bernie and Hillary,\u201d said John McDonough, an aide to Kennedy during the Obama health overhaul debate.\n\nThe worry is about provoking a fatal backlash from the political right.\n\n\u201cBernie speaks to the hearts of Democrats, and Hillary speaks to the head,\u201d added McDonough, now a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s about who is more in tune with the actual opportunity and possibility of the time.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates seem to be struggling to clearly frame the issue.\n\nSanders sees the destination, but hasn\u2019t been able to lay down a roadmap for getting there. Clinton can\u2019t seem to fit her menu of tweaks into a persuasive vision. They\u2019re talking past each other, said Yale professor Ted Marmor, in a \u201cdialogue of the deaf\u201d that leaves voters confused. Both Democratic candidates seem to be struggling to clearly frame the issue. Signed almost six years ago, Obama\u2019s health overhaul is the starting point for Democrats who would succeed him. About 16 million people have gained coverage, and the uninsured rate has fallen to 9 percent, a historic achievement. Economic recovery helped, but the biggest increases in coverage came after the health law\u2019s insurance markets and Medicaid expansion got going in 2014.\n\nNonetheless, 28.8 million remain uninsured, and many are still struggling to pay for care even though they have coverage. A government survey estimated that 44.5 million people under age 65 were in families with problems paying medical bills. On top of that, \u201cObamacare\u201d is mind-numbing to many consumers, a program that combines two of the most complicated areas: insurance and taxes.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act made some improvements for some people, but the health care system is failing lots of Americans,\u201d said Steffie Woolhandler, a longtime single-payer activist and primary-care physician. \u201cThat made it inevitable that further reform would be back on the table.\u201d\n\nUnder Sanders\u2019 plan there would be no premiums, no deductibles, no copayments, no hospital bills. Instead, there\u2019d be significant tax increases.\n\nGovernment-run health care in the world\u2019s richest country in theory should be able to cover everyone and keep costs manageable, but Sanders has been unable to demonstrate that the math behind his plan adds up. One analysis found he overestimates how much his proposed new taxes would raise; another concluded he underestimates the plan\u2019s costs.\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton\u2019s failed 1990s health plan pledged coverage for all, but it maintained a private insurance market, albeit highly regulated. A key element of Obama\u2019s law \u2014 the requirement that individuals get health insurance \u2014 comes from a Republican counterproposal to the earlier Clinton plan.\n\nNow Hillary Clinton has pledged to build on Obama\u2019s progress, outlining policy proposals to limit prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. She\u2019d repeal Obama\u2019s unpopular \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost health insurance plans, which is meant as a brake on spending.\n\nBut Clinton doesn\u2019t connect the dots on how her ideas might advance age-old Democratic aspirations.\n\n\u201cI think she has to go back to those basics and stay there,\u201d said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who once introduced single-payer legislation with Sanders, but is supporting Clinton. He checks off a list: \u201cCoverage for all, no pre-existing conditions, no medical bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nRecent analysis from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that there\u2019s room to cover many more uninsured people under the framework of Obama\u2019s law. Nearly 6 in 10 of the uninsured would be eligible for subsidized private insurance, existing Medicaid programs or, if the remaining states accept it, expanded Medicaid.\n\nBut incremental progress is unsatisfying for Sanders and those committed to a single-payer plan. If elected president, the Vermont senator says, he\u2019d lead a political revolution for universal health care.\n\nOther Democrats wonder.\n\n\u201cWe saw a political revolution around health care reform,\u201d McDonough, the former Kennedy aide, said of the \u201cObamacare\u201d debate. \u201cIt was called the tea party.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Get the analysis of Mark Shields and David Brooks delivered to your inbox every week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Health care for all.
