The report\u2019s authors are William Hamblen, CBER research associate; LeAnn Luna, CBER associate professor; and Bill Fox, CBER director.\n\nTennCare is the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which provides health care for low-income children; families; pregnant women; and aged, blind, or disabled adults.\n\nThe purpose of the annual study is to determine the insurance status of Tennessee residents, collect information about their use of medical facilities, and gauge the extent of their satisfaction with services received.\n\nThe study did not examine the Affordable Care Act in relation to TennCare.\n\n\u201cTennCare continues to receive positive feedback from its recipients, indicating the program is providing medical care in a satisfactory manner and up to the expectations of those it serves,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe report also looked at where TennCare recipients first go when they need medical attention\u2014a doctor\u2019s office, a clinic, or directly to a hospital.\n\nThe portion of TennCare recipients initially reporting that they seek care at hospitals this year was 6 percent, compared to 10 percent last year.\n\n\u201cThis decrease in TennCare adults initially seeking care at hospitals has been accompanied by an increase in the portion of TennCare adults initially seeking care at a doctor\u2019s office,\u201d the report states.\n\nIn 2013, 80 percent of recipients stated that they sought initial care at a doctor\u2019s office, compared to 75 percent in 2012.\n\nThe report also showed that the number of uninsured adults and children in Tennessee increased slightly this year compared to 2012. In 2013, uninsured Tennesseans\u2014an estimated 611,368 individuals\u2014represent 9.6 percent of the state\u2019s 6.4 million residents, whereas 9.2 percent reported being uninsured last year. The number of uninsured children also increased, to 3.7 percent this year from 2.7 percent last year.\n\nThe underlying reason most Tennesseans lack insurance is the perception that they cannot afford it.\n\nThis year, 83 percent of uninsured people cited unaffordability as a major reason for not having insurance, a 5 percent decrease from 2012, according to the report.\n\nThe survey, which interviewed about 5,000 heads of households by telephone between May and July 2013, is a regular follow-up to previous surveys conducted since 1993, the last year of Medicaid before the state adopted TennCare.\n\nCBER conducted the survey under contract with the Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration.\n\nRead the report in its entirety online.\n\n\u2014\n\nCONTACTS:\n\nLola Alapo (865-974-3993, lola.alapo@tennessee.edu)\n\nBill Fox (865-974-6112, billfox@utk.edu)", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Study: TennCare Satisfaction at its Highest\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/tntoday.utk.edu\\/2013\\/12\\/03\\/study-tenncare-satisfaction-highest\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-03 15:29:09\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-12-03 15:29:09\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":44134,\"author_id\":\"5\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"Rebekah Winkler\",\"tags\":[\"Bill Fox\",\"Center for Business and Economic Research\"],\"categories\":[\"Faculty &amp; Staff\",\"Headlines\",\"Press Releases\",\"Research\"],\"image\":null}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "HandheldFriendly": "True"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1142\"", "article_summary": "Ninety-five percent of TennCare recipients surveyed expressed satisfaction with the care they received, the highest level since the program\u2019s inception.\nOverall enrollee satisfaction with the TennCare program is at its highest level, according to a UT report released today.\nThe portion of TennCare recipients initially reporting that they seek care at hospitals this year was 6 percent, compared to 10 percent last year.\nThis finding is included in \u201cThe Impact of TennCare: A Survey of Recipients 2013,\u201d prepared by UT\u2019s Center for Business and Economic Research.\nThe report also looked at where TennCare recipients first go when they need medical attention\u2014a doctor\u2019s office, a clinic, or directly to a hospital."}
