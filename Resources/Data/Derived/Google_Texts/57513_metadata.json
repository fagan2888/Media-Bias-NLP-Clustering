This, without a doubt, is one of those times.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve had better things to do (and for your sake, we hope you have), here\u2019s where we stand: Having adjourned without passing a budget during its regular annual session, the Assembly was called back into special session by Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The main sticking point was the governor\u2019s push to expand Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program, using funds allocated by the federal government under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nDuring the regular session, the Democrat-controlled Senate had tried to advance McAuliffe\u2019s goals by introducing a \u201cprivate option\u201d plan they called Marketplace Virginia, under which the federal funds would be used to purchase private insurance for low-income individuals. Although this compromise had managed to garner a handful of GOP votes in the Senate, the Republican-dominated House of Delegates summarily dismissed it, leading to the current impasse.\n\nTo the surprise of many, Gov. McAuliffe kicked off the special session by introducing a revised budget that eschewed the private option for his original goal of full Medicaid expansion (albeit as a \u201cpilot program\u201d that could be ended after two years without incurring any financial penalties for the commonwealth). What\u2019s more, he promised to use the projected savings to increase wages for state employees and teachers, expand pre-kindergarten programs, and help shore up the Virginia Retirement System, among other things.\n\nThis new proposal set off a frenzy of bickering and infighting, with the entire first day of the special session wasted on an argument over which budget\u2014McAuliffe\u2019s or one proposed by the House Appropriations Committee chairman\u2014should serve as the starting point for budget negotiations.\n\nOn the second day of the special session, the ongoing drama turned into straight-up farce. The state Senate, claiming to need time to study McAuliffe\u2019s proposals, decided to adjourn until April 7. The house, on the other hand, went into full-on theatrics mode. The Republican majority passed their own budget (devoid of any mention of Medicaid, natch), marched over to the Senate offices and posted a \u201cGone Home\u201d sign on the door whilst cheering like a pack of drunken frat boys. Then they went home.\n\nOh yeah\u2014a number of delegates also promised not to shave until a state budget was signed into law.\n\nIt\u2019s this sort of unprofessional, childish behavior that makes the possibility of a July 1 state government shutdown seem ever more likely. In the meantime, Virginia is forfeiting around five million dollars a day in federal Medicaid funds and, according to an analysis recently published in the well-respected journal Health Affairs, effectively denying almost 300,000 Virginians access to decent health care (while, in the process, failing to prevent between 266 and 987 unnecessary deaths per year).\n\nBut keep growing those beards, Republican delegates. You can use them to cover your smirks while thousands of your fellow Virginians needlessly suffer and die.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Odd Dominion is an unabashedly liberal, bi-monthly op-ed column covering Virginia politics.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "C-VILLE Weekly", "description": "Odd Dominion is an unabashedly liberal, bi-monthly op-ed column covering Virginia politics.", "title": "Child\u2019s play: Virginia\u2019s lawmakers throw a tantrum, then take a time out", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.c-ville.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/richmond-capitol.jpg", "url": "http://www.c-ville.com/childs-play-virginias-lawmakers-throw-a-tantrum-then-take-a-time-out/", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": 1219058141, "app_id": 1073603839361926}, "template": "Cville Theme 3.0.0", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Government & Courts", "published_time": "2014-04-04T15:49:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9d5\"", "article_summary": "Oh yeah\u2014a number of delegates also promised not to shave until a state budget was signed into law.\nThe state Senate, claiming to need time to study McAuliffe\u2019s proposals, decided to adjourn until April 7.\nOn the second day of the special session, the ongoing drama turned into straight-up farce.\nThe main sticking point was the governor\u2019s push to expand Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program, using funds allocated by the federal government under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nYou can use them to cover your smirks while thousands of your fellow Virginians needlessly suffer and die."}
