Former Obama White House official Linda Douglass will start as Bloomberg Media’s Global Head of Communications in September, Politico reported Tuesday.

Douglass served as a correspondent for ABC and CBS News before joining the 2008 Obama campaign as a strategist and spokeswoman.

She later landed the gig of Director of Communications for the White House Office of Health Reform, a post from which she resigned abruptly after nearly two years once the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. From there, she moved into a communications role at Atlantic Media Group.

Douglass’ husband, now-retired whistleblower attorney John R. Phillips, is himself a major Obama supporter, having raised upwards of $200,000 for the president’s 2012 reelection campaign. Obama later rewarded Phillips by nominating him in June 2013 to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Italy.

Bloomberg Media CEO Justin B. Smith championed Douglass as “a force of nature, a gifted strategist, and a forward-thinking, creative media executive” in a statement Tuesday.

“Linda will be a remarkable addition to our leadership team as we drive towards our goal of becoming the world’s leading global business media company,” Smith said.
