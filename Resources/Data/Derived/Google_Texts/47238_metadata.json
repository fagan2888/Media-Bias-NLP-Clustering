Jan. 6, 2015 (Photo: Alton Strupp/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo Story Highlights The East Broadway health center renovation project was funded mainly with a $5 million federal grant\n\nThe project's cost rose because of requirements to raise the floor to comply with flood plain rules.\n\nEMS will move to the fifth floor of the health center and to a former bank site across the street.\n\nFamily Health Centers community health-care agency is preparing to triple the space for its East Broadway center by moving it a block west to a massive five-story brick building at Broadway and Campbell Street that most recently housed an antique mall.\n\nLouisville Metro EMS \u2014 which collaborates with the health agency \u2014 also plans to move its command center to the fifth floor of the health center building. Its operations headquarters and ambulance fleet also will move to a former Bank of Louisville complex across Campbell from the center \u2014 helping to create a health care \"campus\" on East Broadway that also will include Seven Counties Services social services agency.\n\nA complicated renovation project at the new health center site, 834 E. Broadway, funded mostly with a $5 million grant provided through the federal Affordable Care Act, is wrapping up after beginning in late fall of 2013.\n\nRELATED | Feds give $4.9M boost to Ky. health centers\n\nThe non-profit agency officials hope the current East Broadway center, 914 E. Broadway, will be in the new, leased site next month, and a grand opening event also is planned, perhaps in March. It shares the former Spencerian College building with Seven Counties, which will take over the whole building.\n\nAnother $1 million was raised by the agency for the renovation work at the new site, bringing the total cost of the project to about $6 million, said Bill Wagner, the agency's executive director.\n\nFamily Health Centers, which is affiliated with the Louisville Board of Health, also operates six other community health centers \u2014 which provide primary and preventative care to the public, regardless of ability to pay \u2014 including one at the agency's headquarters in Portland. The others are: Fairdale, Iroquois, Southwest, Americana on Southside Drive and Phoenix Health Care for the Homeless on East Muhammad Ali Boulevard.\n\nThe $5 million federal grant for the East Broadway center renovation was part of $11 billion federally allocated for expansion of community health care facilities throughout the country, in conjunction with provisions of the Affordable Care Act to help make insurance coverage more accessible, Wagner said.\n\nRELATED | More than 100,000 enrolled in kynect plans\n\n\"It doesn't do any good just to give people insurance coverage\" without also offering services and facilities to manage and keep down health care costs, he said.\n\nThe new East Broadway center will be able to serve about 10,000 more people annually, up from about 5,800 now, in a space that will increase in size from 8,400 to more than 30,000 square feet.\n\nThe New York Times has written four stories in the past two years that look at care at the Family Health Centers network, including one Dec. 29, after Kentucky expanded Medicaid, resulting in a drop in the uninsured rate that's among the sharpest in the nation, the Times said.\n\nMore than 90 photos will be displayed throughout the new East Broadway center, showing scenes and details of neighborhoods in the area \u2014 including Smoketown, Old Louisville and Phoenix Hill \u2014 shot by former Courier-Journal photographer Pam Spaulding.\n\n\"We wanted this effort to be a reflection of the neighborhoods we serve,\" Wagner said. Some old concrete ceiling beams and other features also are being retained to reflect the historic character of the building, which was constructed in about 1924.\n\nThis week, construction work was still going on at a new entrance to the building at the west front corner next to Broadway and in a community meeting and conference room area with a kitchen on the second floor, where cooking, yoga and other community classes also will be held, Melissa Mather, the health centers communications and planning coordinator said.\n\nAdult primary care also will be on the second floor, and pediatrics and women's health services will be on the third floor. A radiology unit is planned later on the fourth floor, and a dental area will be on the third floor. A pharmacy will operate on the first floor, along with a small urgent care clinic, although same day care also will be provided in all departments, Mather said.\n\nThe cost of the project rose because of requirements for raising the floor on the first level anywhere from a few inches to several feet to comply with local MSD flood plain regulations. The site is in a flood plain because it is next to Beargrass Creek and a bridge over the creek that can cause water backups, Wagner said.\n\nThe renovation project was designed by architect Steve Wiser of JRA Architects, who said it was a \"challenge in almost every design aspect.\"\n\nFor EMS, the new dual location on East Broadway is a \"really good fit\" that enables the service to consolidate its services at one general site, Kristen Miller, EMS's chief of staff, said. The operations and supplies headquarters could move to the bank site as soon as next month from 1805 S. Brook St., near University of Louisville.\n\nThe EMS command staff is expected to move a few months later to the health center building from West Liberty Street downtown, Miller said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Irn1zm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Family Health Centers hopes to moved its East Broadway center a block away into its new space in a five-story, historic building taht was an antique mall and had been the on four floors of a historic building at", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Family Health Centers hopes to moved its East Broadway center a block away into its new space in a five-story, historic building taht was an antique mall and had been the on four floors of a historic building at", "title": "East Broadway health center, EMS plan", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/centralwest/2015/01/07/east-broadway-health-center-ems-plan-campus/21394569/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Family Health Centers hopes to moved its East Broadway center a block away into its new space in a five-story, historic building taht was an antique mall and had been the on four floors of a historic building at", "title": "East Broadway health center, EMS plan \"campus\"", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/800630dd5c616c29b25d84b5459b406cf02d6db4/c=960-0-4800-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/07/B9315721584Z.1_20150107133705_000_GQD9JR55O.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "Martha Elson"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Louisville", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Louisville", "title": "East Broadway health center, EMS plan \"campus\"", "author": "Martha Elson", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/centralwest", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c72fc348fa6bc2747180f692a2131f99b9f734f5/c=1440-0-4320-3840/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/07/B9315721584Z.1_20150107133705_000_GQD9JR55O.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98bf8e596c32510f94f4c1c778ff11fda8fbcb3a/c=960-0-4800-3840/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/07/B9315721584Z.1_20150107133705_000_GQD9JR55O.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2ce35cb0bc3c3f1fa72c1a12fd6c099318b932a/c=320-0-5440-3840/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/07/B9315721584Z.1_20150107133705_000_GQD9JR55O.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f58cd65e1ebc537e90e0572c38e1c9187a60894/c=0-300-5760-3540&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/07/B9315721584Z.1_20150107133705_000_GQD9JR55O.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-07T13:49:56.337000-05:00", "shorthed": "East Broadway health campus shapes up", "articleid": 21394569, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/421b078e32ec24dfbab35e78c8c4cec779ade847/c=0-300-5760-3540/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/07/B9315721584Z.1_20150107133705_000_GQD9JR55O.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/48df83f7285729a6166f4a8d36f71b4cd1d569c0/c=1800-0-3960-3840/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/07/B9315721584Z.1_20150107133705_000_GQD9JR55O.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Family Health Centers, East Broadway, Louisville Metro EMS, Bank of Louisville, East Broadway, Campbell Street"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba87\"", "article_summary": "Louisville Metro EMS \u2014 which collaborates with the health agency \u2014 also plans to move its command center to the fifth floor of the health center building.\nThe EMS command staff is expected to move a few months later to the health center building from West Liberty Street downtown, Miller said.\nEMS will move to the fifth floor of the health center and to a former bank site across the street.\nBuy Photo Family Health Services executive director Bill Wagner gives a tour of the second floor inside the new East Broadway Family Health Center that is planned to open in late February, or early March.\nThe others are: Fairdale, Iroquois, Southwest, Americana on Southside Drive and Phoenix Health Care for the Homeless on East Muhammad Ali Boulevard."}
