Fort Collins firefighters rescued two dogs and a cat in an apartment blaze that injured one person and caused up to $100,000 in damage to eight apartments early Saturday morning, authorities say.

The three-alarm fire broke out around 3 a.m. in the 16-unit apartment building at 1112 Davidson Dr., according to a news release by Patrick Love, spokesman for the Poudre Fire Authority.

Thirty residents were quickly evacuated from the building including a person who suffered non-life-threatening burns. That resident was taken to Poudre Valley Hospital for treatment.

Of the three pets that were rescued from the fire, one dog needed medical attention and was taken to the Colorado State University Veterinary Hospital.

A second alarm was almost immediately called while firefighters searched for possible trapped residents and attempted to extinguish the fire, Love said.

A section of roof later collapsed, triggering a third call for reinforcements, he said. Loveland and Wellington fire departments responded to the fire.

Crews worked to keep the inferno from spreading into other sections of the building and helped protect residentsâ€™ belongings by placing fire-retardant covers over furniture.

Two apartments were heavily damaged by fire, smoke and heat. Six other units were damaged by smoke and water.

Investigators are working to determine what caused the fire.
