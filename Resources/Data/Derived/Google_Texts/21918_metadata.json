Her Husband recently got laid off and she's searching for answers when it comes to the new coverage.\n\n\"You try to go online to do comparisons but it's daunting,\" she said.\n\nSo she decided to get help from Affordable Care Navigators at the Morton Clinic.\n\nNancy Rardin is health resources advocate at the clinic and say's this year it\u2019s important to get educated.\n\nIn the past, the marketplace had more providers. This year, in Oklahoma, Rardin say's there are only two: Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Health Care. So, if your previous plan was under a different provider you need to re-enroll.\n\n\"I had a call last night from someone that [asked], \u2018you know what's the difference between community care from last year to this year?\u2019 Well, community care isn't even a provider this year, so if you haven't heard that or don't know that, you're not going to be insured in 2016,\" Rardin stated.\n\nRardin say's another one of the big concerns she hears is affordability.\n\n\"I've had a lot of people say, \u2018They say this is affordable, this isn't affordable!\u2019 Well, if you just get someone to help you sift through it all, and maybe you're missing something, that would make it much more affordable and that's what we're here for.\"\n\nAnd White says she's thankful there's some guidance available, especially through a subject that can be so overwhelming.\n\nThe deadline to get coverage by January 1st is Tuesday, and the final deadline is January 31st to get insurance by March 1st.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Advisors at the Morton Comprehensive Health Center say a lot has changed in the marketplace this year, so they recommend talking to someone before signing up for health insurance.", "author": "Erin Conrad", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/30733283/morton-clinic-offers-guidance-to-those-choosing-health-insurance", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9448909_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Advisors at the Morton Comprehensive Health Center say a lot has changed in the marketplace this year, so they recommend talking to someone before signing up for health insurance.", "title": "Morton Clinic Offers Guidance To Those Choosing Health Insurance"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9448909_G.jpg", "description": "Advisors at the Morton Comprehensive Health Center say a lot has changed in the marketplace this year, so they recommend talking to someone before signing up for health insurance.", "card": "summary", "title": "Morton Clinic Offers Guidance To Those Choosing Health Insurance"}, "wnreadableurl": "morton-clinic-offers-guidance-to-those-choosing-health-insurance", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/12/12", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS10", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "article_summary": "So she decided to get help from Affordable Care Navigators at the Morton Clinic.\nThis year, in Oklahoma, Rardin say's there are only two: Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Health Care.\nNancy Rardin is health resources advocate at the clinic and say's this year it\u2019s important to get educated.\nAdvisors at the Morton Comprehensive Health Center say a lot has changed in the marketplace this year, so they recommend talking to someone before signing up for health insurance.\nWhite is signing up for health insurance through the marketplace for the first time."}
