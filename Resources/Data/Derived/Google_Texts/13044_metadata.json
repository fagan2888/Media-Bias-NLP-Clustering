(AP) - Tennessee coach Butch Jones wasn\u2019t complaining even after his team allowed a 17-point lead to turn into a narrow escape.\n\nJalen Reeves-Maybin recovered a fumble deep in Tennessee territory with 32 seconds remaining Saturday to preserve the Volunteers\u2019 27-24 triumph over South Carolina. Aaron Medley\u2019s 27-yard field goal with 9:14 left broke a 24-all tie after Tennessee squandered a 17-0 advantage to continue a season-long pattern.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to apologize for winning,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis is a hard-fought game. We\u2019re playing a good football team. I give South Carolina all the credit in the world. \u2026 They\u2019re going to have success. We\u2019re still building. I\u2019m proud of our players. I\u2019m proud of our program. We need to start being positive around here.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina (3-6, 1-6 SEC) was seeking a game-tying or game-winning score when Jerell Adams caught a pass inside the Tennessee 35 and started spinning away from defenders as he headed into the red zone. Adams was trying to gain extra yardage when Malik Foreman knocked the ball out of his left arm.\n\nReeves-Maybin recovered at the Tennessee 13 to seal the victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got that confidence now,\u201d Reeves-Maybin said. \u201cWhoever has to make the play is going to find a way to get it done and not let anybody in the end zone. In crunch time like that, we\u2019re not playing on our heels at all. Everyone\u2019s looking to make big plays.\u201d\n\nThe frantic finish was fitting for an annual series whose last four games have been decided by a total of 11 points.\n\nSouth Carolina won 38-35 in 2012 after Tennessee fumbled in the red zone with just over a minute left. Tennessee won 23-21 in 2013 on a field goal as time expired and won 45-42 in overtime last year.\n\n\u201cThe guy just came up behind him and punched it out,\u201d South Carolina quarterback Perry Orth said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things. It\u2019s just very, very unfortunate. I feel bad because Jerell\u2019s such a good guy, and he played his tail off tonight.\u201d\n\nThe start of the game certainly didn\u2019t foreshadow a close contest.\n\nTennessee (5-4, 3-3) grabbed a 14-0 lead midway through the first quarter as Alvin Kamara had a 4-yard touchdown run and Joshua Dobbs threw a 37-yard scoring strike to Von Pearson on the Vols\u2019 first two possessions. Pearson finished with eight catches for 121 yards.\n\nThe Vols led 17-0 before South Carolina\u2019s Elliott Fry kicked a 43-yard field goal with 1:03 left in the first half.\n\nOrth rallied the Gamecocks by throwing touchdown passes on three consecutive third-quarter possessions as the Gamecocks capitalized on some creative play calling.\n\nSouth Carolina cut Tennessee\u2019s lead to 17-10 on a 10-yard completion from Orth to Jonathan Walton, a linebacker who hadn\u2019t played offense all season before lining up in the backfield Saturday.\n\nOn South Carolina\u2019s next series, Orth threw a touchdown pass to Adams when the Gamecocks went for the touchdown rather than settling for a field goal on fourth-and-goal from the 7.\n\nSouth Carolina benefited from facing a Tennessee secondary that played most of the game without safety Brian Randolph, who was ejected due to a targeting penalty in the first quarter. Tennessee also played the first half without cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, who was penalized for targeting in the second half of a victory over Kentucky last week.\n\nThe Gamecocks\u2019 comeback continued a troubling trend for Tennessee, which led in each of its four losses this season and was ahead by at least 13 points in three of those defeats.\n\nThis time, Tennessee bounced back after blowing a big lead.\n\n\u201cGood teams find ways to win when they don\u2019t particularly play their best football,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play our best football tonight.\u2019\n\n_____\n\nAP College Football: collegefootball.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tennessee coach Butch Jones wasn't complaining even after his team allowed a 17-point lead to turn into a narrow escape.", "Author": "STEVE MEGARGEE", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tennessee coach Butch Jones wasn\u2019t complaining even after his team allowed a 17-point lead to turn into a narrow escape.", "title": "Late fumble preserves Vols\u2019 27-24 win over South Carolina", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/7/late-fumble-preserves-vols-27-24-win-over-south-ca/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/07/b09965ca36271832870f6a7067008fd1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/07/b09965ca36271832870f6a7067008fd1.jpg", "title": "Late fumble preserves Vols\u2019 27-24 win over South Carolina", "description": "Tennessee coach Butch Jones wasn't complaining even after his team allowed a 17-point lead to turn into a narrow escape.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Jalen Reeves-Maybin recovered a fumble deep in Tennessee territory with 32 seconds remaining Saturday to preserve the Volunteers\u2019 27-24 triumph over South Carolina.\n\u201cThe guy just came up behind him and punched it out,\u201d South Carolina quarterback Perry Orth said.\nI give South Carolina all the credit in the world.\nSouth Carolina won 38-35 in 2012 after Tennessee fumbled in the red zone with just over a minute left.\nThe Vols led 17-0 before South Carolina\u2019s Elliott Fry kicked a 43-yard field goal with 1:03 left in the first half."}
