Delmaro promised her client he could be with the woman he loved, even after the woman died in 2014. Delmaro was arrested for grand larceny by the NYPD in early June.\n\n\u201cAlthough fortune telling is protected by the First Amendment, it does raise a moral question,\u201d said Maher. \u201cA New York detective who was working on the case asked, \u2018Is it O.K. to rob stupid people?\u2019 \u201d\n\nCelia Mitchell, another NYC psychic who admitted to conning $159,205 out of a client, was arrested on grand larceny charges earlier this year. Sylvia Mitchell, a different psychic scammer, is serving 15 years in prison for grand larceny charges.\n\nMaher ended the show by drawing a connection between the GOP and psychic con-artists.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m not saying Republicans are like psychics, because psychics are right sometimes,\u201d Maher joked. \u201cWhereas trickle-down economics has never been right. Yet, Republican voters keep buying into it, even though that girlfriend has been dead since the 80s.\u201d\n\nMaher pointed out that former Vice President Dick Cheney predicted a disastrous outcome for President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran Deal. Maher noted a different prediction from 2007, where Cheney told the Guardian, \u201cThere is no doubt Saddam has weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nMaher mockingly pulled out a bag of fortune cookies, arguing the press should consider the Chinese cookies more credible than Cheney.\n\nMaher then went on to list other Republican predictions that turned out false.\n\n\u201cIf President Obama is reelected you will not be able to get a job,\u201d said former Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2011. Today, unemployment is lower than it was under President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201c\u2026 when Obamacare takes effect in 2014 expect it [unemployment] to go even higher,\u201d tweeted Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2011, proving another poor prediction of today\u2019s low unemployment rates.\n\nMaher then pointed out other ill-fated predictions, from politicians Sarah Palin, who said there\u2019d be Obamacare death panels, Rand Paul, who said Obamacare would \u201cbankrupt the states,\u201d or John Boehner\u2019s prediction that Obamacare would \u201cbankrupt the nation.\u201d\n\n[Image via HBO screengrab]", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Friday's Real Time, Bill Maher compared psychics to organized religion and the GOP during his new rules segment. \"If authorities in New York are going to", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "On Friday\u2019s Real Time, Bill Maher compared psychics to organized religion and the GOP during his new rules segment. \u201cIf authorities in New York are going to", "title": "Bill Maher Compares Religion And The GOP To Psychics", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2433591/bill-maher-compares-religion-and-the-gop-to-psychics/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bill-Maher-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T04:13:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-20T08:55:23+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bill-Maher-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-09-20T04:13:29+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bill maher,real time,maher,gop,psychics,psychic,republicans,sarah palin,mitt romney,donald trump,dick cheney,rand paul,john boehner,media industry", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bill-Maher-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "On Friday\u2019s Real Time, Bill Maher compared psychics to organized religion and the GOP during his new rules segment. \u201cIf authorities in New York are going to"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf10\"", "article_summary": "On Friday\u2019s Real Time, Bill Maher compared psychics to organized religion and the GOP during his new rules segment.\n\u201cNow I\u2019m not saying Republicans are like psychics, because psychics are right sometimes,\u201d Maher joked.\nMaher referred to a New York Times report on an unnamed man who was scammed out of $713,975 by New York City psychic Priscilla Kelly Delmaro.\nMaher ended the show by drawing a connection between the GOP and psychic con-artists.\n\u201cAlthough fortune telling is protected by the First Amendment, it does raise a moral question,\u201d said Maher."}
