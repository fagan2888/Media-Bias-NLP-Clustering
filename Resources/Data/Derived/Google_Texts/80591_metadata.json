Capstone Executive Director Hal Cohen explained: \u201cThe new name better reflects the breadth and diversity of the services we provide and our mission to end poverty and strengthen communities statewide.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was made at a community block party at the new Capstone campus in downtown Barre celebrating the organization\u2019s new name and successful completion of a multi-year capital campaign. Cohen was joined by US Senator Patrick Leahy, Secretary of Administration Jeb Spaulding, Lt. Governor Phil Scott, Barre Mayor Thom Lauzon, State Senators Bill Doyle and Anthony Pollina and Representative Francis \u201cTopper\u201d McFaun.\n\n\u201cWe have been part of the Vermont landscape for half a century fighting the \u2018War on Poverty\u2019 and our new name, new logo and new building will help us reach out and connect with Vermonters and the people we serve,\u201d Cohen explained. \u201cCapstone serves more than just Central Vermont and like other community action agencies, we support communities throughout the state through our various partnerships and programs.\u201d\n\nCapstone serves a total of 47 towns in Lamoille, Orange and Washington Counties and an additional nine towns in adjacent counties. The agency also operates statewide and multi-regional initiatives that extend beyond Central Vermont.\n\n\u201cThe Central Vermont Community Action Council has long been committed to offering program participants a solid foundation for family and career success, and to alleviating poverty. I know that Capstone Community Action will continue this dedicated service to Vermonters in need,\u201d said US Senator Patrick Leahy.\n\nCapstone serves more than 18,000 Vermonters per year through its weatherization, comprehensive child and family services, education, home heating fuel, housing, financial literacy, nutrition, transportation and emergency food programs.\n\n\u201cBuilding on a strong foundation, Capstone Community Action and its partners will provide Vermonters with important resources, training and support, whether it be through affordable housing, workforce training or home heating in the winter,\u201d said Secretary of Administration Jeb Spaulding. \u201cTheir work and partnership will be key to achieving economic prosperity for all Vermonters.\u201d\n\nEvery individual and family Capstone interacts with comes from a unique situation. The goal of every one of Capstone\u2019s 184 staff members is to work together with clients to develop a plan to empower and connect them with the resources they need to prosper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m continually impressed by Capstone\u2019s willingness to think outside the box and find creative ways to better the lives of Vermonters,\u201d said Lt. Governor Phil Scott. \u201cThey are a long-time partner in \u2018Wheels for Warmth,\u2019 our annual tire recycle and resale event that benefits heating assistance, and I look forward to working with them as they develop new ways to help our neighbors.\u201d\n\nThe block party culminated in the dedication of the \u201cdonor wall\u201d which is located in the new Capstone building. The donor wall commemorates the many people both in and outside of Vermont who have made it their priority to fight poverty through supporting the programs Capstone provides throughout the state.\n\n###\n\nAbout Capstone Community Action\n\nFounded in 1965 under the name Central Vermont Community Action Council, Capstone Community Action is part of a nationwide network of community action agencies (CAA) established by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 in order to fight America\u2019s War on Poverty.
