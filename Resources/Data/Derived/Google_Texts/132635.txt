Rapid City, SD

A Rapid City dental specialist says he's running for a seat in the state House of Representatives in the 2016 election.



Republican Richard Mounce is pursuing the west river seat and says he's committed to limiting government and cutting regulations.



Mounce tells the Rapid City Journal that his highest priorities are finding solutions to fund education "responsibly and sensibly" and promoting the area's economy.



Mounce is stressing his Christianity, his conservative principles and experience as a business owner.



District 30 Reps. Lance Russell and Mike Verchio, both Republicans, can't run for re-election to their House seats because of term limits. Bruce Rampelberg serves as the district's senator.



The district includes Custer and Fall River counties and much of Pennington County's land area.
