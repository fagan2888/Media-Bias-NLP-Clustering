If a bank were failing, the holders of that debt could re-capitalize a new company, rather than taxpayers providing those funds. Banks consider the rule crucial to ending the perception that they are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and need government help, but unwinding any global bank will also require international cooperation.\n\nThe Financial Stability Board, a group of global regulators, is coordinating international talks on the debt rule. Mr. van Der Weide said the participants still have gaps in what they believe an appropriate requirement would be, but they want to agree on a proposal by November and finalize it next year. \u201cOur hope is that process proceeds well\u201d and the U.S. implements its own rule soon after, he said.\n\nMr. van Der Weide said the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have been coordinating in developing the minimum debt rule for U.S. banks. He and Arthur Murton, the top FDIC official in charge of the matter, agree on where that level should be set, but there is \u201cmuch more heterogeneity in international conversations,\u201d Mr. van der Weide said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Federal Reserve may wait until 2015 to propose a rule on loss-absorbing bank debt that is considered central to the job of preventing taxpayer-backed bailouts, a senior official said Tuesday.", "title": "Fed\u2019s Long-term Debt Rule May Slip To 2015", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/10/feds-long-term-debt-rule-may-slip-to-2015/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Fed\u2019s Long-term Debt Rule May Slip To 2015", "description": "The Federal Reserve may wait until 2015 to propose a rule on loss-absorbing bank debt that is considered central to the job of preventing taxpayer-backed bailouts, a senior official said Tuesday.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ryan Tracy", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The Federal Reserve may wait until 2015 to propose a rule on loss-absorbing bank debt that is considered central to the job of preventing taxpayer-backed bailouts, a senior official said Tuesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-10T22:25:49-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/10/feds-long-term-debt-rule-may-slip-to-2015/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-22450", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Federal Reserve may wait until 2015 to propose a rule on loss-absorbing bank debt that is considered central to the job of preventing taxpayer-backed bailouts, a senior official said Tuesday.", "title": "Fed\u2019s Long-term Debt Rule May Slip To 2015", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/10/feds-long-term-debt-rule-may-slip-to-2015/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-22450", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-10T22:26:20-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceeb4\"", "article_summary": "Mr. van Der Weide said the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have been coordinating in developing the minimum debt rule for U.S. banks.\nThe Financial Stability Board, a group of global regulators, is coordinating international talks on the debt rule.\nWASHINGTON\u2013The Federal Reserve may wait until 2015 to propose a rule on loss-absorbing bank debt that is considered central to the job of preventing taxpayer-backed bailouts, a senior official said Tuesday.\nThe \u201cfirst best outcome\u201d is international consensus on a rule \u201cthat creates a level playing field and maximum confidence,\u201d Mr. van Der Weide said.\nThe rule in question would force bank holding companies to issue a minimum amount of long-term debt."}
