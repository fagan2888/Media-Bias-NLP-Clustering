The two Camp Pendleton-based Marines killed Friday when their 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing UH-1Y Huey helicopter crashed have been identified as Capt. Elizabeth Kealey, 32, and 1st Lt. Adam Satterfield, 25.

Both Marines were assigned to Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron (HMLA) 169.

Kealey, known as Betsy, was from the town of Indiana, Pa. According to a news release from the 3rd MAW, she commissioned in the Marine Corps May 27, 2005:

She served within HMLA-169 as a UH-1Y Huey helicopter pilot and weapons training instructor. Kealey deployed twice with the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit and once in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Satterfield grew up in Crestwood, Ky., according to his Facebook page. He commissioned in the Marine Corps June 20, 2011:

He served within HMLA-169 as a UH-1Y helicopter pilot and supported Marine Air-Ground Task Force training operations in the Southern California area.

Lt. Col. James M. Isaacs, commanding officer of HMLA-169, released a statement that read, in part:

“Capt. Kealey and 1st Lt. Satterfield were both outstanding Marine Corps officers and talented helicopter pilots. I was fortunate to have the distinct honor of serving as their commanding officer.”

As Home Post reported Saturday, the crash took place at approximately 4:40 p.m. on Friday during routine flight operations aboard Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms.

An investigation into the cause of the crash is underway.
