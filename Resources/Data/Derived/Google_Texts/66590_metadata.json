The siblings are disabled and have not been able to pay for repairs since their parents both died within seven months of each other in 2008. To make matters worse, the parents\u2019 hospice worker stole the family's life savings.\n\n\u201cI mean literally every dime that these people had, so what Josh and Rosalyn have is what Josh makes at work,\u201d Stewart said.\n\n\u201cWe do as much as we can, do what we can,\u201d Tran told News 9.\n\nThe front door they had on the home was too small.\n\n\u201cIt was like a bedroom door on the front door and it had a gap probably that big underneath it where wind and snow and everything blew in it,\u201d Stewart explained.\n\nThen someone broke in and stole their TVs.\n\nSo when so much has been taken from the Trans, the Central Oklahoma Habitat for Humanity's Critical Repair Program is happy to be giving them a safer home.\n\nThe Critical Repair Program helps low-income homeowners who have limitations and can\u2019t maintain their homes.\n\n\u201cThere are many houses in disrepair like this and what happens to these people is then they can't meet city codes or they're cited for things and then fined and then they don't have the money to pay the fines,\u201d said Ann Felton Gilliland, the Central Oklahoma Habitat CEO and Chairman.\n\nThe siblings now have heat and repairs are underway to the roof, exterior doors, flooring, plumbing and painting.\n\n\u201cHe and his sister will have a nice home to live in and a safe home,\u201d Stewart beamed. \u201cI just want the best for these two kids,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThey're doing a great job, keep it up and thank you,\u201d Tran said.\n\nOn Saturday, dozens of volunteers are finishing the Tran\u2019s renovation. However, the siblings still need a lot of help not covered by the project. All monetary donations made to the Critical Home Repair program go directly to the cost of materials and any contract labor necessary to repair and revitalize eligible homes.\n\nTo make a donation, go to cohfh.org, and note \u201cCritical Home Repair\u201d in the comments section of the donation form.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Josh and Rosalyn Tran lost both of their parents within seven months of each other back in 2008.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31328702/central-oklahoma-habitat-for-humanity-steps-in-to-help-disabled-siblings", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9978871_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Josh and Rosalyn Tran lost both of their parents within seven months of each other back in 2008.", "title": "Critical Home Repair Program Restores Home For Metro Disabled Siblings"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9978871_G.jpg", "description": "Josh and Rosalyn Tran lost both of their parents within seven months of each other back in 2008.", "card": "summary", "title": "Critical Home Repair Program Restores Home For Metro Disabled Siblings"}, "wnreadableurl": "central-oklahoma-habitat-for-humanity-steps-in-to-help-disabled-siblings", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/02/26", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS27", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "The Critical Repair Program helps low-income homeowners who have limitations and can\u2019t maintain their homes.\nAll monetary donations made to the Critical Home Repair program go directly to the cost of materials and any contract labor necessary to repair and revitalize eligible homes.\nSo when so much has been taken from the Trans, the Central Oklahoma Habitat for Humanity's Critical Repair Program is happy to be giving them a safer home.\nThe sound of repairs to his dilapidated house has Josh Tran more excited than he has been in a long time.\nTo make a donation, go to cohfh.org, and note \u201cCritical Home Repair\u201d in the comments section of the donation form."}
