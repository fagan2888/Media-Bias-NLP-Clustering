(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Hobby Lobby decision has thrust a once little-known boutique law firm into the center of a growing conservative movement to make faith-based exemptions as potent a legal tool as free speech has been for liberals.\n\nThe tiny Becket Fund for Religious Liberty was the legal power behind the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last month to extend religious rights to corporations for the first time. Before that, the Washington firm\u2019s attorneys successfully defended a church school\u2019s right to be exempted from federal anti-discrimination rules and, in another case, persuaded the progressive U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to keep \u201cunder God\u201d in school recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nWith just a dozen full-time attorneys, the firm, after a string of Supreme Court successes, is earning a reputation in legal circles as a powerhouse, though its leaders play down talk about the firm\u2019s growing influence.\n\n\u201cWe had a good laugh,\u201d said Kristina Arriaga, the firm\u2019s executive director, when asked about the nationwide attention that followed the Supreme Court\u2019s June 30 Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of false modesty, however, since the fund also prides itself on being highly selective about the kinds of cases it accepts, looking for appellate-level lawsuits that have the ability to change legal precedents.\n\n\u201cWe defend religious liberty as a principle, in and of itself,\u201d Arriaga said. \u201cWe believe religious liberty is not about who God is. It\u2019s about who we are.\u201d\n\nIn the Hobby Lobby decision, the justices ruled that the religious owners of the chain of craft stores do not have to provide full contraceptive coverage for female workers as required under the Affordable Care Act. In her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the decision carried \u201cstartling breadth\u201d and would open the door for other religious-minded businesses to seek exemptions from federal laws.\n\nThe Becket Fund played a key role in the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous 2012 decision that gave broader powers to churches and religious schools to circumvent federal anti-discrimination laws. Becket successfully defended a Michigan church school that fired a teacher after she claimed she was discriminated against because of her narcolepsy.\n\n\u201cThey are smart, they are hardworking, and they are prepared,\u201d said Ira Lupu, law professor emeritus at George Washington University. \u201cAnd they win.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s legal work is always free of charge, funded by about $5 million last year from donors and grants, according to tax records. Of the 170 cases it has taken since it opened in 1994, the firm boasts an 87 percent success rate.\n\nCompare that with Alliance Defending Freedom, another religious-liberty law firm started in 1994, which took in nearly $40 million last year, has 44 in-house attorneys and delivered an 80 percent success rate.\n\nBecket founder Kevin \u201cSeamus\u201d Hasson, who stepped down as president in 2011 because of Parkinson\u2019s disease, has said he created the fund in response to a \u201cculture war\u201d in the United States, hoping to preserve religious rights from what he saw as a half-century-long assault by the secular movement.\n\nThe fund insists it represents all denominations, from \u201cA to Z, from Anglicans to Zoroastrians.\u201d It once defended a Texas Santeria priest who wanted to sacrifice goats at home. This fall the firm heads back to the Supreme Court to represent a Muslim inmate prevented by prison rules from growing a beard in keeping with his faith.\n\n\u201cWe need to defend the rights of other people who believe in something \u2014 even if we think they believe in the wrong thing,\u201d Hasson said in a 2012 Heritage Foundation speech. \u201cIn so doing, we are sticking up for all believers against the nihilists. We are standing tall for those who are convinced there is a truth, against those who are opposed to the very idea of anybody making truth claims in public.\u201d\n\nBut critics say that in recent years, Becket has turned its focus toward representing Christians and the religious right.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve become more ideologically conservative,\u201d said the Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a Washington-based advocacy group. \u201cWhere they have ended up today is a point far to the right of the political mainstream.\u201d\n\nYears ago, the fund focused on cases that would have aided all religions, such as land-use and zoning disputes that several religious groups said prevented them from practicing their faith, according to Robert Tuttle, professor of law and religion at George Washington University. Today the firm\u2019s work appears more political, more conservative and more Christian, Tuttle said.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled in May that city councils may start public meetings with Christian prayers, many religious-liberty groups criticized the ruling, warning it would favor Christianity over other religions. Becket heralded the decision as a \u201cgreat victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a consistent view of religious liberty,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember Becket 15 years ago playing up the culture wars fight, and now it\u2019s a big part of their appeal.\u201d\n\nThe representation of Christians opposed to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage mandate is another example, critics say. The firm has eight open cases that seek exemptions, including Illinois-based Wheaton College and Colorado\u2019s Little Sisters of the Poor, which won temporary injunctions from the high court.\n\nHasson, a Catholic and former church-state adviser in the Reagan-era Justice Department, was replaced as president by William Mumma, who, at Hasson\u2019s request, left a 30-year career as a Wall Street executive to head the firm.\n\nArriaga said Becket has almost doubled its staff and attracted more donors under Mumma\u2019s leadership, but she disputed the notion that the firm has altered its approach, saying it merely reflects the shift in the kinds of religious liberty lawsuits being filed. She said that government efforts to legislate sensitive issues such as contraception and same-sex marriage were fueling Becket\u2019s caseload.\n\n\u201cWe find there has been an aggressive push from the government to become the sole arbiter of morality, which is not good for the country,\u201d Arriaga said. \u201cRegrettably, religious liberty work has augmented exponentially.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Hobby Lobby, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Supreme Court, religious law firms", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Becket Fund for Religious Liberty gaining reputation as a powerhouse", "title": "Spoils of victory go to tiny firm in Hobby Lobby case", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/becket-fund-law-firm-gaining-a-reputation-as-powerhouse-after-hobby-lobby-win/2014/07/20/c28931a4-104c-11e4-8936-26932bcfd6ed_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/20/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court_Birth_Control-048d3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Becket Fund for Religious Liberty gaining reputation as a powerhouse", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/becket-fund-law-firm-gaining-a-reputation-as-powerhouse-after-hobby-lobby-win/2014/07/20/c28931a4-104c-11e4-8936-26932bcfd6ed_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Hobby Lobby, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Supreme Court, religious law firms", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "c28931a4-104c-11e4-8936-26932bcfd6ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd035e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe defend religious liberty as a principle, in and of itself,\u201d Arriaga said.\nThe tiny Becket Fund for Religious Liberty was the legal power behind the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last month to extend religious rights to corporations for the first time.\n\u201cWe believe religious liberty is not about who God is.\n\u201cAnd they win.\u201dThe firm\u2019s legal work is always free of charge, funded by about $5 million last year from donors and grants, according to tax records.\nBecket heralded the decision as a \u201cgreat victory.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a consistent view of religious liberty,\u201d Tuttle said."}
