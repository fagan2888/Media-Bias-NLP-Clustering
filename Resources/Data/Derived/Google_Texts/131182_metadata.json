Gives you a three-day weekend, sure, and that\u2019s great \u2014 no one\u2019s turning that down. But then you realize, oh, crap, this will be the last three-day weekend for months and also summer is over, and with it, fun and a general sense of relaxation. And warmth. It\u2019s going to be winter soon and you\u2019ll be depressed and fat and working all the time. Oh well, worry about that later. Labor Day!\n\nWhat does one do on Labor Day, a day in which Americans traditionally honor the herculean efforts and cracking discipline of business owners and bosses over the years? You get up, pray to your boss for the noblesse oblige of bestowing upon you some lousy piece of underemployment, and then do the same damn thing you always do on summer holidays: go to a barbecue with your weird, politically diverse extended family.\n\nAgain: The best thing to do in a politically diverse family is to never talk about politics. Talking about politics is not fun. Who enjoys it? Nobody. Much better to stick to chatter over summer blockbuster motion pictures or the Major League Baseball standings or Internet memes. But somehow, in these hypercharged Modern Times, almost anything can funnel into a political bitchfest. If you\u2019re talking about summer movies, and you\u2019re mentioning how you liked, say, \u201cCaptain America 2,\u201d someone in the family might say, \u201cSpeaking of America \u2026\u201d You\u2019re off to the races, there\u2019s no turning back. Your beloved Tea Party uncle would like to list some grievances.\n\nGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLFFFFFFFFF!!!!!\n\nYour Tea Party uncle here is referring to the well-reported and analyzed fact that President Obama enjoys playing golf. Some would say it\u2019s his favorite hobby and means of getting away from the grind for a few hours. Your uncle, however, believes that President Obama literally lives on the seventh hole of a golf course on Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2014 not just in a house lining the fairway of the hole, but in a big tent, set up on the green. Can you believe that Obummer has stopped being president and now lives in a big tent on the seventh hole of a golf course? This is what the chain email from World Net Daily said, right under the ads for cheap dietary penis supplements and gold bullion and crank-wheel manual flashlights for the post-EMP apocalyptic hellscape.\n\nJust kindly mention that Barack Obama still does live in the White House and still does spend his time being president \u2014 although this won\u2019t go over well either, for a whole other set of reasons. Note that Obama went on a two-week vacation during August on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and while on vacation, he played golf frequently. Now that he\u2019s back from vacation, he will play fewer rounds of golf \u2014 maybe one round during the weekends, until it gets cold. This roughly corresponds to typical leisure patterns: a lot of it during vacations, and otherwise, a little bit on the weekends.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No one enjoys a political debate while eating hot dogs.
