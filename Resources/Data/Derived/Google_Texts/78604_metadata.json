Over the past couple of weeks the man who was supposed to be the front-runner has made a series of attacks on the man who is. Strange to say, however, Mr. Bush hasn\u2019t focused on what\u2019s truly vicious and absurd \u2014 viciously absurd? \u2014 about Mr. Trump\u2019s platform, his implicit racism and his insistence that he would somehow round up 11 million undocumented immigrants and remove them from our soil.\n\nInstead, Mr. Bush has chosen to attack Mr. Trump as a false conservative, a proposition that is supposedly demonstrated by his deviations from current Republican economic orthodoxy: his willingness to raise taxes on the rich, his positive words about universal health care. And that tells you a lot about the dire state of the G.O.P. For the issues the Bush campaign is using to attack its unexpected nemesis are precisely the issues on which Mr. Trump happens to be right, and the Republican establishment has been proved utterly wrong.\n\nTo see what I mean, consider what was at stake in the last presidential election, and how things turned out after Mitt Romney lost.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Romney accused President Obama of favoring redistribution of income from the rich to the poor, and the truth is that Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election did mean a significant move in that direction. Taxes on the top 1 percent went up substantially in 2013, both because some of the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire and because new taxes associated with Obamacare kicked in. And Obamacare itself, which provides a lot of aid to lower-income families, went into full effect at the beginning of 2014.\n\nConservatives were very clear about what would happen as a result. Raising taxes on \u201cjob creators,\u201d they insisted, would destroy incentives. And they were absolutely certain that the Affordable Care Act would be a \u201cjob killer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo what actually happened? As of last month, the U.S. unemployment rate, which was 7.8 percent when Mr. Obama took office, had fallen to 5.1 percent. For the record, Mr. Romney promised during the campaign that he would get unemployment down to 6 percent by the end of 2016. Also for the record, the current unemployment rate is lower than it ever got under Ronald Reagan. And the main reason unemployment has fallen so much is job growth in the private sector, which has added more than seven million workers since the end of 2012.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that everything is great in the U.S. economy, because it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s good reason to believe that we\u2019re still a substantial distance from full employment, and while the number of jobs has grown a lot, wages haven\u2019t. But the economy has nonetheless done far better than should have been possible if conservative orthodoxy had any truth to it. And now Mr. Trump is being accused of heresy for not accepting that failed orthodoxy?\n\nSo am I saying that Mr. Trump is better and more serious than he\u2019s given credit for being? Not at all \u2014 he is exactly the ignorant blowhard he seems to be. It\u2019s when it comes to his rivals that appearances can be deceiving. Some of them may come across as reasonable and thoughtful, but in reality they are anything but.\n\nMr. Bush, in particular, may pose as a reasonable, thoughtful type \u2014 credulous reporters even describe him as a policy wonk \u2014 but his actual economic platform, which relies on the magic of tax cuts to deliver a doubling of America\u2019s growth rate, is pure supply-side voodoo.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting: all indications are that Mr. Bush\u2019s attacks on Mr. Trump are falling flat, because the Republican base doesn\u2019t actually share the Republican establishment\u2019s economic delusions.\n\nThe thing is, we didn\u2019t really know that until Mr. Trump came along. The influence of big-money donors meant that nobody could make a serious play for the G.O.P. nomination without pledging allegiance to supply-side doctrine, and this allowed the establishment to imagine that ordinary voters shared its antipopulist creed. Indeed, Mr. Bush\u2019s hapless attempt at a takedown suggests that his political team still doesn\u2019t get it, and thinks that pointing out The Donald\u2019s heresies will be enough to doom his campaign.\n\nBut Mr. Trump, who is self-financing, didn\u2019t need to genuflect to the big money, and it turns out that the base doesn\u2019t mind his heresies. This is a real revelation, which may have a lasting impact on our politics.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not making a case for Mr. Trump. There are lots of other politicians out there who also refuse to buy into right-wing economic nonsense, but who do so without proposing to scour the countryside in search of immigrants to deport, or to rip up our international economic agreements and start a trade war. The point, however, is that none of these reasonable politicians is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150907032004, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush\u2019s attacks on the G.O.P. front-runner are on issues where the Republican voting base and the party\u2019s rich donors diverge.", "title": "Trump Is Right on Economics", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/opinion/paul-krugman-trump-is-right-on-economics.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003890841"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "PaulKrugman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/opinion/paul-krugman-trump-is-right-on-economics.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003890841", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/opinion/paul-krugman-trump-is-right-on-economics.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 7, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Bush  Jeb,Trump  Donald J,Presidential Election of 2016,Taxation,United States Economy,Republican Party,Federal Taxes (US),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),United States Politics and Government", "news_keywords": "Tax", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Trump, Donald J", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Jeb Bush\u2019s attacks on the G.O.P. front-runner are on issues where the Republican voting base and the party\u2019s rich donors diverge.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "description": "Jeb Bush\u2019s attacks on the G.O.P. front-runner are on issues where the Republican voting base and the party\u2019s rich donors diverge.", "CN": "paul-krugman", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 7, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-11-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2015-09-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "07krugman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151117040002, "hdl_p": "Trump Is Right", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/opinion/paul-krugman-trump-is-right-on-economics.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Jeb Bush\u2019s attacks on the G.O.P. front-runner are on issues where the Republican voting base and the party\u2019s rich donors diverge.", "title": "Trump Is Right on Economics"}, "pdate": 20150907, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003890841, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Trump Is Right on Economics", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "So am I saying that Mr. Trump is better and more serious than he\u2019s given credit for being?\nAnd now Mr. Trump is being accused of heresy for not accepting that failed orthodoxy?\nBut Mr. Trump, who is self-financing, didn\u2019t need to genuflect to the big money, and it turns out that the base doesn\u2019t mind his heresies.\nThe thing is, we didn\u2019t really know that until Mr. Trump came along.\nAgain, I\u2019m not making a case for Mr. Trump."}
