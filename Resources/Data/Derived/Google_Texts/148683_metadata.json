The Reserve at Ten Mile Creek will actually give you two Winter Park season passes with either condo; family passes for Ski Granby Ranch along with 16 extra day-passes for your cousins/guests are already included with your membership in Granby Ranch\u2019s club.\n\n\u201cThese amenities at Granby Ranch are such a win for families,\u201d says Roger Brown with Adair Group, who launched Ten-Mile Creek at Granby Ranch six years ago, and is now seeing resort buyers returning to the market, often qualified to buy more expensive Winter Park properties, but opting for these modest prices at The Reserve instead. \u201cGranby Ranch isn\u2019t a-la-carte like Vail or Aspen. You buy into those places and the first thing you have to do is figure out how to join the pool, how to join the golf course,\u201d he adds. \u201cAt Granby Ranch, our families are watching their kids ski, or they\u2019re golfing or biking, and dad doesn\u2019t have to pull his wallet out every five minutes.\u201d\n\nAfter strong sales last summer (these are the only two units left) Brown is making plans for his next building \u2013 but those homes are going to be priced well higher than this, he says; and they won\u2019t be open in time to ski this year. \u201cWhy not start having all of that fun right now, for $50,000 less than you\u2019d be paying then?\u201d Houston asks.\n\nThose two homes show lots of quality you\u2019d expect from something much more expensive \u2013 fireplace, pendant lighting \u2014 ready for your move right away (Ten Mile Creek will throw in $5,000 toward custom touches to help you create a warm, inviting scene for holiday guests). That\u2019s on top of Granby Ranch\u2019s amenities: 5,000 acres of trails and back country, a fishing reserve on the Fraser River, the family hangout at Granby Ranch Grill; four foursomes on 18-hole Golf Granby Ranch, a the new \u2018Ranch\u2019 swim club. Houston (970-557-3022) will show you the mountain-modern styling of those roomy homes, 90 minutes west of Denver. Take I-70 west past Idaho Springs to U.S. 40 and continue west, past the town of Winter Park; another 15 miles to a right at Village Road; or visit Facebook/Lodgeat1OMileCreek or 10milecreek.com.\n\nReserve at Ten Mile Creek, Granby Ranch; two new 2-bed resort condos ready now, Ski Granby Ranch family-style ski mountain, other year-round amenities, golf, trails, spa, river fishing; two season passes Winter Park with each home. 150 Village Rd. Granby; take U.S. 40 over Berthoud Pass, past Winter Park, 15 more miles to Village Rd (entrance to Granby Ranch); right 1 blk.\n\nTwo 2-bedroom condos ready now from $179,000\n\nToday & daily 10-5\n\n970-557-3022\n\nLodgeAt10MileCreek\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him atmark@samuelsonassoc.com.
