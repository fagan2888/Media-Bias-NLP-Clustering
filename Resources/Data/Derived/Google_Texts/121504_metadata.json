Rumor has it that there may not be a budget before then. Why? The poison pills known in Washington as \u201cpolicy riders.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Senate narrowly passed a budget that would have defunded Planned Parenthood and repealed the Affordable Care Act. Could such a budget pass? Not without enough votes to overcome a presidential veto. But the battle for this year\u2019s budget is going strong, with a series of dangerous \u2013 and extreme \u2013 policy \u201criders\u201d under consideration. These contentious policy changes have no place in the budget bill.\n\nHere are 5 battlegrounds where special interests are pushing for major policy changes through the budget:\n\n1. Syrian refugees\n\nFrom blocking entry by all Syrian refugees to making the process even more onerous (it already takes 18 months to 2 years), these riders would deny safe harbor to desperate Syrian refugees who are mostly women and children.\n\n2. Planned Parenthood\n\nThought this battle was over? Not so fast. While the previous budget deal was supposed to have ended this fight for this year, there are still calls to defund the health care agency that helps 2.7 million women, men and teens each year.\n\n3. Bank regulation\n\nBarely five years out from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, some lawmakers have already forgotten the fast and loose financial games played by big banks that got us into the mess in the first place. These lawmakers want to gut the Dodd-Frank reform that set a floor for more responsible banking practices. Santa shouldn\u2019t bring Wall Street this piece of anti-reform this year.\n\n4. Tax breaks\n\nFrom benefits for corporations that shift profits overseas, to those that allow corporations benefits for past equipment purchases, a special group of tax breaks known as \u201ctax extenders\u201d may be extended by attaching them to the budget. The budget shouldn\u2019t become a vehicle for bad tax policy.\n\n5. Worker protections\n\nOvertime pay, retirement contributions and more could be subject to relaxed rules and enforcement if this bad-news family of policy riders make their way into the budget.\n\nTell Congress that America needs a clean budget bill with no poison pills!
