It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA\u201d -- a group favoring sex between men and boys -- \u201cbe they people who believe in bestiality -- it doesn't matter what they are, they don't get to change the definition,\" he said during a 2013 interview with Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity.\n\nCarson said Thursday that critics had twisted his words to say that he equated same-sex marriage with pedophilia and bestiality.\n\n\u201cI never said that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that by any stretch of the imagination. \u201c\n\nHe said he believes two consenting adults ought to be free to do anything they want -- including obtaining legal recognition of their partnership -- but he does not believe the definition of marriage ought to be changed.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t get to call it marriage. They don\u2019t get to change the definition of marriage,\u201d he said, to growing applause. \u201cIf you do it for one, you\u2019ve got to do it for the next one that comes along and the next one that comes along, and pretty soon, it has no meaning. So I don\u2019t have any problem with gay people, no problem whatsoever, but I don\u2019t think anybody gets to change things for everybody else.\u201d\n\nOn another topic popular with the crowd, Carson heralded health savings accounts and comparison shopping by patients as a better solution to improving healthcare than Obamacare, which he has cast as a step on the path to socialism.\n\nCarson repeatedly accused reporters of twisting his words to fit a narrative that he is unfit for the presidency.\n\n\u201cI mean they are just so ridiculous,\u201d he said, to applause from hundreds of national Republican leaders gathered for a retreat in Coronado, Calif.\n\n\u201cThey say Carson\u2019s insignificant, don\u2019t worry about him,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWhy do they spend so much ink talking about me if they\u2019re not worried about me?\u201d\n\nBut, as he has before, he confirmed that reports he had plagiarized sections of a book were accurate.\n\n\"There were some mistakes made there,\u201d he said of the book. \u201cWe happened to miss a couple.\"\n\nCarson spoke at a luncheon on the second day of the Republican National Committee\u2019s winter meeting. A popular speaker -- his switch from the Democratic Party to the GOP is an integral part of his pitch -- was greeted with a standing ovation and people swarming him for pictures after his remarks.\n\nHe is particularly popular among party conservatives; a movement to draft him to run for president has raised $12 million, according to the New York Times. And he has volunteer leaders in all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, a show of strength that no other potential presidential candidate yet can claim in the state that holds the first nominating contest in the nation.\n\nCarson, who is African American, has never held elected office, but gained note challenging President Obama on his signature healthcare law.\n\nAn absence of political experience has dogged prior candidates, such as businessman Herman Cain, who made a temporary splash in 2012 before stumbling. But Carson tried to use his history as a strength.\n\n\u201cI will confess, I do not have experience in certain things, like empowering special interest groups and growing the government and wasting taxpayers\u2019 money and dishonoring our military and disrespecting our allies and lying to the people and submitting to the P.C. people,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no experience in that and I hope to never have experience in that.\u201d\n\nCarson said he has seen enthusiastic crowds as he has traveled the country exploring a bid, visiting four or five states a week over the last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many people say, \u2018I\u2019ve never been involved in politics but now I think I\u2019m going to get involved, and if you run, I\u2019m going to volunteer,\u2019 \u201d Carson said.\n\nDuring his remarks, Carson repeatedly warned that too many in the nation were dependent on the government, and he pointed to his life story. He described being raised by a single mother who refused to be a \u201cvictim\u201d despite dire poverty, and who demanded that he study and read.\n\n\u201cThe person who has the most to do with what happens in your life -- it\u2019s you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the environment. It\u2019s not somebody else.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @latseema", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Ben Carson, looking at 2016 presidential race, urges GOP to adhere to beliefs", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon flirting with a run for president in 2016, warned party leaders Thursday that Republicans must avoid being cowed by political correctness, and said he stood by controversial statements about same-sex marriage, Obamacare, the \u201cGestapo\u201d tactics of the federal\u00a0 government and the Veterans Affairs scandal.", "title": "Ben Carson, looking at 2016 presidential race, urges GOP to adhere to beliefs", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-ben-carson-republicans-20150115-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54b84bb0/turbine/la-pn-ben-carson-republicans-20150115", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Republicans, 2016 presidential campaign, Ben Carson", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82545554", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-15", "Description": "Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon flirting with a run for president in 2016, warned party leaders Thursday that Republicans must avoid being cowed by political correctness, and said he stood by controversial statements about same-sex marriage, Obamacare, the \u201cGestapo\u201d tactics of the federal\u00a0...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Republicans, 2016 presidential campaign, Ben Carson"}, "article_summary": "An absence of political experience has dogged prior candidates, such as businessman Herman Cain, who made a temporary splash in 2012 before stumbling.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that by any stretch of the imagination.\nCarson said Thursday that critics had twisted his words to say that he equated same-sex marriage with pedophilia and bestiality.\nCarson, who is African American, has never held elected office, but gained note challenging President Obama on his signature healthcare law.\nCarson contrasted the dedication of the nation\u2019s founders to their cause to that of the Islamic State."}
