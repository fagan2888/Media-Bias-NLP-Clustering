According to the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH), 37,503 Michigan children are currently covered by MiChild.\n\n\u201cThis came out of the blue and at a glance looks pretty benign. But actually it's very significant,\u201d said Dr. Megan Edison, a pediatrician in Wyoming, Michigan. \u201cLow reimbursement rates are really having a negative impact on those in the vulnerable portion of our population. That's why the whole thing with Medicaid expansion is wrong. And it's really too bad because there are things that could be done to improve care for these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quality of care falls off with a lower reimbursement rate,\u201d Edison added. \u201cIt affects the quality of the doctor and the doctor-patient relationship. Most private practices are no longer accepting new Medicaid patients. That means an increasing number of the people on programs like Medicaid, with low reimbursement rates, are going to end up being treated either in the emergency room or at regional clinics. That's not the same as having your own doctor with whom you develop a relationship.\u201d\n\nSen. Bruce Caswell, R-Hillsdale, looked into the situation after being informed of it by Capitol Confidential.\n\nStay Engaged\n\n\u201cThis is connected with the change we [the legislature and Governor] made to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBS) earlier this year that allowed them to convert to a mutual health insurance company,\u201d Caswell said. \u201cAs part of their societal responsibility, Blue Cross has been subsidizing the MiChild program. Now, apparently, that's coming to an end.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's happening is that they (MDCH) are moving these kids to a Medicaid HMO (health maintenance organization),\u201d Caswell continued. \u201cThe change will result in a lower reimbursement rate. Blue Cross will continue to do some subsidizing of the program, so the reimbursement rate will be somewhat higher than the Medicaid rate but lower than the Blue Cross rate.\u201d\n\nThe legislation to which Caswell referred was a two-bill package, Senate Bills 61 and 62), which allowed BCBS to convert to a \u201cmutual insurance company\u201d and make it subject to the same regulations as regular health insurers. The measures were passed by the legislature this past winter and signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder on March 18. Both bills were passed 92-18 by the House and unanimously by the Senate.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the change to the MiChild reimbursement level, MDCH spokesperson Angela Minicuci focused on the fact that the reimbursement rate for those in the MiChild program will still be higher than the rate paid for children covered by Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe are currently in the process of transitioning children in the MIChild program from BCBS into the Medicaid Health Plans,\u201d Minicuci said. \u201cBeginning October 1, the Medicaid Health Plans will receive monthly capitation (rate) payments for these children which are significantly higher than they receive for similar children on Medicaid, though not as high as the BCBS rates. These rate payments will enable Health Plans to reimburse hospitals and other providers at amounts higher than Medicaid rates.\u201d\n\nCapitol Confidential asked Edison if \u2013 due to the impending approach of Obamacare \u2013 people should expect to see continuing reimbursement rate declines in government-provided health care coverage, such as the one taking place with MiChild.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Edison said. \u201cAlmost everything is very much in flux. If you are a doctor, from year to year you don't know if you are going to be paid at the same rate or whether it will be cut. And there doesn't seem to be anything we can do about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a court case in California over reimbursement rates, where the California Medical Association took it to court and it lost,\u201d Edison continued. \u201cBasically, the Obama administration has sent the signal that there are really no restrictions on how low reimbursements can get. Imagine if we did that with bridge cards . . . Imagine if the store didn't know what percentage of a purchase would be covered. No business could operate that way \u2013 but that's what we're doing with our health care system.\u201d\n\nBCBS was contacted and declined to comment.\n\n~~~~~\n\nSee also:\n\nCapCon Medicaid Coverage\n\n~~~~~\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nProposal 1 of 2014: Summary and Assessment\n\nTeaching 'Hard' - Yes, 'Underappreciated' - Maybe, but 'Underpaid' a Stretch\n\nPrison Guard Union Provides Lurid Claims for U-M Anti-Privatization Report\n\nApril 8, 2016 MichiganVotes Weekly Roll Call Report\n\nMedia Covers MEA President\u2019s Public Pension\n\nMEA Gives False Explanation to Members About Why Executive Salaries Rose", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "michild, reimbursement", "og": {"description": "An article on liberty and free markets as sound public policy for Michigan.", "title": "MiChild Reimbursement Rate Being Cut", "url": "http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/19122", "image": "http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/media/images/2013/BCBS.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "stephen.frick1"}, "description": "An article on liberty and free markets as sound public policy for Michigan.", "twitter": {"site": "@MichCapCon", "image": "http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/media/images/2013/BCBS.jpg", "description": "An article on liberty and free markets as sound public policy for Michigan.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MiChild Reimbursement Rate Being Cut"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01f9\"", "article_summary": "According to the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH), 37,503 Michigan children are currently covered by MiChild.\nAnd it's really too bad because there are things that could be done to improve care for these people.\u201d\u201cThe quality of care falls off with a lower reimbursement rate,\u201d Edison added.\n\u201cThe change will result in a lower reimbursement rate.\nWhen asked to comment on the change to the MiChild reimbursement level, MDCH spokesperson Angela Minicuci focused on the fact that the reimbursement rate for those in the MiChild program will still be higher than the rate paid for children covered by Medicaid.\n\u201cWe are currently in the process of transitioning children in the MIChild program from BCBS into the Medicaid Health Plans,\u201d Minicuci said."}
