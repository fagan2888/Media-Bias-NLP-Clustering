WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) today gave a standing ovation to Sen. James Lankford’s (R-Okla.) new report, “Federal Fumbles: 100 Ways the Government Dropped the Ball.”

The report contains 100 examples of wasteful government spending and ridiculous regulations. The penalty flags are thrown at agencies, programs, and projects that consistently throw away taxpayer funds, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation. The report not only provides details about each extravagant expenditure, it also reveals “how to recover the ball” with specific proposals to eliminate the waste.

“Federal Fumbles” includes infamous boondoggles such as the $43 million gas station in Afghanistan and failed Obamacare co-operative plans. The report also tackles solar energy subsidies, funding for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Museum, the study of tobacco use in Russia, media ethics training in India, paying Social Security benefits to the dead, duplicative and overlapping programs, and much more.

CAGW President Tom Schatz said, “With the national debt rushing quickly to $19 trillion, it is clear that wasteful government spending must be eliminated. Sen. Lankford’s report has successfully built on the legacy of his predecessor, Sen. Tom Coburn, who worked for years to bring Washington’s profligate spending habits to public light. Sen. Lankford should be applauded for taking the handoff from Sen. Coburn and moving the ball down the field so that taxpayers can finally score a few touchdowns in the ongoing fight against wasteful spending.”
