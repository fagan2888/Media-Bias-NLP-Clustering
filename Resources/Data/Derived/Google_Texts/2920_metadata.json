One of the most important rules in assessing \u201cgaffes\u201d or outsized statements is that if the moment was extemporaneous, out of character, instantly regretted, and not repeated, then we should give it a pass, because it probably reveals next to nothing about the person who said it.\n\nHaving said that, there\u2019s a new statement we learn about today from Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst that deserves some scrutiny, and Ernst ought to explain it. The Huffington Post has the news:\n\nJoni Ernst, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Iowa, said during an NRA event in 2012 that she would use a gun to defend herself from the government. \u201cI have a beautiful little Smith & Wesson, 9 millimeter, and it goes with me virtually everywhere,\u201d Ernst said at the NRA and Iowa Firearms Coalition Second Amendment Rally in Searsboro, Iowa. \u201cBut I do believe in the right to carry, and I believe in the right to defend myself and my family \u2014 whether it\u2019s from an intruder, or whether it\u2019s from the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important.\u201d\n\nErnst\u2019s defenders would say that she was only talking in general, hypothetical terms, and comparisons to Sharron Angle\u2019s 2010 talk of armed revolt against the government are unfair (I\u2019ll get to the Angle comparison in a moment). And it\u2019s true that Ernst is speaking hypothetically here, when she says of the government \u201cshould they decide that my rights are no longer important.\u201d That\u2019s different from saying that the government has already decided her rights are no longer important or that armed revolt is actually imminent.\n\nAnd there are plenty of examples of federal, state, and local governments trampling on people\u2019s rights, particularly since September 11, that are worthy of debate, discussion, even angry condemnation, whether it\u2019s the monitoring of phone calls, the surveillance of anti-war groups, the widespread \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies that black people in particular are subject to (not something Joni Ernst has to worry about), or the appalling spread of asset forfeiture, under which local police forces and governments just steal innocent people\u2019s money and property.\n\nBut if Ernst is talking about some hypothetical situation in which government\u2019s disregard for her rights may necessitate an armed response it\u2019s fair to ask her: What exactly is it? Is she saying that when law enforcement officers come to arrest her on some trumped-up charge, instead of submitting and fighting the charges in court she\u2019ll shoot those officers? Who else is an appropriate target here? Members of Congress who pass laws taking away her rights? FBI agents? Who?\n\nThe problem with this new quote is that it borders on anti-democratic. I don\u2019t care how many times you praise the Founding Fathers or talk about your love of the Constitution, if you think that the way to resolve policy differences or personal arguments with the government is not just by trying to get different people elected or waging a campaign to change the laws or filing suits in court, but through the use of violence against the government, you have announced that you have no commitment to democracy. In the American system, we don\u2019t say that if the government enacts policies we don\u2019t like, we\u2019ll start killing people. It\u2019s not clear that Ernst meant this, but it\u2019s fair to ask her to explain what she did mean.\n\nSharron Angle said: \u201cThomas Jefferson said it\u2019s good for a country to have a revolution every 20 years. I hope that\u2019s not where we\u2019re going, but you know, if this Congress keeps going the way it is, people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies.\u201d That sounded a lot more like a call for insurrection, based simply on policy differences with Democrats. Ernst\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t amount to that. But it does fetishize guns as a tool for fighting the government.\n\nThe larger context here is that rhetorical suggestions that democratic processes are legitimate only when they produce desired outcomes have become commonplace. That\u2019s one of the things that has changed in America since Barack Obama got elected. Ernst\u2019s defenders may argue that Ernst is only talking about some future hypothetical takeover by a tyrannical government, in which case an armed response might be appropriate. But how many times in the last six years have we heard conservatives \u2014 including well regarded commentators, elected officials, and other people of high standing \u2014 talk about the ordinary processes of democracy in the same terms we used to reserve for military coups and despotic campaigns of repression?\n\nThings like Barack Obama\u2019s two elections, the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and a hundred other government actions are now routinely called \u201ctyranny\u201d and \u201cfascism\u201d by people just like Joni Ernst. Given that recent history, the defense that she\u2019s talking only about some remote scenario out of \u201c1984\u201d or \u201cFahrenheit 451\u2033 is a little hard to believe.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that Ernst didn\u2019t mean her statement to come out sounding the way it did. She may have just been mirroring back to her audience their own beliefs. Ernst should be given the opportunity to elaborate \u2014 and pressed to answer specific questions about when she thinks it\u2019s acceptable for an American citizen to use violence against representatives of the American government. If she answers those questions in a way that demonstrates a commitment to democracy, I\u2019ll be happy to say that her statement to the NRA should be set aside.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Iowa Senate candidate in the raw.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Iowa Senate candidate in the raw.", "title": "The real problem with Joni Ernst\u2019s quote about guns and the government", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/10/23/the-real-problem-with-joni-ernsts-quote-about-guns-and-the-government/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/08/teaparty.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/10/23/the-real-problem-with-joni-ernsts-quote-about-guns-and-the-government/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "joni ernst, iowa senate debate, bruce braley, nra, national rifle association", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "joni ernst, iowa senate debate, bruce braley, nra, national rifle association"}, "article_summary": "Having said that, there\u2019s a new statement we learn about today from Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst that deserves some scrutiny, and Ernst ought to explain it.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that Ernst didn\u2019t mean her statement to come out sounding the way it did.\nThe problem with this new quote is that it borders on anti-democratic.\nErnst\u2019s defenders may argue that Ernst is only talking about some future hypothetical takeover by a tyrannical government, in which case an armed response might be appropriate.\nIn the American system, we don\u2019t say that if the government enacts policies we don\u2019t like, we\u2019ll start killing people."}
