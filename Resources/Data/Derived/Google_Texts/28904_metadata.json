Further, if CoOpportunity Health goes under, a government safety net could protect those left holding their policies. However, the coverage \"may be limited,\" the state warned. And Gerhart is advising that most of the 120,000 CoOpportunity Health policyholders in Iowa and Nebraska \"may find it in their best interests\" to find new carriers by Feb. 15 -- the deadline for open enrollment for 2015 coverage.\n\nCoOpportunity Health will no longer offer its policies through Iowa's online marketplace, either.\n\nFor critics of the law, Wednesday's announcement was more evidence of the ACA's problems.\n\n\"Here in Iowa, we were promised more [choices] and lower premiums, yet now we learn that one of two [companies] responsible for providing affordable insurance can't provide what the law promises,\" Drew Klein, director of the Iowa chapter of the conservative Americans for Prosperity, said.\n\nWith CoOpportunity Health off the exchanges, it leaves plans offered by Coventry Healthcare as the only option for Iowans who qualify for the federal subsidies under the law.\n\nCoventry's parent company, Aetna, said it would work with state and federal regulators \"to do all we can to aid in a solution.\"\n\n\"That solution must be in the best interests of the people in both states and incorporate adequate pricing to ensure sustainability of coverage,\" Aetna said in a statement.\n\nEmployers that have a CoOpportunity Health group insurance plan also have been told to work with brokers to find new coverage.\n\nWhether the confusion in Iowa portends problems elsewhere is unclear.\n\nCoOpportunity Health was one of roughly two-dozen customer-owned cooperatives approved by the federal government under the health law to offer competitive plans in the individual and small-group markets.\n\n\"We do not believe that any other co-ops are facing immediate solvency problems,\" Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told The Des Moines Register.\n\nThe Iowa company, which formed last year, had been promised $146 million from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nThe company was once seen as a new competitor for Iowa's dominant health insurer, Wellmark, that would expand consumer choice and potentially drive down prices. Wellmark has declined to participate in the exchange.\n\nBut the company's finances were a challenge, and they were made worse earlier this month when a provision adopted by Congress reduced the amount of its assets by about $60 million. CMS told the company last week that it would not provide additional funding immediately. The company, which did not oppose the state takeover, expects to receive additional federal risk mitigation payments in the second half of 2015.\n\nThe company is not yet insolvent, but its cash and invested assets dropped to $17.2 million earlier this month, down significantly from weeks earlier, Gerhart's court petition said. CoOpportunity Health is also facing \"extremely high health care utilization\" by its members, Gerhart's office said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata":
