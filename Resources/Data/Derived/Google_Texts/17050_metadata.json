The callers, from all over Washington state, wanted to know how to qualify for health insurance coverage. They had called the right place.\n\nReady to answer their questions, poised at new computers in a new facility in Spokane Valley, was a roomful of workers who\u2019d been training for this moment, for more than a month.\n\nTuesday, Washington\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange launched a multi-pronged initiative to help the uninsured obtain health insurance coverage. The effort is prescribed by the federal Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nWith a payroll of $2 million, the Spokane Valley call center attracted \u201chundreds\u201d of applicants for its 90 jobs, said Anna Van Buren, CEO of Faneuil Inc. Except for 20 temporary workers who were hired to help with the startup rush between now and December, all of the new call center jobs are full-time and came with a full benefits package including health insurance, said Don Albright, call center manager.\n\nFaneuil, based in Virginia, won a contract to operate the facility. Van Buren said she was pleased with the skills of those the center hired. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a personal interest in what they do. They have passion for the people they get to serve.\u201d\n\nThe call center\u2019s role is to answer questions from Washington residents interested in signing up for health insurance. In Washington, more than 800,000 people have no coverage today. Approximately 300,000 will be eligible for Medicaid, a government-funded program which has been expanded to cover everyone up to 138 percent of poverty level. The other 500,000 will be eligible to purchase coverage, in most cases with federal subsidies to reduce the cost.\n\nAll applications for federally assisted coverage \u2013 whether it\u2019s Medicaid or private insurance \u2013 must go through a new Washington state web site, www.wahealthplanfinder.org.\n\nAlthough sales do not begin until Oct. 1, information about how to qualify is available now. In addition to the web site, the state has been preparing several sources of information:\n\n\u2022 The call center, whose toll-free number is 1-855-WAFINDER or 1-855-923-4633.\n\n\u2022 Traditional health insurance brokers, who are being trained by the state to assist people with the new government-run, online insurance buying marketplace. When the state offered training, 1,400 brokers signed up. Classes have been packed and more are being added, said Richard Onizuka, CEO of the state Health Benefit Exchange. Brokers, who tend to work mostly with small-business clients, can get special login accounts for the online insurance marketplace, and can receive commissions from the health insurance plans that their clients purchase.\n\n\u2022 In-person assistance providers. Also known as \u201cnavigators\u201d and required by the Affordable Care Act, these are trained, front-line social workers located all around the state. In most cases they\u2019re paid for the work, by organizations that have won contracts with the state. Within the 14 counties of Eastern Washington, training is under way for 150 of these assistance providers. The Health Plan Finder web site includes information about how to get in touch with a trained assistance provider, and the new toll-free call center can provide referrals to the providers.\n\n\u2022 A separate corps of volunteers is being trained to assist with expanded Medicaid. The state Health Care Authority, which runs Medicaid, offered 24 training seminars around the state. The response, officials said, has been intense. Several classes are full and more are being added. At a packed day-long seminar in Spokane last week, the volunteer trainees came from a range of agencies such as churches, tribes, health districts and medical clinics.\n\nAs part of their training, all of these official assistance providers are required by state and federal rules to undergo criminal background checks, and to learn techniques for protecting the privacy of those they assist. Many, as social workers or employees at medical clinics, for example, already are experienced at working with confidential information and keeping it secure, officials said.\n\nAt the state\u2019s new Spokane Valley call center, supervisors continuously walk the room, monitoring call-takers\u2019 work. Faneuil\u2019s policy requires clutter-free desks to prevent unauthorized note-taking, and the computer system on which employees work is designed so that confidential information is saved to secure electronic database, rather than being printed on pieces of paper.\n\nKristen West Fisher, chair of the board for Better Health Together, was on hand to watch the call center\u2019s opening day. It\u2019s her organization\u2019s job to provide the trained in-person navigators for Eastern Washington. In an interview, she told about a few area residents who in recent months have illustrated the heartache that comes with no health insurance:\n\n\u2022 A construction worker who suffers from epilepsy lost his job, lost his house, had no insurance coverage, could not afford his anti-epilepsy medications, began cutting his pills in half to save money, suffered a severe seizure, was hospitalized, got a big hospital bill he couldn\u2019t pay, lost his apartment and now has become homeless.\n\n\u2022 A veteran diagnosed with stage 3 cancer had difficulty receiving his benefit checks because he was homeless, and by the time social workers discovered his plight and came to his aid all they could do was ensure that when he died, he had a roof over his head.\n\n\u2022 A woman who had received an organ transplant lost her job and with it, her health insurance. She no longer could afford her anti-rejection drugs, so her body began to reject her new organ. When social workers learned of her plight they got her onto emergency medical assistance, a program that will be superseded by the new, more comprehensive expansion of Medicaid. For thousands of uninsured people like this woman, Fisher said, \u201cif you\u2019re sick and scared, it\u2019s hard to know how to get help, and it\u2019s hard to get work.\u201d\n\nFisher said she\u2019s well aware of the continuing controversy in Congress, over the Affordable Care Act. And yet, as she looked across the room of busy call center operators on Tuesday morning, she said: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think this is the right path.\u201d\n\nErin Fluegal, a customer service representative at the call center, said most of the first day\u2019s calls had to do with eligibility: How do I qualify for Medicaid? How do I qualify for subsidized insurance? The new web site includes a calculator to provide answers, based on an applicant\u2019s family size and income. By Oct. 1, it will offer not only eligibility information, it will offer a range of policies that consumers can compare and purchase. When applicants qualify for Medicaid, with all costs paid by the government, they\u2019ll be able to sign up on the site.\n\nFluegal, whose previous job was as a quality analyst for a bank call center, said she felt good about the mission of the new health insurance call center: \u201cIt really is going to help a lot of people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At 7:30 a.m., the switchboard turned on and immediately the phones began to ring.
