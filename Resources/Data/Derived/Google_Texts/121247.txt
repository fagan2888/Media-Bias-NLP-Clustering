In this weekend’s issue of Parade, Dr. Sanjay Gupta opens up about Obamacare, medical marijuana, and what he loves about surgery.

Below, the CNN medical correspondent shares a few of his best stay-healthy tips. Plus, check out our exclusive video for even more tips and a behind-the-scenes glimpse at Parade‘s photo shoot with the good doctor.

1. Treat your doctor as a member of your health team. I think there’s a lot of suspicion of the medical system, but for the most part doctors are actually very interested in their patients’ best welfare. Walk in with the assumption that he or she is on your side and that you have an opportunity to talk with someone who’s going to help you.

2. Don’t try to self-diagnose; this can lead your doctor in the wrong direction. Just describe your symptoms as best you can, in your own words. If you have a pain in your back that’s going down your leg and into your toes, that’s what you should say, not “I think it’s a disc and it’s probably related to my back.”

3. Spend a few minutes ahead of time to prepare a list of your concerns. It might help to run them by a loved one first to see if they match what you’ve been describing. Note any medications you’re taking as well.

4. Remember that you have to actually change your habits and follow through on what your doctor recommends—both with things that are difficult (stopping smoking) and things that are easy (taking medication). Do your part as a health team member and you may avoid needing an invasive procedure.

5. Finally, if you and your doctor are simply not a good match, find another one. I’ve heard people say that switching doctors can be harder than a breakup, but it may also be the right thing to do.
