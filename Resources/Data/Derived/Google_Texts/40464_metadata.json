The comet itself has not been seen since 1861 and won\u2019t be seen again until 2276, Earthsky.com reports.\n\n\u201cBits and pieces shed by this comet litter its orbit and bombard the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere at 110,000 miles per hour,\u201d Earthsky.org says. \u201cThe vaporizing debris streaks the nighttime with medium-fast Lyrid meteors.\u201d\n\nWhile the shower normally generates 10-20 shooting stars per hour, occasionally there are bursts of up to 100 per hour, according to CBS News in San Francisco, which puts its first known viewing back at 2,700 years ago.\n\n\u201cIn ancient China, one observation reported the shower as \u2018falling like rain,' \u201d Chabot Space And Science Center Astronomer Ben Burress told CBS News, \u201cwhich was probably describing an instance of exceptional activity, possibly following the passage of Comet Thatcher and a fresh trail of dust.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re talking back in the time of Confucius, according to Earthsky.org, the year 687 BC. Talk about an infrequent visitor.\n\nWhile the Lyrids are classified as a weak to moderate meteor shower, they could be worth waiting up for, especially given that they are the biggest shower for the first half of the year. Plus, for once moonlight won\u2019t get in the way.\n\n\u201cConditions this year should be nearly ideal,\u201d reports Astronomy.com. \u201cThe waxing crescent Moon sets around midnight local daylight time, leaving the prime viewing hours before dawn Moon-free. The shower\u2019s radiant\u2014the point in the constellation Lyra the Harp from which the meteors appear to emanate\u2014climbs nearly overhead just before morning twilight starts to break. Under a clear, dark sky, observers can expect to see 15 to 20 meteors per hour.\u201d\n\nOf course, one never knows.\n\n\u201cAmerican observers saw an outburst of nearly 100 Lyrid meteors per hour in 1982,\u201d says Earthsky.org. \u201cAround 100 meteors per hour were seen in Greece in 1922 and from Japan in 1945.\u201d\n\nSo wait until late, late at night, find a quiet, extremely dark spot, and lie down to gaze upward on the nights of Tuesday April 21-22 and Wednesday April 22-23, with April 23 being the best night for the shower's brief peak.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lyrid meteors grace the skies on the nights of April 22, Earth Day, and on April 23, during the peak of this remnant of Comet Thatcher.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/21/earth-day-lyrid-meteors-shower-our-mother-heavenly-light-160067", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/meteors-shooting_stars-istock_000023209511.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Earth Day: Lyrid Meteors Shower Our Mother With Heavenly Light [Video]"}, "abstract": "The Lyrid meteors grace the skies on the nights of April 22, Earth Day, and on April 23, during the peak of this remnant of Comet Thatcher, last seen in 687 B.C.", "keywords": "Shooting Stars, Meteor Showers, Meteors, Space, Astronomy", "dc": {"title": "Earth Day: Lyrid Meteors Shower Our Mother With Heavenly Light [Video]"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/21/earth-day-lyrid-meteors-shower-our-mother-heavenly-light-160067", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-21T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Earth Day: Lyrid Meteors Shower Our Mother With Heavenly Light [Video]"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc729\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAmerican observers saw an outburst of nearly 100 Lyrid meteors per hour in 1982,\u201d says Earthsky.org.\nThey are the Lyrid meteors, and they are not just any shooting stars.\nRemnants of Comet Thatcher, the meteors appear as Earth crosses the debris stream in late April each year.\n\u201cBits and pieces shed by this comet litter its orbit and bombard the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere at 110,000 miles per hour,\u201d Earthsky.org says.\nThe comet itself has not been seen since 1861 and won\u2019t be seen again until 2276, Earthsky.com reports."}
