About half of the 25,000 uninsured in the Reid service area are HIP 2.0 eligible.

Reid is planning be special enrollment event 3-6 p.m. Feb. 26 in Lingle Hall at Reid.

Some people already enrolled in marketplace plans are eligible for HIP 2.0 and must change plans.

Significant efforts are underway to enroll area residents who are now eligible for health insurance through Indiana’s newly approved HIP 2.0 plan.

The Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) 2.0, approved last week by the federal government, is designed to insure Hoosiers who have incomes between 100 and 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level.

Of the more than 25,000 people in the Reid Hospital service area who remain uninsured, about half of them are eligible for HIP 2.0, hospital officials said.

Most of those now eligible are working families who previously were ineligible for Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act insurance offered in the Health Insurance Marketplace.

“This is a very important thing for Indiana,” said Reid Hospital president and CEO Craig Kinyon. “We don’t have this gap in the middle anymore.”

Reid and other businesses and organizations are planning special events and making more people available to help area residents sign up for the new plan.

Reid is planning a special enrollment event for 3-6 p.m. Feb. 26 in Lingle Hall at Reid.

Sara Hall, enrollment specialist with Meridian Health Services, was scheduled to answer Affordable Care Act and HIP 2.0 questions from 10 a.m. to noon Wednesday at Morrisson-Reeves Library in Richmond.

“The state has done an awesome job with the HIP 2.0 program. Now that their plan has rolled out, I love it. It’s a great plan,” Hall said. “It will definitely help the people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough money to get a plan on the marketplace. I think it will be a great opportunity to get people in the door and offer them affordable health care.”

“You’ve got to at least investigate this,” Kinyon encourages area residents. “Don’t be constrained by past rejections. Don’t make the assumption that it’s the same as in the past.”

Generally, Hoosiers who qualify for HIP 2.0 are ages 19 to 64 with incomes of $16,297 for an individual, $21,967 for a couple and $33,307 for a family of four.

Jessica Stanton, health insurance agent with VanVleet Insurance in Richmond, said some area residents who have been enrolled in an Affordable Care Act insurance plan through the health marketplace are now eligible for HIP 2.0. If eligible, they must enroll and cannot continue to use their marketplace plan.

“If someone becomes eligible for HIP 2.0 and does not make the conversion from Obamacare to HIP 2.0, they will have to pay all of the tax credits back when they file their taxes,” Stanton said.

The Health Marketplace might not recognize or terminate a person’s coverage automatically, so people need to update their account in the marketplace, according to Indiana’s Family and Social Services Administration. Additionally, enrolling in HIP 2.0 might provide more comprehensive medical coverage than a marketplace plan, such as vision and dental services.

Kinyon said there will be some understandable complications and confusion as area residents enter the enrollment process.

That’s why Reid is arranging numerous sign-up sessions with representatives from ClaimAid, a company that Reid contracts to provide experts who work with customers to enroll them in Medicaid, HIP and HIP 2.0. ClaimAid’s services are provided at no charge to area residents.

“We’re going to spread this around like butter to get people engaged in the application process,” Kinyon said.

Area residents can begin signing up for HIP 2.0 right away at Reid’s Patient Financial Services office, Reid Urgent Care in Richmond, the main hospital campus and on Thursdays at Whitewater Valley Urgent Care in Connersville.

Reid also is planning sign-up and informational sessions in the coming weeks in partnership with Richmond Community Schools, the United Way of Whitewater Valley, the Natco Empowerment Center and the Wayne Township Trustee’s Office.
