The course now has its sights on even bigger golf championship events.\n\nAn estimated 120,000 people walked the grounds of Oak Tree National for the U.S. Senior Open. Organizers say everything went amazingly well from the dry weather to the dramatic playoff that determined the winner. The course now has its sights on even bigger golf championship events.\n\n\u201cWe think we are back in the rotation and we think that is going to be helpful for us,\u201d said Oak Tree National majority owner, Ed Evans.\n\nEvans thinks the success of the U.S. Senior Open this past week has put Oak Tree National \u201cback on the map.\u201d He called the tournament \u201cflawless\u201d, saying the course can easily host the bigger crowds that would come with a U.S. Open.\n\n7/8/2014 Related Story: Practice Rounds Kickoff US Senior Open At Oak Tree National\n\nWidening Waterloo Rd. north of the golf course would be extremely helpful in handling the crowds according to Evans.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see it widened either from the course to (highway) 77 or the course to I-35,\u201d said Evans.\n\nThe Oak Tree National co-owner admits the widening of Waterloo isn\u2019t absolutely necessary, but would make handling U.S. Open crowds easier. He also feels there are enough hotel rooms in Edmond and off Memorial Rd. that could handle the 250,000 people expected at a U.S. Open.\n\nEvans says the Club will be in talks with the USGA and the PGA of America to host other tournaments. The next best target for Oak Tree National, according to Evans, would be the U.S. Amateur in 2019 or 2020. That would put the course in good position to host a US Open in 2022.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An estimated 120,000 people walked the grounds of Oak Tree National for the U.S. Senior Open.
