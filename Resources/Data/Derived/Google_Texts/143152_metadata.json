In between traditional harness races this Saturday, there will be camel and ostrich races to entertain fans. (Sorry, you can\u2019t bet on them.)\n\nCamel racing has a long history and is popular in other parts of the world, including the Middle East, but it\u2019s not commonly seen in the United States. The gregarious ungulates can actually reach speeds of around 40 miles per hour, which is comparable to a racehorse.\n\nFinding the right camels for the job is a little trickier. The four camels racing Saturday were brought in, along with several ostriches, from Hedrick\u2019s Exotic Animal Farm in Nickerson, Kan., and were hand-picked for the race.\n\n\u201cWe have about 70 camels and we can pick and choose the ones that do this type of stuff,\u201d animal handler Monte McClurg said as he stood next to Snickers (the camel\u2019s \u201cbarn name\u201d \u2013 he will race under a different name, one that likely includes a camel pun).\n\n\u201cThis is his third year at the Meadowlands,\u201d said Mr. McClurg, \u201cso he\u2019s pretty good at it.\u201d\n\nHe said Snickers should be considered a favorite in Saturday\u2019s race. \u201cSnickers is a very honest camel, very loving, very eager to please,\u201d Mr. McClurg said. \u201cIf he was a human, I\u2019d be proud to have him as a son.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge is the camel\u2019s hump \u2014 which makes the jockey\u2019s position a little awkward. The rider must lean way to the back of his custom-made camel saddle and reach over the mound for balance.\n\nAnd the camels may not run in the right direction \u2013 a video of last year\u2019s camel race shows that at least three of the camels paused or turned around before the finish, to shrieks and laughter from the crowd.\n\nOstrich races are still more unpredictable. Ostriches, which themselves can reach speeds of about 40 miles per hour, have brains about as big as the end of a human thumb, according to handler A.J. Augusto. This means they are not the easiest animals to train.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about repetition and stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more they do it, the more they know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nLike the camels, the flightless birds have been known to turn around and run in the opposite direction of the race.\n\nFor the Meadowlands event, ostriches will be pulling \u201cBen-Hur\u201d-esque chariots and riders as they race \u2013 the jockey rides in a special contraption harnessed to the birds, which means speeds on this track of about 25 miles per hour, Mr. Augusto said.\n\nHe believes the birds are competitive \u2013 if you have two ostriches racing side by side, you can feel the chariot speed up, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at them in the wild, they run out in the wild,\u201d Mr. Augusto said. \u201cWe have some that enjoy running and some that, if they don\u2019t, we leave them at the house.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For the third straight year, the Meadowlands Racetrack has lifted its strict horse-only policy and opened its track to other animals from the wild kingdom.", "title": "Video: Camel, Ostrich Races Are Off the Beaten Track", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/20/video-camel-ostrich-races-are-off-the-beaten-track/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DI929_NYCAME_P_20140620132524.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Video: Camel, Ostrich Races Are Off the Beaten Track", "description": "For the third straight year, the Meadowlands Racetrack has lifted its strict horse-only policy and opened its track to other animals from the wild kingdom.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Jennifer Weiss and Geoff Foster", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "For the third straight year, the Meadowlands Racetrack has lifted its strict horse-only policy and opened its track to other animals from the wild kingdom.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-20T17:42:40-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/20/video-camel-ostrich-races-are-off-the-beaten-track/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-20906", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "For the third straight year, the Meadowlands Racetrack has lifted its strict horse-only policy and opened its track to other animals from the wild kingdom.", "title": "Video: Camel, Ostrich Races Are Off the Beaten Track", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/20/video-camel-ostrich-races-are-off-the-beaten-track/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DI929_NYCAME_P_20140620132524.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-20906", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-20T20:01:46-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd93\"", "article_summary": "In between traditional harness races this Saturday, there will be camel and ostrich races to entertain fans.\nThe gregarious ungulates can actually reach speeds of around 40 miles per hour, which is comparable to a racehorse.\n\u201cIf you look at them in the wild, they run out in the wild,\u201d Mr. Augusto said.\nThe rider must lean way to the back of his custom-made camel saddle and reach over the mound for balance.\nOstriches, which themselves can reach speeds of about 40 miles per hour, have brains about as big as the end of a human thumb, according to handler A.J."}
