Apropos of nothing, House Republican leaders decided last week their new top issue is There must have been some kind of strategy memo issued behind the scenes. Apropos of nothing, House Republican leaders decided last week their new top issue is complaining about cost-savings measures in Medicare \u2013 and the rest of the House GOP conference quickly started reading from the same script.\n\nThe party\u2019s official weekly address was delivered over the weekend by Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), who condemned Medicare \u201ccuts\u201d as a \u201cbreach of faith\u201d with America\u2019s seniors, and we\u2019re seeing individual members pop up with op-eds like this one from Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio).\n\nOne of the most troubling aspects of President Obama\u2019s takeover of health care is the more than $200 billion in cuts that Obamacare is taking from the Medicare Advantage (MA) program \u2013 a program that over 15 million seniors and individuals with disabilities have chosen to enroll in across the United States. As of January 2014, Ohio had over 763,797 enrollees in the MA program and roughly 38,766 of those enrollees reside in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio. This administration must stop these cuts to the MA program from happening if they want to protect the well-being of seniors across the country.\n\nRight off the bat, the moment you hear a member of Congress argue that President Obama has launched a \u201ctakeover\u201d of the health care system, you know there\u2019s probably going to be some flaws with the rest of the argument.\n\nBut the real problem with Johnson\u2019s argument is more specific: he voted for the same \u201ccuts\u201d he\u2019s now condemning.\n\nThe issue, once again, are the Medicare cost savings in the Affordable Care Act. As we discussed the other day, the law doesn\u2019t actually cut Medicare \u2013 if it did, the AARP wouldn\u2019t have endorsed it \u2013 so much as it reduces payments to insurance companies and hospitals, extending the program\u2019s financial health while expanding benefits. We can certainly have a meaningful conversation about whether the changes have caused some disruptions in the system, because they have.\n\nBut what\u2019s especially relevant now is the fact that congressional Republicans, after the savings took effect, quickly incorporated the policy into their own budget plan \u2013 a plan Bill Johnson, like nearly all GOP lawmakers, voted for.\n\nThis is easily documented: Johnson and House Republicans voted for the so-called \u201ccuts\u201d in 2011 . And then again in 2012 . And then once more in 2013\n\nGOP officials basically have two choices here: they can condemn the Medicare cost savings or they can embrace the Medicare cost savings. Right now, their plan is to do both and hope the public and the media don\u2019t notice.\n\nIf House Republicans were sincere about their new position \u2013 they\u2019re almost certainly not, but if they were \u2013 they could very easily write legislation increasing Medicare spending, reversing the savings included in \u201cObamacare\u201d and the GOP budget plan. But they\u2019re not, which tells us quite a bit about the seriousness of their argument.\n\nThere is, however, an electoral angle to also keep in mind. As the midterm elections draw closer, congressional Republicans have quietly decided to appear more liberal, not more conservative, as a way to impress voters.
