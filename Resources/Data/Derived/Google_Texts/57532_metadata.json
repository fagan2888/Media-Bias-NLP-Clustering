The Board was especially to investigate the NSA's clandestine collection of essentially all of the phone records of Americans. The PCLOB was established to monitor the activities of federal law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and spy agencies in an effort to make sure that the executive branch is not violating the civil liberties of Americans.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post and the New York Times, the PCLOB report, which will be issued today, finds that the NSA's massive domestic surveillance program is illegal and largely useless and should be ended. From the Times:\n\nThe program \u201clacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215 [of the PATRIOT Act], implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only limited value,\u201d the report said. \u201cAs a result, the board recommends that the government end the program.\u201d\n\nThe panel further noted, as the Post reports:\n\n\u201cWe have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the telephone records program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation,\u201d said the report, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cMoreover, we are aware of no instance in which the program directly contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown terrorist plot or the disruption of a terrorist attack.\u201d... \u201cThe Board believes that the Section 215 program has contributed only minimal value in combating terrorism beyond what the government already achieves through these and other alternative means,\u201d the report said. \u201cCessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government\u2019s efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.\u201d\n\nThe Board explicitly rejected claims made by NSA enablers that the agencies massive telephone spying program could have prevented the 9/11 atrocities or helped disrupt the New York City subway bombing plot.\n\nThe PCLOB report finds that the NSA claim that the telephone calling data of all Americans is \"relevant to an authorized investigation\" is an absurd interpretation of the PATRIOT Act. The Post reports that ...\n\n... the board found that it is impossible that all the records collected \u2014 billions daily \u2014 could be relevant to a single investigation \u201cwithout redefining that word in a manner that is circular, unlimited in scope.\u201d...\u201cAt its core, the approach boils down to the proposition that essentially all telephone records are relevant to essentially all international terrorism investigations,\u201d the report said. This approach, it said, \u201cat minimum, is in deep tension with the statutory requirement that items obtained through a Section 215 order be sought for \u2018an investigation,\u2019 not for the purpose of enhancing the government\u2019s counterterrorism capabilities generally.\u201d\n\nThe Board rejected the proposal that there should be a central repository holding data on the phone calls of all Americans. Federal agencies can seek data from individual telephone companies on a case-by-case basis using constitutionally authorized procedures, e.g., warrants issued on the basis of probable cause.\n\nPresident Obama was briefed on the Board's findings before his speech last Friday in which he outlined a couple of very feeble proposals for reforming the NSA's unconstitutional domestic spying operations. He evidently didn't listen to his own oversight board.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Last summer, President Barack Obama asked the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to look into the effectiveness and legalities of the National", "title": "NSA Telephone Spying Is Illegal and Useless, Asserts Obama's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/23/nsa-telephone-spying-lacks-a-viable-lega", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13904855985962.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13904855985962.jpg", "title": "NSA Telephone Spying Is Illegal and Useless, Asserts Obama's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Last summer, President Barack Obama asked the\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties\nOversight Board to look into the effectiveness and legalities\nof the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program.\nThe Board was especially to investigate the NSA's clandestine\ncollection of essentially all of the phone records of Americans.\nThe PCLOB was established to monitor the activities of federal law\nenforcement, counter-terrorism, and spy agencies in an effort to\nmake sure th"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-01-23T15:04:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf397\"", "article_summary": "Last summer, President Barack Obama asked the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to look into the effectiveness and legalities of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program.\nThe PCLOB was established to monitor the activities of federal law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and spy agencies in an effort to make sure that the executive branch is not violating the civil liberties of Americans.\nThe Board was especially to investigate the NSA's clandestine collection of essentially all of the phone records of Americans.\nThe PCLOB report finds that the NSA claim that the telephone calling data of all Americans is \"relevant to an authorized investigation\" is an absurd interpretation of the PATRIOT Act.\nHe evidently didn't listen to his own oversight board."}
