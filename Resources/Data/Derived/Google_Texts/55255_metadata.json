Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with Democrats.\n\n\"The president cannot go around the Democrats,\" said Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.). \"If he wants trade promotion authority, which of course is what we call fast track, he has to tell us what it\u2019s going to be.\"\n\nIn a Congress run by Republicans and with the largest majority of House Republicans in 85 years, it's a steep climb for Democrats hoping to block Obama's action on trade deals. Republicans historically support trade agreements because they're supposed to boost U.S. commerce overseas. Democratic concerns stem from jobs in their districts being lost to international companies, and the deals' lack of environmental, labor and consumer protections.\n\nObama conceded Tuesday night that there have been consequences to trade deals, even as he advocated for more agreements.\n\n\"Look, I\u2019m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we\u2019ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense,\" he said. \"But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. We can\u2019t close ourselves off from those opportunities.\"\n\nBut fast track authority is the more controversial piece of the process. If Congress votes to give that authority to the president, it means lawmakers can only vote up or down on a forthcoming trade deal and can't amend it. And they don't get to see what's in the deal until after fast track authority is approved. The reason for giving that authority is so whatever delicately crafted trade deal the administration has worked out with other countries doesn't unravel at the 11th hour because of congressional tinkering.\n\nSome Democrats are fine with Obama using that authority for a massive trade deal currently on the table, the Trans Pacific Partnership. That proposal involves 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and would cover nearly 40 percent of the world's economy.\n\n\"Why would we deny our president the same authority every president has had since the 1970s?\" asked Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). \"We still reserve the right to vote against the ultimate agreement. But giving him the flexibility to negotiate with broad [fast track authority] is something every president\u2019s had the last 40-plus years. I think it would be a terrible blow for Democrats to be the instrument of denying this president that authority.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s going to create some very interesting fault lines here in the Congress,\" he said.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Democrats ready to buck Obama will do so because it's about more than just trade policy. It's about wooing the voters that he has long counted as the most important.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to see things through the prism I\u2019m trying to get our entire caucus to look through, and I think just about everyone agrees: Does it help the middle class?\" Schumer told The Huffington Post. \"I told some business leaders, even if your trade agreement raises GDP and raises corporate profits, if it doesn\u2019t help middle-class incomes, don\u2019t count on us.\"\n\n\"We may have to oppose the president on parts of his trade agenda, but it will be middle-class focused and that will be very, very good for us,\" he said.\n\nSchumer admitted that Democrats might have a difficult time opposing both Obama and the GOP on trade deals. It's not a lost cause though, he said.\n\n\"When the president is on our side, we\u2019ve got the veto, like on the [Keystone] pipeline, so that\u2019s pretty easy. When he\u2019s not on our side, we have to win a majority -- because they can pass things on a narrow majority, or at least 60 votes in the Senate -- it\u2019s harder,\" he said. \"But on an issue like trade, you\u2019re going to find a good number of Republicans with us. Not every Republican is for trade. So that gives us some leverage.\"\n\nCritics of fast track authority continued to hammer the issue Wednesday. A group of seven House Democrats, along with Sanders, described the damage caused by past trade deals crafted in secret. Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), for one, said that Kodak, the photography company based in her district, had to slash its employees from 62,000 to 4,000 because of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\"We need to rename it. It should be the well-worn dead-end track, and not fast track,\" said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.).\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was coy in a recent interview with The Huffington Post on whether she supports giving fast track authority to Obama. She's supported and opposed trade deals in the past.\n\n\"Have you seen it? No, I haven't seen it either,\" she said earlier this month. \"It's a written document. It just depends on what it says. If it talks about transparency and consultation with Congress, that might be something.\"\n\nPelosi acknowledged that some in her party are \"never going to be for any of it,\" and said others are criticizing fast track authority \"to try to get the administration to do better\" in terms of working with Congress on its contents. The bottom line, she said, is that people need to know what's in it.\n\n\"It's not just, 'The president wants it, so we should all be for it' kind of thing,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a close ally of Pelosi and a vocal critic of trade deals, insisted Wednesday that the House has the votes to block fast track authority.\n\n\"We are going to win this issue,\" she said, noting that the House blocked it in 1997. \"We believe that we will win this vote to deny fast track.\"\n\nDeLauro couldn't say, though, why there weren't any Republicans at Wednesday's event. She also couldn't say if she expected Pelosi to have her back on the issue, though she said Pelosi has always advocated for transparency.\n\n\"She will make up her own mind,\" said DeLauro.\n\nSabrina Siddiqui, Maxwell Tani, Julia Craven and Jesse Rifkin contributed reporting.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: State of the Union 2015 Speech Reactions State of the Union 2015 Speech Reactions\n\n1 of 45 Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) \"In the State of the Union tonight, the president talked a lot about the challenges we face as a country, and I appreciate that he finally acknowledges that the middle class is being squeezed. But unfortunately, he has chosen to double down on the failed policies that have prevented so many Utahns and hardworking Americans from getting ahead in the first place. We know these are not serious proposals because the president is not serious about getting them through Congress. For him, it\u2019s all 2016 partisan politics now, and Republicans shouldn\u2019t waste time debating the merits of the president\u2019s political talking points. Instead, Republicans must take advantage of the opportunity the American people have given us. We should be developing and proposing real solutions that address America\u2019s growing Opportunity Deficit. We have anti-poverty initiatives, tax reform that works for working families, innovative new models of higher education, and a number of other solutions that will create jobs and improve our economy. So as the President tries to divide Americans and distract them from the failures of his administration, we shouldn\u2019t take the bait. Instead, Republicans are going to move forward on a positive agenda. I look forward to the opportunity the American people have given us to meet the challenge of our time. \" Share this slide:\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- With President Barack Obama declaring on Tuesday his intentions to push for legislation giving him authority to move forward unilaterally w...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-01-22 15:52:31 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- With President Barack Obama declaring on Tuesday his intentions to push for legislation giving him authority to move forward unilaterally w...", "title": "Democrats Warn Obama They Don't Have His Back On Trade Plans", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/21/obama-trade-agreements-democrats_n_6518212.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2518486/images/o-CHARLES-SCHUMER-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- With President Barack Obama declaring on Tuesday his intentions to push for legislation giving him authority to move forward unilaterally w...", "creator": "jbendery", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2518486/images/o-CHARLES-SCHUMER-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Democrats Warn Obama They Don't Have His Back On Trade Plans", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-21 15:52:31 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6518212", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Obama trade policy,Obama trade,obama fast track authority,fast track authority,democrats fast track authority,congress fast track authority,tpp,Trans-Pacific Partnership,obama-trans-pacific-partnership,video,democrats", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Obama trade policy,Obama trade,obama fast track authority,fast track authority,democrats fast track authority,congress fast track authority,tpp,Trans-Pacific Partnership,obama-trans-pacific-partnership,video,democrats", "published_time": "2015-01-21 15:52:31 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-01-22 01:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc68a\"", "article_summary": "And they don't get to see what's in the deal until after fast track authority is approved.\nObama conceded Tuesday night that there have been consequences to trade deals, even as he advocated for more agreements.\nSchumer admitted that Democrats might have a difficult time opposing both Obama and the GOP on trade deals.\nA group of seven House Democrats, along with Sanders, described the damage caused by past trade deals crafted in secret.\nBut giving him the flexibility to negotiate with broad [fast track authority] is something every president\u2019s had the last 40-plus years."}
