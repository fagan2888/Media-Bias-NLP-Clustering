And that doesn\u2019t include the county Water Resources Agency\u2019s spending plans.\n\nAssistant County Administrative Officer Dewayne Woods said the decision to separate the agency\u2019s recommended $22.5 million budget from the overall county spending plan, for the first time in recent memory, was an attempt to shine more light on the agency\u2019s operations. The agency is being charged with taking the lead on crucial water supply projects including possibly serving as the Salinas Valley\u2019s groundwater sustainability agency.\n\n\u201cThis offers more transparency with the issues they\u2019re going through, especially around the drought,\u201d Woods said.\n\nThe agency\u2019s budget will be considered by the Board of Supervisors during this week\u2019s budget hearings, set to start at 9 a.m. Tuesday at the County Government Center in Salinas.\n\nAlways officially an independent legal entity created by legislation, the agency is overseen by the Board of Supervisors of the Water Resources Agency, along with an appointed board of directors. County officials have also played a key role in nudging the agency toward fiscal balance in recent years.\n\nThis year\u2019s agency budget, still deeply affected by the impact of the drought and the absence of hydroelectric plant revenue, has cut its use of reserves by more than half \u2014 from about $3.7 million to about $1.68 million \u2014 as it moves toward balancing its spending with revenue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing things more into balance,\u201d agency general manager David Chardavoyne said.\n\nHowever, the budget doesn\u2019t include specific spending on key water projects, including the Interlake Tunnel, Salinas River diversion permit work, Salinas River maintenance and management support, and Groundwater Sustainability Act compliance, among other priorities.\n\nThe agency reported those efforts would cost more than $20 million over the next five years, including $4.6 million in the upcoming fiscal year. The supervisors directed agency officials to hire a financial consultant to explore funding options for its share of the work.\n\nLast week, Supervisors Dave Potter, Simon Salinas and Fernando Armenta went on a whirlwind tour of local state legislators and other state agencies in a quest for water project funding, among a series of other issues.\n\nMeanwhile, the county\u2019s overall budget reflects a $126.5 million spending increase and would require spending $39.5 million in reserves to balance the spending plan despite a $131.6 million increase in revenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the additional cost comes from adding 194 new positions to the county payroll, for a total of 5,034, most of them in the Health Department and Natividad Medical Center. The Health Department is adding 110 positions to expand its behavioral health program and health clinic capacity to serve an increasing number of clients enrolled in Medi-Cal managed care under the Affordable Care Act and those newly insured through Covered California. The county hospital is adding 76 positions for its Level II trauma center and expanding family practice residency program.\n\nWhile government reimbursement is up and property tax revenue has rebounded to pre-recession levels, Woods said the county\u2019s \u201crecovery period\u201d is also met by more rapidly rising costs.\n\nThe county is also allocating about $13.2 million for the jail expansion and juvenile hall projects, replacing aging vehicles such as sheriff\u2019s patrol cars averaging 141,000 miles, tenant improvements for the Schilling Place office complex and Government Center, renovation of the Old Courthouse\u2019s east and west wings and removing portables on the Government Center campus.\n\nDespite the imbalance between costs and available funding, the county appears to have managed to avoid all but a few layoffs by tapping about $13 million in increased discretionary revenue.\n\nWhile county parks\u2019 Lake San Antonio operation is facing closure and the loss of a dozen positions, half of them filled, new parks director Mark Mariscal announced last week that the department had cut the number of layoffs to two as a result of retirements and filling vacancies.\n\nJim Johnson can be reached at 726-4348.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salinas >> Monterey County is contemplating a record $1.2 billion annual budget for the 2015-16 fiscal year.
