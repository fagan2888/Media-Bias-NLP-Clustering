He contends that the hallowed school continually flouts both the establishment clause and military regulations by endorsing Christian fundamentalism.\n\nWeinstein told the Washington Gadfly that Lamar Advertising abruptly informed his people today that the billboard was rejected for being factually incorrect. With characteristic measured language he called the rationale a \u201cbullshit\u201d pretext, noting that they used other equally provocative billboards he bought to challenge the Air Force Academy but none named Obama. The company, which once rejected then accepted a pro-Obamacare billboard that criticized a Republican congressman, seems, like many Washington players, rather non-partisan throne sniffers.\n\nLamar executive Hal Kilshaw pulled a Marty Baron when reached for comment this afternoon, professing confusion about the identity of a reporter who just identified himself before angrily hanging up.\n\nIf Kilshaw is a non-cowardly capitalist he should let me buy a billboard for outside the Washington Post that says, \u201cWaPo Exec Editor Marty Baron Covers Up Racial Purge Lawsuit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rejected for factual inaccuracy", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Military Religious Freedom Foundation president Mikey Weinstein says an advertising company, which this Friday\u00a0abruptly rejected his proposed sign for Barack Obama's expected motorcade route to his J", "title": "MRFF \u2018Jesus Is Commander-In-Chief\u2019 Billboard Rejected For Obama Visit", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/14/mrff-jesus-is-commander-in-chief-billboard-rejected-for-obama-visit/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WelcomeMrPresident_proof-e1463177635647.jpg", "height": 558}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rejected for factual inaccuracy", "title": "MRFF \u2018Jesus Is Commander-In-Chief\u2019 Billboard Rejected For Obama Visit Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/14/mrff-jesus-is-commander-in-chief-billboard-rejected-for-obama-visit/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WelcomeMrPresident_proof-e1463177635647.jpg"}, "creator": "@evangahr", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-14 23:18:51", "sailthru.title": "MRFF 'Jesus Is Commander-In-Chief' Billboard Rejected For Obama Visit", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "mikey", "sailthru.description": "Military Religious Freedom Foundation president Mikey Weinstein says an advertising company, which this Friday\u00a0abruptly rejected his proposed sign for Barack Obama's expected motorcade route to his J", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WelcomeMrPresident_proof-e1463177635647.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "With characteristic measured language he called the rationale a \u201cbullshit\u201d pretext, noting that they used other equally provocative billboards he bought to challenge the Air Force Academy but none named Obama.\nThe billboard is the latest salvo against the Air Force Academy from Weinstein, an observant Jew with mostly Christian clients who Breitbart.com falsely calls an atheist.\nWeinstein told the Washington Gadfly that Lamar Advertising abruptly informed his people today that the billboard was rejected for being factually incorrect.\nIt said, \u201cWelcome Mr. President to Our AF Academy, Why is Jesus Commander in Chief Here?\u201dWell, for Christians, isn\u2019t he the commander-in-chief everywhere?\nThe company, which once rejected then accepted a pro-Obamacare billboard that criticized a Republican congressman, seems, like many Washington players, rather non-partisan throne sniffers."}
