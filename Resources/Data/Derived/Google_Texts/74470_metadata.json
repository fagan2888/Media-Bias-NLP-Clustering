New projections from the Congressional Budget Office, however, anticipate that the federal government will need to spend more on Obamacare than previously thought.\n\nThe non-partisan office estimates that the program will cost the federal government $1.34 trillion over the next decade, an increase of $136 billion from the CBO\u2019s predictions in 2015. In 2016 alone, Obamacare will cost a total of $110 billion.\n\nThe rising costs are likely caused by higher-than-expected enrollment in the expanded Medicaid program created under the law. The CBO also estimates that about 12 million people are currently covered through Obamacare\u2019s insurance marketplaces this year. The program is expected to reduce the number of insured people by 22 million this year.\n\nThe CBO also projects that costs will rise for those enrolled in Obamacare. For those who are already insured, insurance premiums will jump by about 6% a year over the next decade.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people enrolled under employment-based coverage\u2014the most popular type\u2014is expected to decline in the next decade. Employers now cover about 155 million people, or about 57% of those under age 65. That figure is expected to decrease to 54% of those under 65.\n\nThat\u2019s because some workers may qualify for Medicaid, a virtually free program. Other employers\u2014those not large enough to be fined for not offering insurance\u2014may decide not to offer Obamacare. Still, employment-based coverage will remain the most popular kind of coverage under the ACA, the report found.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Due to a projected enrollment spike, the cost of Obamacare is expected to rise over the next decade.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Because more people are signing up for Obamacare.", "title": "Here's How Many Billions Obamacare Will Cost in 2016", "url": "http://time.com/money/4271224/obamacare-cost-taxpayers-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/160324_em_obamacarecost.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/160324_em_obamacarecost.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Because more people are signing up for Obamacare.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Here's How Many Billions Obamacare Will Cost in 2016"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", affordable care act, health care, obamacare, pubdesk", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare,cost,taxpayers,projected,affordable care act,aca,health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd617\"", "article_summary": "In 2016 alone, Obamacare will cost a total of $110 billion.\nThe rising costs are likely caused by higher-than-expected enrollment in the expanded Medicaid program created under the law.\nNew projections from the Congressional Budget Office, however, anticipate that the federal government will need to spend more on Obamacare than previously thought.\nOther employers\u2014those not large enough to be fined for not offering insurance\u2014may decide not to offer Obamacare.\nThe program is expected to reduce the number of insured people by 22 million this year."}
