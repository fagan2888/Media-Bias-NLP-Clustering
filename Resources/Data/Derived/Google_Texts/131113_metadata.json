You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then, and why aren\u2019t you for it now?\u201d asked Baier.\n\nTrump responded that his opinion back in 2000 related to the situation at the time and does not reflect his position now.\n\n\u201cAs far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\u2019re talking about here,\u201d answered Trump, before moving on to discuss his endorsement of allowing health-care policies to be purchased across state lines.\n\nWatch Trump\u2019s answer at the Aug. 6 prime-time GOP debate:\n\nGrace-Marie Turner is president of the Galen Institute and battled Obamacare as well as the Clinton health-care reform efforts in the 1990s. She said the first thing to remember is that Canada and Scotland have two different systems.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian system is a single-payer system,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government is the payer, both the provinces and the federal government for all health care services. In Scotland, it is really socialized medicine, in which the government owns hospitals and employs physicians. So they\u2019re two different systems.\u201d\n\nShe also doesn\u2019t buy Trump\u2019s argument that circumstances were that much different 15 years ago, when the GOP front-runner embraced the single-payer approach.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically saying that either one of them would have worked better and could have worked in this country in the year 2000, which is relatively recently, and I don\u2019t know how much has changed in the sense that we might have been able to have done socialized medicine in the year 2000. I think not,\u201d Turner said.\n\nRegardless of the structure, she said the realities in both countries are far from what Trump describes.\n\n\u201cIt probably would work very well for him because he would be able to go wherever he wanted and pay for his own care privately,\u201d Turner explained. \u201cBut for individual citizens, that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Grace-Marie Turner:\n\nShe continued, \u201cIn either [Canada or Scotland], you face long wait times, unless you can escape and go some place else for your care. If you are stuck in either one of those systems, in which you need care, you get in the queue and you will wait weeks, sometimes months, sometimes years to get the care that you need.\u201d\n\nAnd she said the waiting game is only getting worse.\n\n\u201cA wonderful think-tank in Canada, the Fraser Institute, keeps track of wait times for medical care in the country. In 1993, there was about a nine-week wait for surgery or treatment,\u201d Turner said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s 18 weeks on average. So it\u2019s doubled in those 22 years.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s only for necessary treatment.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re even worse for what we call elective surgeries, like hip, knee or back surgery. That wait? Forty-two weeks or 10 months. Neurosurgery is 31 weeks,\u201d she said.\n\nTurner said life is even more miserable for Canadians unfortunate enough to have their procedure scheduled late in the years.\n\n\u201cIf a hospital reaches its budget the first of December, it will close the rest of the year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you had a surgery scheduled for the 10th of December, you\u2019re going to have to get back in the queue.\u201d\n\nTurner also points to research from Forbes magazine health-care expert Avik Roy, pointing out the contrast in cancer survival between the U.S. and Scotland. The overall five-year survivability numbers show 73.8 percent of Americans surviving five years or more after their cancer diagnosis, compared to 52.7 percent in Scotland. Double-digit differences also exist for specific cancers, including prostate, colon and breast cancers.\n\nRoy has served as a health-care adviser to former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, during this campaign. Perry and Trump have taken numerous shots at each other. However, Roy\u2019s numbers on the cancer differential come from a 2008 CONCORD study.\n\nIn his debate answer, Trump also pushed for health insurance policies to be purchased across state lines.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I\u2019m negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid.\n\n\u201cYou know why? Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage. But they have total control of the politicians. They\u2019re making a fortune,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile endorsing the purchase of policies across state lines, Turner believes that answer suggests Trump doesn\u2019t fully grasp the current system.\n\n\u201cAs a large company, he can self-insure his employees. Therefore, he is under a provision of law called ERISA that allows him to operate as one health plan. He doesn\u2019t have to have individual negotiations with individual states,\u201d Turner said.\n\n\u201cHe already has, as a major employer, as do tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of major employers operated exactly the way that he\u2019s describing we should.\u201d\n\nRelated column:\n\nIs Trump right about single-payer? by Elizabeth Lee Vliet, M.D.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "While the media focus on the public spat between Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and Fox News, a prominent health-care expert says Trump\u2019s praise for single-payer health care systems in Canada and Scotland doesn\u2019t survive an examination of the facts.
