Here are some of the most common:\n\n1. Waiting to Apply\n\nThe FAFSA asks for figures from your 2014 tax return, which few families have filed this early in the year. Those who wait to apply until they complete their taxes, however, may be making a serious mistake.\n\nMany forms of financial aid are first-come, first-served, and some states set deadlines as early as February for their own programs. State deadlines can be found using a link on the home page of the FAFSA website (fafsa.ed.gov/deadlines.htm).\n\nCollege consultants suggest filing the FAFSA with estimated numbers as soon after Jan. 1 as you can and then updating it with the actual figures once your tax returns are filed (which you should also do as early as possible). You can electronically import your 2014 tax numbers from the IRS, using a link embedded in the FAFSA's online application, starting Feb. 2 or two weeks after you file your return, whichever is later.\n\nApps such as education lender Sallie Mae's free \"College Ahead\" can help you keep track of all these deadlines.\n\nRelated: The Smarter Way to Borrow for College\n\n2. Filing the Old-School Way\n\nThe Education Department still accepts paper forms, but expect a much longer processing time - two to four weeks compared with three to five days for the electronic version.\n\nYou cannot use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool with the paper version and must answer all 102 questions, since only the electronic version will tailor the questions it asks to the details you provide. The online version also flags potential errors for correction.\n\nIf you do file a paper form, be sure to fill in all the blanks, adding a \"0\" if the question does not apply to you. To avoid math errors, make sure to go over the form carefully, and most of all, sign it.\n\n3. Misunderstanding Dependency Rules\n\nIf you were born before Jan. 1, 1992, you are considered independent and do not have to include your parents' financial information on your FAFSA. Otherwise, you probably do, even if your folks cannot or will not help you financially.\n\nThere are a few exceptions for people under 24 to be considered independent: those who are married, have dependent children, served in the military, have a legal guardian or are wards of the court. You can find out more about the rules, which are different from those used by the IRS, on the Education Department's financial aid site.\n\nRelated: Financial Aid Haggling: How Far Can You Go?\n\n4. Misreading Instructions\n\nHousehold size also is incredibly important to the financial aid formula, but many applicants fail to read the FAFSA instructions on how to determine this number.\n\nStudents may not have included themselves or, say, ailing grandparents who receive more than half of their support from the parents.\n\nAnother mistake is using a name that does not match your government-issued identification, like a nickname. This can delay processing of your application.\n\nCarefully reading the FAFSA instructions can help. So can guidebooks such as \"Filing the FAFSA\" by Mark Kantrowitz and David Levy.
