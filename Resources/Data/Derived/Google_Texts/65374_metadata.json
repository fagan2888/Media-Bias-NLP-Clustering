Carmen Zalazar picked up extra babysitting jobs at night after caring for kids all day in Houston.\n\nThe women scrimped and saved for months to pay for the $680 application, but for other applicants in the future, it might not be enough.\n\nAs President Barack Obama renews his quest for immigration reform, some proposals would impose fines of $2,000 on top of application fees, making the financial hurdles much taller for people who are here illegally.\n\n\u201cYou have more rights when you are a citizen, like to vote,\u201d said Zalazar, a legal resident. As soon as she started a citizenship class, \u201cI started to save because I knew otherwise it won\u2019t be possible.\u201d\n\nThe struggle is familiar to millions of immigrants. A 2012 survey by the Pew Hispanic Center showed that only 46 percent of Hispanic immigrants eligible to become citizens had done so. The top two reasons were lack of English skills and lack of money to pay for the application.\n\nManuel Enrique Angel made learning English his first priority upon arriving in Houston from his native El Salvador two years ago. He now speaks English clearly and deliberately and plans to apply for citizenship as soon as he becomes eligible later this year.\n\nTrained as a lawyer in El Salvador, the 28-year-old works as a cook in a Houston burger joint. His wife, an American citizen, is a hair stylist. He estimates it will take him up to eight months to save the money for the citizenship application.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard when you have to pay rent around $600, when you have car notes for $300 and $500,\u201d Angel said.\n\nRepublican supporters of the proposed fines say penalties are necessary to defend against any appearance that creating a pathway to citizenship amounts to amnesty.\n\nMark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based think tank that supports tighter immigration controls, said if immigrants who are in the country illegally are allowed to seek citizenship, they should have to pay the costs, which will increase if millions of applications need to be processed.\n\nHowever, he said, the costs should not be so high that people can\u2019t afford them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid to price people out of the market,\u201d Krikorian said.\n\nAngel plans to take advantage of a program at a Houston credit union that offers small low-interest loans specifically to help clients become citizens. The Promise Credit Union partners with Neighborhood Centers Inc., a nonprofit network of community centers in the Houston area that cater to immigrants.\n\nCredit union President Randy Martinez said the program began as a pilot in 2012 and only officially started last fall.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want that to become an obstacle for them not to become citizens, just because they don\u2019t have the entire fee to pay,\u201d he said.\n\nThe credit union\u2019s $455 loans include $380 toward the citizenship process plus a $75 processing fee for the loan application. They carry a fixed 5 percent interest rate for a 12-month term, so the monthly payments work out to about $38.\n\nApplicants must contribute $300 of their own money. They are all pre-screened by the Neighborhood Centers legal team to make sure they qualify for citizenship and have all the necessary documentation.\n\nAn immigration reform bill passed by the Senate in June did not set the costs of the proposed 13-year path to citizenship. Lawmakers left that up to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, with the idea that fees would make the system self-sustaining.\n\nWhile the fees remain unspecified, the Senate bill lays out penalties totaling $2,000 to be paid at various steps along the way. The legislation would create a new status called \u201cregistered provisional immigrant\u201d and require anyone with that status to pay taxes.\n\nDuring the 13-year wait, immigrants would be \u201cworking on the books, and you will hopefully be able to make a better income and be progressing in your life,\u201d said Ellen Battistelli, a policy analyst with the National Immigration Law Center, who has argued against making the process too costly.\n\n\u201cThere are so many requirements and financial burdens, this is a very rigorous path to go,\u201d especially for low-wage workers, Battistelli said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "It may soon cost $2,680 to become a US citizen", "title": "It may soon cost $2,680 to become a US citizen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/02/it-may-soon-cost-2680-to-become-a-us-citizen/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140202__p_d0d5e1ca-51a3-4600-ae33-f77e698cb8cblsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140202__p_d0d5e1ca-51a3-4600-ae33-f77e698cb8cblsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-02T11:18:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:03:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hilda Vasquez squirreled away the money for her U.S. citizenship application by selling batches of homemade tamales at South Texas offices.\nHe estimates it will take him up to eight months to save the money for the citizenship application.\nAs soon as she started a citizenship class, \u201cI started to save because I knew otherwise it won\u2019t be possible.\u201dThe struggle is familiar to millions of immigrants.\nThe top two reasons were lack of English skills and lack of money to pay for the application.\n\u201cYou have more rights when you are a citizen, like to vote,\u201d said Zalazar, a legal resident."}
