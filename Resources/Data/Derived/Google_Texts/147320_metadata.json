That includes education conditions like kindergarten enrollment, but also household factors like parental income.\n\nKansas\u2019 received a B-, a score of 81.9 percent, compared to 81.4 last year.\n\nIn the K-12 achievement category, the state got a D+, or 68.4 percent, down from 69.1.\n\nThat category consists of 18 academic indicators, ranging from math and reading scores on the federally administered National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test, to graduation rates and achievement gaps between lower- and higher-income students.\n\nFor school finance, Kansas received a C, or 74.2 percent, down from 76.8.\n\nThe school finance score includes eight benchmarks that look at funding equity across districts and overall spending. On the latter point, the report awards higher marks for more spending, a controversial topic in Kansas, where state funding levels are the key dispute in a lawsuit pending at the Kansas Supreme Court.\n\nOn the matter of funding equity, Kansas saw an increase in disparity among districts, Education Week said. However, it remained one of just seven states that offer more funding to poorer districts than wealthier ones to even out local resources.\n\nKansas did better than average on economic benchmarks, such as the percentage of children with family incomes at least twice the poverty level (59 percent) and the percentage with at least one parent working full time (81 percent). It also was ahead on math and reading scores.\n\nBut the state lagged behind in preschool enrollment \u2014 with about 46 percent of preschool-aged children enrolled \u2014 and in closing the achievement gap for low-income students.\n\nKansas Education Commissioner Diane DeBacker, who sent a summary of the report to members of the Kansas State Board of Education this past week, said the report didn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased with the \u2018Chance for Success\u2019 \u201d score, she said.\n\nShe said school districts deserved credit for much of the state\u2019s higher performance in that category, because many successful initiatives are decided at the local level.\n\nKansas is often described as a \u201clocal control\u201d state that gives districts more leeway on deciding education matters than many other states do.\n\nAs an example, DeBacker said the state only funds half-day kindergarten and doesn\u2019t require districts to offer more, yet most local school boards take the initiative to fund and offer full-day kindergarten anyway.\n\nDeBacker said the governor\u2019s proposal to fund full-day kindergarten would help districts with that initiative. Additionally, the Kansas State Board of Education has a policy goal of increasing access to preschool, she said.\n\nMark Tallman, a lobbyist at the Kansas Association of School Boards, said the Education Week report was both positive and negative.\n\n\u201cThe good news is we still rank ahead of most states\u201d on a number of measures, Tallman said. \u201cThe bad news is we don\u2019t seem to be growing as fast.\u201d\n\nKansas should be concerned that other states\u2019 K-12 systems may overtake it in terms of quality, he said.\n\nAt the same time, Tallman questioned the report\u2019s heavy reliance on NAEP scores.\n\nUnlike state math and reading tests, which all students take annually in grades three through eight and once in high school, the NAEP is administered every other year at randomly selected schools to fourth- and eighth-graders.\n\nStudents and teachers don\u2019t see the results, which the U.S. Department of Education uses to produce aggregate state scores.\n\nMeanwhile, Erick Vaughn, executive director of the Kansas Head Start Association, said Kansas doesn\u2019t offer adequate preschool options.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough high-quality preschool slots available to meet the need,\u201d Vaughn said.\n\nEarly education is an investment that pays off by boosting academic achievement and lowering dropout rates, he argued.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Education, State, Celia Llopis-Jepsen, Diane DeBacker, Erick Vaughn, Mark Tallman", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Kansas lags behind the national average in educational indicators, such as preschool attendance, but does better than many states on equity of school district finance, an annual report said Thursday.", "title": "Mixed results for Kansas education on annual report", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-01-11/mixed-results-kansas-education-annual-report", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/12979923.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Kansas lags behind the national average in educational indicators, such as preschool attendance, but does better than many states on equity of school district finance, an annual report said Thursday.This year's Quality Counts report, an annual state-by-state study conducted by the research department of the publication Education Week, showed that Kansas K-12 schools made progress on such measures as graduation rates and reading scores, but lost ground on others, such as mathematics scores."}, "article_summary": "Kansas Education Commissioner Diane DeBacker, who sent a summary of the report to members of the Kansas State Board of Education this past week, said the report didn\u2019t come as a surprise.\nThe study looks at student achievement, state funding and other factors, and produces report cards with three grades.\nOn the matter of funding equity, Kansas saw an increase in disparity among districts, Education Week said.\nMark Tallman, a lobbyist at the Kansas Association of School Boards, said the Education Week report was both positive and negative.\nAdditionally, the Kansas State Board of Education has a policy goal of increasing access to preschool, she said."}
