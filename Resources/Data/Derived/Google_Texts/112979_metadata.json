People in countries with socialized health care, in countries that are allowed to regulate and negotiate the prices of drugs, the pill will cost around $1.73.\n\nPerhaps some are thinking \u201cWell, those countries have to pay way more health care related taxes than we do! I\u2019d rather pay $750 a pill than do that! Who knows if I\u2019ll ever even need that pill!\u201c\n\nBut the fact is\u2013Americans actually pay more in health care-related taxes than any other country on earth. In 2012, the year before Obamacare was launched, the U.S. spent an average of $8,745 per person in health care related costs\u2013$2000 more than the second highest spender, Norway. Now we pay something like $9000 per person\u2013 and while Obamacare is better than nothing, we don\u2019t get the same bang for our buck that people in other countries do.\n\nIn addition to that, we spend way the hell more on out-of-pocket costs than people in other countries do, and on top of that we have to pay for our own insurance, so we\u2019re getting it from all sides. So let\u2019s examine some of the reasons health care costs us so much.\n\n1. Because the cost is so low in other countries\n\nWhen those who oppose single-payer whine about how \u201cthey don\u2019t want to pay for anyone else\u2019s health care,\u201d I kind of have to laugh. Because guess what? We, as Americans, are shouldering the cost of healthcare for pretty much the rest of the world. Just like we shoulder the cost of war.\n\nBecause most other industrialized countries have both national healthcare and regulations on the pharmaceutical industry, they are allowed to determine the cost of medication and care, rather than the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies. If Canada says a pill is going to cost a dollar, that pill is going to cost a dollar\u2013or they don\u2019t get to sell it. So they\u2019ll sell it for a dollar in Canada, and charge Americans $750. Why? Because we let them! There\u2019s no one to say no!\n\n2. Because we fund research and development\n\nAgain, because healthcare costs are so low in other countries, we get charged more\u2013at least partially\u2013to fund research and development of new drugs. Because we don\u2019t want to subsidize healthcare for ourselves, we end up subsidizing it for the entire planet.\n\nSo, say this dude does use the money from his $750 pill to fund research and development of a \u201cbetter\u201d pill. The countries that are now paying a dollar a pill for Daraprim will then get to pay a dollar a pill for the pill that our money funded the research and development for, and we will not.\n\nThere are a lot of people who say it\u2019s worth it\u2013that they are OK with paying higher prices so that everyone, including us, can have better medicine. Personally, I happen to think it would be a lot more fair if we could work this out some other way, with other countries contributing to this as well.\n\n3. Because we shoulder the cost of tax breaks for companies that provide insurance for their workers\n\nCorporations that pay for healthcare for their workers get about $300 billion a year in tax breaks\u2013which is about a $1000 per person in the United States. The need for that money doesn\u2019t go away, it just means that you pay it instead of some giant corporation. So if you work for an employer who does not pay for your healthcare, guess what? You\u2019re still technically paying for someone else\u2019s! Perhaps in a round-about way, but you\u2019re still doing it\u2013and not seeing the benefit you would if you were paying taxes towards a single-payer system.\n\n4. Because a lot of the time we only see the increased costs as a rise in our insurance premiums\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to stay in a hospital, you may have noticed that you\u2019ve been charged insane fees for incredibly cheap items. For instance, people have reported being charged over $100 for a box of Kleenex (described in the bill as a \u201cmucous recovery system\u201d). If you have insurance, you\u2019re not going to be charged directly for this, but as those $100 Kleenex boxes pile up, our insurance premiums rise.\n\n5. Medicare isn\u2019t allowed to negotiate for lower prices\n\nOne of the weirdest things about Medicare Part D is that it is explicitly barred, by our laws, from negotiating lower prices with providers and drug companies. The drug companies set the price and Medicare pays it, regardless of how ridiculously high it is. That comes out of our taxes. Like, our law on this is \u201cNo thanks, we prefer to pay more!\u201d\n\nThis is how our country ended up spending $172 million on penis pumps\u2013at $360 a pop! In case you were wondering, you can get one for about $20 elsewhere! Why? Because we literally are legally barred from saying \u201cNo, give us a lower price.\u201d\n\n6. It is crazy expensive to become a doctor here\n\nAlthough physician costs account for only about 20% of our spending on health care, this is still a bit of a factor and I think it\u2019s worth addressing. Doctors in America make the most in the world, and part of that is because they spend the most to become doctors in the first place. Really\u2013you make it through all those years of schooling, you\u2019re gonna have some serious loans to pay back when you\u2019re done. Unless you have some seriously rich parents. The average cost of medical school here is $50 grand a year!\n\nSo it really is only fair that our doctors are paid more than in countries where their tuition is free or a heck of a lot cheaper. This, essentially, is how we subsidize education\u2013it\u2019s just a different, and in the long run, much more expensive way of doing it.\n\n7. The prices are just higher because they can charge you whatever the hell they want.\n\nPart of the reason this country recoils so hard at the idea of \u201csocialized medicine\u201d is due to a deep belief in the \u201cfree market.\u201d Except the thing is, there\u2019s a difference between healthcare and Walmart\u2013so you can\u2019t really rely on competition to lower the prices of things. If something happens to you and someone calls an ambulance, you can\u2019t choose to take a \u201ccheaper\u201d ambulance.\n\nAlthough Americans use more generics than any other country, we don\u2019t make it easy. We have really strong patent laws, which are about to get even stronger due to the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership. But, even when patents have expired, people like Martin Shkreli can make it impossible for companies producing generics to get their hands on the amount of a drug they need in order to test the generic and prove that it\u2019s the exact same as the non-generic. Then, they can charge whatever the hell they want without any fear of competition bringing the price down.\n\nFor medical procedures, the government in other countries sets the cost rather than the provider. So while an MRI in France would cost you $280, in America it could cost you anywhere from $400-$1080 depending on what your provider felt like charging you.\n\nAs far as prices go, there\u2019s no one to say \u201cno,\u201d there\u2019s no competition to bring down prices, and this essentially means they can charge you whatever the hell they want to charge you.\n\n8. Because Obamacare was written by the insurance companies and Conservative groups\n\nFor years and years and years\u2013at least since Ted Kennedy and Nixon\u2013the Left and the Right battled it out. The National Healthcare debate. The Left supported Single Payer, the Right supported a mandate. Nixon supported a mandate, the Heritage Foundation supported a mandate. Then, Obama comes around and decides to go with the mandate instead of Single Payer (which is still the better system), and, naturally, the conservatives hate that too now.\n\nTo be fair\u2013Obamacare is better than what we had before, but shit, if you\u2019re gonna encounter this kind of opposition, wouldn\u2019t it have been better to go with the better option entirely? I certainly think so!\n\nSingle-payer means that you have one large insurance group\u2013the entire country. You have more negotiating power and the ability to regulate all of these prices in a way that the insurance companies don\u2019t. You also get better deals, because you\u2019re buying in bulk. It\u2019s not socialism, idiots, it\u2019s Costco.\n\n9. Because Americans are stupid.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true. \u201cNo thanks!\u201d says America! \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep paying higher prices because we don\u2019t like socialism! Socialism bad!\u201d In the meantime, while you\u2019re so worried about \u201csubsidizing\u201d the health care of people in your own country, you\u2019re subsidizing the health care costs of the entire freaking world.\n\nPeople in other countries may pay slightly higher taxes, but they get way, way more bang for their buck than we do and end up saving a lot of money on out-of-pocket costs. That\u2019s a fact. They pay $2000 a year for childcare for two kids, we pay an average of $12,000 for the same. They pay a dollar for a pill, we pay $750. They pay nothing or very little for school, we end up in debt for the rest of our lives. If we\u2019re going to pay taxes\u2013if we\u2019re going to pay the highest healthcare taxes in the world, specifically\u2013it would be nice, I think, if they benefited us for a change, instead of someone else. We, essentially, are paying for subsidized healthcare and not getting it.\n\nPersonally, I am goddamned tired of subsidizing the world\u2019s healthcare. I am also tired of subsidizing the world\u2019s wars. Lindsey Graham said during the debates that he wants to start at least 40,000 new wars, and sorry, but that shit is expensive, and we already spend more on our military than the next seven countries combined! I\u2019m tired of subsidizing tax cuts for big businesses, when those businesses are doing their manufacturing abroad instead of hiring Americans. We need to take care of our stuff here first. Everyone else gets to use their taxes to benefit the people in their country, and we don\u2019t get to do that, and I think that sucks. Who\u2019s the putz?
