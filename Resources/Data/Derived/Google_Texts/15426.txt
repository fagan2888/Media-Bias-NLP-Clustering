In the first two months of Obamacare, 14,000 Texans purchased insurance. One of them was Misty Parker. This so-called “young invincible” has a premium of $38 a month.

The KERA radio story.

When Parker, 31, left her job and lost her health insurance in 2012, she started to search for a new position, with benefits. But like many millennials, she’s looking to make a difference -- and it wasn’t easy to find a job that offered both revolution and health insurance.

“Because the things I’m most passionate about don’t tend to make a lot of money,” Parker says.

That’s where Obamacare comes in.

Heart of gold, plan of bronze

“When I found out I qualified for a subsidy through Obamacare, I decided to just go for it," she said.

Parker took a job with Recycle Revolution in Dallas near Deep Ellum. It’s a small company that doesn’t offer insurance. But because of her Obamacare subsidy, she can afford coverage.

Her bill is $38 a month -- a subsidized rate available to someone like her making $12 an hour. It’s a bronze plan with a $6,000 deductible.

“If I had to pay that for some reason, it’s not going to destroy me,” Parker says.
