Now, with the Affordable Care Act and the push for accountable care, it\u2019s proving to be a valuable tool in population health efforts.\n\nGIS \u2014 short for geographic information system \u2014 is software that is capable of capturing, storing, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced data.\n\nWhile global health organizations and public health agencies in the U.S. have long used it for population health purposes, its use in the private sector has mostly been limited to strategic planning and marketing. But that\u2019s starting to change as hospitals take on more risk for health outcomes and cost, says Danny Patel, account executive for health and human services at GIS software maker Esri.\n\nWhy GIS use is rising\n\n\u201cAs the move to accountable care and value-based payments takes hold, providers and health plans are increasingly interested in applying GIS to assess risk based on geography and the populations that live there, reveal where the greatest need is, and prioritize areas for interventions,\u201d Patel tells Healthcare Dive.\n\nEHRs alone don\u2019t tell the whole story to mitigate those risks, Patel notes. Providers need to understand what\u2019s driving peoples\u2019 health, and much of that stems from their community.\n\nBig data power users\n\nOne of the best-known proponents of medical GIS is Jeffrey Brenner, a family physician in Camden, NJ, who uses big data to identify \u201chot spot\u201d buildings where large numbers of high-need, high-cost individuals live. By using data from hospital claims, Brenner\u2019s Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers (CCHP) has helped to cut emergency room use and hospital stays.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve tried a variety of geographic approaches \u2014 targeting a building/neighborhood for chronic disease management courses, building a primary care office directly in a high-cost building, and developing a relationship and care transition workflows with social services in the building,\u201d says Aaron Truchil, CCHP\u2019s director of data, research and evaluation.\n\nToday, the coalition is pursuing a more holistic data framework that spans health and social services \u2014 linking individuals\u2019 education, housing, and criminal justice record to their use of healthcare.\n\n\u201cAdministrative data can play a huge role in advancing the shift to accountable care and value-based payment,\u201d Truchil says. \u201dIt is the financial history of what got us to this point and can help us understand where we went wrong and who is likely to have adverse events in the future.\u201d\n\nOne example of this place-based approach is Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) in California, which is using GIS to create successful interventions that reduce unnecessary readmissions and promote health behavior with a focus on transitional care. Discharged patients in San Bernardino County, where LLUH is located, have historically had trouble maintaining their health and wind up back in the hospital, says Patel. The county ranks 42 out of 57 in the state in health outcomes and 41 of 57 in health behaviors.\n\nTo turn things around, LLUH created an interactive map that patients can access to find community resources near their home that will help them stay healthy and avoid recurrent hospitalization.\n\nA deep GIS dive into Children's National\n\nAt Children\u2019s National Heath System (CNHS) in Washington, D.C., administrators are using GIS to better understand their population across the region, characterize different subsets of a disease population, and target areas for improvement and intervention. For example, in 2015, CNHS characterized all of its sickle cell disease patients were admitted for pain crisis.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, we evaluated clinical variables found during the initial admission that may influence the propensity for a child to be readmitted,\u201d says Jefferson McMillan, manager of business intelligence and clinical analytics at the 313-bed hospital.\n\n\u201cWe also worked into this prediction model information about the geographic area from which the children originated,\" McMillan says. \"This information was gathered from our enterprise GIS and include how close they were to appropriate outpatients services, other emergency departments and our main campus.\u201d\n\nThe prediction model showed that the distance patients had to travel to get to the hospital was often significant and those who were closer had a \u201cprotective effect,\u201d according to McMillan.\n\nThe model has also helped the nonprofit health system focus scarce resources on areas that need them the most, such as building interventional clinics or clinic services to prevent readmissions. \u201cGIS significantly improves the overall [return on investment] because of both the increase of specificity and sensitivity of the intervention and decision,\u201d McMillan says.\n\nCNHS uses a system-wide GIS platform that can be accessed by all users in the system. \u201cOur payment models have not changed in pediatrics to a value-based or accountable care, so implementing this system allows us to provide the highest level of care,\u201d McMillan says.\n\nThe drivers may vary depending on whether the focus is research, clinical, quality improvement or some other need, but the goal is always the same \u2014 doing what\u2019s best for the kids.\n\nThe mighty strength of GIS\n\nThe value of GIS is that it provides context to geographic data that would otherwise just be a value in a database, says Patel. \u201cThe key to making this data actionable is to uncover the relationships and patterns that traditional healthcare IT systems can\u2019t detect.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "medium": "news", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-it,healthcare-hospital-admin,healthcare-practice-mgmt", "description": "Healthcare", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "GIS maps hospital efforts to healthier populations", "pub_date": "may 22, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-22T09:00:00", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Sunday, May 22, 2016, 09:00 AM", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ec/20/ec2090abb241c26fd33dcf6a01a7d942.jpg", "news_keywords": "Health IT,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin,Practice Management,Practice Mgmt", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-05-10T09:00:00", "teaser": "<p>GIS uses geographic data to uncover&nbsp;patterns and relationships that traditional health IT systems can&rsquo;t detect.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-05-22", "sailthru.description": "GIS uses geographic data to uncover\u00a0patterns and relationships that traditional health IT systems can\u2019t detect.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "GIS uses geographic data to uncover\u00a0patterns and relationships that traditional health IT systems can\u2019t detect.", "title": "GIS maps hospital efforts to healthier populations", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/gis-maps-hospital-efforts-to-healthier-populations/419434/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/8681750288_66cfdd82f9_b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/da/c9/dac936afd3b5f9e5eb0a0b428581db2b.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a65\"", "article_summary": "GIS maps hospital efforts to healthier populationsFor years, providers have used GIS software to map disease outbreaks and monitor the effectiveness of interventions.\nNow, with the Affordable Care Act and the push for accountable care, it\u2019s proving to be a valuable tool in population health efforts.\nBy using data from hospital claims, Brenner\u2019s Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers (CCHP) has helped to cut emergency room use and hospital stays.\nGIS \u2014 short for geographic information system \u2014 is software that is capable of capturing, storing, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced data.\nWhile global health organizations and public health agencies in the U.S. have long used it for population health purposes, its use in the private sector has mostly been limited to strategic planning and marketing."}
