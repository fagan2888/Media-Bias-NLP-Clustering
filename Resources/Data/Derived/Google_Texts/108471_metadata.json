One person, one vote.\u201d It ends with a view of the fifth protester, who sings the opening verse to a version of \u201cElla\u2019s Song\u201d before being pulled away by security.\n\n\u201cWe who believe in freedom shall not rest,\u201d the man sings, seconds after Chief Justice John Roberts warns that any further outburst could result in criminal contempt.\n\nThe group has staged two previous protests and caught both of them on film \u2014 a largely unprecedented feat.\n\nAll electronic equipment including cellphones and other devices are prohibited from the courtroom. The court provides delayed audio records of the proceedings but does not allow video equipment, something a number of lawmakers and other transparency advocates have criticized as being behind the times.\n\nThe activist group has been protesting a pair of previous Supreme Court decisions dealing with campaign finance. But its first protest last February in the court caught attention because of the novelty of sneaking a camera in the generally closed off court.\n\nIn the past, protesters have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and have been banned from the court.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The group has done the same after previous protests.", "description": "The group has done the same after previous protests.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The group has done the same after previous protests.", "title": "Protesters release video of Supreme Court outburst", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/237713-protesters-release-video-of-supreme-court-outburst", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/237713-protesters-release-video-of-supreme-court-outburst", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-02T10:46-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Supreme Court, Protest, camera, 99 Rise,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-02T10:46:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/237713-protesters-release-video-of-supreme-court-outburst", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The group has done the same after previous protests.", "card": "summary", "title": "Protesters release video of Supreme Court outburst"}, "dcterms.title": "Protesters release video of Supreme Court outburst"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25b0\"", "article_summary": "The activist group has been protesting a pair of previous Supreme Court decisions dealing with campaign finance.\nThe video posted Wednesday night by the group 99 Rise appears to show the outburst of five protesters arrested during oral arguments.\nFor the third time in about a year, activists snuck a video recorder into the Supreme Court to catch their protests against a pair of campaign finance decisions.\nThe group has staged two previous protests and caught both of them on film \u2014 a largely unprecedented feat.\nIn the past, protesters have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and have been banned from the court."}
