One of those charities, Islamic Relief USA, received about $13,500 through this process.\n\nIslamic Relief USA is part of a global network of charities that is under the umbrella of Islamic Relief Worldwide. That organization has been accused by one top Israeli official of having links to the terrorist group Hamas. Islamic Relief has denied any such connections. And the way MissionFish worked, there's no indication that Points of Light directed money to Islamic Relief USA or any specific charity.\n\nWe rated the claim Mostly False.\n\nNunn on layoffs\n\nEnding Spending Action Fund was more on target with its first attack ad in the race, claiming Nunn \"earned as much as $300,000 running a nonprofit that had laid off 90 workers.\"\n\nThe claim focuses on Nunn's job when HandsOn Network merged with the Points of Light Foundation. About 90 jobs were lost, and Nunn's salary was increased from $120,000 to $250,000 by her board of directors as she took charge at Points of Light. Her total compensation exceeded $300,000 three years later.\n\nSo the political action committee was on target with the numbers, showing Nunn got a huge raise while some employees were getting pink slips.\n\nBut some context is missing. Layoffs following mergers are common. And a nonprofit's success can hinge on whether the public believes that it's operating as efficiently as possible.\n\nWe rated the statement Mostly True.\n\nNunn and Obamacare\n\nLike Perdue, Nunn has is running as an outsider to traditional politics.\n\nNunn is campaigning as a problem-solver, responding last year to a question about the federal health care program known as Obamacare with an interest to reform, not repeal it. Specifically, she said Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of insurance coverage by rejecting Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe claim was based on research done by the Urban Institute nationally and the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute statewide. That research hasn't\u2019t been reviewed for a second opinion but appears on target.
