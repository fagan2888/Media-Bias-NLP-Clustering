A crash that hurled one vehicle over the median barrier onto a southbound station wagon closed Interstate 225 north of East Sixth Avenue in Aurora for about two hours Saturday afternoon.

Aurora police said a white van and a red SUV were northbound on I-225 when both of them veered into the median. The van stopped in the median but the SUV became airborne and landed on top of a southbound Ford Escort. A loose tire hit a southbound Pontiac.

The driver of the SUV and a child passenger, as well as the driver of the Escort, were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, said Aurora police Sgt. William Revelle.

“It’s incredible,” Revelle said of the fact the injuries weren’t worse or more numerous.”The roadway was busy.”

The accident happened about 3:30 p.m., and the road reopened shortly after 6 p.m. CDOT said southbound I-255 was closed between Sixth Avenue and Alameda.
