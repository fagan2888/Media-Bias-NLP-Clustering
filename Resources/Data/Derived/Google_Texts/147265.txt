The good news for Corey Dickerson on Saturday was his left foot felt much better. He’s starting to quell a multi-day case of plantar fasciitis with some shoe insoles. He’s gellin’.

Bad news is he added a left quad injury. Dickerson fouled a ball off his back leg in the fifth inning before hitting into a double play.

Manager Walt Weiss said the leg was “pretty swollen” and Dickerson needed a sub.

Dickerson had a lighter view.

“I hit some really weird foul balls sometimes,” Dickerson said. “Every now and then, I feel like I can hit anything. And it gets me in trouble.”

Dickerson said the swelling came down after the game and he wasn’t worried about it. It just got tight coming off the field in the fifth.

At the plate against Giants starter Tim Hudson, Dickerson finished 0-for-3. And the Rockies fell to the Giants for the first time this season, 5-4. It was the second time Hudson got through seven innings at Coors Field in nine starts. But he’s never won at Coors Field.

“You have to have a better approach against a guy like that, who’s been around and is really crafty,” Dickerson said.
