(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nWith a chance to get to the Section 1AAA finals for the third straight time, the top-seeded Wingers floored Winona and never let the Winhawks get back into the game with a 71-54 drubbing in the section semifinals at Mayo Civic Arena.\n\n\u201cWe came out with fire,\u201d said senior forward Ty Buck, who finished with 20 points on 6 of 11 shooting with eight assists, six rebounds and two steals. \u201cCoach told us before the game that it\u2019s a section game, not a regular-season game and if we don\u2019t come out on top right away, it\u2019s going to be a tough game all the way through. We came out on top and held it all the way through.\u201d\n\nLed by eight early points from Travis Toivonen, the Wingers sprinted out to a 20-7 lead midway through the first half. The hot start, according to Red Wing head coach Doug Toivonen, was the by-product of two of the team\u2019s best practices of the season building up to Saturday\u2019s game against the Winhawks.\n\n\u201cEverything we talked about, what we needed to do, we did it in practice,\u201d Coach Toivonen said. \u201cWhat you saw in the first half, that\u2019s how we practiced the last two days and the kids were able to transfer that over to the game. It\u2019s real nice to see.\u201d\n\nThe inside game was where Red Wing managed to do the bulk of its damage. Led by Toivonen\u2019s 22 points and 10 rebounds, the Wingers scored 23 second-chance points while out-rebounding Winona 36-17. Ben Miller had 11 points and five rebounds, and Joe Sevlie came off the bench and provided nine rebounds (five offensive) and nine points.\n\n\u201cThe first two games (against Winona) we did a good job of attacking the gaps and getting some things inside,\u201d Coach Toivonen said. \u201cThey play a zone and you\u2019re not always sure who\u2019s going to be down there (in the post). We found if we could get them spread out a little bit, which is what we did, we have good finishers inside.\u201d\n\nTravis Toivonen added, \u201cWe had really good ball movement. A lot of guys had good dribble-penetration and then they had good dishes. We played really good team offense.\u201d\n\nUp 36-18 at halftime, the Wingers (22-6) never took their foot off the accelerator as they led by as much as 28 points midway through the second half.\n\nDonald Ells III led Winona (9-19) with 19 points, with 16 of those coming in the second half. Phillip Appicelli was the only other Winhawk in double digits with 15 points.\n\nUnlike the last two years where Austin awaited Red Wing in the 1AAA finals, the Wingers will face off against second-seeded New Prague with a state berth on the line. Red Wing has already had success against the Trojans with a 66-62 win back on Dec. 20.\n\nThe section title game will take place at 6 p.m. Friday at the Mayo Civic Arena.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pumped. I\u2019ve played in the section finals the last two years and I\u2019ve lost both years,\u201d Buck said. \u201cI\u2019m coming out, me and (fellow captain) Ben Miller are going to come out next Friday with some fire under us, and hopefully the whole team will be with us. I\u2019m sure they will.\u201d\n\nCoach Toivonen added, \u201cWhoever wins this game (between New Prague and Kasson-Mantorville), they\u2019re going to see a really good Red Wing basketball team next Friday. Our kids are going to be excited. It\u2019s going to be a long week, but Friday\u2019s going to come pretty quick and we\u2019re going to be real excited. And hopefully, we can do something different that we haven\u2019t done the last couple years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,wingers,boys basketball,Red Wing", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "ROCHESTER \u2013 Red Wing was in no mood to mess around Saturday.\r\n\r\nWith a chance to get to the Section 1AAA finals for the third straight time, the top-seeded Wingers floored Winona and never let the Winhawks get back into the game with a 71-54 drubbing in the section semifinals at Mayo Civic Arena.\r...", "title": "Boys Basketball: Red Wing dominates Winona, returns to 1AAA title...", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sports/wingers/3689844-boys-basketball-red-wing-dominates-winona-returns-1aaa-title-game", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Ben%20Miller_10.jpg?itok=9a1-iTee", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ROCHESTER \u2013 Red Wing was in no mood to mess around Saturday.\r\n\r\nWith a chance to get to the Section 1AAA finals for the third straight time, the top-seeded Wingers floored Winona and never let the Winhawks get back into the game with a 71-54 drubbing in the section semifinals at Mayo Civic Arena.\r...", "title": "Boys Basketball: Red Wing dominates Winona, returns to 1AAA title...", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sports/wingers/3689844-boys-basketball-red-wing-dominates-winona-returns-1aaa-title-game", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Ben%20Miller_10.jpg?itok=n8FiWdqS", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,wingers,boys basketball,Red Wing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,wingers,boys basketball,Red Wing", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T16:15:13-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Red Wing's Ben Miller takes a jump shot over the Winona defense during the second half of Saturday's Section 1AAA semifinal game at the Mayo Civic Arena in Rochester.
