She received a book entitled, \u201cWeb Sites for Dummies\u201d in response to the failing Obamacare web site.\n\nFrom a report on the state legislator who gave her the book:\n\nThe only warning State Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, gave of what he intended to do at U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 visit to the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library Friday, Nov. 1, was that he would appear \u201cin protest of the visit.\u201d Before it was over, though, he\u2019d done a little more than that. He presented the secretary with a copy of the book \u201cWeb Sites for Dummies,\u201d a jab at her department\u2019s problematic rollout of the federal health insurance website. And a Daily News photo capturing the result \u2013 Sebelius holding the book, the title clearly visible, preparing to hand it off to an aide \u2013 was circulated widely across the Web, garnering coverage everywhere from BuzzFeed to the Huffington Post to the Tennessean and several news blogs, as well as attracting a torrent of social media chatter. \u201cI only had two seconds to convey that message to her, so I thought the book would be a creative way to ensure she remembered the message,\u201d Kelsey said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps that is a sign she should stop doing the promotional tour while the site isn\u2019t working properly,\u201d conservative writer Jim Geraghty responded.\n\nTony Perkins of the Family Research Council talked about the frustration of Americans on Obamacare and pro-lifers on its abortion funding.\n\n\u201cWithout skipping a beat, the HHS chief insisted she didn\u2019t know what she so clearly knew in 2009, which is that ObamaCare is the biggest expansion of taxpayer-funded abortion in U.S. history,\u201d he said of Sebelius\u2019 answers during a hearing last week.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what I don\u2019t know firmly right now,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201c\u2026 I will get that information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we really supposed to believe that one of the most zealous abortion supporters in the Obama administration doesn\u2019t know which plans cover the procedure she\u2019s spent so much of her career advocating? That a woman who fought for late-term abortions in Kansas (and threw a Governor\u2019s mansion party for the criminal performing them) would be in the dark after three years about whether the network she oversees is covering her pet cause? Give me a break,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nPerkins continued: \u201cAt the very least, Americans deserve to know which plans cover the procedure before they enroll. That\u2019s the kind of clarification that Rep. Shimkus asked for \u2014 but never got \u2014 from Secretary Sebelius. And let\u2019s face it: the onus shouldn\u2019t be on citizens to force the government to comply with its law on taxpayer-funded abortion, it should be on HHS. (And don\u2019t forget, funds are sure to flow to abortion through those \u201ccommunity health centers\u201d too.)\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cIf Secretary Sebelius won\u2019t be forthcoming, Congress will be. To call the administration\u2019s bluff, Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) filed a bill, The Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, that demands HHS provide all the insurance details to exchange shoppers up front. He understands that when it comes to ObamaCare, what you don\u2019t know can hurt you \u2014 and hundreds of thousands of unborn children too. Contact your congressman and ask him to cosponsor Smith\u2019s bill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sebelius Gets \"Web Site for Dummies\" Book at Obamacare Promotional Event", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "At a promotional event today for Obamacare, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius got a book from one Americans who shares the frustrations most people across the cou", "title": "Sebelius Gets \u201cWeb Site for Dummies\u201d Book at Obamacare Promotional Event", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/04/sebelius-gets-web-site-for-dummies-book-at-obamacare-promotional-event/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sebelius11-190x126.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "sebelius,kathleen sebelius,web site for dummies,book,obamacare", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6db\"", "article_summary": "She received a book entitled, \u201cWeb Sites for Dummies\u201d in response to the failing Obamacare web site.\nAt a promotional event today for Obamacare, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius got a book from one Americans who shares the frustrations most people across the country are facing over Obamacare.\nHe presented the secretary with a copy of the book \u201cWeb Sites for Dummies,\u201d a jab at her department\u2019s problematic rollout of the federal health insurance website.\nThat\u2019s the kind of clarification that Rep.
