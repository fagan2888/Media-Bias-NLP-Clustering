It struck the cement divider and came to rest facing the wrong direction with no headlight's on.\n\nA second vehicle then stuck the one that crashed. Bell says either someone in the first vehicle was ejected during the crash or got out afterward. That person was then hit by a third vehicle and died at the scene. One other person was taken to a hospital with unknown injuries.\n\nBell says one of the vehicles involved is a commercial motor vehicle.\n\nNorthbound lanes of the Turnpike have reopened, but the Kansas Highway Patrol's CHART had a team en route to investigate.
