Plans must provide the associated medical records and claims, and are required to hire an independent auditor to validate the membership and risk adjustment information. Truven Health is an IVA-qualified vendor with a solution that meets these requirements.\n\nThe Truven Health EDGE Initial Validation Audit solution meets CMS requirements by providing health plans with certified coders to support every stage of the IVA process, including providing up-to-date detailed initial instructions, reviewing EDGE data files to ensure completeness and accuracy, performing chart reviews, and supporting the submission of final audit results. The Truven Health audit and compliance team has more than 20 years\u2019 experience in auditing healthcare claims, and expertise performing claims reviews that include all of the major national insurance carriers and many of the nation\u2019s most widely used third-party administrators. Their medical coders are certified by the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) or the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC).\n\n\u201cACA compliance has been stressful for health plans, but this is one requirement that health plans can\u2019t, by virtue of the law, handle on their own.\u201d said Barb Graovac, senior vice president and general manager at Truven Health Analytics. \u201cBecause reviewing medical records is such a critical part of the validation process, health plans need to be careful to select a vendor with the right experience and certification, or they could be opening themselves up to risk.\u201d\n\nThe Truven Health EDGE team has been closely tracking with CMS on the EDGE and other exchange-related regulations and has a deep working knowledge of the ACA requirements. In addition to partnering with numerous health plans to submit EDGE server data in time to meet the CMS December deadline and processing records for 1 million members, our team of experts created reinsurance models and implemented the CMS do-it-yourself commercial risk model for health plan clients wanting preliminary reimbursement estimates.\n\nTruven Health has claims databases containing 150 million lives, has been working with health plans for more than 20 years, and counts over 125 health plans, third-party administrators, and related organizations as customers.
