Heyman Service to America Medal. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nSuppose you were looking for a lawyer to argue a case before the Supreme Court and this r\u00e9sum\u00e9 crossed your desk:\n\nStarted legal career after being hired by Antonin Scalia. Worked on briefs and legal strategy with John G. Roberts Jr. Mentored Samuel A. Alito Jr. Served as acting solicitor general for President Obama and helped prepare Elena Kagan for her first court argument.\n\nOh, and besides working with four Supreme Court justices, has argued 125 cases there, more than any other practicing lawyer.\n\nThe only problem with trying to hire Edwin S. Kneedler is that you can\u2019t. He is exclusive to one client: the government of the United States.\n\nKneedler has worked at the Justice Department for almost 40 years, the vast majority of that time in the office of the solicitor general, through the administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama.\n\nHe is a career employee \u2014 deputy solicitor general \u2014 in the office whose job it is to represent the government before the Supreme Court and to advocate for the long-term interests of the government while serving the administration of whoever occupies the White House.\n\nThat is where Kneedler is without peer, said the solicitor general, Donald B. Verrilli Jr.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more than the institutional memory \u2014 he\u2019s the institutional conscience,\u201d said Verrilli. \u201cEverything about him embodies the ethos of the office, the principle that the job of the office is to represent the interests of the United States, and that is a nonpartisan obligation.\u201d\n\nOne of Verrilli\u2019s Republican predecessors, Paul D. Clement, offers a similar assessment. \u201cEd is the consummate public servant,\u201d said Clement, as well as a \u201cbrilliant lawyer\u2019s lawyer.\u201d\n\nAlito said he knows what to expect when Kneedler is before the court.\n\n\u201cWhenever Ed is on the brief or is arguing, I know \u2014 and I won\u2019t speak for my colleagues, but I bet they all feel the same way \u2014 we\u2019re getting the best possible argument that can be made for the position that he is defending.\u201d\n\nSuch accolades are the reason Kneedler is a finalist for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal, recognizing federal employees for their career service. The winners of the awards, given in several categories, will be announced at a gala Sept. 22.\n\nLike Kneedler, Alito\u2019s legal career was based in government service before President George W. Bush nominated him to the Supreme Court in 2006. He served in the solicitor general\u2019s office from 1981 to1985, and he and Kneedler shared adjoining offices. (Perhaps because \u201cI think we were the quietest ones,\u201d Kneedler said.)\n\nAlito said he often worked late at night, leaving just in time to catch the last Metro to Virginia. When he tapped on the door between them, Kneedler was always in his book-filled space. He had worked all day, had gone home for dinner with his family and had returned to the office.\n\n\u201cWhenever I was struggling and wanted to bounce an idea off somebody, he\u2019d always have time to talk to me and was very, very helpful,\u201d Alito said.\n\nIn that way, Alito was like many who passed through the solicitor general\u2019s office and sought Kneedler\u2019s guidance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the encyclopedia of law,\u201d said Lisa Blatt, a Supreme Court practitioner in private practice who spent much of her career at the solicitor general\u2019s office.\n\nShe said Kneedler was so in demand by his colleagues preparing for Supreme Court arguments that he had to hide out to work on his own cases. After they discovered his favorite spot in the law library, Kneedler at times decamped to an Au Bon Pain down the street.\n\n\u201cHe had to leave the building to get work done,\u201d she said.\n\nKneedler, though, describes his legal career as somewhat accidental. He went to Lehigh University intending to be an engineer. He became a math major before settling on economics. After graduation, he went west, a VISTA volunteer working in Oregon.\n\nHe saw the ways attorneys were able to improve the lives of migrant workers, and his older brother Lane encouraged him to apply to the University of Virginia Law School, where Lane was on the faculty.\n\nKneedler returned to the west to clerk for a federal judge and then applied to the Justice Department, thinking he would end up in the environmental law section. Instead, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 made its way to Scalia, who was then head of the Office of Legal Counsel. Four years later, he was recommended for a job at the solicitor general\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a real privilege,\u201d Kneedler said in an interview. \u201cI feel really fortunate, and I\u2019m also very aware of how fortuity affects people\u2019s life path.\u201d\n\nHe has argued and presented a range of issues to the court, including immigration and tribal law. He mentions among his favorites: dense separation of powers cases \u2014 such as challenging the constitutionality of legislative vetoes by only one house of Congress \u2014 that require a deep dive into history.\n\n\u201cIt is so fascinating to me to go back and read all the founding-era documents about the legislative process that we all learned about in grade school,\u201d Kneedler said.\n\nThe biggest case he participated in, he said, would be the defense of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which the court mostly upheld on a 5-to-4 opinion by Roberts.\n\n\u201cThat was more pressure than any other,\u201d Kneedler said, with the debate \u201cso public and so intense.\u201d\n\nThe appeals process dominated a year of his life, and Verrilli said Kneedler\u2019s involvement was crucial to the outcome.\n\nWhich is not the same as saying Kneedler favored the act. Both Republicans and Democrats who have worked with Kneedler say they have no idea about his political leanings.\n\n\u201cThere are not many people you meet in Washington like Ed,\u201d said Verrilli, a Democrat. \u201cEd doesn\u2019t filter legal questions through a political prism. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a liberal or conservative.\u201d\n\nClement, a Republican, said he agrees. Kneedler\u2019s concern is that a new administration changes policy the way it should \u2014 through rule-making and the legislative process \u2014 instead of the \u201cback door of simply changing legal opinions.\u201d\n\nKneedler said it has not been hard to work for solicitors general of widely divergent ideological views because of the traditions of the office.\n\n\u201cPolitical philosophy has almost nothing to do with the SG\u2019s job, and in my experience the SGs have put their opinions to one side,\u201d Kneedler said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great strength of the office that it has that tradition.\u201d\n\nAlmost everyone who knows Kneedler is surprised to hear that he is 68, his somewhat boyish face offset by a thick gray beard. \u201cHe is kind of ageless; he doesn\u2019t look very much different than when I was in the office,\u201d Alito said. \u201cMaybe his beard is a little bit shorter.\u201d\n\nMany lawyers use experience in the solicitor general\u2019s office to build multimillion-dollar private appellate practices, but Kneedler said the life never appealed to him. He comes from a long line of public servants; when he argues a case before the Supreme Court, he wears cufflinks handed down from his grandfather, a high school civics teacher.\n\n\u201cI love what I do, I like working for the government,\u201d Kneedler said. \u201cI just feel like I found my calling.\u201d\n\nAfter so many appearances at the Supreme Court, when was the last time he was nervous?\n\n\u201cThe last time I argued a case,\u201d he replied. That\u2019s how it should be, he said.\n\n\u201cA certain amount of anxiety, a certain amount of edge of being on the ball and having your answers down \u2014 for me at least is driven by some combination of wanting to do the best I can, not wanting to look like an idiot, trying to anticipate the questions and trying to be helpful to the court,\u201d Kneedler said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Edwin S.
