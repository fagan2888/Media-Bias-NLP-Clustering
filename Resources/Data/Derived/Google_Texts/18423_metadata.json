(Photo by Matt McClain/ The Washington Post)\n\nA new report with this diagnosis is particularly timely as Congress again toys with the American public and its workforce with another threat to shut down the government.\n\nThe title of the report, \u201cGovernment Disservice,\u201d by the Partnership for Public Service, aptly describes what Congress does when it leads the country to the brink of a shutdown, as it is doing now, or worse, as was the case two years ago when a partial shutdown closed many government operations for 16 days.\n\nRepublican opposition to federal funding for Planned Parenthood could result in government workers being sent home and offices closing their doors after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. That\u2019s getting close, yet an informal Washington Post survey indicates a number of staffers so far have heard nothing from their agencies.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even received an email this year about the possibility, but nothing new,\u201d said Victoria Nellon, an IRS employee in Atlanta. \u201cThey only tell us what they have to and that\u2019s at the last minute most times.\u201d\n\nThat uncertainty has practical ramifications.\n\n\u201cMy refrigerator went out, but I can\u2019t replace it until I know there is no shutdown because I need to save my cash to pay my normal bills if I don\u2019t get paid on time,\u201d said Shirley Prichard, a Department of Homeland Security employee in Missouri.\n\n[A government shutdown: What federal employees need to know about their pay and benefits]\n\nThe failure of Congress to approve spending bills \u201chas become a way of life in Washington, creating tremendous uncertainty and multiple management and financial inefficiencies for government agencies,\u201d the Partnership, a nonprofit think tank on federal government management and workforce issues, said in the report released last week.\n\n\u201cThe negative effect on the ability of the agencies to fulfill their missions has often seemed to be of little concern to many lawmakers, some of whom are focused on using the appropriations process to win specific policy battles or to control spending and reduce the federal budget deficit.\u201d\n\nComplaints about partisan gridlock are not new. But this report should be read by members of Congress, particularly Republicans, because it examines \u201cthe profound way\u201d their hyper-partisan political acrimony undercuts the ability of government agencies and staffers to service the public.\n\n[Van Hollen on government shutdown: Patients will be turned away from NIH]\n\nTwo examples \u2014 preparing for a shutdown distracts managers from day-to-day operations and uncertain funding leads to hiring freezes, recruitment difficulties and morale problems.\n\nFederal employees know that only too well.\n\n\u201cI love what I do and I\u2019m proud of what I do. I believe I serve the American people,\u201d Mark Horowitz, a senior music specialist at the Library of Congress, told the Federal Diary by e-mail. \u201cBut it feels like we\u2019re being used as pawns by our congressional bosses who have little respect for what many of us do (and in most cases probably have little idea), our time, or the actual wasting of taxpayer dollars that result in these shutdowns (and the preparations for them).\n\n\u201cThese shutdowns\u201d is right.\n\nBased on reporting by The Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog, the 2013 closure over funding for the Affordable Care Act was the 18th partial closure since 1976.
