Neither man is qualified to be elected president, and neither can beat Democrat Hillary Clinton, but together they have been polling at about half the Republican primary vote for months. Why do so many Republicans treat the presidency so lightly?\n\nFor millions of Americans, the White House is not something to be captured, but something to be resisted. Some of the GOP\u2019s most loyal voters see their party as a dissident force against President Obama and against the demographic changes in America that he represents. They see the Republican Party as a bulwark against an expanding federal government (epitomized by \u201cObamacare\u201d) and a counterrevolutionary movement against social \u201cexperiments\u201d such as same-sex marriage (which exists) and a ban on gun ownership (which is politically impossible). By this thinking, it\u2019s more important to keep control of Congress, and as many state governments as possible, than to win the White House\u2014which constantly moves forward, like a shark, in search of greater power no matter which party controls it. What has the presidency gotten small-government conservatives since Ronald Reagan, anyway?\n\nThe GOP as resistance movement explains the curious situation in the House of Representatives, where a faction known as the Freedom Caucus seems to want Republican control without Republican leadership. \u201cWe\u2019re really tired of the top-down, micromanagement where you have just a few people, or in this case just the speaker and his team, determining the outcome,\u201d Rep. Justin Amash (R-Michigan) told Politico after outgoing House Speaker John Boehner reached an agreement with the Obama administration to raise the U.S. debt limit through March 2017 and thus eliminate the threats of a government shutdown or debt default until after the next presidential elections. (Paul Ryan, Mr. Boehner\u2019s presumptive replacement, quickly agreed, saying of the collaborative effort, \u201cI think the process stinks\u201d and \u201cunder new management we are not going to do the people's business this way.\u201d Mr. Ryan is under suspicion for his past support of Mr. Boehner\u2019s efforts to appease the White House by keeping open the federal government.)\n\nBut \u201ctop-down\u201d management is what the presidency is all about, and Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson are as guilty as any of the candidates in giving the impression they could and would act unilaterally as president. (Mr. Trump, author of The Art of the Deal, has little to offer voters other than his ability to intimidate people during business negotiations.) GOP voters would surely relish a defeat of Hillary Clinton next November, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine a Republican president unifying his or her party for more than a few hours after the inauguration speech. (Or, in Ted Cruz\u2019s case, a few hours after his ripping \u201cto shreds\u201d the Obama administration\u2019s treasonous nuclear deal with Iran.)\n\nThe Republican Party as resistance movement also explains its obsession with proving the illegitimacy of Democratic presidents (see the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the conspiracy theories, encouraged by Mr. Trump, about President Obama\u2019s birthplace) and the Benghazi hearings conducted by House Republicans, with their insinuations that President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton cared nothing about the deaths of four Americans by terrorists in Libya in 2012.\n\nAnd it explains the recent rise of Mr. Carson, who combines a low-key speaking style with some of the most inflammatory rhetoric in the presidential campaign. A recent Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll found that 81 percent of those likely to attend the Iowa Republican caucuses found it \u201cattractive\u201d that Mr. Carson called the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) the \u201cworst thing since slavery.\u201d According to the same poll, 77 percent found it attractive that Mr. Carson \u201chas said that Hitler might not have been as successful if the people had been armed.\u201d These are the sentiments of voters looking not for responsible leadership, but instead for the standard-bearer of an insurrection.\n\nNot surprisingly, onetime frontrunner Jeb Bush is getting crankier by the continued attention given to Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson, and he seems increasingly likely to blurt out, \u201cTake this job and shove it.\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke,\u201d Mr. Bush said at a town hall meeting in South Carolina. \u201cElect Trump if you want that.\u201d) And last weekend\u2019s New York Times story about the Bush family\u2019s professed befuddlement about their declining power is exactly what Mr. Bush doesn\u2019t need if he is to shed the perception that he feels entitled to hold the presidency. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, rose in the polls after the last Republican debate but has slid back under 10 percent (as of October 23) after being dubbed the new frontrunner among the Establishment candidates.\n\nMr. Bush and Mr. Rubio have not been helped by the reluctance of Republican elected officials to stick their heads up and act like leaders. As FiveThirtyEight.com reports, there have been fewer endorsements by major Republicans than at any comparable time in recent history; Mr. Bush leads the pack with endorsements from just three U.S. senators and zero governors. (The most successful at picking up endorsements this early in the process was George W. Bush ahead of the 2000 election.) The dilemma for Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio is that neither is likely to become the nominee without the help of party leaders, but they\u2019re running in a party whose voters seem repelled by the very idea of leadership. Perhaps Mr. Bush will become so agitated during the debate that he\u2019ll declare, \u201cIf elected, I will not serve!\u201d and thereby finally win the respect of Republican primary voters.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/republicans-are-no-longer-political-party-resistance-movement", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "parsely-title": "Republicans Are No Longer a Political Party but a Resistance Movement", "twitter": {"url": "http://americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/republicans-are-no-longer-political-party-resistance-movement", "description": "For many Americans, the White House is not something to be captured, but something to be resisted.", "card": "summary", "title": "The GOP voters who refuse to be led"}, "description": "For many Americans, the White House is not something to be captured, but something to be resisted.", "og": {"site_name": "America Magazine", "description": "For many Americans, the White House is not something to be captured, but something to be resisted.", "title": "The GOP voters who refuse to be led", "url": "http://americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/republicans-are-no-longer-political-party-resistance-movement", "image": "http://americamagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/media/2015/blog/images/screen_shot_2015-10-27_at_4.00.00_pm_0.png?itok=Js8L4ZGC", "updated_time": "2015-10-29T16:15:39-04:00", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "(Un)Conventional Wisdom,Blogs", "parsely-post-id": 220013, "parsely-author": "Robert David Sullivan", "parsely-section": "(Un)Conventional Wisdom", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-27T15:51:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-29T16:15:39-04:00"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://americamagazine.org/sites/default/files/media/2015/blog/images/screen_shot_2015-10-27_at_4.00.00_pm_0.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-28T09:30:00-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd78a6\"", "article_summary": "(Mr. Trump, author of The Art of the Deal, has little to offer voters other than his ability to intimidate people during business negotiations.)\nThat is a joke,\u201d Mr. Bush said at a town hall meeting in South Carolina.\nAnd it explains the recent rise of Mr. Carson, who combines a low-key speaking style with some of the most inflammatory rhetoric in the presidential campaign.\nPerhaps Mr. Bush will become so agitated during the debate that he\u2019ll declare, \u201cIf elected, I will not serve!\u201d and thereby finally win the respect of Republican primary voters.\nMr. Bush and Mr. Rubio have not been helped by the reluctance of Republican elected officials to stick their heads up and act like leaders."}
