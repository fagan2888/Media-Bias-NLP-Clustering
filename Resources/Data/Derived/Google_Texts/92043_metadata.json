James Neal\u2019s goal at 1:02 of the third period tied it, and Mike Fisher made it 3-2 with his ninth of the season at 9:44 before the Predators added empty-netters from Shea Weber and Mikka Salomaki.\n\n\u201cOur third period needs to be better,\u201d said Avalanche coach Patrick Roy. \u201cIf you look at our record in the last four games we\u2019re 1-3, and in all those games we were even or ahead going into the third period. We need to be smarter in the third period. We have to learn how to play those situations much better.\u201d\n\nSaid defenseman Erik Johnson: \u201cThat was a tough one to forget right away. But you have to move on to the next one.\u201d\n\nThe Predators haven\u2019t lost in regulation in 12 games, going 8-0-4 during that stretch, and with 78 points and a six-point lead on Minnesota, they now seem likely to claim at least the first Western wild card and even have climbed to within five points of third- place St. Louis in the Central Division. So what not long ago seemed a three-team race for the West\u2019s two wild cards has come down to the Wild and Avalanche for the final slot.\n\n\u201cMost of their goals were kind of broken plays,\u201d Avalanche goalie Calvin Pickard said of the Predators. \u201cI got off to a good start, and our team was playing well the first couple of periods. A couple of bounces went their way in the third, and that was the difference in the hockey game. We\u2019re still there, we\u2019re two points back, but we can\u2019t let this turn into a losing streak.\u201d\n\nOn Nashville\u2019s third goal, after Pickard bobbled the puck and defenseman Andrew Bodnarchuk\u2019s one-handed attempt to get it out of trouble failed, Fisher \u2014 whose wife, singer Carrie Underwood, will follow the Predators into the Pepsi Center for a March 30 concert \u2014 put it past Pickard.\n\n\u201cIt was going about six feet wide, and I just wanted to get something on it in case it hit that crowd in front,\u201d Pickard said. \u201cIt just kind of laid there, and there was kind of a lull there for a couple of seconds, and all of a sudden (Fisher) had it right on his tape in front and he made a good shot over the pad, and that was the difference.\u201d\n\nBlake Comeau and Gabe Landeskog scored the Colorado goals, and Pickard finished with 35 saves.\n\nPickard made 15 saves while holding the Predators scoreless in the first period \u2014 meaning he had 39 saves in a two-period span, starting with a franchise-record 24 in the third against Florida on Thursday.\n\nEach of the Predators\u2019 first two goals \u2014 from Filip Forsberg at 15:30 of the first period and then Neal\u2019s \u2014 came off Colorado turnovers, and Neal\u2019s score came when he was unattended and knocked in a loose puck in front off the rush.\n\nJohnson hadn\u2019t gotten completely back on the play, and it was a continuation of the Avalanche\u2019s top defensive pair, Johnson and Francois Beauchemin, having an inconsistent season, albeit while playing major minutes and often against top lines.\n\nHow are they playing?\n\n\u201cI think you know the answer to that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNot as well as we did at the start of the year. We have to be better, for sure. It\u2019s probably lots of different areas, but I think the biggest thing is our gaps aren\u2019t as good off the rush. When we play against top lines, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in their faces enough. I think we back off a little bit too much. We have to be a little bit more aggressive. We might be a little on our heels. We have to play more in-your-face hockey.\u201d\n\nRoy said: \u201cI thought E.J. had a better game today. He knows he could bring more. Things haven\u2019t gone the way I\u2019m sure they want. They\u2019ve got a lot of ice time, and those things happen.\u201d\n\nThe third game in the Avs\u2019 four-game homestand is Monday night against the Arizona Coyotes.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche falters in third period, losing 5-2 to Nashville Predators", "title": "Avalanche falters in third period, losing 5-2 to Nashville Predators", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/05/avalanche-falters-in-third-period-losing-5-2-to-nashville-predators/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305_040122_avs-predators-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305_040122_avs-predators-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T15:54:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:43:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMost of their goals were kind of broken plays,\u201d Avalanche goalie Calvin Pickard said of the Predators.\n\u201cOur third period needs to be better,\u201d said Avalanche coach Patrick Roy.\nSo what not long ago seemed a three-team race for the West\u2019s two wild cards has come down to the Wild and Avalanche for the final slot.\nThe Avalanche had a 2-1 lead after two periods before a familiar pattern unfolded.\n\u201cIf you look at our record in the last four games we\u2019re 1-3, and in all those games we were even or ahead going into the third period."}
