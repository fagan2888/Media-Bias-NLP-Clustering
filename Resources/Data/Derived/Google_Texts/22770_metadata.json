She tried out scores of occupations \u2013 clown, lion tamer, stewardess, farmer, ballerina \u2014 and wrote about them. Her first-person accounts were engaging, funny and often insightful. She also covered society news, interviewed movie stars and occasionally wrote about fishing. Burns left the paper in 1940 to marry John Shanard, later a Cargill executive, and moved to Washington, D.C. She went on to play leadership roles in state Republican politics, helped plan a Republican state convention and headed former Laker George Mikan\u2019s congressional campaign. She died in May 2006 at age 92.\n\nWomen Singing in Bathtub\n\nBy MARJORIE BURNS\n\nStaff Writer for The Star\n\nIf you are a woman and you sing in the bathtub you are making someone unhappy.\n\nAnd if you don't sing in the bathtub, you yourself must be unhappy.\n\nSo starting with the premise that you can\u2019t win either way, we\u2019ll progress from there.\n\nFirst, singing in the bathtub is supposedly not only the right but also the duty and desire of every cheery individual. So it is taken for granted that women, being equally as good-natured as men, would like to sing in the bathtub.\n\nBut do they sing in the bathtub?\n\nThat all depends on their regard for the comfort of others, it seems.\n\n* * *\n\nThis little bather from about 1935, identified in the archived caption as the \u201cNascher baby,\u201d looks like she had plenty to sing about. (Photo courtesy of mnhs.org)\n\nIn the words of Abe Pepinsky, professor of music at the University of Minnesota:\n\n\u201cBecause of the high frequency of a woman\u2019s voice in a bathroom it resounds with a sensation of pain.\u201d\n\nThe whole controversy was started by Sir James Jeans, the astronomer, in his new book, \u201cScience and Music.\u201d He refers to singing in the bathroom as a \u201cpeculiarly male pleasure.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the high reflecting walls in the bathroom make the oral harmony in a man\u2019s voice pleasing, whereas the oral harmony in a woman\u2019s voice would be beyond the audible range.\n\nWhat you do hear is unpleasant.\n\n* * *\n\nIn a confined space like a bathroom, notes below middle C will reflect several feet, go echoing round and resound in all their richness. This is not true of higher tones which have too short a wave length.\n\nSo women, if you feel a song coming on, get out in the wide open spaces and let it go. For there you have just as good a chance as the men.\n\nBut whether it sounds so well or not, women everywhere are standing on their rights and exercising the feminine prerogative to sing in the bath if they want to.\n\n* * *\n\nNow take the Kappa Alpha Thetas at the University of Minnesota. On an upper floor of their house, far from complaining masculine ears, they lustily whoop up \u201cFeet Are Too Big\u201d day after day as they scrub.\n\nThe Gamma Phis cannot be budged from their claim that they don\u2019t sing while bathing. All of which proves either they aren\u2019t happy or they\u2019re too considerate to force the \u201csensation of pain\u201d upon others.", "article_metadata": {"description": "&nbsp;     &nbsp; .", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "&nbsp;     &nbsp; .", "title": "Dec. 6, 1937: Singing in the bathroom?
