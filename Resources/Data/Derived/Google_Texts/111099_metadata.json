He insisted, like most players, he would do anything to make it happen. Monday, he begins following through on his promise as the Broncos listed Sanders as their top punt returner.\n\nFans reacted over the weekend with concern, with one tweeting he was worried about Sanders getting hurt on special teams.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not championship mentality,\u201d Sanders responded.\n\n\n\nThe Broncos considered using Sanders late last season after Isaiah Burse struggled, but settled on Wes Welker. Sanders finished with one return for 11 yards. He has never returned punts regularly. He boasts a career high of nine returns for 93 yards for Pittsburgh in 2012. The Broncos ranked in the bottom third in punt return yardage last season as Burse failed to gain traction.\n\nGM John Elway gets his wish on this move. Elway said Saturday the Broncos didn\u2019t need to add another returner because they already had one on the roster. At that point, Omar Bolden was still listed as the top punt returner. That changed Monday.\n\nCreating more intrigue is the fact that Sanders did not play in the preseason because of a hamstring injury. He insists he will be ready to go. And that applies, now, to all roles.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Emmanuel Sanders,Gary Kubiak,John Elway,Omar Bolden", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders topped the Broncos' depth chart on punt return despite missing the preseason with a hamstring injury.", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders tops depth chart at punt return", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/09/07/emmanuel-sanders-tops-broncos-depth-chart-at-punt-return/35356/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/457740658-495x357.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders topped the Broncos' depth chart on punt return despite missing the preseason with a hamstring injury.", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders tops Broncos\u2019 depth chart at punt return", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/09/07/emmanuel-sanders-tops-broncos-depth-chart-at-punt-return/35356/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/457740658-495x357.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders topped the Broncos' depth chart on punt return despite missing the preseason with a hamstring injury."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7e5\"", "article_summary": "Monday, he begins following through on his promise as the Broncos listed Sanders as their top punt returner.\nThe Broncos ranked in the bottom third in punt return yardage last season as Burse failed to gain traction.\nAt that point, Omar Bolden was still listed as the top punt returner.\nWhen Emmanuel Sanders arrived in Denver, he made headlines, proclaiming he landed in \u201cwide receiver heaven.\u201d Lost in the quote was Sanders\u2019 desire to win a championship.\nThe Broncos considered using Sanders late last season after Isaiah Burse struggled, but settled on Wes Welker."}
