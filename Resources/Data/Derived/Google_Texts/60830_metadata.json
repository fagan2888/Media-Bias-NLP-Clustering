Just how bad is it? Under your watch, only 58 bills became law last year. That\u2019s 30 less than the previously least productive Congress. President Harry Truman dubbed the Congress of 1947-49 the \u201cDo-Nothing Congress,\u201d which at this point had passed 395 bills! President Truman would be stunned by this Congress.\n\nSpeaker Boehner, you will no doubt reply that passing laws isn\u2019t always a good thing \u2014 and I agree. But we in Nevada have real needs, and you are ignoring them. Nationally, there are three job seekers for every job opening. Nevadans are still dealing with the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rate and an economy that is stuck in first gear. Because of your \u201cleadership,\u201d they must now face it without emergency unemployment insurance.\n\nUndocumented immigrants who want nothing more than to come out of the shadows, gain a reasonable path to citizenship and pay their taxes while working hard like the rest of us are instead having their families torn apart by our broken immigration system. Even though the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform months ago, you and House Republicans have refused to hold a vote on bipartisan legislation.\n\nBusinesses and workers are still trying to recover from the unnecessary government shutdown you caused late last year. Many of those affected locally are in Congressional District 3, including Lake Mead tour operators and businesses in Boulder City.\n\nYour good friend Rep. Joe Heck should be outraged by what you, as speaker, have done and not done. But Joe Heck is a follower, and you\u2019re the leader. So Joe Heck invited you to Las Vegas for a swanky $2,500-a-plate fundraiser at the Las Vegas Country Club on Friday so he could boast to his friends about how close he is to his leader.\n\nSadly for Nevadans, Joe Heck is following a misguided leadership that makes life more difficult for Nevadans. When all is said and done, Heck is on your side and will do what you want. He has proved that over and over again, voting with leadership nine times out of 10. Therefore, middle-class Nevadans either need you to change and begin allowing votes on bills that benefit our economy, or we need to send someone new to Congress who will take you on.\n\nHere in Nevada, we know a little something about odds. And the odds of you or Joe Heck changing are not in our favor. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for Congress.\n\nThanks for visiting my hometown, Speaker Boehner. Hopefully you took a look around and noticed the real human toll of your do-nothing Congress. If you stopped to support our local economy somewhere between the airport and your lunch with Joe Heck, hopefully you made sure to tip your server well.\n\nErin Bilbray is a Democratic candidate for Nevada\u2019s 3rd Congressional District.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/bilbray-boehner-s-leadership-hurts-nevadans", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "ERIN BILBRAY SPECIAL TO THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Bilbray: Boehner\u2019s \u2018leadership\u2019 hurts Nevadans", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_boehnerprotest_011713JL_05_4.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "Thanks for visiting Las Vegas, Speaker Boehner!", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/bilbray-boehner-s-leadership-hurts-nevadans", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_boehnerprotest_011713JL_05_4.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_boehnerprotest_011713JL_04_4.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_boehnerprotest_011713JL_02_4.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_boehnerprotest_011713JL_03_4.jpg"}, "title": "Bilbray: Boehner\u2019s \u2018leadership\u2019 hurts Nevadans", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-19T08:03:09Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-837811"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=787957", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=787957", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "ERIN BILBRAY SPECIAL TO THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "keywords": "Opinion,,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T00:03:09-08:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Thanks for visiting Las Vegas, Speaker Boehner!", "title": "Bilbray: Boehner\u2019s \u2018leadership\u2019 hurts Nevadans", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/bilbray-boehner-s-leadership-hurts-nevadans", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_boehnerprotest_011713JL_05_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "Thanks for visiting Las Vegas, Speaker Boehner!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd60b\"", "article_summary": "Sadly for Nevadans, Joe Heck is following a misguided leadership that makes life more difficult for Nevadans.\nAnd the odds of you or Joe Heck changing are not in our favor.\nYour good friend Rep.
