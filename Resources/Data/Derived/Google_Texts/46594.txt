To the Editor:

Re “Czech Republic: President to Skip Parade in Moscow” (World Briefing, April 11): The United States government and our European allies have been imposing economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation on Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in an effort to dissuade him from further military involvement in the conflict in Ukraine and for his annexation of Crimea. This diplomatic effort apparently includes a planned boycott of the military parade in Moscow on May 9.

On that Victory Day, Russians will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the 1945 surrender of Nazi Germany and the Allied victory in Europe in World War II. The Soviet people paid a terrible price for that victory: more than 20 million total deaths, including more than 8 million military deaths — a majority of all Allied deaths in the European theater of war.

To pay due respect to the few surviving war veterans, and to honor that great sacrifice of the Russian people to our shared historic cause, President Obama himself should be present in Moscow on Victory Day, but not attend the parade’s show of military force. Instead, he should lay a commemorative wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a place sacred to the Russian people. That would be an act of statesmanship worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
