The White House on Wednesday blasted a House bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, calling the legislation “disgraceful.”

The measure — which underwent significant changes in the past several months after some Republicans objected to a provision requiring rape victims to report the assault to law enforcement — stands little chance of becoming law, despite the adjustments made by GOP leaders.

The bill no longer requires women to report rape cases to the police and instead calls on abortion providers to make sure victims have had access to counseling and medical care.

But that change and others won’t be enough to change President Obama’s position on the bill. The White House left no doubt Wednesday that Mr. Obama would veto the legislation.

“The bill continues to add harsh burdens to the survivors of sexual assault, rape and incest, who are already enduring unimaginable hardship. … It’s disgraceful,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.
