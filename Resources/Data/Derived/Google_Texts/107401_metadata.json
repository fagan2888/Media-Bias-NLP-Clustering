William Hoagland, a senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Republican Senate Budget Committee staff director, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cSo let\u2019s just accept the fact that that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to do budgeting and appropriating in the future.\u201d\n\nRetiring House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and White House officials quietly negotiated a two-year budget deal unveiled late Monday that would increase federal spending on defense and domestic programs by $80 billion, increase the Treasury\u2019s borrowing authority through March 2017, block cuts in Social Security Disability Insurance payments and a stiff 50 percent increase in Medicare Part B premiums for millions of seniors.\n\nThe agreement \u2013 while far from perfect \u2013 satisfied many conservative Republicans by providing more funding for defense and achieving some entitlement savings, and pleased the White House by boosting domestic spending by an equal amount. The deal also calls for an additional $32 billion over the next two years for U.S. military action in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The agreement should clear the House today and the Senate no later than early next week.\n\nRelated: Boehner\u2019s Last Stand \u2014 A Budget Deal That Raises the Debt Ceiling\n\nPresident Obama hailed the budget deal during a speech in Chicago yesterday, saying, \u201cIt allows us to plan for the future.\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told Politico, \u201cThis would take away a very big potential negative and remove a serious threat at a time that the economy feels a little fragile.\u201d\n\nThis desire for more certainty and dependability in the budget process is at the crux of the long-term but unsuccessful drive for a move to a two-year budget process, much like the one that has been used over the years by many states.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), Boehner\u2019s heir apparent, spoke for many conservatives declaring that the closed-door, secretive process for reaching the budget agreement \u201cstinks\u201d and needs to be reformed. Yet Ryan announced earlier today that he would vote for the agreement. Two years ago, Ryan, then chair of the House Budget Committee, sat behind closed doors with then-Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray and negotiated another two-year budget deal very similar to the one now before Congress that suspended the sequester and boosted spending for defense and domestic programs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For decades, proposals for shifting the cumbersome, often exasperating congressional b", "title": "How Congress Stealthily Shifted to a Two-Year Budget Process", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/28/How-Congress-Stealthily-Shifted-Two-Year-Budget-Process", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112012_Congress_Spending_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/28/How-Congress-Stealthily-Shifted-Two-Year-Budget-Process", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112012_Congress_Spending_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For decades, proposals for shifting the cumbersome, often exasperating congressional b", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23cc\"", "article_summary": "For decades, proposals for shifting the cumbersome, often exasperating congressional budget process from once a year to once every two years were a legislative pipe dream.\nTwo years ago, Ryan, then chair of the House Budget Committee, sat behind closed doors with then-Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray and negotiated another two-year budget deal very similar to the one now before Congress that suspended the sequester and boosted spending for defense and domestic programs.\nRep.
