I believe we\u2019re seeing another major shift, and this one is all about the employee experience.\n\nBeing successful in 2014 is all about the intersection of the employee and the customer, because employees are the fabric that binds your customers to your brand. Your employees know how to make your customers happy better than you do. It\u2019s those on the front lines that make the real difference. These are the people that build brand loyalty and turn customers in advocates. Ignore this fundamental truth at your own risk.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying to abandon your customer engagement programs. What I\u2019m saying is to build out your employee engagement program in conjunction, because happy employees help to build stronger, more successful businesses.\n\nWith this in mind, here are two resolutions to give startups the insight they need to kick off the New Year.\n\nEngage with employees or suffer the consequences.\n\nThe effects of having an unengaged workforce are far too great to ignore. Gallup\u2019s recent \u201cState of the American Workplace\u201d study found that active workplace disengagement costs American businesses between $450 and $550 billion per year.\n\nSo before a company can even begin to provide its customers with the best possible experience, it must first make sure that its own house is in order. In other words, make sure that your employees are fully engaged.\n\nDo you know if your employees would recommend your company to a friend? Do staff members feel that their talents are being well utilized? Are employees passionate about their work? If you don\u2019t know the answers then find out now, because employees are an organizations biggest asset or its greatest liability.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, with more and more Millennials entering today\u2019s workplace, those companies and leaders who learn about them and what they require as a workforce will be the ones to succeed. I\u2019m not saying that you have to ride a horse through your office to excite your employees (although I have done this) but Millennials admire new and creative approaches to management styles and work environments.\n\nBy instilling an ethos of creativity and radical transparency, employees are more likely to increase productivity and engagement in the workplace. In turn, as these employees become knitted into the fabric of the business, and you develop a team singularly focused on the customer experience, your customers will always reap the benefits.\n\nDo everything you can to keep the customer happy.\n\nAgain, don\u2019t get rid of your customer experience programs. Grow them instead. Take them to the next level, because today\u2019s customers are more demanding then ever before.\n\nThere are real advantages to having constant open dialogue with customers. This lets you identify both the opportunities and the challenges in your business and allows you to address them as quickly as possible.\n\nI believe that companies should be available and responsive to customers both in person and online. For example, surveys are an excellent vehicle for communicating and engaging with clients personally and directly to understand what they like and don\u2019t like, for what they need and for how you can serve them better.\n\nAnd honestly you\u2019ll never create customer advocacy if you don\u2019t act on customer feedback. It\u2019s simple. Your customers are dying to tell you what they think! Don\u2019t believe me? Just ask.\n\nAsk your customer\u2019s opinions, make real change based on this feedback and then share the love with them. Thank them for the help. Articulate how you\u2019ll use their voice to improve your product or service. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to form genuine relationships with the people that you exist to serve.\n\nGoing beyond the Internet, organizations must also actively seek opportunities to be present with their customers in person. Face-to-face interactions are extremely powerful. It establishes trust in a way that you just can\u2019t build online.\n\nAs with any business year, there will be companies that thrive and companies that fade away. But by taking the time to truly understand and gain insight into your customers and your employees, you can ensure that 2014\u2019s New Year\u2019s celebration will last well beyond January 1.\n\nFollow @Qualtrics\n\nFollow @WSJstartup\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "GUEST MENTOR", "title": "Ryan Smith: The Intersection of Employee and Customer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2013/12/23/ryan-smith-the-intersection-of-employee-and-customer/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Small Business", "article.headline": "Ryan Smith: The Intersection of Employee and Customer", "description": "GUEST MENTOR", "article_section": "Small Business", "author": "Caitlin Huston", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Accelerators Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Accelerators", "article.summary": "GUEST MENTOR", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-23T19:49:16-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2013/12/23/ryan-smith-the-intersection-of-employee-and-customer/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-232B-2151", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Small Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "GUEST MENTOR", "title": "Ryan Smith: The Intersection of Employee and Customer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2013/12/23/ryan-smith-the-intersection-of-employee-and-customer/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Accelerators", "article.id": "BL-232B-2151", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-09T15:47:52-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce242\"", "article_summary": "Being successful in 2014 is all about the intersection of the employee and the customer, because employees are the fabric that binds your customers to your brand.\nBut being a successful business in 2014 means more than simply providing great customer experiences.\nAnd honestly you\u2019ll never create customer advocacy if you don\u2019t act on customer feedback.\nIf you don\u2019t know the answers then find out now, because employees are an organizations biggest asset or its greatest liability.\nYour employees know how to make your customers happy better than you do."}
