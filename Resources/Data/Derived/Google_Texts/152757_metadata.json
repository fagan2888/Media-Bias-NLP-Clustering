Nurses assessed all of the patients as being at risk for falls but more than half of the patients believed that they were not at all likely or were slightly likely to fall during hospitalization.\n\nIn addition:\n\nAlthough three-quarters of patients said they would call for assistance before getting out of bed to walk in or outside the hospital room, 10 percent said they would not call for help for any mobility-related activities.\n\nMost patients perceived low consequences of falling, with 69 percent reporting that they would be able to cope alone in the event of a fall, 60 percent predicting they would remain independent and 65 percent saying they would stay active.\n\nNearly half of the respondents perceived the most risk with walking outside their hospital room.\n\nNurses can incorporate patients' perception of fall risk into prevention plans and tailor communication about such plans accordingly, the researchers said. They warned, however, that even patients who intend to comply with fall-prevention plans may perform high-risk activities alone anyway if assistance isn't quickly available.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the announcement\n\n- see the study\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow teamwork can prevent patient falls\n\nPatient fall prevention: New tool could save hospitals $1M in costs\n\nOhio clinic aims to prevent patient falls in hospitals, homes\n\n5 ways to prevent patient falls\n\nSurveillance cameras help prevent patient falls\n\nHospitals work to cut patient falls and complications\n\nHospitals vs. nurses in battle to prevent patient falls", "article_metadata": {"description": "A\u00a0fall-prevention\u00a0plan may be only as good as a hospitalized patient's belief that it's necessary, suggests a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Journal of Critical Care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A\u00a0fall-prevention\u00a0plan may be only as good as a hospitalized patient's belief that it's necessary, suggests a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Journal of Critical Care.", "title": "Low patient perception of risk ups chances for hospital falls", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/low-patient-perception-risk-ups-chances-hospital-falls/2015-09-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "fall prevention,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,nurse communication,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,patient falls,patient perception", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the announcement- see the studyRelated Articles:How teamwork can prevent patient fallsPatient fall prevention: New tool could save hospitals $1M in costsOhio clinic aims to prevent patient falls in hospitals, homes5 ways to prevent patient fallsSurveillance cameras help prevent patient fallsHospitals work to cut patient falls and complicationsHospitals vs. nurses in battle to prevent patient falls\n\"Our findings suggest that fear of falling is a key perception for nurses to assess as they develop fall-prevention plans.\"\nNurses can incorporate patients' perception of fall risk into prevention plans and tailor communication about such plans accordingly, the researchers said.\nThey warned, however, that even patients who intend to comply with fall-prevention plans may perform high-risk activities alone anyway if assistance isn't quickly available.\nNearly half of the respondents perceived the most risk with walking outside their hospital room."}
