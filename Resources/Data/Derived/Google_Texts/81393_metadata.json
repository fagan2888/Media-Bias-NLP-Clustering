Kaye is succeeded by James M. Gleeson, who most recently worked in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cIt has been a pleasure to have Melanie serve as my Director of Communications,\u201d said Dr. Jill Biden. \u201cHer incredible dedication and remarkable skills have helped us bolster our Joining Forces initiative for our country\u2019s military families, honor teachers and bring attention to the importance of education for our children and country\u2019s future, improve access to quality health care, and promote the empowerment of women and girls. I am so grateful for Melanie\u2019s invaluable advice over the past three years as well as her kindness and integrity. Joe and I wish her all the best.\u201d\n\nJames Gleeson comes to the White House from the U.S. House of Representatives where he served as Communications Director to Congressman Xavier Becerra (CA-34), Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. From passage of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to find budget solutions during the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the Super Committee, to the pursuit of commonsense immigration reform and economic policies to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class, James helped coordinate House Democrats\u2019 communications strategy and messaging efforts since 2009.\n\nBefore moving to D.C., James was an Account Manager for a political consulting firm in Denver, Colorado. Prior to that, he served in the Colorado State House as a Legislative Aide to then-Majority Caucus Leader Michael Cerbo, and as a Policy Strategist for the Autism Society of Colorado.\n\nJames attended Arapahoe Community College in Littleton, Colorado and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Colorado, Boulder. He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland with his wife Kelly Berens Gleeson.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"creator": "@WhiteHouse", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/office-vice-president-announces-staff-changes", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "width": 240, "height": 240}, "title": "Office of the Vice President Announces Staff Changes", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "Washington, DC \u2013 The Office of the Vice President announced today that Melanie Kaye, Director of Communications to Dr.", "title": "Office of the Vice President Announces Staff Changes", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/office-vice-president-announces-staff-changes", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2015-07-15T10:57:50-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-21T13:58:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-15T10:57:50-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8778\"", "article_summary": "Washington, DC \u2013 The Office of the Vice President announced today that Melanie Kaye, Director of Communications to Dr. Jill Biden departed the White House.\nKaye is succeeded by James M.
