A federal jury in New York convicted Ross Ulbricht of running the online drug black market Silk Road on Wednesday. Ulbricht, who went by the moniker “Dread Pirate Roberts,” faces life in prison after being convicted on seven counts, including including trafficking drugs on the Internet, narcotics-trafficking conspiracy, running a continuing criminal enterprise, computer-hacking conspiracy, and money-laundering conspiracy. The jury took less than four hours to find Ulbricht guilty.
