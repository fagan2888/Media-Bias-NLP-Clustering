As the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act implementation gets underway, many business owners still have questions about the law known as Obamacare.

On Wednesday morning, Lehigh Valley Business is bringing together a group of experts from across the region to answer questions on the Affordable Care Act and other facets of the ever-changing world of health care. The health care symposium leads up to Wednesday's annual Lehigh Valley Business Expo, all at the Agri-Plex Expo Center at the Allentown Fairgrounds.

David Vassilaros, senior vice president of operations for The Benecon Group, will give an update on the Affordable Care Act; and Matthew T. O'Donnell, deputy director of policy and planning for the office of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, will discuss the implementation of the act in Pennsylvania.

Steve Chevarria, president and CEO of Pansalus Consulting LLC, will talk about maintaining a healthy culture and healthy bottom line.

Emil DiIorio M.D. of Coordinated Health will speak on the power of forward integration and the future of for-profit hospitals; and Paula Bussard, senior vice president of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, will talk about the changing health care landscape.

The cost of the symposium, which runs from 7:30-10:15 a.m., is $35, which includes a continental breakfast. The Agri-Plex Expo Center is at 302 N. 17th St., Allentown.
