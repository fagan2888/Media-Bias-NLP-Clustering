An autopsy by the coroner's office and investigation by McDonald police are pending.\n\nWarco said the Lincoln was traveling east on Langloth-Eldersville Road, crossed the center line, went off the westbound lane up a hillside and went airborne, traveling nearly a quarter mile before landing on Plum Run Road extension. The car then went another 25 feet, going over a hillside and landing in a creek bed.\n\nThe victim, Phillip S. Wolanski, 43, of Washington, was the driver and sole occupant of the Lincoln sedan involved in the crash. The wreck was reported at 10:28 a.m., but the actual time of the incident is unknown.\n\nTribLive commenting policy\n\nYou are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.\n\nWe moderate comments. Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.\n\nWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\n\nWe value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either by the same reader or different readers.\n\nWe follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.\n\nWe do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.\n\nWe welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly.\n\nWe appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tribune-Review", "description": "A Washington man died Sunday in a one-car crash in Burgettstown, Washington County Coroner Tim Warco reported.
