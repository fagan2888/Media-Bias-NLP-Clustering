David Bardall of the Davis County Sheriff\u2019s Office said authorities across the country are cooperating with greater frequency and ease.\n\n\"You now have a dialogue on a national level rather than just on a local level, so you're able to talk to people, whether it's on the west coast or on the east coast, about what has worked for them, what hasn't worked for them,\u201d he said.\n\nNicholls said technology in their industry is constantly evolving.\n\n\"You could take an envelope... and with the use of a laser, by shining the laser across the envelope, you can visualize fingerprint impressions that are invisible to the naked eye, and that are invisible to any other type of fingerprint process,\u201d he said.\n\nThe crime scene investigators in Davis County deal with a variety of situations.\n\n\"We'll go on anything from homicides, which we have, to officer involved shootings, rape cases and to the more benign things that might be just vehicle burglaries, criminal mischief calls\u2014that sort of thing,\u201d Bardall said.\n\nBardall said evidence comes in many forms: \"Evidence can be anything that can relate to the crime that has occurred, and so is that trace evidence? Does that mean that a hair fiber, can it be soil samples, can it be blood, can it be something larger like a fingerprint? All these things are evidence.\"\n\nMany crime labs in the country are not accredited, but there has recently been a push in that direction. Bardall said the process is one he is enjoying.\n\n\"It takes some work and some vigilance to stay current with the changes, and to me that's exciting,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DAVIS COUNTY, Utah \u2013 The Davis County Sheriff\u2019s Office crime lab has been operating for decades, but now they\u2019re working toward getting accreditation.
