Health officials said Saturday there has been a second case of West Nile Virus confirmed in Pima County.

A spokesman for the Pima County Health Department says the person infected is an older aged woman from midtown, and at last check, she was still in the hospital.

West Nile may have contributed to the death of an elderly woman earlier this month. Tucson News Now had also learned that woman had other health problems in addition to West Nile.

Health officials urge homeowners to get rid of standing water which can attract mosquitoes. The insects can carry West Nile, but the virus is deadly for certain groups of people.

“Remember West Nile virus in most cases is not going to kill you. It's only when folks are older, only when folks are immune suppressed, only when folks have other complicating medical issues that can be potentially deadly,” says Health Department Director, Dr. Francisco Garcia.

To submit a standing water complaint, call (520) 243-7999.
