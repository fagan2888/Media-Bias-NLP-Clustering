BOULDER — In an effort to supply balance to the offense, Colorado would like to get its running game in gear Saturday afternoon against Oregon State (2 p.m., Pac-12 Network).

The Buffaloes (2-3, 0-2 Pac-12) must do it without their leading rusher, however.

LIVE GAMETRACKER: Colorado vs. Oregon State, 2 p.m.

CU junior running back Christian Powell is designated by the school as “out indefinitely” with concussion symptoms, according to pregame media materials.

Powell apparently suffered the concussion last weekend during CU’s 59-56 double-overtime loss at California and, according to the news release, he did not seek advice from the team’s training staff until Monday.

Powell has netted 274 yards through five games, almost 100 yards more than CU’s second-leading rusher, senior Tony Jones (175).

At 6-foot and 240 pounds, Powell is the Buffs’ biggest tailback. Jones (5-7, 185), redshirt freshman Phillip Lindsay (5-8, 175) and sophomore Michael Adkins II (5-10, 195) rely more on their speed.

A successful running game by the Buffs would open up more options for CU quarterback Sefo Liufau against Oregon State (3-1, 0-1). The absence of Powell makes that goal more challenging.

The weather appears almost perfect for football — sunny skies with the high temperature expected to be in the low 70s.

Oregon State is making its first visit to Folsom Field since 1988, when Colorado was a member of the Big Eight Conference. This is CU’s fourth season in the Pac-12.
