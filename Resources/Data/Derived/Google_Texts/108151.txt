Mr. Knickerbocker, a store that has sold Clemson sportswear and gifts for decades, is renting out a popular entertainment and dining venue to hold a viewing party when the Tigers play in the national championship.

The store said it has rented out Dave & Buster's on Woodruff Road in Greenville to host the “Big Orange Bash” on Jan. 11 when the Tigers will take on Alabama.

Tickets are $50 per person and include food, non-alcoholic drinks, a game card with unlimited video gaming, and a t-shirt. A cash bar will be also open.

Mr. Knickerbocker said fans should get tickets early before they sell out.
