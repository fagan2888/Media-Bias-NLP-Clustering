Is it working, and how will it impact your health care in the future? Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove shares his diagnosis.\n\nIn boosting his signature domestic policy achievement, President Obama once cited the Cleveland Clinic as a health care model to emulate.\n\nNow, five years since the Affordable Care Act became law, how does that prestigious hospital's CEO think Obamacare is going? In an interview with CNBC's \"On the Money,\" Dr. Toby Cosgrove says he sees some positive change.\n\n\"Health-care inflation has come down,\" Cosgrove tells CNBC. \"We've seen quality metrics go up, and we've seen 13 million new people enrolled with coverage. So I think from those three standpoints, we've certainly seen a success.\"\n\nSince assuming leadership in 2004, the former cardiovascular surgeon has built the Cleveland Clinic into one of the largest hospital organizations in the country. Last year, more than 5.5 million patients visited the clinic and its member hospitals.\n\nStill, all the news hasn't been good for the clinic. The health-care powerhouse has retrenched financially, slashing part of its more than $6 billion annual budget, in what some observers linked to Obamacare reforms.\n\nWhile Cosgrove declined to give the Affordable Care Act a letter grade, he calls it a \"long-term project.\"\n\nHe added: \"One of the things we have to do is keep costs down, and we have to sustain it. As more and more people come in and we have an older population, it's going to be more difficult to do.\"\n\nCosgrove said that as Obamacare continues, \"we will see the effectiveness of maintaining cost controls in health care.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "On the fifth anniversary of Obamacare's passage, the head of the prestigious Cleveland Clinic says he sees some positive change in its implementation.", "author": "Trent Gillies", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "On the fifth anniversary of Obamacare's passage, the head of the prestigious Cleveland Clinic says he sees some positive change.", "title": "Obamacare a 'long term project': Cleveland CEO", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/02/obamacare-successful-but-a-long-term-project-clinic-chief.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/05/102244406-cleveland-clinic.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the fifth anniversary of Obamacare's passage, the head of the prestigious Cleveland Clinic says he sees some positive change.", "title": "Obamacare successful, but a 'long-term project': Clinic chief", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/02/obamacare-successful-but-a-long-term-project-clinic-chief.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/05/102244406-cleveland-clinic.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@trentCNBC", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "On The Money, Managed Health Care, Health Insurance, On The Money, Sectornomics Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-04-05T09:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "On The Money", "modified_time": "2015-04-05T10:01:34-0400", "tag": "Obamacare"}, "pageNodeId": 102554527, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, health care, Cleveland Clinic, Toby Cosgrove, costs, budget cuts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbead\"", "article_summary": "\"We've seen quality metrics go up, and we've seen 13 million new people enrolled with coverage.\nWhile Cosgrove declined to give the Affordable Care Act a letter grade, he calls it a \"long-term project.\"\nNow, five years since the Affordable Care Act became law, how does that prestigious hospital's CEO think Obamacare is going?\nIn boosting his signature domestic policy achievement, President Obama once cited the Cleveland Clinic as a health care model to emulate.\nIt's been five years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law."}
