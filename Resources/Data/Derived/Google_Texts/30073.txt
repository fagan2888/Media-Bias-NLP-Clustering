Tallahassee, FL - 37 year old Jeffrey Davis is facing 29 counts of possession of child pornography.

Arrest papers say police got a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and traced an email to Davis's computer.

Court records say Davis works at FSU. We are trying to find out more about his role there.

Arrest papers say Davis told investigators he had communicated with a girl on Facebook about the action figures he creates, but said he had never met her.

Arrest papers say David told police he viewed nude models on his computer, but he did not believe they were children. The investigator inquired about a picture of what appeared to be an 8 year old girl, and arrest papers say Davis "did not recall seeing an image like that."

Court records show Davis has been released from jail and ordered to stay away from children under 18 and stay away from schools and other places where children gather.
