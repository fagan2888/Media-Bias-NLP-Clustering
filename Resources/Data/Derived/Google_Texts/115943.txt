PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Fire officials are investigating the cause of a blaze that raced through a block of row homes in Philadelphia, killing three 4-year-olds and a baby.

Investigators planned to return to the scene Sunday, a day after the fire engulfed at least 10 homes.

Among the dead are 4-year-old twins, Maria and Marialla Bowah. Their father, Pennoh Davis, tells WPVI-TV that they loved Sunday school and music.

Four-year-old Patrick Sanyeah and 1-month-old Taj Jacque also died in the blaze.

The twins’ mother and three of their sisters escaped the fire through a second-floor window and were taken to a hospital.

A neighbor, Jeff Boone, tells The Philadelphia Inquirer that he saw a couch on fire on a porch and says the flames jumped across the row of houses.
