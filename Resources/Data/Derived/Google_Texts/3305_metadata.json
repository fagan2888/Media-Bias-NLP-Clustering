That\u2019s their game. They\u2019ve won elections that way, they won the last election that way.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe need to do better because America deserves better. They deserve a group, a party, a movement that is for policies that provide opportunity for everyone to reach that American dream and a message that unifies us.\u201d\n\nIn a nod to expectations that he will submit himself as the man to carry that vision, Santorum submitted, \u201cToday I want to share with you, I want to share with you a vision forward, a vision forward that can unite us. That I deeply believe in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been and we must be the party of growth and opportunity,\u201d admitting it\u2019s not a new message to what the GOP has heralded in the past. \u201cWe need to be pro-growth, but we also need to be pro-worker.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he said. \u201cOne of our favorite sayings, I know that you hear Republicans say all the time is a rising tide lifts all boats. And that is true, unless, your boat has a hole in it.\u201d He cited 70% of Americans as not having a college degree, many of which he says don\u2019t have a high school degree, also mentioning substance abuse and broken families as contributing to suppression of opportunity to advance in America.\n\n\u201cWe have to be the party that says we understand what you\u2019re feeling, we understand what you\u2019re thinking, we understand the problems and put forth a message that targets specifically, not how we can help the economy, but how we can help you and you and you,\u201d asserted Santorum.\n\nThe former Senator cited education as the first priority in achieving this. \u201cThe path that we\u2019re going to lay forward here is not going to be easy, but it\u2019s gonna be one that makes sense,\u201d he stated, going on to emphasize the importance of rebuilding the breakdown of the American family.\n\n\u201cGovernment shouldn\u2019t be an obstacle,\u201d Santorum said. Citing welfare statistics he pointed to the contribution of the welfare system to broken families as getting married can lead to loss of massive welfare benefits.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to reform welfare, then we need to reform all welfare, and that means corporate welfare. We can\u2019t be the ones who are for bailouts, we can\u2019t be the ones who are for sweet deals for corporations if we\u2019re going to ask people to sacrifice and struggle and rise in our society\u2026.that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people say that we have to do something about the border and we have to do something about illegal immigration, they are right, we do. We have to secure the border.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe need to stand for an immigration policy that puts Americans first and American workers first. And this isn\u2019t anti-immigrant, I am for legal immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteve is right, we need to step forward with an immigration policy, we need to do so in the context of standing strong with American workers.\u201d\n\nSantorum went on to talk on national security and low level of discussion on the subject in the last set of Presidential debates. He criticizes President Obama\u2019s policy and the need for a 2016 candidate that has experience in the arena. He pushed his experience on the Armed Services committee while he was in the Senate as an example of such experience. He touted his push for a bill that was originally opposed by President George W. Bush, but eventually passed and signed.\n\n\u201cExperience, knowledge, courage \u2013 on national security, the area where the President has the most per view, those are the things that are necessary,\u201d as he asked the audience how he knows that, then cited a recent experience he had on a trip to Israel where an official told him America needs to elect a President that is ready for war.\n\nHe went on to butter up the Iowan crowd saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been here many times as you know and you had a tough time last time around. You made a very good decision by the way,\u201d he said referring to his win of the 2012 Iowa caucus. \u201cYou made a good decision and you\u2019re going to have to do that again. I just want to encourage you, you do a great job,\u201d continuing to elaborate on his win in Iowa. He said, \u201cThe last time around everyone told you no, no, don\u2019t pick this person, this person has no chance and you said well I think we\u2019re going to just vote for the best person that we believe has the best chance, not who Washington and New York thinks should have the best chance.\u201d\n\nHe closed, \u201cIt is well worth the mileage and the sleep to go to all 99 counties in Iowa. And if any one of these other guys wants a travel log, I\u2019d be happy to share it with them.\u201d\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Senator Rick Santorum started off his Iowa Freedom Summit speech Saturday by reminding Iowans of the \u2018birth\u2019 of his infamous sweatervest and his Iowa caucus win against Romney for President in 2012.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Former Senator Rick Santorum started off his Iowa Freedom Summit speech Saturday by reminding Iowans of the \u2018birth\u2019 of his infamous sweatervest and his Iowa caucus win against Romney for President in 2012.", "title": "Santorum Tells Iowans 'They Made a Good Decision'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/rick-santorum-AP-Photo-Eric-Gay.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-24T20:30:21-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/24/sweatervest-santorum-to-iowans-you-made-a-good-decision-in-2012/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Senator Rick Santorum started off his Iowa Freedom Summit speech Saturday by reminding Iowans of the \u2018birth\u2019 of his infamous sweatervest and his Iowa caucus win against Romney for President in 2012.", "title": "Santorum Tells Iowans 'They Made a Good Decision'", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/rick-santorum-AP-Photo-Eric-Gay.jpg", "creator": "@michellediana", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2012, 2016, immigration, Iowa caucus, Iowa Freedom Summit, Mike Lee, Mitt Romney, national security, republican, Rick Santorum, Ted Cruz, U.S. Senate, unity, welfare,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,rick santorum", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-24T18:09:47-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-01-24T20:30:21-07:00", "tag": "welfare", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou made a good decision and you\u2019re going to have to do that again.\nYou made a very good decision by the way,\u201d he said referring to his win of the 2012 Iowa caucus.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to reform welfare, then we need to reform all welfare, and that means corporate welfare.\n\u201cI could spend the rest of this speech, easily, detailing why President Obama and his middle class economics have failed, failed miserably,\u201d said Santorum.\n\u201cHow many people do we convince that they should vote for us by simply criticizing what the President does?"}
