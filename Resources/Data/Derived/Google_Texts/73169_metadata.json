Silver Cross, an independent single hospital based in New Lenox, would be buoyed by the heft of Advocate, which has 12 hospitals and plans to get even bigger by merging with north suburban powerhouse NorthShore University HealthSystem.\n\nBut Blue Cross won't negotiate reimbursement rates with affiliations created by separate health systems that clinically integrate rather than those under common ownership, Dr. Lee Sacks, chief medical officer of Downers Grove-based Advocate, said during a meeting yesterday with the Crain's Chicago Business editorial board.\n\n'CHILLING EFFECT'\n\n\u201cIf the Blues aren't going to recognize (the affiliations), that's really going to have a chilling effect on everybody's non-merger kind of relationship,\u201d Advocate CEO Jim Skogsbergh said.\n\nThe issue illustrates a dilemma for small health systems and independent hospitals looking for ways to command higher reimbursement rates from insurers in the competitive Chicago-area health care market. Large hospital systems and physicians groups are establishing care coordination groups that have financial incentives for improving health while reducing costs, and financial penalties if those benchmarks aren't met. It's high-risk but potentially high-reward. It also requires large groups of patients in order to get economies of scale, a difficult hurdle for small systems such as Silver Cross.\n\nThe Blue Cross decision also could impact a joint operating agreement announced in June by Adventist Midwest Health, a four-hospital system based in west suburban Hinsdale, and Alexian Brothers Health System, a five-hospital network based in northwest suburban Arlington Heights.\n\nRepresentatives from Alexian and Adventist did not provide comment.\n\nIn a statement, Blue Cross spokesman Mike Deering said the insurer has advised other Illinois-based hospital systems that it will negotiate rates only with groups under a single ownership.\n\n\u201cWhile we support clinical integration arrangements to better coordinate patient care, optimize the sharing of clinical information, and working toward the industry's triple aim \u2014 improving patient satisfaction, increasing quality and lowering costs \u2014 we do not believe joint fee negotiation by hospitals is necessary to achieve these results,\u201d Mr. Deering said in the statement.\n\nFINANCIAL DOWNSIDE\n\nExperts say clinical integrations at smaller systems can improve the quality of patient care. But there can be a financial downside for insurers.\n\n\u201cIf at the same time you're taking community hospitals that are often lower-cost and bringing them to these large health systems rates . . . you've also increased cost,\u201d said Steve Riedl, Chicago-based senior consulting actuary at Towers Watson, a consultancy and employee benefits firm. \u201cIt's not necessarily a great outcome for the people that ultimately foot the bill.\u201d\n\nMr. Skogsbergh and Dr. Sacks could not say how much money Advocate could lose or how much costs could go up by not jointly negotiating Blue Cross rates with Silver Cross. The health systems' affiliation likely won't end, Dr. Sacks added.\n\nRuth Colby, chief strategy officer and senior vice president at Silver Cross, declined to comment.\n\nIn February, Silver Cross and Advocate announced an affiliation that falls just short of a merger. The deal adds Silver Cross and about 300 members of its medical staff to Advocate Physician Partners' clinical integration program, the collaboration between Advocate's hospitals and its 4,400 affiliated doctors to manage costs through better coordinating patient care. The agreement could be advantageous for Silver Cross since it wouldn't have been able to launch such a program itself due to hefty startup costs.\n\nAdvocate has about 600,000 patients in some type of care coordination contract, not including Medicaid. Of those, about 400,000 are Blue Cross patients in an accountable care organization formed by the insurer and Advocate that has already demonstrated improved patient care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160526_01:07:50", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "title": "Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois delivers blow to Advocate, Silver Cross hospital partnership", "taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois delivers blow to Advocate, Silver Cross hospital partnership"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "Silver Cross Hospital and much larger Advocate Health Care won't be able to jointly negotiate reimbursement rates with the state's dominant insurer, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Silver Cross Hospital and much larger Advocate Health Care won't be able to jointly negotiate reimbursement rates with the state's dominant insurer, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois.", "title": "Blue Cross delivers blow to small hospitals", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20141007/NEWS03/141009864/blue-cross-delivers-blow-to-small-hospitals", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "published_at": "2014-10-7", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/141009864", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Silver Cross Hospital", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf35d\"", "article_summary": "The move came in reaction to a deal struck earlier this year between south suburban Silver Cross Hospital and Advocate Health Care, the largest hospital network in the state.\nA recent decision by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois could make it more difficult for small hospitals to preserve their independence by affiliating \u2014 rather than merging \u2014 with larger health care systems.\nThe agreement could be advantageous for Silver Cross since it wouldn't have been able to launch such a program itself due to hefty startup costs.\nIn February, Silver Cross and Advocate announced an affiliation that falls just short of a merger.\nRuth Colby, chief strategy officer and senior vice president at Silver Cross, declined to comment."}
