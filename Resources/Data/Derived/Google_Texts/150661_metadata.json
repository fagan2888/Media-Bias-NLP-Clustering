Where he got his drugs remains uncertain, but the arrests of drug suspects identified during the investigation suggest he might have visited a lower Manhattan apartment building where a supplier lived.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the Bronx operation provided any heroin Hoffman might have bought. But New York has long been known as the nation\u2019s capital of smack, regularly accounting for about 20 percent of the heroin the federal Drug Enforcement Administration seizes every year.\n\nThose seizures have grown by 67 percent in the state over the past five years, a trend Brennan attributes in part to high-volume heroin mills invisible to most New Yorkers but capable of churning out hundreds of thousands of packets within days after a big shipment arrives.\n\nThe pipeline starts in Mexico, where cartels traffic Colombian-produced heroin by the kilogram. The wholesalers smuggle the drugs into the United States in trucks, through tunnels dug under the Southwest border and, in one recent case, by molding and coloring the heroin to look like coffee beans.\n\nIn the Northeast, the cartels have increasingly supplied Dominican middlemen who rely on a business model for heroin mills that emphasizes discipline and an absence of violence.\n\nA mill found in an 18th-floor apartment in upper Manhattan had a sign that read, \u201cClean Up After Yourselves \u2014 The Management.\u201d At another across the street from Manhattan College in the Bronx, immigrant workers wore school sweat shirts to try to blend in.\n\nWorkers can make up to $5,000 a week. They\u2019re also given meals and toiletries to help make it through 12-hour shifts.\n\nThe mill operators and workers go out of their way not to disturb neighbors, who might report them to police, or to draw the attention of other criminals.\n\n\u201cDrug dealers are very wary,\u201d said James J. Hunt, the acting head of the DEA\u2019s New York office. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t want word to get out on the street about a mill. They want anonymity.\u201d\n\n20 percent\n\nPercentage of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s heroin seizures made in New York City\n\n67 percent\n\nIncrease in seizures in New York over the past five years\n\n$8 million\n\nValue of a heroin seizure made in a Bronx apartment last week", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New York City heroin dealers go to great lengths to blend in", "title": "New York City heroin dealers go to great lengths to blend in", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/new-york-city-heroin-dealers-go-to-great-lengths-to-blend-in/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__20140209_A5_ND09HEROINp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__20140209_A5_ND09HEROINp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T17:30:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:21:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd997f\"", "article_summary": "In the Northeast, the cartels have increasingly supplied Dominican middlemen who rely on a business model for heroin mills that emphasizes discipline and an absence of violence.\nHeroin dealers want to find customers with ready cash \u201cwho are going to be with them until they die,\u201d said city Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan.\nThey want anonymity.\u201d20 percentPercentage of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s heroin seizures made in New York City67 percentIncrease in seizures in New York over the past five years$8 millionValue of a heroin seizure made in a Bronx apartment last week\nWhere he got his drugs remains uncertain, but the arrests of drug suspects identified during the investigation suggest he might have visited a lower Manhattan apartment building where a supplier lived.\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the Bronx operation provided any heroin Hoffman might have bought."}
