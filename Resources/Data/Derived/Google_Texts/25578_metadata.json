That\u2019s especially true now, as the industry watches intently while Amazon puts the squeeze to Hachette Book Group in a dispute over pricing.\n\nOnly after the laughter has died down and calm has been restored can they explain that simply because the Big Five publishers are struggling to make money in the digital age \u2014 with self-publishers applying pressure along with Amazon \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t space for new publishing ventures to survive and even thrive.\n\nRelated: Will a \u2018Netflix for Books\u2019 Save the Publishing Business?\n\nAt this year\u2019s annual BookExpo America, that space was in a corner of the vast showspace at New York\u2019s Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. While the bulk of the exhibit floor was still given over to conventional publishers and their carefully decorated booths, stacks of books, and celebrity author signings (from Billy Idol to \u201cGoosebumps\u201d creator R.L. Stine), some fresh industry ideas were tucked away in the show\u2019s \u201cStartup Alley.\u201d There, 18 companies explained their concepts and business models to the publishers and others who drifted by.\n\n\u201cThese companies aren\u2019t necessarily trying to turn the whole publishing world on its head,\u201d explains Ronnie Ricker, director of customer acquisition at Librify, a startup e-book retailer and social media forum targeted at book club members. Along with some of its own backers, Librify sponsored Startup Alley, giving a host of other publishing newbies the chance to strut their stuff.\n\n\u201cThere are new businesses to help people publish books, to help readers find better books or books that they\u2019ll like more, or to manage their libraries,\u201d says Ricker. \u201cThere are companies that go beyond the book as an object to getting people to read, to read more, or to read in different ways.\u201d\n\nThe 18 businesses pitching their visions of the future of publishing were a motley crew, ranging from the reasonably well established to the unknown.\n\nA company called Beneath the Ink offered \u201cBinks\u201d \u2014 a way for publishers to insert visual content into e-books, so that if an author\u2019s character is ambling through Hyde Park in late spring, up pops a \u201cBink,\u201d or image, of the London park with horse chestnut trees flowering away and the roses just about to bloom.\n\nMoscow-based Bookmate is focused on getting books to readers in emerging markets that have been particularly prone to piracy, using mobile phones and their networks as the delivery and payment mechanism. (It has just raised $3 million in startup funding.)\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Riffle, \u201crun by a happy team of obsessive book lovers,\u201d was presented to readers as a great way to discover new books \u2014 and billed to potential new investors as \u201ca revenue freight train.\u201d Sure, the site offers daily deals, but it also carefully places ads \u2014 lots of ads, targeted to your reading patterns and interests \u2014 and its clients range from the largest publishing companies to mid-list authors and self-published writers.\n\nSix finalists from among the startups competed for $13,000 in funding from the sponsors, with $10,000 going to the first place winner and $3,000 to the company that came in second. That\u2019s not a heck of a lot when set beside the median seed capital funding of $800,000 recorded in 2013, but the winners (along with the other four finalists) also walked away with a kind of Good Housekeeping seal of approval on their business plans and concept.\n\nNext Big Book walked away with the big $10,000 prize, thanks to its marketing analytics model that tracks what\u2019s happening in bookstores, on social media and elsewhere in cyberspace, from sales and retailer promotions to marketing events. The goal: to determine which factors are most important in a book\u2019s success in the market. The award may simply be the decoration on the icing on the cake for the company, which announced a deal with Macmillan Publishers, one of the Big Five, during BEA.\n\nSecond place went to Qlovi, a literacy innovation company that offers lesson plans and other classroom tools to teachers who subscribe and pay for its ebooks. The Qlovi team, pitching their concept to a group of about a hundred entrepreneurs, venture investors and others, vigorously made their case for their business as more than just a social good.\n\n\u201cWe built our own e-reader,\u201d pointed out Shira Schindel, head of content and acquisitions, noting that their chief technology officer, Ricardo Rodriguez, is an alumnus of Intel\u2019s software development group as well as the MIT Media Lab.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that any of these companies will morph into the next Amazon \u2014 none of their business models is that comprehensive, aiming to turn every human being on the platform into a customer. Nonetheless, collectively, they could end up radically reshaping the way we read.\n\nIn light of that fact, I\u2019m surprised these booths weren\u2019t just as busy as those offering free copies of this fall\u2019s must-read titles. Those will be forgotten in a few months\u2019 time. The odds are pretty good that we\u2019ll still be talking about three or four of these companies in a decade\u2019s time.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Anyone foolhardy enough to talk of of building a future in publishing these days likel", "title": "Startups Pitch a Brighter Future for Book Publishing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/04/Startups-Pitch-Brighter-Future-Book-Publishing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06042014_BookExpo_America.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/04/Startups-Pitch-Brighter-Future-Book-Publishing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06042014_BookExpo_America.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Anyone foolhardy enough to talk of of building a future in publishing these days likel", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe54e6\"", "article_summary": "Related: Will a \u2018Netflix for Books\u2019 Save the Publishing Business?\nAnyone foolhardy enough to talk of of building a future in publishing these days likely must first wait until the snickering around them dies down.\nThat\u2019s especially true now, as the industry watches intently while Amazon puts the squeeze to Hachette Book Group in a dispute over pricing.\n\u201cThere are new businesses to help people publish books, to help readers find better books or books that they\u2019ll like more, or to manage their libraries,\u201d says Ricker.\nNext Big Book walked away with the big $10,000 prize, thanks to its marketing analytics model that tracks what\u2019s happening in bookstores, on social media and elsewhere in cyberspace, from sales and retailer promotions to marketing events."}
