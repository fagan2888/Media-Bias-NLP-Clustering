PA-Sen: Sestak Premieres First TV Ad (VIDEO)

Written by Nick Field, Managing Editor

Joe Sestak is hitting the airwaves.

The ex-Admiral and former Congressman has released his first TV ad of the 2016 Senate Democratic primary.

The sixty-second spot, titled “Joe’s Got Your Six”, runs through Sestak’s biography.

“Joe Sestak become a three star Navy admiral, served President Clinton and led the Navy’s anti-terrorism unit,” the narrator states.

He recounts how his daughter’s cancer diagnosis inspired him to run for public office.

“I never thought I’d leave the military,” Sestak states. “But when my 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with brain cancer, I had to leave to help her fight. In those hospitals, I met too many families that didn’t have health insurance and it drove me to fight for them.”

“I’m running for the Senate to be the people’s champion – to defend Obamacare, protect Social Security and support our veterans,” he concludes. “I’ve got Pennsylvania’s 6.”

Sestak is running against former Chief of Staff to Governor Wolf Katie McGinty and Braddock Mayor John Fetterman in the Senate Democratic primary.
