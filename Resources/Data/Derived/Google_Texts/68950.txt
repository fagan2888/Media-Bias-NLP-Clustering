A current U.S. President on a motion capture stage. That’s not something you see every day. But it happened Tuesday when President Barack Obama visited DreamWorks Animation to talk to the company (which is headed by major Obama contributor and fundraiser Jeffrey Katzenberg). The President called the entertainment industry “one of the bright spots of our economy” and got a tour of the facility.

One of the stops was the motion capture stage where How to Train Your Dragon 2 director Dean DeBlois explained and demonstrated the technique for the President. And, as a bonus, there’s some new footage from the 2014 sequel. Check out the video below.

Thanks to Cartoon Brew for this great video.

Another stop of Obama’s tour featured Jim Parsons (The Big Bang Theory) and Steve Martin, who assumedly provide voices on an upcoming DreamWorks film, and the President got an animated surprise.
