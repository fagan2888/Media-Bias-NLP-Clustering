( Jeremy Papasso )\n\nWith public concern over development running high, the dilemma before the council at this year's retreat was how to make substantive changes to the city's rules for new development in time to still influence the current wave of building.\n\nCity Council members said that defining \"community benefit\" \u2014 what new projects should be doing to meet other city goals in exchange for exemptions to certain rules \u2014 and improving the city's design guidelines need to be top priorities this year.\n\nWhy Housing Matters Boulder is hosting a public forum on housing challenges Monday night at eTown Hall. The goal of the forum is to initiate \"constructive conversations\" about meeting the city's housing goals in ways consistent with community values. Participants will choose a housing goal and break into small groups to discuss solutions. Members of several working groups on housing issues will be there to here the ideas of the public. The forum will conclude with a presentation by Michael Pyatok, an award-winning architect who works on affordable housing and neighborhood design issues. The city is also hosting an inform \"Pastries with Pyatok\" discussion in Alfalfa's Market Community Room, 1651 Broadway, from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. Tuesday.

Without that, it's hard to know what kinds of designs the code should include.\n\nBoulder only has a few area plans, and a suggestion to develop neighborhood plans throughout the city failed to gain traction because it would be too time-consuming.\n\nCity planners have set aside an ambitious Envision East Arapahoe area planning process for east Boulder as community disagreement over the scope of the plan indicated it would be a lengthy and contentious process.\n\n\"There are people who are really angry that we're being too timid about what we're considering, and there are people who are just as angry that we're looking at it at all,\" Driskell said.\n\nThe only near-term change the City Council will consider is a zoning change to allow medical offices near the Boulder Community Health Foothills campus.\n\nAlso in 2015, the city hopes to complete a comprehensive housing strategy that would identify ways to provide a diversity of housing options for different income levels, preserve middle-income housing and allow seniors to age in place.\n\nThe housing strategy process started last year as a top council priority, but at this year's retreat, several council members wondered if the housing strategy should be scaled back or tabled until after the completion of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan update. The recommendations could include code changes to allow for more density and accessory dwelling units like in-law apartments and converted garages that could be controversial.\n\nDriskell said the recommendations from the housing strategy will help inform the comprehensive plan update and stressed that adopting the strategy does not, by itself, make any land use code changes.\n\nDifficult public conversations envisioned for year ahead\n\nIn the end, the City Council decided to stay the course on the housing strategy. When it is complete, planners may look for neighborhoods that are willing to host pilot projects on several of the new ideas.\n\n\"To me, affordability of living here is one of the big things we need to figure out,\" Councilwoman Suzanne Jones said.\n\nAs part of a focus on code enforcement issues, City Attorney Tom Carr said he would work on ways to simplify the city's occupancy rules and tie it to rental licensing. In most of the city, no more than three or four unrelated people can share a house or apartment, depending on the zoning. However, when the city tries to enforce the occupancy limit, many landlords claim grandfathered rights to house more people under previous zoning codes.\n\nCarr said showing that the city can effectively enforce its occupancy limit could create the political space for the City Council to consider raising the occupancy limit in some areas or in some circumstances, such as to allow for cooperative housing and accessory dwelling units.\n\nThe City Council also wants the planning department to consider area planning around the Broadway and Mapleton buildings owned by Boulder Community Health. Though Driskell said hospital officials have indicated they are unlikely to sell the buildings for a few years, council members said they cannot wait until a sale is imminent to consider what they want for those locations.\n\n\"Whether we buy it or someone else buys it, we're already behind the curve,\" Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum said. \"My fear is that someone buys it and proposes something that is allowed in the code but isn't what we want.\"\n\nCouncilwoman Mary Young said the City Council needs to be prepared for the difficult public conversations in the year to come.\n\n\"We have to remember that in Boulder, land use planning is a contact sport,\" she said.\n\nErica Meltzer: 303-473-1355, meltzere@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meltzere", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27387490/council-boulder-needs-get-ahead-development", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27387490:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-24T17:22:31-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "With public concern over development running high, the dilemma before the council at this year's retreat was how to make substantive changes to the city's rules for new development in time to still influence the current wave of building.", "title": "Council: Boulder needs to get ahead of development", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27387490/council-boulder-needs-get-ahead-development", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0124/20150124__25DCACOUW.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0124/20150124__25DCACOUW_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-01-26T06:23:39-0700", "endDate": "2025-01-24T17:20:38-0700", "description": "With public concern over development running high, the dilemma before the council at this year's retreat was how to make substantive changes to the city's rules for new development in time to still influence the current wave of building.", "byline": "By Erica MeltzerStaff", "pubDate": "2015-01-24T17:24:29-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-01-24T17:22:31-0700", "sailthru.title": "Council: Boulder needs to get ahead of development", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27387490/council-boulder-needs-get-ahead-development", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "With public concern over development running high, the dilemma before the council at this year's retreat was how to make substantive changes to the city's rules for new development in time to still influence the current wave of building.", "title": "Council: Boulder needs to get ahead of development"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0124/20150124__25DCACOUW.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e99\"", "article_summary": "Councilwoman Mary Young said the City Council needs to be prepared for the difficult public conversations in the year to come.\nThe only near-term change the City Council will consider is a zoning change to allow medical offices near the Boulder Community Health Foothills campus.\nThe City Council also wants the planning department to consider area planning around the Broadway and Mapleton buildings owned by Boulder Community Health.\nDifficult public conversations envisioned for year aheadIn the end, the City Council decided to stay the course on the housing strategy.\nCity Council members support that initiative, but they said the community cannot wait for form-based codes to be put in place throughout the city."}
