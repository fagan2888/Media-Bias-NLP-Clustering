John Kasich of Ohio has steadily gained ground in the New Hampshire polls, drawing few attacks from his opponents as they have fought among themselves.\n\nNow, that will begin to change.\n\nA national conservative group, the American Future Fund, plans to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that brand Mr. Kasich an \u201cObama Republican,\u201d according to the group\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nThe group will run a commercial that goes after Mr. Kasich for supporting Common Core educational standards and expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It shows an image of Mr. Kasich smiling, face to face with Barack Obama, and calls him \u201cone of the few Republican governors to cheerlead Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nThe ad closes: \u201cJohn Kasich \u2014 Not a conservative. Not even a moderate. An Obama Republican.\u201d\n\nNick Ryan, the president of the American Future Fund, said the group will air the ad on broadcast and cable television in New Hampshire, as well as in the expensive Boston media market. The American Future Fund is incorporated as a nonprofit group and does not disclose its donors.\n\nThe TV campaign is the most intensive effort yet to challenge Mr. Kasich in New Hampshire, where he has concentrated his 2016 efforts, wooing more moderate and upscale Republican and independent voters with a message about balanced budgets and bipartisanship.\n\nMr. Kasich has defended his support for Medicaid expansion in Ohio as a policy of compassion toward the poor, and has called Common Core standards helpful for raising student performance. He was endorsed by The Boston Globe on Monday.\n\nRob Nichols, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich, said the ad was an \u201cunprincipled smear\u201d that did not reflect the governor\u2019s full record. Mr. Kasich, he said, had been opposed to the Affordable Care Act and favored limits on the role of the federal government in education.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Governor Kasich\u2019s continued strength that these shadowy, desperate, misleading attacks are now emerging,\u201d Mr. Nichols said.\n\nMr. Ryan said in an email that Mr. Kasich had been \u201cmisleading New Hampshire voters\u201d about his record. \u201cThe real John Kasich record looks like something you might expect from a liberal politician like Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201cnot a Republican governor.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan, who is also steering a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, in the presidential race, said the anti-Kasich ads were unrelated to Mr. Huckabee\u2019s campaign.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160127083427, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "hdl_p": "A Conservative Group Calls Kasich an u2018Obama Republicanu2019 in a New Ad", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Kasich, John R", "org": "American Future Fund", "keywords": "Kasich John R,Conservatism (US Politics),Political Action Committees,Political Advertising,Presidential Election of 2016,American Future Fund,New Hampshire,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Alexander Burns", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Alexander Burns", "byl": "Alexander Burns", "twitter": {"description": "The American Future Fund, a conservative group, plans to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that brand John Kasich an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d Mr. Kasich has been gaining ground in recent polls before the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.", "title": "John Kasich Is Called an 'Obama Republican' in New Hampshire Ads", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/27/john-kasich-is-called-an-obama-republican-in-new-hampshire-ads/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/27/us/27firstdraft-kasich/27firstdraft-kasich-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004170814, "description": "The American Future Fund, a conservative group, plans to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that brand John Kasich an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d Mr. Kasich has been gaining ground in recent polls before the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 27, 2016", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-01272016.jsonp", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1453901667, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T14:31:18-05:00"}, "geo": "New Hampshire", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160127143118, "PUD": 20160127, "pdate": 20160127, "des": "Conservatism (US Politics);Political Action Committees;Political Advertising;Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/27/us/27firstdraft-kasich/27firstdraft-kasich-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "The American Future Fund, a conservative group, plans to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that brand John Kasich an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d Mr. Kasich has been gaining ground in recent polls before the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.", "title": "John Kasich Is Called an 'Obama Republican' in New Hampshire Ads", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/27/john-kasich-is-called-an-obama-republican-in-new-hampshire-ads/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/27/us/27firstdraft-kasich/27firstdraft-kasich-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "John Kasich Is Called an 'Obama Republican' in New Hampshire Ads", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/27/us/27firstdraft-kasich/27firstdraft-kasich-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 27, 2016"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Ryan said in an email that Mr. Kasich had been \u201cmisleading New Hampshire voters\u201d about his record.\nA national conservative group, the American Future Fund, plans to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that brand Mr. Kasich an \u201cObama Republican,\u201d according to the group\u2019s chief strategist.\nJohn Kasich of Ohio has steadily gained ground in the New Hampshire polls, drawing few attacks from his opponents as they have fought among themselves.\nMr. Kasich, he said, had been opposed to the Affordable Care Act and favored limits on the role of the federal government in education.\nIt shows an image of Mr. Kasich smiling, face to face with Barack Obama, and calls him \u201cone of the few Republican governors to cheerlead Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201dThe ad closes: \u201cJohn Kasich \u2014 Not a conservative."}
