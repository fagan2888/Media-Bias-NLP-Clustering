Thank you. I have to say, nice building, this Capitol. Nice room. But too old-fashioned, don\u2019t you think? I do this all the time. I acquire these rundown old properties, I buy them cheap, I bring in my decorators, we fix it up. More mirrors, more gold trim, a nice statue of me \u2026 we\u2019ll have it looking beautiful. Come back next year, you\u2019ll be amazed.\n\nThere\u2019s our new First Lady, Melania, up in the balcony. First supermodel in the White House. Amazing no one thought of it before. See that empty seat next to her? That\u2019s for Ted Cruz. Not here anymore. Nice guy. Smart guy. Everything I say, he agreed with me. Everything I say. So I said go back to Canada, Ted, where you belong.\n\nSo Ted, he\u2019s the first immigrant I deported. More to come, I promise you that. We have to do it. Ted can run for prime minister up there, he\u2019ll do great. Cold, but great.\n\nSee the other empty seat? Right here, behind me, next to Speaker Pelosi. (Can you believe the face on that one?) That\u2019s for my new vice president, Marco Rubio. He never showed up here when he was a senator, so I told him, why should you show up now? Stay home. Get yourself a nice glass of water, take off those high-heels, turn on the Home Shopping Network. Such low energy.\n\nOK, so North Korea. Believe me, I can take care of North Korea in my back pocket. What\u2019s his name, the leader guy? Kim Long Wrong? Something like that. Such a fat boy. Disgusting to even think about, so fat. You see his haircut? Terrible. Horrible. How can you have a country with a leader with a haircut like that. So they claim to have a hydrogen bomb? Who gave them the hydrogen? I say no more hydrogen to North Korea. Problem solved. Such an easy answer, nobody thought of it but me.\n\nObamacare? Obamacare is now repealed. There, I said it. I did it. Already the country is greater. All these votes you people took in Congress, vote after vote after vote. Accomplished nothing. I\u2019m here a week, I\u2019m the president, it is now repealed. It\u2019s easy \u2014 executive order. I promise, you will see so many executive orders that you won\u2019t believe it. You people in Congress should just go home, because you will have nothing to do. Seriously. You can come back in eight years. Maybe. I haven\u2019t decided \u2014 maybe eight, maybe 16. Whenever I think Ivanka is ready to take over.\n\nSo, where was I? No Obamacare, did I say that? I did? Good. We will come up with something that is so much better than Obamacare, and Mexico is going to pay for it. Or maybe China, I haven\u2019t decided. What do you think? Should we make China pay for it? Or maybe Britain. They say I can\u2019t go to Britain. They had a vote a year ago and said I couldn\u2019t go to Britain. The whole place is Muslim now anyway. A no-go zone, the whole place. I get that from so many people.\n\nSo. Last thing. All of you in Congress? Clear out your desks, take any personal items with you. You too. Yes you, the ones in front in the robes. I mean, who wears robes in public anymore? Is this a bathhouse? Ridiculous.\n\nI \u2014 I mean we \u2014 we\u2019re going to be so strong, so powerful. We\u2019re going to do it so much faster than anyone thinks possible, I will tell you that.
