The Democrats had counted on Hagan to be one of the few bright spots for them on election night, and to survive the tide of conservative anger at President Barack Obama in the 2014 midterms that pulled down Democratic candidates nationwide and gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress. But the undertow was too much even for Hagan\u2019s well-executed effort.\n\nIn hindsight, she blames herself, the Democrats, and Obama for not talking up positive economic indicators such as low gas prices, declining unemployment rates, and record stock-market gains more aggressively. News coverage of the Ebola pandemic and hostage beheadings by ISIS \u201csucked the wind out\u201d of the Democrats\u2019 strong economic message, she said.\n\n\u201cWe ceded that message. We did not take hold of it,\u201d said Hagan. \u201cHad [Obama] given his State of the Union address in October, I would be in Washington.\u201d\n\nInstead, Hagan is in Cambridge as a Spring 2015 Fellow at HKS\u2019 Institute of Politics along with former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and Christine Quinn, the former speaker of the New York City Council. The three women have been in the trenches of American politics for decades and have the battle scars to prove it. They\u2019re all \u201cfirsts\u201d \u2014 the first woman in their city, state, or party to hold their elected post. Each recently ran in tough, high-profile campaigns for top federal, state, and city office, respectively. And each stumbled.\n\nEach of them sat down with the Gazette recently to talk candidly about their experiences, and to discuss the hard-won advice and encouragement they\u2019re offering students, particularly young women, about what it takes to make it in political life.\n\n\u201cThere was a narrative that I was a horrible candidate,\u201d recalled Coakley. \u201cAnd I agree, we could have done some things better, but I think the narrative was useful to people to explain why there was now a Republican senator in Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nFew outside Boston\u2019s insular political scene knew much about Coakley before she entered a special election in 2010 to serve out the late Ted Kennedy\u2019s U.S. Senate term, running against a little-known Republican state senator named Scott Brown. Coakley\u2019s shocking defeat in the historically blue state came at a precarious moment for passage of the Affordable Care Act. Undaunted, Coakley went on to run a much stronger race for governor in 2014, losing narrowly to Republican Charlie Baker as the first woman Democratic gubernatorial nominee.\n\nAfter harsh criticism from across the political world for her loss to Brown, Coakley said she gave a lot of thought to how that might affect her candidacy for governor in 2014.\n\n\u201cSo I purposely said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do it unless I can put the team together, [and] I have time to ramp up; I\u2019m going to get my husband and my family out on the trail with me\u2019 \u2014 all of the things which we didn\u2019t have time or didn\u2019t do in the last race. In the end, we came very close; we lost by 40,000 votes,\u201d said Coakley of the governor\u2019s race. \u201cGiven the outside money and the outspending by the Republican Governors Association, a lot of people would say that Baker should have won by more than he did.\u201d\n\nAs NYC Council speaker, Quinn was the early front-runner in the Democratic primary race for mayor of New York City in 2013, enjoying crucial support from Michael Bloomberg, the popular, outgoing mayor. The only woman and openly LGBT candidate in an all-male field, Quinn\u2019s initial momentum appeared strong, with The New York Times producing a documentary about her run called \u201cHers to Lose.\u201d Quinn would eventually place third to public advocate Bill de Blasio, now the current mayor.\n\nSome theorized that Quinn\u2019s unexpected flameout came because she was an openly gay woman.\n\n\u201cThe first person responsible when you don\u2019t win a race is the candidate,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI think we need to talk about the realities of sexism and homophobia more \u2014 to admit it, to understand it, to overcome it. [But] that wasn\u2019t always my philosophy. I used to think there was no point in talking about it a lot because if you were talking about it, you were wallowing in it. And if you were wallowing in it, you weren\u2019t overcoming it. So that played out in the campaign.\u201d\n\nAs a gay woman running, Quinn said, it was only natural that \u201cthere was going to be extra scrutiny; there was going to be sexism and homophobia. And being the frontrunner, you have the wind at your back, but you also have a target on your back.\u201d\n\nThe three say that, as in everyday life, female candidates are still held to different and often higher standards than male candidates. They are also expected to present themselves to voters in ways that either comport with narrow, stereotypical expectations of how women should act publicly or counter negative assumptions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called a lot of things in my career,\u201d said Quinn. \u201c\u2018Ladylike\u2019 was never one of them \u2014 and that is fine, in my opinion. I\u2019ve always been proud to say \u2018a big, pushy broad is who I am,\u2019 and I think we needed to own that more and put that out there earlier on\u201d in the campaign. \u201cI think we didn\u2019t find a way to make that the positive that it was.\u201d\n\nCoakley believes that female candidates are frequently caught in a double bind and are more quickly and easily criticized when they make a mistake.\n\n\u201cBeing competent or working hard has never been an issue for me. I\u2019ve been in jobs that people deem I\u2019m competent in, think that I work hard at, and I\u2019m good at. I\u2019m proud of that,\u201d said Coakley. \u201cBut then it is: \u2018You have to smile more,\u2019 which is true. I think the expectation is that men may or may not smile, but if a woman isn\u2019t smiling, that\u2019s a different image. If you\u2019re too competent, then you don\u2019t have a heart. But if you\u2019re too emotional, \u2018Oh, my God, how are you going to make tough decisions?\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring a televised debate one week before the election, she and Baker were asked, \u201cWhen was the last time you cried?,\u201d a question some observers thought was designed to accentuate Coakley\u2019s steely mien. Coakley spoke of attending a memorial service that day for a friend who had died of leukemia. Baker offered an emotional tale of an unnamed New Bedford fisherman whose two sons had to give up college football scholarships in order to work in the state\u2019s dwindling fishing industry. After reporters tried unsuccessfully to verify the fisherman\u2019s identity and noted that Baker had told the same tale years before, Baker allowed that he might have misremembered some of the story\u2019s key elements.\n\nCoakley doesn\u2019t think the question targeted her, but it did underscore a double standard. The fisherman story was \u201can amalgam at best. But he was given a pass on that, and I never would have been.\u201d\n\nWhen Hagan first arrived in the U.S. Senate in 2009, she made waves after insisting that the Senate\u2019s men-only pool be opened up to women. \u201cI\u2019d have guys come up to me and say, \u2018Why do you want to use the pool? It\u2019s kind of small,\u2019\u201d said Hagan. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say, \u2018Because you do and I don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite such retrograde traditions, Hagan said she hadn\u2019t encountered the kind of sexual harassment that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and others have said they\u2019ve experienced, and that sexism on Capitol Hill stems from ignorance rather than spite. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s unfriendly; I would say it\u2019s an unrecognized issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, with anything, you\u2019ve got to pick your battles,\u201d said Hagan. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to figure out what battle is one of the most important at that time, and you\u2019ve got to go after it aggressively. You can\u2019t pick a fight with every issue, because then I think women tend to be seen as: \u2018She\u2019s just somebody who complains.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough more women are winning elected offices than ever, men still vastly outnumber them. The three said there are several factors that keep more women from throwing their hats into the ring, from the burdens of fundraising to the relentless and increasingly vitriolic tone of political media.\n\n\u201cI think that keeps good people from running. Does it have more of an effect on women than men? I don\u2019t actually know the answer to that question, but I think the viciousness of campaigns nowadays is certainly affecting the overall candidate pool, and that has an effect on women, without a doubt,\u201d said Quinn.\n\n\u201cI think there are two or three key issues. One is, for women, they want to wait until the time is right,\u201d said Hagan. \u201cI tell them, \u2018There\u2019s never going to be a perfect time, so don\u2019t wait on it.\u2019 And the second thing is, women typically need to be recruited, even in 2015. Women want to be the most qualified person at whatever it is they do. Men don\u2019t think that way.\u201d\n\nThe soaring costs of running a viable political campaign mean that candidates have to be able to call upon supporters who can \u2014 and will \u2014 write bigger and bigger checks.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s daunting for women, particularly if they haven\u2019t had to raise money\u201d before, said Coakley. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, and it takes an enormous amount of time to be on the phone. In Massachusetts, where the limits are very low, every candidate spends a huge amount of time just raising money. And if you don\u2019t have a network of people who can give money and raise money for you, it almost becomes a barrier to getting involved.\u201d\n\nDespite the difficulties, all three say they still counsel and encourage young women to get into politics, but to go in with their eyes open and with a full understanding of the challenges ahead.\n\n\u201cWell, this is true for men and women: You have to have a reason you want to be the elected official,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cWhat is it you bring to the table; what is it you\u2019re passionate about; what is it you believe you have the unique ability to fix that someone else doesn\u2019t have? You need to be willing to work hard, and you have to be willing to bear up under scrutiny, and you have to accept that you will operate, for better or worse, in a field where things will get unpleasant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to get experience, like to work on campaigns, work for candidates, develop issues you care about, understand the mechanics of what it means to be a candidate, and how you put a campaign together. And then figure out if that\u2019s something you can do, or you want to do.\u201d said Coakley.\n\nHagan says Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s bestseller, \u201cLean In,\u201d is instructive in that it identifies how many smart, ambitious women sometimes feel twinges of self-doubt just below the surface. She advises young women to recognize this is probably a gender-related commonality, but then to, \u201cGet over it. Get over it! I\u2019ve been telling women this here at Harvard: Be one of the first people to ask questions in your class. Don\u2019t sit back and let the guys ask all the questions. \u2026 Don\u2019t always feel like you have to do the grunt work.\u201d\n\nAs for their own political futures, Hagan was undecided about whether she\u2019ll go after Republican Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s seat in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m really being encouraged to do that, but there\u2019s a lot out there, and I\u2019m not saying yes nor no at this time,\u201d she said.\n\nCoakley said she isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s next, but thinks her days in elected office are probably over. \u201cI think [that] for now. I never say never, but I\u2019ve got so many other things I want to do and I\u2019m interested in.\u201d\n\nQuinn said she hopes to be a candidate again one day. In January, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office announced that Quinn will serve as a special adviser, focused initially on extending the State University of New York\u2019s (SUNY) new comprehensive rape and sexual-assault policy to all private and public colleges and universities statewide. New York state currently has the largest number of schools in the nation under federal supervision for Title IX compliance.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t started yet because I\u2019ve been here, but I\u2019m continuing, as I say, to annoy people in Albany,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#99283c", "news_keywords": "Bill de Blasio, Charlie Baker, Christina Pazzanese, Christine Quinn, Harvard Kennedy School, Institute of Politics, Kay Hagan, Martha Coakley, Scott Brown, The New York Times, Thom Tillis,", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Gazette", "description": "IOP Fellows Martha Coakley, Kay Hagan, and Christine Quinn talk candidly about their battle-scarred campaign days and advise students on what it really takes to make it in politics.", "title": "Three strong women", "url": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/04/three-strong-women/", "image": "http://media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IOP_Triptych_605.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harvard", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harvard"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Harvard Gazette", "robots": "all", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": 593072576, "page_id": 105930651606, "app_id": 135898969862440}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/themes/gazette20/a/i/appletouch.gif", "keywords": "Bill de Blasio, Charlie Baker, Christina Pazzanese, Christine Quinn, Harvard Kennedy School, Institute of Politics, Kay Hagan, Martha Coakley, Scott Brown, The New York Times, Thom Tillis,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "description": "IOP fellows Coakley, Hagan, and Quinn talk candidly about politics, gender, and governing | IOP Fellows Martha Coakley, Kay Hagan, and Christine Quinn talk candidly about their battle-scarred campaign days and advise students on what it really takes to make it in politics."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda718\"", "article_summary": "You can\u2019t pick a fight with every issue, because then I think women tend to be seen as: \u2018She\u2019s just somebody who complains.\u2019\u201dAlthough more women are winning elected offices than ever, men still vastly outnumber them.\nThe three women have been in the trenches of American politics for decades and have the battle scars to prove it.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s daunting for women, particularly if they haven\u2019t had to raise money\u201d before, said Coakley.\nI\u2019ve been telling women this here at Harvard: Be one of the first people to ask questions in your class.\nNews coverage of the Ebola pandemic and hostage beheadings by ISIS \u201csucked the wind out\u201d of the Democrats\u2019 strong economic message, she said."}
