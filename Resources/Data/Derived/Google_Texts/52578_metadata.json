Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I'd have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The Ku Klux Klan?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: There are groups in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair. So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: OK, I mean I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...\n\n\n\nTRUMP: I don't know anything -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met him, I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him.\n\nAs I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. pic.twitter.com/OIXFKPUlz2 \u2014 Donald J.

But the fact is that in the early 1990s, or at some point ten or 15 years ago when Donald Trump was thinking about running for president in the Reform Party, one of the reasons why he said he wasn't going to run is because David Duke is part of the Reform Party. So he knows exactly who David Duke is.\"\n\nDonald Trump knew David Duke was a klansman in 2000, yet denies knowledge of him now. https://t.co/P3eMUj3lWP pic.twitter.com/kJQUKqMxim \u2014 Justin Green (@JGreenDC) February 28, 2016\n\nMy God.\n\nThis is Trump implying that the judge in the Trump U. case is against him because the judge is Hispanic. pic.twitter.com/lpjJJkOUqp \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) February 27, 2016", "article_metadata": {"description": "Footsie..05/27/2016 7:06:49AM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Footsie.", "title": "Video: Trump Repeatedly Avoids Condemning Infamous White Supremacist and KKK", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/02/29/video-trump-refuses-to-condemn-infamous-white-supremacist-or-kkk-n2126209", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/2/28/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Footsie.", "title": "Video: Trump Repeatedly Avoids Condemning Infamous White Supremacist and KKK", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/02/29/video-trump-refuses-to-condemn-infamous-white-supremacist-or-kkk-n2126209", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/2/28/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Video: Trump Repeatedly Avoids Condemning Infamous White Supremacist and KKK, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "TAPPER: OK, I mean I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...TRUMP: I don't know anything -- honestly, I don't know David Duke.\nI don't believe I've ever met him, I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him.\nDonald Trump knew David Duke was a klansman in 2000, yet denies knowledge of him now.\nAs I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow.\npic.twitter.com/OIXFKPUlz2 \u2014 Donald J.
