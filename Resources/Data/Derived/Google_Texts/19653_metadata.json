That has to be an improvement on his call for global warming regulations in response to the Islamist raid on Paris last month.\n\nOne supposes he could have urged Americans to enroll in ObamaCare or to cut out fatty foods as a rebuke to evildoers. At least gun control is about guns.\n\nBut in the broader sense, the president\u2019s call for restrictions on firearms sales in the wake of the attack is of the same nature as his Paris posture: Using the attention generated by terrorism to push his domestic agenda.\n\n\n\nIt has long been said that the president is much more interested in domestic policy than foreign policy and it\u2019s certainly no mystery what his priorities are for his final 13 months in office: global warming and gun control.\n\nSo is he being cynical in exploiting national attention to plump for his legacy projects?\n\n\n\nMaybe he was just looking for a way to explain why he was going to Paris just two weeks after the attack for an unrelated purpose \u2013 more of an excuse than an exploitation. Or maybe he really believes that the two issues are connected. But even if you grant the president the assumption of sincerity in his global warming response to Paris, it still looks pretty tacky.\n\n\n\nWhat about his crusade for gun control measures? Three years ago, Obama promised to do \u201ceverything in [his] power\u201d to end mass shootings. He also made clear that he saw regulations on firearms the cornerstone of that effort.\n\n\n\nIt hasn\u2019t worked. There have been more people killed in mass shootings in the three years since that speech than in the three years before the slaughter that precipitated it. Even many Democrats have ignored the president\u2019s call for new gun laws.\n\n\n\nPart of the problem has been that the laws proposed \u2013 particularly the demand for background checks on private sales \u2013 would not have prevented the Newtown, Conn. school massacre or many, if any, of the subsequent killings.\n\n\n\nIf you propose a controversial law in response to a tragedy, the law ought to at least have been able to have been effective in that case.\n\n\n\nAnd on that count, the president\u2019s call for banning gun sales to those 700,000-or-so Americans who aren\u2019t allowed to fly on commercial planes comes up similarly short. \u201cIf you\u2019re too dangerous to board a plane, you\u2019re too dangerous, by definition, to buy a gun,\u201d the president said.\n\n\n\nBut the killers in California apparently weren\u2019t on the \u201cno-fly\u201d list. They were deemed safe to travel.\n\nThe hope among Democrats seems to be that by winning any new restriction of gun sales, even if small or simply symbolic, they can start to build momentum for other, larger restrictions.\n\n\n\nOr perhaps the president is simply out of ideas when it comes to domestic terror attacks. There have been at least three substantial attacks by Islamists in the U.S. on his watch and it\u2019s hard to imagine that there won\u2019t be more.\n\nBut given the way that the president structured his Sunday night address, it\u2019s hard not to think that he saw a political opportunity in tragedy and hoped to steer national fear and outrage toward his desired outcome. After speaking as commander in chief for five minutes \u2013 strong, reassuring, non-partisan \u2013 he shifted in topic and tone to rebuke his political rivals for alleged Islamophobia and support for gun rights.\n\n\n\nIt was almost as if he couldn\u2019t resist trying to make the most of the moment. Like they say: Never let a crisis go to waste.\n\nHillary still says no to term \u2018radical Islam\u2019 - Fox News: \u201cDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton declined Sunday to say that a \u2018radical\u2019 form of Islam is behind terror attacks connected to the Islamic State and other such attacks committed by fringe members of the Muslim religion. \u2018I don't want to do that because, No. 1, it doesn't do justice to the vast numbers of Muslims in our own country and around the world who are peaceful people,\u2019 she told ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018The nature of freedom\u2019 - Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., went to San Bernardino to record his response to President Obama\u2019s remarks: \u201cThis is not about workplace violence. This is not about global warming or gun shows. This is not about income inequality. This is not about kids from broken homes, as tragic as that is. This is not about anything we have done wrong. This is about who we are. This is about the nature of freedom.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nWaPo: \u201cInside an old aircraft factory [in Nebraska], behind the glass windows of a pristine laboratory, the lost crew of the USS Oklahoma rests on special tables covered in black foam\u2026They are the unidentified remains of hundreds of sailors and Marines who perished 74 years ago Monday, when Japan launched a surprise air attack on Hawaii and plunged the United States into World War II\u2026Over the past six months, with a fresh mandate from the Defense Department, the bones were exhumed from a cemetery in Hawaii and most were brought to a new lab here, where scientists have begun the task.

What is slowing his collapse in national polls is the wellspring of good feelings voters continue to have about Carson.\n\nUnfortunately for Carson, his current rate of descent would have him out of the race in two months. The question now is whether the one-time frontrunner has a second act within him. Four years ago, Newt Gingrich returned from an initial collapse had a The Carson campaign has emphasized that its high spending rate was devoted to more than just raising additional funds from small-dollar donors, and that there was a real organization in the making. The next few weeks will reveal whether that really was the case.\n\nCarson\u2019s loss in this week\u2019s Power Index is Jeb Bush\u2019s gain. There is still no apparent path to the nomination for the former Florida governor who boasts the second highest unfavorability rating among Republicans, better only than Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Bush has been on a media blitz with both advertisements and interviews, but has yet to see material gains. And now Bush has to worry about the growing specter of a Chris Christie renaissance as the New Jersey governor hugs New Hampshire voters tighter than Jerry Jones in a skybox.\n\nIn the top-tier, Donald Trump again shows the value of intense support. As the Quinnipiac University poll out last week shows us again Trump enjoys the highest share of voters who say they have made up their minds of any candidate. There may be serious constraints on Trump\u2019s broader appeal within the party but among his voters there is no one but him.\n\n1) Ted Cruz; 2) Marco Rubio; 3) Donald Trump [+1]; 4) Carly Fiorina [-1]; 5) Jeb Bush [+1]; 6) Ben Carson [-1];\n\n\n\nOn the radar - Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins \u201cThe Real Story with Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\n\n\n\nWhat would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, gives Chris Stirewalt his first reaction to the successful gambit by Senate Republicans to advance a measure to repeal ObamaCare, a cause Hatch has championed since the law was passed. While Obama will surely veto the measure, Hatch says that there will be real repercussions \u2013 particularly if the GOP can pull off a presidential victory in 2016.Hatch, the longest-serving Senate Republican and chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, discusses where the road goes from here. WATCH HERE.\n\n\n\nNOT THE KIND OF SUPER PAC ATTENTION HE WAS HOPING FOR\n\nPro-GOP group America Rising is having some fun with Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet who the group says posted unedited shots of himself campaigning in what seems to be an attempt to indirectly coordinate with outside groups making ads on his behalf. Bennet is a vulnerable incumbent Democrat, and has been vocal opponent of outside money in campaigns.\n\n\n\nAmerica Rising took him up on the offer to use the video to make an attack ad targeting the Bennet on his support for ObamaCare, which is blamed for huge insurance coverage disruptions in the state, and the president\u2019s now infamous \u201cif you like it, you can keep it\u201d pledge.\n\n\n\n\u201cSen. Bennet is apparently soliciting Super PAC assistance and America Rising is happy to help get the facts out about his record,\u201d said America Rising Press Secretary Amelia Chass\u00e9 said in a statement. \u201cSen. Bennet betrayed the people of Colorado when he repeated President Obama\u2019s lie that Americans could keep their doctor under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nLICK YOUR OWN PUTIN!\n\nReuters: Russians gathered on Saturday in the city of St Petersburg for a chocolate fair with one rather special guest. Russian President Vladimir Putin was in attendance, except this Putin was made of chocolate. A St. Petersburg sculptor, Nikita Gusev, was commissioned to fashion the life-size sculpture for the Chocolate Fair. ... Organisers said the Putin sculpture was to be the main attraction at the fair but warned there would be no touching, licking or biting allowed. \u2026 One of those in attendance, St. Petersburg resident Yelena, found it all rather amusing. \u201cUnfortunately in real life there are many people who want to lick him and even more [when he is] in chocolate form. You understand what I am talking about. We have a lot of people who like to lick the authorities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cWoody Allen said showing up is 80 percent of life. In that sense, he showed up, finally appeared to address the issue. I think that counts for something. As to the substance and tone, I think it's a complete failure.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer responding to President Obama\u2019s remarks on last week\u2019s terrorist attack in California.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
