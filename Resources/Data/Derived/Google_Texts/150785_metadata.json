That didn\u2019t stop Abbott, however. So in early November, while dishing out food, he was given a citation for breaking law. His crime: He was feed the homeless without providing a Porta-Potty.\n\nSeriously.\n\nIt appears that Fort Lauderdale officials don\u2019t want homeless people gathering in their city. Mayor Jack Seiler was quoted by CNN as saying, \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with having a cycle of homeless in the city of Fort Lauderdale. Providing them with a meal and keeping them in that cycle on the street is not productive.\u201d\n\nBecause if you let them gather in public, they might \u2026 what? Bother people? Look not as spiffy as the other residents of Fort Lauderdale? Because if we give hungry and hurting people a hot meal, it will keep them homeless forever?\n\nSimilar warped thinking applies to Denver: If you put a big fence around an area where homeless people hang out downtown, maybe you\u2019ll stop them from being homeless.\n\nOr, like some cities have done, if you add concrete spikes to the underpasses and nooks on the city streets, you\u2019ll force people to find homes.\n\nThis is beyond stupid. Homeless people are homeless for many, many reasons and exactly none are because a kind man and some pastors feed them sometimes.\n\nHomelessness comes from a bad turn in life \u2014 an injury, divorce, DUI, etc. \u2014 or from being a runaway or from seeing your parents struggle to hold on or, believe it or not, by choice. Yes, there are some folks on the street because they prefer living off the grid.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard for us, while we read this article in a tony coffee shop or from the comfort of our cozy kitchen, to believe there are some out there who make the choice consciously to be homeless, but I assure you, it\u2019s true. If you gave some of the folks on the street a free house, they might actually turn you down.\n\nSo, when we hear that war veteran Arnold Abbott in Florida wishes to spend his own money and time feeding folks who need a little help, we should let him do so.\n\nThe matter is now in the courts: A Broward County judge last week asked prosecutors to delay filing formal charges against Abbott for 30 days pending mediation.\n\nWhat is wrong with this country that our hearts and compassion go out the window because we don\u2019t want to see a few folks who don\u2019t look as spiffy as we do? Why is it wrong to help them simply because there isn\u2019t a Porta-Potty next to the food table?\n\nThe simple answer is we should help people. All people.\n\nMarijo Tinlin is a writer and small-business owner in Superior.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Don\u2019t feed the homeless?", "title": "Don\u2019t feed the homeless?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/05/dont-feed-the-homeless/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__20141207_Z00_OP07V_TINLINp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__20141207_Z00_OP07V_TINLINp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T14:58:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:33:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But in October, the Fort Lauderdale city commission passed a law that restricts where you can feed homeless people in outdoor public places.\nIt appears that Fort Lauderdale officials don\u2019t want homeless people gathering in their city.\nHomeless people are homeless for many, many reasons and exactly none are because a kind man and some pastors feed them sometimes.\nNinety-year-old Arnold Abbott has been providing meals to the homeless in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., since 1991 through his organization, Love Thy Neighbor.\nHis crime: He was feed the homeless without providing a Porta-Potty."}
