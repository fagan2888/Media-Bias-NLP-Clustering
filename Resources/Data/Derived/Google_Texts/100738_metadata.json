While no recession is forecast at this point, the slowdown in trade will weigh on global economic growth, which is running well below its long-term average.\n\nIn a report released Monday, the OECD cut its forecast for global economic growth from 3.0 percent to 2.9 percent in 2015, and from 3.6 percent to 3.3 percent in 2016. The numbers mark a decline from an interim report the organization issued in September and a sharp reduction from last November, when the group initially pegged growth for 2015 at 3.7 percent.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton May Be the Biggest Winner from the Blowout October Jobs Report\n\nGlobal trade has been growing slowly for the past few years, and appears to have stagnated in the last 12 months. The growth of world trade will fall below 2 percent in 2015 and actually shrink in nations outside the OECD.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in global trade and the continuing weakness in investment are deeply concerning. Robust trade and investment and stronger global growth should go hand in hand,\u201d Angel Gurria, secretary general for the 34-member nation OECD, said during a speech presenting the findings in Paris.\n\nEconomic growth in the United States should reach 2.4 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year, according to the new report. The OECD originally has growth at 2.6 percent for 2016. The group foresees 2.4 percent growth in 2017. That\u2019s roughly in line with other economic outlooks, including one by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nBut other countries, including Russia and to some extent China, may have a bumpier path.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Case Against the Fed Is Not Completely Crazy\n\nChina comes off relatively well in the new analysis, at least for the time being. The OECD raised its 2015 growth forecast from 6.7 to 6.8 percent in 2015 and maintained its 2016 prediction at 6.5 percent. However in 2017, Beijing could see its growth drop back to 6.2 percent.\n\nThe expected drop-off would be especially problematic for other leading economies, which have relied on China to be the engine for global growth in recent years. The new data chalks the decline up to the country\u2019s shift away from its massive infrastructure building toward an economy centered on consumer goods and services.\n\nWhile China\u2019s possible softening is cause for concern, Russia is already in hot water. Bluntly declaring that the \u201ceconomy is in recession\u201d in part due to the huge depreciation of the ruble, the OECD says Russian gross domestic product is on track to drop 4 percent in 2015 and 0.4 percent next year.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Case Against the Fed Is Not Completely Crazy\n\nRussia energy consumption is also a concern, according to the report.\n\nIt calls Russia \u201cone of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases.\u201d\n\n\u201cLow air quality contributes to a high premature mortality rate. Attaining the goal of a 40 [percent] reduction of the energy intensity of GDP from 2008 levels by 2020 will be challenging,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe OECD suggests a number of corrective steps Moscow and others could take to recover, such as instituting reforms in education and labor markets.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new report by a global economic think tank is warning of a steady decline in public investment and a lull in trade that could place some of the world\u2019s top economies on track to a new recession, although the United States is likely to emerge relatively unscathed form the downturn over the next two years.", "title": "Global Trade Is Falling to Recession Levels", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/09/Global-Trade-Falling-Recession-Levels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182010_globe_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/09/Global-Trade-Falling-Recession-Levels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182010_globe_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new report by a global economic think tank is warning of a steady decline in public investment and a lull in trade that could place some of the world\u2019s top economies on track to a new recession, although the United States is likely to emerge relatively unscathed form the downturn over the next two years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A new report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is warning that global trade is slowing to levels usually found during global recessions.\nWhile no recession is forecast at this point, the slowdown in trade will weigh on global economic growth, which is running well below its long-term average.\n\u201cThe slowdown in global trade and the continuing weakness in investment are deeply concerning.\nThe expected drop-off would be especially problematic for other leading economies, which have relied on China to be the engine for global growth in recent years.\nThe OECD raised its 2015 growth forecast from 6.7 to 6.8 percent in 2015 and maintained its 2016 prediction at 6.5 percent."}
