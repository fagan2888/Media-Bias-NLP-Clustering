Former editor Coulson goes to prison in U.K. hacking case

Andy Coulson, once editor of Britain's best-selling newspaper, went to prison on Friday after being sentenced to 18 months for conspiring to hack the phones of celebrities, royals, politicians, and crime victims. Judge John Saunders said Coulson, 46, "has to take the major share of the blame" for the eavesdropping done by reporters while he was editor of Rupert Murdoch's now-defunct News of the World between 2003 and 2007. "He encouraged it when he should have stopped it," the judge said.
