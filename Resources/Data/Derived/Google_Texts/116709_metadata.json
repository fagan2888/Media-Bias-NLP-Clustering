Americans tell Reason-Rupe that 75 percent of all politicians are \u201ccorrupted\u201d by campaign donations and lobbyists. And they say 70 percent of politicians use their political power to help their friends and hurt their enemies.\n\nNo wonder just 17 percent approve of the job Congress is doing. Or that President Obama\u2019s approval rating is just 43 percent, with 51 percent disapproving.\n\nAnd while the Supreme Court just struck down limits on campaign contributions to federal candidates, the new Reason-Rupe poll finds Americans are actually more concerned about how elected officials misuse their power and taxpayer money once they\u2019re in office than they are worried about campaign contributions.\n\nAsked, which is a \u201cmore serious\u201d problem \u2014 \u201cspecial interest groups spending private money on campaigns to elect the politicians they favor\u201d or \u201celected officials enacting policies and spending taxpayer money that benefit the special interests they favor\u201d \u2014 63 percent of Americans said officials enacting policies and spending taxpayer money for special interests was a more serious problem.\n\nSimilarly, Americans say they are \u201cmore bothered\u201d by politicians abusing political power than they are by some of the personal issues most often associated with political downfalls. Seventy percent of Americans say they would be \u201cmost bothered\u201d by a politician who used his or her political power to bully someone, while 14 percent would be most bothered by a politician using drugs, and 11 percent would be most bothered by a politician who cheated on his/her spouse.\n\nThe Reason-Rupe national poll conducted live interviews with 1,003 Americans on mobile (503) and landline (500) phones from March 26-30, 2013. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.6 percent. Princeton Survey Research Associates International executed the nationwide Reason-Rupe survey.\n\nPaying NCAA Basketball Players\n\nWith the Final Four approaching, just 42 percent of Americans say college athletes should be paid. However, when they learn the NCAA makes over $700 million a year from the television broadcast rights to the NCAA basketball tournament, 50 percent of Americans tell Reason-Rupe that college basketball players should receive a share of the television revenue. And 64 percent of Americans say college athletes should receive some of the revenue when their jerseys are sold or likenesses are used in video games or on merchandise.\n\nFlight 370 Conspiracy Theories\n\nWith Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 still missing, there are no shortages of theories about what happened. Reason-Rupe finds 35 percent of Americans think a mechanical problem caused the plane to crash, 22 percent believe the pilots crashed the plane intentionally, 12 percent feel it was destroyed by terrorists, 9 percent say the plane landed safely and is in hiding, 5 percent believe the disappearance is related to supernatural or alien activity, and 3 percent think it was shot down by a foreign government.\n\nTrusting the IRS, NSA and Facebook\n\nThe NSA topped Facebook when Americans were asked who is most likely to violate their privacy. Thirty-six percent of Americans said the NSA was most likely to violate their trust, 26 percent said Facebook, 18 percent said the IRS and 12 percent said Google.\n\nBut when it comes to whom the public would trust the most with their personal information, 35 percent said the Internal Revenue Service, 18 percent said the NSA, 10 percent said Google and just 5 percent said they trust Facebook the most with their privacy.\n\nTax Returns and Government Waste\n\nAmericans may trust the IRS more than Facebook, but with the April 15 deadline for filing federal income tax returns approaching, they\u2019re reminded of how much money they send to the government. Asked open-ended how much of every tax dollar is wasted, the median answer was half, 50 cents.\n\nThis time of year also reminds Americans of the overly complicated tax code. Sixty-two percent of Americans say they\u2019d favor switching to a flat tax. When asked open-ended what they\u2019d set the flat tax to, Americans said 15 percent (median).\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nFifty-three percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Affordable Care Act, while 36 percent have a favorable view of the law in this Reason-Rupe poll.\n\nForty-three percent of Americans say they will blame the federal health care law if their health care premiums increase or their health care plan changes in the next year. Twenty-six percent say they\u2019ll blame health insurance companies, 17 percent would blame the economy and 5 percent would blame their employers.\n\nMinimum Wage\n\nReason-Rupe finds 67 percent of Americans favor increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour.\n\nFifty-one percent would still support raising the minimum wage, even if they had to pay higher prices as a result. However, just 39 percent of Americans would still favor raising the minimum wage if it caused companies to lay off or hire fewer workers.\n\nWhen it comes to paying for a higher minimum wage, 38 percent say companies would raise their prices, 32 percent say companies would lay off workers, 18 percent say they\u2019d reduce executive salaries, and 6 percent say firms would accept smaller profits.\n\nForty percent of Americans say raising the minimum wage would have no impact on the number of jobs available, 38 percent say it would decrease the number of jobs, and 20 percent believe it would increase the number of jobs.\n\n2014 Elections\n\nIf the 2014 elections were held today, 40 percent of Americans said they\u2019d vote for the Democrat in the congressional district and 36 percent would vote for the Republican. When it comes to controlling Congress, 29 percent of Americans would like Democrats to take control, 24 would like Republicans to control Congress and 43 percent wish neither major party would be in control of Congress.\n\nRepublican Party Presidential Primary\n\nMike Huckabee 15%\n\nPaul Ryan 12%\n\nRand Paul 11%\n\nJeb Bush 11%\n\nChris Christie 10%\n\nTed Cruz 6%\n\nMarco Rubio 6%\n\nDemocratic Party 2016 Presidential Primary\n\nHillary Clinton 64%\n\nJoe Biden 11%\n\nElizabeth Warren 6%\n\nEnergy Subsidies and Keystone Pipeline\n\nAmericans favor building the Keystone Pipeline by a 61-32 margin, Reason-Rupe finds. Fifty-eight percent of Americans support giving subsidies to wind, solar and hydrogen energy companies. Just 31 percent of Americans favor giving subsidies to oil, gas and coal companies.\n\nPolice Conduct\n\nReason-Rupe finds 78 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the police. However, with protests over police shootings in places like Albuquerque, 50 percent of Americans say police officers are not generally held accountable for misconduct, while 46 percent say police are held accountable. Sixty-six percent of blacks and 64 percent of Hispanics say the police are not held accountable for misconduct.\n\nNearly nine in 10 Americans, 88 percent, believe citizens should be allowed to videotape uniformed police officers while they are making arrests or performing other parts of their jobs.\n\nFull Poll\n\nPoll results and additional Reason-Rupe poll resources are available here.
