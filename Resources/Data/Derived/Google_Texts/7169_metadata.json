So it\u2019s going to cost one way or another.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost five million Floridians are uninsured. That\u2019s 28 percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nJenny Rose, a student at the Florida Coastal School of Law, also appeared on the show. Rose is a mother of four.\n\nHer family can\u2019t afford insurance under the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as \u201cObamacare,\u201d and they don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid.\n\nRose\u2019s husband suffers from congestive heart failure, and she says his medical bills are expensive.\n\nSullivan says without Medicaid expansion, the cost to treat uninsured patients will be higher because they won\u2019t get help when they need it.\n\nRose said, \u201cIt\u2019s about the people and what the people need, and if you do not cover the people, they\u2019re going to get sicker.\u201d\n\nListen to the full conversation with Sarah Sullivan and Jenny Rose on Monday\u2019s episode of the \u201cFirst Coast Connect\u201d podcast on iTunes or Stitcher.\n\nPhoto credit: \"Florida State Capitol and Florida House Office\" by Michael Rivera is used under CC BY-SA 3.0.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Underinsured Floridians are concerned about health care coverage after the Florida House voted down Medicaid expansion for the state.
