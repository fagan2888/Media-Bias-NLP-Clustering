Ted Cruz and GOP strategist Karl Rove escalated late Sunday, with Cruz dusting off an email exchange from 2009 to refute Rove\u2019s denial of claims in his forthcoming book.\n\n\u201cI never imagined that his response would be a straight-out falsehood. It\u2019s disappointing; this is why people are so cynical about politics, because too many people are willing to lie,\u201d Cruz said in a statement issued by his campaign.\n\nCruz asserted in his book that Rove was angry that he\u2019d secured a donation and endorsement from former President George H.W. Bush, and that Rove said Bush\u2019s advanced age made his judgment unreliable. The emails Cruz released don\u2019t support the ageism allegation. But they do show Rove explicitly saying the endorsement would anger Bush library donors and supporters of state Rep. Dan Branch, who was also angling to replace Abbott, something Rove denied earlier today.\n\n\u201c[The] distress you mention is not mine or 43 \u2014 it is the people raising money for the library who are also Branch fans and will not understand why one part of the Bush family is for not-the-guy while they are raising money big bucks for library,\u201d Rove wrote in the email released by Cruz.\n\nRead the entire email exchange at the end of this blog item.\n\nupdated 5pm with Rove response\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Add GOP operative Karl Rove to the ever-growing list of Ted Cruz\u2019s political adversaries.\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s forthcoming book, A Time for Truth, set for publication on Tuesday, he recounts a tense confrontation in which Rove bullied him into burying an endorsement from George H.W. Bush amid concerns that would alienate donors to the George W. Bush library in Dallas.\n\nRove, in Cruz\u2019s telling, also called Bush \u201ctoo old\u201d to exercise sound political judgment in such matters \u2013 an assertion bound to stir consternation in the tight knit family hoping to elect its third president next year.\n\nSunday afternoon, Rove issued a stern denial, saying he never questioning the mental faculties of a president he has revered for decades. He said his concern about the endorsement was that Greg Abbott hadn\u2019t yet announced whether he would seek re-election as attorney general.\n\n\u201cMy call to Mr. Cruz apparently didn\u2019t offend him back then because he continued seeking my counsel about his political ambitions, specifically his 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate,\u201d Rove said. \u201cOne piece of advice I offered was that he should stop describing himself as the `next Marco Rubio,\u2019 since he did not have Senator Rubio\u2019s outstanding legislative record of accomplishments as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.\u201d (Full statement below.)\n\nThe run-in took place during Cruz\u2019s short-lived campaign for state attorney general in 2009. George P. Bush \u2013 son of Jeb Bush, and now the Texas land commissioner \u2013offered to introduce him to his grandfather, who turned 91 this month.\n\nCruz flew to the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. He ended up hitting it off with the 41st president. He scored an afternoon on the boat with him and Barbara Bush with a stop for lobster rolls along the coast. Bush lent him some clothes so he wouldn\u2019t have to wear his suit \u2013 including jeans and a belt buckle that read \u201cPresident of the United States.\u201d\n\nCruz called it \u201csurreal\u201d to be wearing Bush\u2019s clothes.\n\nHe returned to Houston with a $1,000 donation and an endorsement.\n\nRove \u2013 George W. Bush\u2019s longtime consigliore \u2014 heard about the meeting and called Cruz, livid.\n\n\u201cHe was irate, demanding, \u2018What in the hell do you think you are doing?!\u2019\u201d the senator writes. \u201cTexas donors were giving the Bushes tens of millions, including major donors who were supporting the Dallas state rep who wanted to run for attorney general\u201d \u2013 Cruz doesn\u2019t name him, but was referring to Dan Branch \u2013 and those donors \u201cwere now berating Karl.\u201d\n\nThen, in a passage that could \u2013 intentionally or not \u2014 sow divisions in the Bush orbit, Cruz asserts that Rove denigrated the aging Bush\u2019s mental capacity.\n\n\u201cHe suggested that the elder Bush was too old to have good judgment anymore,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cI was offended by that characterization and knew from my visit with 41 that it wasn\u2019t remotely true.\u201d\n\nRove demanded that Cruz return the check, but it had already been cashed. Cruz did give into pressure to keep quiet about Bush\u2019s support, though.\n\n\u201cHe implied that if I made any news about Bush 41\u2019s support, then Bush 43 would endorse my opponent,\u201d Cruz writes. That stung, given the four years he\u2019d devoted to electing and then serving the president. He wasn\u2019t sure if Rove had the authority to make such threats on behalf of the Bushes, but \u201cthe last thing I wanted to do in running a fledgling campaign in Texas was to get on the wrong side of Rove and the second President Bush.\u201d\n\nWithin hours, Cruz had received an approved draft of an endorsement from the elder Bush\u2019s office. In the face of Rove\u2019s objections, he told campaign aides to \u201cthrow it in the trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to anger Karl or 43. The former president\u2019s office said he understood,\u201d Cruz writes.\n\nThe bid for attorney general fizzled when Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison backed away from public avowals to step down early, win or lose, after challenging Rick Perry for governor in the 2010 primary. Cruz turned his sights to winning her seat when her term ended in 2012.\n\nRove later tried to talk him out of that race, urging him to take the easier path in 2012 and run for attorney general, rather than challenging the establishment favorite, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d Rove told him.\n\nThe conservative news site Breitbart first reported the incident. Cruz\u2019s book tour begins Monday.\n\nRove issued a response Sunday afternoon. His full response follows, followed by the emails released late Sunday by the Cruz campaign.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi9jcnV6LWJvb2stcm92ZS1idWxsaWVkLWhpbS1vdmVyLWJ1c2g0MS1zdXBwb3J0LWFuZC1jYWxsZWQtYnVzaC10b28tb2xkLWZvci1zdWNoLWp1ZGdtZW50cy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
