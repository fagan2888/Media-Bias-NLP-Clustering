Instead, North Korea announced Monday the president of its parliament would attend the celebration.\n\nThe trip would have been significant for Kim not just because it was to be his first venture abroad as ruler, but because Russia was the destination. The potential visit, as well as various discussions about deepening North Korea\u2019s economic ties with Moscow, had been seen by experts as evidence of Kim\u2019s desire to establish relationships that would reduce his country\u2019s dependence on China.\n\nRelated: 7 New Weapons in Vladimir Putin's Arsenal\u200b\n\nPutin\u2019s Russia, meanwhile, needs all the new friends it can get. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year, and in the face of the Kremlin\u2019s continued support of armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine, Moscow has been hit with punishing sanctions by the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRelations between Putin\u2019s government and the West have become so tense that many western leaders have also declined to attend the celebrations in Moscow this month, despite the fact that their countries were allied with Russia in the Second World War.\n\nWidely reported as a \u201csnub\u201d to Putin, North Korea\u2019s decision also sparked a rash of rumor-mongering over what the real reason behind it might be.\n\nOn Monday, Britain\u2019s Telegraph newspaper passed along a Hong Kong television report\u2019s suggestion that Kim was demonstrating his displeasure at a failed arms deal involving four of Russia\u2019s S-300 anti-aircraft/ballistic missile systems.\n\nOther reports suggested that Kim demanded to be given \u201cspecial treatment\u201d that would make him stand out among the dozens of other world leaders expected to attend. The South Korean paper Chosun Ibo reported that Kim, who is styled as something approaching a god in his own country, would suffer by comparison if he were not somehow lifted above other international leaders. Still other reports suggested that the \u201cspecial treatment\u201d complaint arose simply because Moscow had declined to accommodate a reportedly massive security entourage that Kim demanded.\n\nRelated: In Ukraine, Top US General Says Russia Is Ready to Strike\n\nFinally, the International Business Times and other publications speculated that what really bothered Kim was the prospect of a coup taking pace while he was away. They pointed out that just last week Kim had ordered 15 executions, sparking rumors that his grip on power was in question.\n\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov did nothing to quiet the rumor of a possible uprising against Kim, telling the Associated Press on Tuesday that unspecified \u201cinternal matters\u201d were behind the cancellation.\n\nWhatever the reason, what was supposed to be a \u201cYear of Friendship\u201d is turning out to be just another awkward long-distance relationship.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Just a few months after their two countries declared a \u201cYear of Friendship\u201d to celebrate greater political and economic ties, the relationship between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un is in question.", "title": "Putin and Kim Jong-un\u2019s Special \u2018Friendship\u2019 on the Rocks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/05/Putin-and-Kim-Jong-un-s-Special-Friendship-Rocks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05052015_Kim_Jong_Un.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/05/Putin-and-Kim-Jong-un-s-Special-Friendship-Rocks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05052015_Kim_Jong_Un.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Just a few months after their two countries declared a \u201cYear of Friendship\u201d to celebrate greater political and economic ties, the relationship between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un is in question.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccea0\"", "article_summary": "Related: 7 New Weapons in Vladimir Putin's Arsenal\u200bPutin\u2019s Russia, meanwhile, needs all the new friends it can get.\nOther reports suggested that Kim demanded to be given \u201cspecial treatment\u201d that would make him stand out among the dozens of other world leaders expected to attend.\nJust a few months after their two countries declared a \u201cYear of Friendship\u201d to celebrate greater political and economic ties, the relationship between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un is in question.\nStill other reports suggested that the \u201cspecial treatment\u201d complaint arose simply because Moscow had declined to accommodate a reportedly massive security entourage that Kim demanded.\nWhatever the reason, what was supposed to be a \u201cYear of Friendship\u201d is turning out to be just another awkward long-distance relationship."}
