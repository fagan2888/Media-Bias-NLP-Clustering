Germany is not trying to make an example of Greece, but it seems perfectly prepared to let the Greeks make an example of themselves. And the Greeks seem ready and willing to do just that.\n\nSo while there is always a chance of yet another last-minute deal that pushes the 5-year-old Greek crisis away from its final conclusion, it does increasingly look as though June 2015 will be the month that Athens finally says to its creditors, \u201cochi pia,\u201d which as I understand it is the Greek equivalent of \u201cno more.\u201d\n\nThe Group of Seven meeting that began yesterday did not officially include Greece\u2019s fate on its agenda, but the pending deadline for an agreement between Greece and its creditors means the topic pressed its way to the front all the same. In an interview with Bloomberg, Christian Schulz, an economist with Berenberg Bank in London, said Greece will be \u201cthe worry on everyone\u2019s mind\u201d at the meeting.\n\nWhile Greece has been on European leaders\u2019 minds for some time now, the current urgency is mainly due to that looming deadline: Unless they negotiate a new deal with their international creditors, Greek officials will not be able to pay the 300 million euros their country owes the International Monetary Fund, due June 5. Nor, presumably, the subsequent payments due next month, 1.6 billion euros total.\n\nGreece\u2019s leadership has continued to assure the international community that the country has every intention of honoring its obligations. But unless Greece can reach an accord with its creditors, intentions will be irrelevant, since the country\u2019s pockets essentially remain empty.\n\nConsistent with its philosophy that fiscal rectitude is a luxury that only the 1 percent can afford, the Obama administration, in the corporeal form of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, wants the Europeans to find a solution that keeps Greece financially afloat and within the eurozone. Lew issued a warning on America\u2019s behalf, urging European negotiators not to \u201cmiscalculate\u201d in their dealings with Greece.\n\n\u201cMy concern is not the good will of the parties,\u201d Lew said during a stopover at the London School of Economics. But, he added, \u201ca miscalculation could lead to a crisis that would be potentially very damaging.\u201d He suggested that it would be impossible to predict the scope of the consequences if Greece defaulted on its debt.\n\nBut ultimately the U.S. has no skin in this game. It will be German taxpayers, and those elsewhere in Europe, who ultimately pick up the tab for Greece\u2019s debts. Greece cannot repay these debts now, and in the absence of major reforms that the Greeks \u2013 not just their government, but their electorate \u2013 have proven simply unwilling to take, it cannot repay them ever. Once that outcome is clear, there is no other option for any rational lender except to stop shoveling money into a bottomless hole.\n\nAs my colleagues and I have written before, the Greeks never belonged in the euro. They never behaved in the manner required of a nation that was part of the eurozone. And there is no reasonable prospect that they will re-qualify for euro membership going forward. The common currency is actually hurting the Greeks, although the euro\u2019s decline this year did help soften the blow by providing some of the devaluation that the country badly needs.\n\nYes, there will be big costs to a euro exit and a Greek default, most of which will be borne by the Greeks themselves. Lew and others who want to kick the can further down the road point to those costs as a motivation to do so, but they never acknowledge that the costs will simply mount with each additional swing of the leg.\n\nOne of the largest non-Greek costs is the example this incident will set for other financially shaky, reform-resistant European nations if they see Greece getting away with siphoning money from German wallets and other equally full ones. The Irish have put their financial house in order. Spain and Portugal have endured hardships comparable to those of Greece, though they still have not fully completed necessary reforms. The Italians and French are even further from facing the global economic reality in which only European countries that maintain sound finances, competitive and flexible labor forces, and tolerable tax burdens that are efficiently administered can compete and prosper. If the Greeks fail, at least let their costly failure count as the rest of Europe\u2019s tuition payment for an education about where such a path ultimately leads.\n\nLew and the rest of the Americans in attendance will not be particularly helpful at this week\u2019s G-7 meeting. Greece isn\u2019t really our issue, and our advice is neither thoughtful nor useful, especially as far as the Germans are concerned. Yes, economic and market disruptions are likely if Greece falls out of the euro. But in the long run \u2013 which is what the Germans, at least, are thinking about \u2013 such disruptions are probably a price worth paying for a financially stronger Europe.\n\nAs in any classical tragedy, Greeks are responsible for their own choices. There is no saving them from the consequences.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Wall Street Pit", "description": "Many people think German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble are prepared to make an example of ...", "title": "Heading for the Grexit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wallstreetpit.com/wp-content/uploads/news/greece-exit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-01T09:47:30+00:00", "url": "http://wallstreetpit.com/108434-heading-for-the-grexit/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wallstreetpit", "section": "Business", "tag": "Greece", "published_time": "2015-05-28T11:07:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-01T09:47:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many people think German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble are prepared to make an example of ...", "creator": "@wallstreetpit", "image": "http://wallstreetpit.com/wp-content/uploads/news/greece-exit.jpg", "title": "Heading for the Grexit", "site": "@wallstreetpit", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca400\"", "article_summary": "Germany is not trying to make an example of Greece, but it seems perfectly prepared to let the Greeks make an example of themselves.\nBut unless Greece can reach an accord with its creditors, intentions will be irrelevant, since the country\u2019s pockets essentially remain empty.\nLew issued a warning on America\u2019s behalf, urging European negotiators not to \u201cmiscalculate\u201d in their dealings with Greece.\nSpain and Portugal have endured hardships comparable to those of Greece, though they still have not fully completed necessary reforms.\nYes, there will be big costs to a euro exit and a Greek default, most of which will be borne by the Greeks themselves."}
