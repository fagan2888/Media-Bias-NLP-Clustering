And Jersey City is nearly 10 degrees above its 1949 record of 60.\n\nTemperatures in Central Jersey were expected to be the highest today, reaching 72 over much of the region, Walker said. The rest of the state will top out in the high 60s or low 70s \u2014 by comparison, normal high temperatures hover in the low- to mid-40s this time of year.\n\nMuch of the state will surpass its daily record high today, and some individual cities could log the hottest day on record for a December. But there\u2019s one record that seems likely to stand \u2014 the highest temperature in the state recorded in December was taken in Belleplain State Forest in Cape May County on Dec. 7, 1998, when the high was 78 degrees.\n\nThe temperatures had reached their peak by mid-morning because unlike in summer, the unseasonable warmth has little to do with the sun. A storm that developed in Texas and made its way up to the Great Lakes is pushing a mass of hot, muggy air, which is now over the Northeast.\n\nFollowing behind the hot air is that storm, which will arrive today in the form of spotty showers before building to a consistent rain after midnight, Walker said.\n\nWith the rain comes a cold front, which will spoil the fun for any New Jerseyans dreaming of a shorts-and-sandals Christmas.\n\n\u201cIt's gonna be some 40 degrees colder on Christmas,\u201d with temperatures hovering around freezing, Walker said. \u201cThis warmth is a very temporary thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','jersey-city','new-brunswick','newark','nj-weather'", "title": "N.J. winter heatwave: Temperature records broken across the Garden State", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"N.J. winter heatwave: Temperature records broken across the Garden State\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/high_temperature_records_being_broken_across_nj_today.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/accuweather-warmthjpg-18fc8c000500a28c.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11868998\", \"pub_date\": \"\", \"author\": \"Tom Wright-Piersanti/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"jersey-city\",\"new-brunswick\",\"newark\",\"nj-weather\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/13978476-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@LedgerTWP", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "By 7 a.m., New Brunswick had already beaten its previous record of 65, set in 1998.
