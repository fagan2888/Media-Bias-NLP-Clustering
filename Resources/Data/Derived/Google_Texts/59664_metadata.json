The Vermont senator, who\u2019s running neck and neck with front-runner Hillary Clinton in Iowa just days ahead of the state\u2019s caucuses, emphasized that the individual savings achieved under his healthcare plan would offset the costs of the tax increase. He called critics of the strategy \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\nPelosi is taking her attacks on Bernie a step further and mocks his single-payer plan, and in doing so aligns herself with Hillary\u2019s plan to \u201cexpand and improve\u201d on ObamaCare as part of her protection of Obama\u2019s\u2014and Pelosi\u2019s\u2014legacy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talking about a single-payer, and that\u2019s not going to happen. I mean, does anybody in this room think that we\u2019re going to be discussing a single-payer?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been for single-payer for 30 years, and it is a very popular idea in our country. But we have made a decision about where we\u2019re going on healthcare.\u201d Pelosi, who was a crucial force in ushering the Affordable Care Act through Congress in 2009 and 2010, said she\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d of the achievement, citing the millions of uninsured Americans who have gained access to health coverage under the law. \u201cIt has achieved the goal of affordable, quality, accessible healthcare for many millions more Americans. It is lowering the cost of healthcare in our country,\u201d she said. . . . . \u201cRight now we\u2019re proud of what we have,\u201d she said, \u201cand want to build upon that.\u201d\n\nPelosi doesn\u2019t officially endorse Hillary, but it\u2019s quite clear whom she supports in the Democrat primary at least with regard to health care and (hidden) tax increases.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pelosi Sort of Endorses Hillary While Slamming Bernie's Tax Increases: \"We're not running on a platform of tax increases\" or on single-payer", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion", "description": "\"We're not running on a platform of tax increases\" or on single-payer", "title": "Pelosi Sort of Endorses Hillary While Slamming Bernie's Tax Increases", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Nancy-Pelosi-on-Boehner.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-28T23:32:00+00:00", "url": "http://legalinsurrection.com/2016/01/pelosi-sort-of-endorses-hillary-while-slamming-bernies-tax-increases/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2016-01-29T07:00:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-28T23:32:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 democratic primary,bernie sanders,hillary clinton,nancy pelosi", "google-site-verification": "f_SDILa9XMa3xcLX9n6eq0yDinw8hWKIjXr-0IOcgIE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Hill reports:Democrats are not on board with the tax hikes Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has proposed to pay for his single-payer healthcare proposal, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not running on a platform of tax increases\u201d or on single-payerIn the wake of the news that Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cfree stuff for everyone\u201d proposals will cost taxpayers $19.6 trillion in new taxes, Nancy Pelosi is distancing Democrats from his massive tax increases.\n\u201cWe will raise taxes, yes we will,\u201d Sanders said during a Democratic town hall in Des Moines, Iowa.\nBernie, to his credit, is not so sneaky about bilking taxpayers of money we don\u2019t really have.\nThe Hill continues:Sanders on Monday acknowledged that his \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d healthcare plan would require tax hikes on the middle class."}
