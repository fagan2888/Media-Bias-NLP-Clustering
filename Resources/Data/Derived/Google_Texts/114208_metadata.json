Jack Markell, D-Delaware, escorted the former Secretary of State onto the stage at the World Caf\u00e9 Live theater in Wilmington.\n\nOne day before the state\u2019s presidential primary election Clinton asked the audience for their vote, promising to create jobs, protect their healthcare and defend women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cIf you will go out and vote for me tomorrow I will stand up and fight for you in this campaign all the way into the White House, and every single day I will get up and figure out how I can improve the lives and protect the American people and make sure the children have the chance to live up to their God given potential,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton is the third candidate to speak to the public in Delaware during their campaigns. Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders spoke in Wilmington Saturday and Republican Donald Trump spoke in Harrington Friday.\n\nGoing into the polls Clinton leads Sanders with 1,944 total delegates. The Democratic candidates need 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.\n\nClinton has received endorsements from the majority of legislators in Delaware. When introducing Clinton on Monday, Markell called her the most qualified candidate to run for president in his lifetime.\n\n\u201cShe has spent her entire adult life fighting for the most vulnerable among us,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is well respected around the world and she will hit the ground running as Commander in Chief.\u201d\n\nDuring the event U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, told the audience he met Clinton many years ago when she was First Lady of Arkansas, and considers her a friend and someone he looks up to as a political leader.\n\n\u201cOver decades nothing speaks more concisely to who Clinton is than that she sees the challenges facing working Americans, she is passionate about finding solutions for them, and she gets busy working, doing it, making a difference and getting in the fight for Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nCongressman John Carney, D-Delaware, also pointed to Clinton\u2019s record as First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who knows how to take big ideas and make them a reality. She\u2019s not about headlines, she\u2019s not about shock value, she\u2019s not about partisanship, she\u2019s not about the refusal to compromise,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s about bringing people together and delivering on the American dream. She\u2019s about making life better for every single American.\u201d\n\nDuring her speech Clinton promised to increase jobs, especially manufacturing jobs, and keep them in the United States. She said she also wants to create more apprentice programs for trade jobs. Clinton said she will support small businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities.\n\nShe received the loudest applause when promising to raise the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay for women.\n\n\u201cAmericans have not got a raise in 15 years and some Americans still haven\u2019t recovered from the great recession,\u201d she said of the economy. \u201cThey need a president who will be on their side, will fight for them and help produce results and that\u2019s what I pledge I will do.\u201d\n\nClinton addressed the wage gap between men and women and said she will fight for women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been shopping for decades. And I have never got to the cashier at the supermarket or any store and have the cashier look at me and say, \u2018Well you\u2019re a white woman you only have to pay 78 cents on the dollar, or you\u2019re an African American woman, you only have to pay 65, 68, cents, or you\u2019re a Latina woman, you only have to pay 55 or 48 cents.\u2019 There is no woman\u2019s discount,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was a sentiment that spoke to Sandra Edmonds of Wilmington, who lined up outside the theater at 5:45 a.m. She said she believes Clinton is highly qualified and is an advocate for mental healthcare, gun control and women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cWomen have waited too long to earn 100 percent of what men earn. I\u2019ve worked all my life and still don\u2019t make that much money,\u201d Edmonds said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone who has the chance to change that and I\u2019m going to support her.\u201d\n\nClinton also mentioned Thursday\u2019s tragic death of a Howard High School of Technology student, Amy Joyner, who allegedly was beaten to death by her fellow classmates\u2014calling the incident \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to, from an early age, help children and young people to understand fighting doesn\u2019t solve things,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to work with schools, churches and our community groups.\u201d\n\nClinton defended Obamacare, marriage equality, a woman\u2019s rights to choose and worker\u2019s rights to organize. She also addressed the country\u2019s gun violence statistics, and promised to increase background checks, close several purchasing loopholes and hold gun sellers and manufacturers accountable.\n\nClinton sporadically attacked Republicans during her speech, denouncing their plans to make tax cuts for the wealthy, denying women\u2019s rights and Muslim rights.\n\nShe particularly attacked Donald Trump, the projected Republican primary winner, accusing him of being out of touch with Americans and the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cAt some point if you want to become President of the United States you have to become familiar with the United States,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cYou have to spend more time with Americans of all sorts and backgrounds in every part of our country\u2014don\u2019t just fly that jet in and land it and make a big speech and insult everyone you can think of.\u201d\n\nMarkell also echoed Clinton\u2019s sentiments during his introduction.\n\n\u201cDo we choose from the Trump\u2019s and Cruz\u2019s of the world? Dissension, derision, division and insults,\u201d he said. \u201cOr do we choose unity and passion and determination and a sense we\u2019re all in this together?\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, also referenced Trump\u2019s immigration policies when urging Delawareans to vote for Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody in this country who doesn\u2019t build walls around America, but builds bridges of understanding so we can get together and get things done,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral attendants, like Laura Wisniewski of Newark, said they already had decided to vote for Clinton prior to Monday\u2019s event. Wisniewski said she believes many young Delaware residents like herself support Clinton.\n\n\u201cI think Hillary not only has young people, she has support from all people, which is something the other candidates are lacking, and they have support in one area, whereas Hillary gathers support from all people because she\u2019s relatable,\u201d she said.\n\nEdward Thomas of Wilmington said he supports Clinton because she supports early childhood education, and promises to lower college loans and create middle class jobs.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment in this nation\u2019s history and this is the time to get a woman elected,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now we have the most qualified person in the history of the country running for office. She does not over-promise or under deliver. She promises what she can deliver and that is very important.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A crowd of Hillary Clinton supporters cheered and chanted as Gov Jack Markell D Delaware escorted the former Secretary of State onto the stage at the World Caf\u00e9 Live theater in Wilmington One day", "title": "Hillary Clinton speaks to Delaware voters in Wilmington", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate spoke to Delaware voters in Wilmington Monday morning."}, "twitter": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate spoke to Delaware voters in Wilmington Monday morning.", "title": "Hillary Clinton speaks to Delaware voters in Wilmington", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_hillary-wilmington169.jpg", "creator": "@whyyfirst", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-25", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/delaware/93163-hillary-clinton-speaks-to-delaware-voters-in-wilmington", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Zo\u00eb Read", "keywords": "clinton, about, rights, delaware, people, she\u2019s, support, their, during, americans, president, fight, woman, american, women\u2019s, wilmington, cents, spoke, hillary, states", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_hillary-wilmington169.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1938\"", "article_summary": "Wisniewski said she believes many young Delaware residents like herself support Clinton.\n\u201cAt some point if you want to become President of the United States you have to become familiar with the United States,\u201d Clinton said.\nSeveral attendants, like Laura Wisniewski of Newark, said they already had decided to vote for Clinton prior to Monday\u2019s event.\nClinton is the third candidate to speak to the public in Delaware during their campaigns.\nShe\u2019s not about headlines, she\u2019s not about shock value, she\u2019s not about partisanship, she\u2019s not about the refusal to compromise,\u201d he said."}
