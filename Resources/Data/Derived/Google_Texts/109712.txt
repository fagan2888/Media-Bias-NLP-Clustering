The extensive, at times nonstop, media coverage of the pope’s visit was justified in that as the head of 1.2 billion Catholics, Francis is a leader of spiritual depth, humble style, personal charm and unlimited compassion for the poor, vulnerable and marginalized among us. It was assumed that Francis would stay out of the culture wars, but that didn’t happen.
