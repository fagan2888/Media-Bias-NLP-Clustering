Heather Slyve of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office opened fire, shooting White in the chest, face and thigh.\n\nOne TSA agent was hit by a bullet fired by Slyve and was being treated for nonlife threatening injures, according to the TSA.\n\nSeveral bystanders suffered minor injuries. Some ran into furniture, as they scrambled to get out of the way. One person was grazed in the arm by a bullet, Normand said.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu praised the response to the incident.\n\n\u201cOfficials acted quickly to secure @NO_Airport,\u201d Landrieu tweeted. \u201cOur thoughts are with those injured in line of duty & we wish them a full & speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nTwo former New Orleans Saints players were at the airport in the midst of the chaos, CNN affiliate WDSU reported. Robert Meachem and Lance Moore described the situation as \u201cwild.\u201d\n\nCalen Bedford was among those diving for cover. \u201cI fell to the ground along with everyone around me,\u201d he told WDSU.\n\nWhy did it happen?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the motivation is,\u201d Normand said. \u201cIt is still early. We\u2019re still running that out in order to try and determine anything about this particular individual.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why White was at the airport, although he was a taxi driver and had recently received his chauffeur license.\n\nWhite has little criminal history, according to Normand. He said White had some disturbing the peace charges and some traffic tickets.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to indicate that the incident posed any sort of national security threat, Normand said.\n\nWhile the scene Friday was chaotic and disruptive, things should be calmer Saturday, with the airport saying in a statement that \u201cthe situation is under control and the airport is secure.\u201d Southwest Airlines flights temporarily operated out of Concourse C, though the airport later Saturday morning that \u201call concourses are open.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no threat to the public at this time,\u201d the airport said, \u201cand the airport is returning to normal operations.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "29.985931;-90.257712", "description": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana -- A man armed with a machete and wasp spray stormed through a security area at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Friday night before being shot, authorities said.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "0b712ce3c768feea09b44013120c6553"}, "og": {"site_name": "whotv.com", "description": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana \u2014 A man armed with a machete and wasp spray stormed through a security area at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Friday night before being shot, auth\u2026", "title": "TSA Officers Attacked with Machete and Wasp Spray at New Orleans Airport", "url": "http://whotv.com/2015/03/21/tsa-officers-attacked-with-machete-and-wasp-spray-at-new-orleans-airport/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/150320235539-new-orleans-airport-suspect-tablet-large.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/150320235539-new-orleans-airport-suspect-tablet-large.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@whohd", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@whohd"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324711668", "fb": {"pages": 383549560312}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://whotv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f35371452b04df2deef561dcee55bb01?s=16", "application-name": "whotv.com", "ICBM": "29.985931, -90.257712", "keywords": "news, crime, new orleans, tsa", "google-site-verification": "rL7fNdHSnN2PyMcNFC2GBk_LusisYfoPth6XdX-yZ2Y", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD", "published_time": "2015-03-21T13:19:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T13:19:34+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbda2\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s nothing to indicate that the incident posed any sort of national security threat, Normand said.\nNEW ORLEANS, Louisiana \u2014 A man armed with a machete and wasp spray stormed through a security area at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Friday night before being shot, authorities said.\nWhite soon pulled out a machete from his waistband and began wielding it at agents and others in the area.\nOne of the agents blocked the machete with a piece of luggage as White chased him through a security checkpoint metal detector.\nOne TSA agent was hit by a bullet fired by Slyve and was being treated for nonlife threatening injures, according to the TSA."}
