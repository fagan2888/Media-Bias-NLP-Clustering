MIDDLETOWN A Red Hill Road resident was working on his lawn mower when it partially severed one of his fingers, Middletown Police Detective Lt. Steven Dollinger said.

The man — who was not identified — was taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune by first aiders, Dollinger said. His condition was not immediately available.

Last year, an estimated 81,100 people were injured by lawn mowers in the United States, according to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.

To mow safely, mow across – not up and down – the face of a hill, keep children inside or away from the mower, and clear grass of objects like sticks, rocks and toys, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Always turn off a lawn mower before inspecting it for damage.
