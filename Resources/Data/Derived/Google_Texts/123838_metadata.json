It's not happening in Sochi this year.\n\nBut the organizers at the Waukesha JanBoree aren't so prejudiced. \"Pickleball, The next Olympic Sport?\" is being presented at 12:30 p.m. Saturday at the Schuetze Recreation Center, 1120 E. Baxter St., Waukesha. Pickles aren't the pucks; it's a blend of tennis and pingpong, played on a badminton-size court, and anyone from 10 to 110 can supposedly learn to play.\n\nIt's just one of a series of events happening at the annual JanBoree, taking place Friday through Sunday about town. The opening ceremony at Lowell Park's Olympic Village, 2201 Michigan Ave., includes a live weather report by WTMJ-TV's John Malan, plus a toboggan run, curling and fireworks at 8 p.m.\n\nOther activities throughout the weekend include an ice-sculpting contest, ice bowling, an ice-fishing clinic and ComedySportz performances.
