The common belief in the entertainment industry has been that record sales are dead. But, Adele showed everyone that sales are alive and well if the public wants the product. The British singer, known for smash break-up hits like Rolling in the Deep and the Oscar-winning Skyfall theme song, took time off from the music scene because, as she explained, “life happened.” In the past week, Adele came blazing back with a red-hot new album 25 that has shattered records and had jaws dropping throughout the industry on both sides of the Atlantic. Here is a look at the impact Adele’s 25 had, judging by the numbers she has posted:

2: Adele had the best selling album in both 2011 and 2012 with 21. It is the only album to be the top-seller for two consecutive years. Considering that 25 is already the top selling album on 2015 and it is late in the year, odds are she will have the best-selling album of 2016 too. That would make two times she has topped the lists two years in a row.

It it still number one. The story is the same with the video too.
