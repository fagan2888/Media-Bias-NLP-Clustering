Although he acknowledged in August that the plan wouldn\u2019t actually work, he told The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent that he did not mean to take sides in the dispute.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly leader-like behavior, but perhaps he calculated that, politically, his best bet was to stay quiet.\n\nTurns out he bet wrong. The Senate Conservatives Fund, a Tea Party affiliated group, has launched a $340,000 ad campaign against Mr. McConnell that characterizes him as a weak leader. Of course from the Tea Party perspective, leadership doesn\u2019t involve speaking out against an ill-conceived scheme that\u2019s bound to fail\u2014it means backing that scheme.\n\n\n\n\u201cObamacare starts in October but Congress can stop its funding,\u201d the ad states. \u201cWhat\u2019s Mitch McConnell doing? Nothing. McConnell is the Senate Republican leader, but he refuses to lead on defunding Obamacare. What good is a leader like that?\u201d\n\nThe ad, which is airing in Mr. McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky starting today through Sept. 17, makes no mention of the fact that \u201cdefunding Obamacare\u201d would involve opposing any continuing resolution that funds the law\u2014i.e. shutting down the entire government. Perhaps that\u2019s because the Senate Conservatives Fund realizes that this niggling detail would put off moderate viewers.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130906123754, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "McConnell, Mitch", "keywords": "McConnell Mitch,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Attacking Mitch McConnell From the Right ( 20130906 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Juliet Lapidos", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Juliet Lapidos", "byl": "Juliet Lapidos", "twitter": {"description": "The Senator\u2019s attempt to stay out of the government shutdown fight is making the Tea Party angry.", "creator": "@julietlapidos", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/attacking-mitch-mcconnell-from-the-right/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "title": "Attacking Mitch McConnell From the Right", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002425397, "description": "The Senator\u2019s attempt to stay out of the government shutdown fight is making the Tea Party angry.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 6, 2013", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1378485474, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-09-07T16:05:43-04:00"}, "utime": 20130907160543, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130906, "pdate": 20130906, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "The Senator\u2019s attempt to stay out of the government shutdown fight is making the Tea Party angry.", "title": "Attacking Mitch McConnell From the Right", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/attacking-mitch-mcconnell-from-the-right/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/attacking-mitch-mcconnell-from-the-right/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Attacking Mitch McConnell From the Right", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 6, 2013"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd816a\"", "article_summary": "The Senate Conservatives Fund, a Tea Party affiliated group, has launched a $340,000 ad campaign against Mr. McConnell that characterizes him as a weak leader.\nMcConnell is the Senate Republican leader, but he refuses to lead on defunding Obamacare.\nOf course from the Tea Party perspective, leadership doesn\u2019t involve speaking out against an ill-conceived scheme that\u2019s bound to fail\u2014it means backing that scheme.\nErik Schelzig/Associated PressSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has done his best to stay neutral in the intra-Republican war over whether to shut down the government in order to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Mitch McConnell doing?"}
