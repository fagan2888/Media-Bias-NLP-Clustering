SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Oregon hospitals say they won’t reduce their spending on services that benefit the community, even though they’re seeing far fewer uninsured patients.

An Oregon hospital industry group said Tuesday its members will provide free care to anyone who earns less than double federal poverty level and is not on Medicaid. The group also said that total spending on so-called “community benefit” services will remain at historical levels.

Community benefit programs included services such as charity care, research, health screenings and medical education.

Hospitals are seeing a big drop in their spending on charity care since the federal health care overhaul gave insurance to hundreds of thousands of people who didn’t previously have it.
