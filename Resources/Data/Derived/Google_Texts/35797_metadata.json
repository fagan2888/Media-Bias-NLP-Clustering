I am committed to fighting for the issues important to our community including for more funding for our schools. I will be introducing a bill to reform the Local Composite Index in the next session of the House of Delegates.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponent(s) and why should voters choose you?\n\nI have the experience, commitment and the ability to work in a bipartisan way to achieve consensus. I have lived here and raised kids here. I know the issues, the values, and the priorities of this community. I have worked for them for nearly 25 years. I know the legislative process and will work hard to achieve positive and productive change for our community.\n\nGiven the political makeup of the state legislature, what examples from your own experience suggests you can successfully bridge the intense partisan differences there?\n\nI have successfully worked across party lines and my legislative record demonstrates that. This past session I cosponsored, and voted for, important legislation introduced by Republicans and Democrats and didn\u2019t let partisanship get in the way of doing what was right for our district.\n\nIn order, list your top 5 specific legislative priorities.\n\nReforming the funding formulas for our schools Fighting for Northern Virginia\u2019s fair share of transportation funding Ensuring we are business friendly and help small business have access to capital Protecting our children and families from gun violence Promoting renewable energy and other innovative technologies\n\nHow has your district changed in the last 10 years? What caused those changes?\n\nThe population of Northern Virginia has increased significantly over the last 10 years. New residents are drawn, to our district specifically, by our quality of life and excellent school system. The extension of the Silver Line and the growth of the Tysons Corner business community are also contributing factors. Simply, the 34th is a great place to live and we need to work to ensure we provide the quality services are growing community deserves.\n\nWill you support legislation restricting high interest lending including car title loans?\n\nYes. With more than 460 car-title loan operations in Virginia and interest rates reaching as high as 300%, this abusive high-interest lending must be addressed.\n\nWill you support funding for Fostering Connections which would result in an influx of federal funding for foster children aging out of foster care?\n\nYes. I am very supportive of measures that protect and support our most vulnerable children who are aging out of foster care. Virginia has already made great strides in educational stability for children in foster care but there is more work to be done.\n\nDo you support expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and if so, what would you do to make that happen?\n\nYes. I support Medicaid expansion because it is morally right and fiscally responsible. I will vote for expansion and I will continue to advocate for it in Richmond and in the 34th district.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2015/oct/26/house-delegates-district-34-kathleen-murphy-d/", "type": "article", "title": "House of Delegates-District 34: Kathleen Murphy (D)"}, "description": "A candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates Q&A", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc08c\"", "article_summary": "Will you support funding for Fostering Connections which would result in an influx of federal funding for foster children aging out of foster care?\nVirginia has already made great strides in educational stability for children in foster care but there is more work to be done.\nI am very supportive of measures that protect and support our most vulnerable children who are aging out of foster care.\nI will be introducing a bill to reform the Local Composite Index in the next session of the House of Delegates.\nI am committed to fighting for the issues important to our community including for more funding for our schools."}
