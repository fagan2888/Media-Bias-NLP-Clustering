PICTURE: Justin Sanson\n\nTWO years after the Tracy Aged Care home was shut for commercial reasons, leaving dozens of elderly residents in the lurch, plans to redevelop the Darwin CBD site have been revealed.\n\nA development application has now been lodged to convert the existing buildings into a 55-room motel.\n\nThe site, at the intersection of Woods and McLachlan streets, will operate as a motel for a maximum of five years.\n\n\u201cThe proposal allows the positive reuse of the existing buildings with minimal capital outlay, with benefits in avoiding any proliferation of vacant buildings,\u201d according to the planning report submitted to the Development Consent Authority.\n\n\u201cThe proposal intends a limitation on the time frame of the permit, with the proposed use allowing a return on \u00adinvestment until such time as the land is redeveloped.\u201d\n\nThe two-floor motel will consist of 42 ensuite rooms and 13 rooms with shared bathroom facilities.\n\nIt also makes allowances for a caretaker\u2019s residence and a convenience store and cafe.\n\nThe cafe would include an alfresco dining space with an awning reaching out over the Woods Rd reserve.\n\nThe Tracy Aged Care facility was put on the market by then-owner the Uniting Church in 2014, leaving its 30 clients in aged care looking for new homes.\n\nFederal money, which was intended to help put a dent in the Territory\u2019s extensive waiting list for aged care places, was controversially redirected to refurbish the church\u2019s Terrace Gardens home in Palmerston, allowing it to take on the \u00addisplaced Tracy Aged Care \u00adresidents.\n\nBy filling Terrace Gardens with Tracy Aged Care residents instead of new clients, the Uniting Church was free to act on the prime Woods St real estate.\n\nThe proposed motel will \u00adinclude a swimming pool and a circular drop-off area, as well as a 32-bay carpark.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "TWO \u2009years after the Tracy Aged Care home was shut for commercial reasons, leaving dozens of elderly residents in the lurch, plans to redevelop the Darwin CBD site have been revealed.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.ntnews.com.au/realestate/tracy-aged-care-centre-to-get-new-lease-on-life-as-motel-in-darwin-cbd/news-story/dd8dbb33987b7f5f669e1ab3771dca45", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b3a83d0619fa6b4206e08d538bb164e9", "type": "article", "description": "TWO \u2009years after the Tracy Aged Care home was shut for commercial reasons, leaving dozens of elderly residents in the lurch, plans to redevelop the Darwin CBD site have been revealed.", "title": "Bid to turn ex-aged care centre into motel"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheNTNews", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b3a83d0619fa6b4206e08d538bb164e9", "description": "TWO \u2009years after the Tracy Aged Care home was shut for commercial reasons, leaving dozens of elderly residents in the lurch, plans to redevelop the Darwin CBD site have been revealed.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bid to turn ex-aged care centre into motel"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/dd8dbb33987b7f5f669e1ab3771dca45?domain=ntnews.com.au"}, "articleid": "dd8dbb33987b7f5f669e1ab3771dca45", "keywords": "Nt News, development application, commercial reasons, aged care places, shared bathroom facilities, minimal capital outlay, real estate, ensuite rooms, convenience store, extensive waiting, alfresco dining, time frame, vacant buildings, Federal money, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-21T01:42:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T06:53:31.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Tracy Aged Care facility was put on the market by then-owner the Uniting Church in 2014, leaving its 30 clients in aged care looking for new homes.\nA development application has been lodged to convert the former Tracy Aged Care home into a 55-room motel.\nPICTURE: Justin SansonTWO years after the Tracy Aged Care home was shut for commercial reasons, leaving dozens of elderly residents in the lurch, plans to redevelop the Darwin CBD site have been revealed.\nFederal money, which was intended to help put a dent in the Territory\u2019s extensive waiting list for aged care places, was controversially redirected to refurbish the church\u2019s Terrace Gardens home in Palmerston, allowing it to take on the \u00addisplaced Tracy Aged Care \u00adresidents.\nBy filling Terrace Gardens with Tracy Aged Care residents instead of new clients, the Uniting Church was free to act on the prime Woods St real estate."}
