On IMDB, he is credited, hilariously, as \u201cPunk Leader.\u201d As Paxton recently told IGN, his long film career includes the distinction of having been offed, in character, by the titular boogeyman in three very memorable sci-fi flicks: \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d \u201cAliens\u201d and \u201cPredator 2.\u201d If only Kelly Lebrock had whacked him altogether in \u201cWeird Science\u201d instead of \u2026 well, this:\n\nTonight, the \u201cBig Love\u201d star returns to television for a recurring role on ABC\u2019s laboriously titled \u201cMarvel: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d He will play John Garrett, a former senior officer of bristly Agent Grant Ward (Brett Dalton). Garrett also has a history with Clark Gregg\u2019s Agent Coulson. As the geniuses at Marvel and ABC undoubtedly anticipated, upon learning the character\u2019s name, I immediately went to the Marvel Wiki to see what I could dig up.\n\nAs expected, Garrett is a bit player pulled and resourced from Marvel\u2019s vast comic book universe. His first appearance was in something called \u201cElektra: Assassin #2.\u201d I\u2019ll leave it to the true comic geeks to plunder their archives for that edition. Here, however, are some eyebrow-raising factoids about Garrett easily plucked from Marvel\u2019s online Wiki:\n\nDespite a history of repeated criminal offenses which included assault, battery, grand larceny, and four counts of statutory rape. John ended up becoming an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. with his past records clandestinely expunged.\n\nPaxton has, in the past, played quite a few creeps with potential, but never one so \u2026 criminally accomplished. I\u2019m betting that the family-style \u201cMarvel: Agents\u201d airing on the Disney-owned ABC shies away from the seedier footnotes in Agent John Garrett\u2019s past \u2013 especially since his file includes details much more germane to the over-arching story of the show.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paxton will play John Garrett, who may have some clues about Agent Coulson's resurrection VIDEO", "title": "Bill Paxton comes to \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D\u201d: A blast from Coulson\u2019s past", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Paxton will play John Garrett, who may have some clues about Agent Coulson's resurrection VIDEO", "title": "Bill Paxton comes to \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D\u201d: A blast from Coulson\u2019s past", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/04/bill_paxton_comes_to_agents_of_s_h_i_e_l_d_a_blast_from_coulsons_past/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bill_paxton_shield.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paxton will play John Garrett, who may have some clues about Agent Coulson's resurrection VIDEO", "title": "Bill Paxton comes to \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D\u201d: A blast from Coulson\u2019s past", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bill_paxton_shield.jpg", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neil Drumming", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Agents of SHIELD, Aliens, almost human, bill paxton, cyborgs, Marvel, Predator, sci-fi, terminator, TV, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Paxton has, in the past, played quite a few creeps with potential, but never one so \u2026 criminally accomplished.\nTopics: Agents of SHIELD, Aliens, almost human, bill paxton, cyborgs, Marvel, Predator, sci-fi, terminator, TV, Video, Entertainment NewsI was just watching \u201cThe Terminator\u201d for the umpteenth time this weekend and was surprised to see Bill Paxton in a tiny part at the beginning of the film.\nI\u2019m betting that the family-style \u201cMarvel: Agents\u201d airing on the Disney-owned ABC shies away from the seedier footnotes in Agent John Garrett\u2019s past \u2013 especially since his file includes details much more germane to the over-arching story of the show.\nJohn ended up becoming an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\nAs expected, Garrett is a bit player pulled and resourced from Marvel\u2019s vast comic book universe."}
