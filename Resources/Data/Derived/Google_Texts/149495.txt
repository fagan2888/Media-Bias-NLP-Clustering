To the Editor:

“Why Do Doctors Commit Suicide?,” by Pranay Sinha (Op-Ed, Sept. 5), poignantly examined the private afflictions that physicians face. Even this early in my medical career, I had a close colleague fall victim to suicide, a loss that deeply affected our medical community.

I recently spoke with an attending physician about the culture of stoicism among doctors and how it affects our profession’s ability to seek necessary treatment. She remarked that those who seek help face more than social stigma.

Any form a physician fills out for further training, professional licensing or hospital privileges invariably includes some variation of the question, “Have you ever been treated for a psychiatric disorder?”

An open discussion of the vulnerabilities that put physicians at risk is a start at reversing the myth of the invincible physician. But until the professional consequences of seeking psychiatric treatment are lifted, physicians will often choose to forgo seeking help and face the devastating consequences.
