What does it take to support a family when your work is cleaning offices in Baltimore?

In the world of commercial janitorial services – where it’s nearly impossible to find full-time work and benefits – it takes holding down multiple jobs.

So says Frances Smith, a Baltimore native, grandmother and part-time office cleaner who got by for 17 years as an office cleaner and even sent her grandson to Catholic school.

“It was difficult to me, yes, and I was just raising one grandson. Imagine if a person has two or three children, you know, and they’re raising them – of course they would have to go out and get another job,” Smith said. “This is still not enough to raise a family on. We’re part time here. . . We only work four hours a night.”

Smith spoke during a video interview with The Brew as negotiations begin on behalf of 10,500 commercial office cleaners in the Baltimore-Washington area (among them 700 from Baltimore).

With the current contract set to expire at midnight on October 15, the focus of negotiations is getting workers more full-time hours so that they will qualify for full health-care benefits under the Affordable Care Act, according to the union bargaining on their behalf, 32BJ SEIU (Service Employees International Union).

In Baltimore, part-time cleaners earn $12.70 and full-time cleaners earn 13.20, according to Julie Karant, an organizer with 32BJ.

Smith said she works 20 hours a week and does not receive full employer-paid healthcare.

Currently part-time cleaners have dental, vision, prescription deductibles and life insurance, but not full employer-paid health care, Karant said. Many cleaners work other part-time or full-time jobs to get by.

“The Washington region’s multi-billion dollar real estate industry can afford to allow hard-working cleaners the opportunity to earn full-time wages and affordable health care,” said Jaimie Contreras, 32BJ Vice President and Capital Area Director.

“We must ensure that these men and women don’t have to work multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet.”

Approximately 90% of the employees represented are Latino and the other 10% are African-American, according to SEIU.

“A strong contract will improve many things for working families and create better opportunities for our children,” said Oscar Vasquez, a Washington, D.C. cleaner.

The custodians work for companies including Red Coats, American Building Maintenance, Metropolitan Maintenance Building Services and USSI, Karant said. The companies arrange for custodians to clean about 40 buildings downtown.
