Bloomberg News\n\nA large fire at Asos PLC\u2019s main warehouse over the weekend canceled in whole or in part nearly one in three of the online fashion retailer\u2019s pending orders, Chairman Brian McBride said Tuesday.\n\nThe fire broke out late Friday at the distribution center in Barnsley, in northern England, where Asos said it held around 70% of its \u00a3159 million ($270 million) in inventory. The fire destroyed around 20% of inventory on site, or about \u00a322 million in products, based on figures from the end of May.\n\nSpeaking to The Wall Street Journal, McBride said the company was able to recover most orders despite the fire, which damaged property in four stories of the warehouse and is being investigated by police. McBride said the police suspected arson.\n\nThe fire is the latest setback for the publicly traded company, a dominant U.K.\u2019s online fashion retailer that targets men and women in their 20s. Despite rapid growth, the company\u2019s stock this year was hit twice when the company issued two profit warnings.\n\nAsos stock initially dipped Monday morning but quickly recovered, ending the day up about 2%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a much better place than we thought we\u2019d be on Friday night,\u201d McBride told the Journal. \u201cAlthough we\u2019re a digital business, it shows you that you still need some physical things like backup, and recovery plans, and business continuity.\u201d\n\nThe company has other distribution centers in the U.S. and China. More than 60% of the company\u2019s sales are overseas. In the quarter that ended May 31, the company notched up revenue of \u00a3243 million.\n\nA company spokesman later said that 7,060 orders were initially canceled or only partially delivered, out of about 26,000 pending orders.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, at an event sponsored by the London Business School, McBride said the company heard sympathy from customers and was also able to see how the fire affected them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cProm dresses, for instance, a number of people had that caught up. So, you can actually feel the pain.\u201d\n\nMcBride said the company was able to quickly communicate with customers about their orders and issued a strong statement to the stock market Monday morning that the company had a plan to recover.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The fire is the latest setback for the publicly traded company, a dominant U.K.'s online fashion retailer that targets men and women in their 20s.
