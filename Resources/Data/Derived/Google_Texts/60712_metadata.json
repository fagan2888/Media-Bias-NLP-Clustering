Pat Roberts has stood against amnesty for illegal immigrants throughout his career and fought with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) to defund Obamacare.\n\nRoberts, who may have survived his GOP primary against Milton Wolf because there was absolutely no daylight between him and his opponent on amnesty for illegal immigrants, is in a dog fight with Greg Orman, an \u201cindependent\u201d candidate whose on amnesty and abortion align more with Democrats, after the Democrat was able to get his name off of the ballot. Palin asked voters not to be fooled by Orman in a race Republicans must win to retain control of the Senate.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI know independence,\u201d Palin said, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cSupporting Barack Obama, supporting Obamacare, supporting amnesty, supporting Harry Reid? That\u2019s not independent. That\u2019s someone who\u2019s trying to schnooker ya, Kansas.\u201d\n\nPalin, who has the most influence and some of the highest favorability ratings among conservative and Tea Party voters, campaigned to help Roberts shore up his right flank, calling for unity to help Republicans take back the Senate and get rid of Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) as Majority Leader.\n\nRoberts also stood with Sens. Cruz and Lee during the defund debate, and Palin, according to NBC News, told the crowd that Roberts was \u201cone of the few senators fulfilling campaign promises, doing what the American people asked him to do, standing there on the floor with Sen. Ted Cruz to do what they could to get rid of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nAs the Kansas City Star noted, Orman, a financier, \u201csupports a path to citizenship\u201d for the country\u2019s illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cIf you are here undocumented, you should register, pay a fine, obey our laws, hold down a job and pay taxes, and then I think you should be able to stay here,\u201d Orman said at a Kansas State Fair debate earlier this month, according to the Star.\n\nRoberts, on the other hand, voted against Ronald Reagan\u2019s infamous Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 when Roberts was a House Member. Roberts also voted against comprehensive immigration reform in 2007 that President George W. Bush tried to pass along with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA). And he also voted against the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d comprehensive amnesty bill last year that the Congressional Budget Office determined would lower the wages of American workers.\n\nPalin, who has always urged Republicans to stand up for the \u201cforgotten man,\u201d has been one of the foremost opponents of illegal immigration. She even called for Obama\u2019s impeachment due to his lawlessness on illegal immigration, which Palin said detrimentally impacts Americans \u2014 native-born and legal immigrants \u2014 of all backgrounds.\n\nPalin has blasted the \u201cwealthy bipartisan elite, who want cheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u201cborder security\u201d money can buy in their own exclusive communities,\u201d for not caring about the concerns of American workers when it comes to illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cHave faith that average American workers \u2013 native-born and wonderful legal immigrants of all races, backgrounds, and political parties \u2013 do care because we\u2019re the ones getting screwed as we\u2019re forced to follow all our government\u2019s rules while others are not required to do so,\u201d she wrote in a Breitbart News op-ed. \u201cMany now feel like strangers in their own land. It\u2019s the American worker who is forced to deal with Obama\u2019s latest crisis with our hard-earned tax dollars while middle class wages decrease, sustainable jobs get more scarce, and communities become unrecognizable and bankrupted due to Obama\u2019s flood of illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nPalin also served pancakes with Roberts to the packed crowd, and she reminded Kansans that \u201ca lot of the country\u2019s eyes are on you\u2026 making sure that you make the right decision.\u201d Palin was wearing a Kansas State sweatshirt and Roberts referenced Kansas State\u2019s heartbreaking loss 20-14 loss to Auburn at home when Kansas State missed three crucial field goals last Thursday, two of which should have been gimmes like Roberts\u2019 general election race was supposed to be on paper. Roberts asked the crowd of Palin, \u201cHave you ever seen a mama grizzly dressed as a wildcat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen a mama grizzly dressed as a wildcat?\u201d Roberts asked the crowd of Palin, who was wearing a purple Kansas State sweatshirt for the occasion. \u201cYou won\u2019t stay and kick the field goal, will ya?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s Palin told a cheering crowd.
