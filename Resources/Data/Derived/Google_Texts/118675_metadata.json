It demeans their children, and it denies the \u2014 both the couples and their children the stabilizing structure that marriage affords.\u2019 (\u2018Dignity\u2019 is Kennedy\u2019s favorite word, and it\u2019s funny to listen to lawyers pander to him by throwing it in at every opportunity.)\u201d\n\nActivist Lane Hudson was less impressed with Verrilli. He took a \u201creserved position,\u201d Hudson told The Advocate via email. It seemed that Justices Alito, Roberts, and Scalia \u201cwere vocally trying to show their opposition or poke holes in the government\u2019s position,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cIt felt, honestly, like [Verrilli] wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d\n\nOf course, the outcome of the case doesn\u2019t depend entirely on Verrilli. Attorneys Mary Bonauto and Douglas Hallward-Driemeier also argued for marriage equality. And Verrilli\u2019s performance before the high court has been criticized before, notably in defending President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act in 2012 against an attempt to strike it down. The court upheld the health reform law, a decision that The New York Times called a vindication of Verrilli as well as the legislation.\n\nThe Obama administration defended Verrilli then, and, as might be expected, praised the work he did this week. \u201cThe president is very proud of the way in which the solicitor general presented the viewpoint of the federal government, and we continue to be very confident in the strength of the legal arguments that he presented,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at Wednesday\u2019s briefing. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to, at this point, prejudge the outcome of the decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon Verrilli made a very cogent and persuasive argument about what he believes and what the federal government believes should be the outcome here,\u201d Earnest continued. \u201cAnd at this point, I\u2019m not going to try to distill the arguments that he was making in this setting. I\u2019ll just say that we feel very confident in the strength of the legal argument that he made, but we\u2019ll let the Supreme Court decide as they should.\u201d\n\nIf the decision is pro-equality, Stern wrote, \u201cwe\u2019ll have a long roster of advocates to thank. Verrilli should be at the top of the list.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some commentators are praising Donald Verrilli's performance as the Obama administration's rep at the high court, but there are those who found him too low-key.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2015/05/01/Donald-VerrilliX400.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T22:28:15-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "U.S. Solicitor General: Marriage Equality's Hero at the Supreme Court?"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-01T20:16:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T20:16:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3752\"", "article_summary": "Solicitor General: Marriage Equality's Hero at the Supreme Court?\nSolicitor General Donald Verrilli is getting mixed reviews for his arguments on behalf of marriage equality before the Supreme Court Tuesday, with some observers saying he\u2019ll emerge as the hero of the day, and others contending he delivered a weak performance.\nAttorneys Mary Bonauto and Douglas Hallward-Driemeier also argued for marriage equality.\n\u201cBut he forged ahead anyway \u2014 and what he said over the next 15 minutes masterfully established the burning importance and obvious correctness of marriage equality.\u201dThe solicitor general \u201csimply nailed it,\u201d Stern continued.\n\u201cShouts of \u2018abomination\u2019 and \u2018hell\u2019 echoed into the courtroom as Verrilli began to speak,\u201d Stern wrote."}
