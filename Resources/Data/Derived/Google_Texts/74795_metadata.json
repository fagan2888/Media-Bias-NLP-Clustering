We are growing \u2014 the Nashville metropolitan area is expected to add more than a half million new residents in the next 20 years, bringing more cars and more traffic.\n\nPlanning for this requires a bold approach \u2014 not just to manage traffic congestion, but to maintain the quality of life of our neighborhoods and to keep Nashville\u2019s economy percolating.\n\nAddressing our transportation issues to keep us moving and ensure a better quality of life won\u2019t be easy. It requires both local and regional approaches on a complex set of issues involving many stakeholders.\n\nThe next mayor will need to lead the charge.\n\nLocally, we can start with improvements to our MTA system: technology upgrades, such as real-time tracking of buses and an electronic fare system, to expanded routes that help riders move around the county without having to first go downtown.\n\nWe have to cut costs and reduce transit times for working families who rely most heavily on public transportation.\n\nAnother major opportunity lies within and around our major pikes and corridors. My goal is to reimagine our pikes as \u201ccomplete streets,\u201d which means improving roads while also making them safer for pedestrians, cyclists, bus users and even drivers.\n\nTo see the concept of a \u201ccomplete street,\u201d imagine, for example, Nolensville Pike, but with the power lines buried below new sidewalks, which are placed next to protected bike lanes, and with dedicated high-capacity transit lanes with optimized traffic signals that reduce congestion. That\u2019s a complete street.\n\nDeveloping complete streets creates good-paying jobs for local residents during construction.\n\nOnce in place, studies show, they encourage small business growth and mixed-use residential development in the areas best equipped to handle density.\n\nAn obstacle to building more complete streets is the silo orientation of Metro departments that currently deal with pieces of transit.\n\nThough effective at their individual missions, departments don\u2019t talk to each other enough. Lines of communication get crossed and the actions of one department sometimes counteract the needs of another.\n\nAs mayor, I will sharpen our focus on transit by creating an Office of Transportation responsible for coordinating the city departments that deal with transit and for working with local, regional, state and federal agencies to streamline the processes for investing in all modes of transportation.\n\nBy doing a better job coordinating these departments and functions, we can more efficiently address Nashville\u2019s current transit problems and develop competitive funding proposals for future projects.\n\nNashville\u2019s transportation challenges are not confined to Davidson County and cannot be solved as if they were.\n\nHalf of Middle Tennesseans work in a county other than the one in which they live. It is therefore crucial that we work to develop a forward-thinking regional transportation strategy.\n\nInitiatives such as NashvilleNext and MTA\u2019s strategic plan \u201cnMotion\u201d are opening doors to the development of a thriving transit system for both city and region.\n\nAs mayor, I will be enthusiastic about seeing these important efforts through.\n\nI also look forward to working with leaders across Middle Tennessee through the Mayors\u2019 Caucus to plan the area\u2019s transportation future and to secure state and federal resources to work toward that future.\n\nMy approach to transportation is rooted in my firm belief that a city that thrives has to be a city that moves.\n\nTo keep Nashville moving, this means everything from roads to sidewalks to buses to bike lanes to rail \u2014 it\u2019s all on the table.\n\nA world-class transportation system is essential to a vibrant city.\n\nThe investments we make in transit will bring enduring returns for our health, our economy and our quality of life.\n\nMegan Barry is an at-large member of the Metro Council and a candidate for mayor.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1HwCY6D", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sharpen focus on transit by creating Office of Transportation to coordinate departments.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Sharpen focus on transit by creating Office of Transportation to coordinate departments.", "title": "Nashville should have world-class transportation system", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/05/27/world-class-transportation/28023757/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sharpen focus on transit by creating Office of Transportation to coordinate departments.", "title": "Nashville should have world-class transportation system", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06d20fd7b20554edfa60f379fca372c8c2c4f608/c=144-0-1856-1712&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Nashville/B9317500472Z.1_20150527150451_000_GRRATF6RV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c8d6c168ea8e66a3f200e5473ef18977f11aee99/c=358-0-1642-1712/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Nashville/B9317500472Z.1_20150527150451_000_GRRATF6RV.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/859b55d8196bbe93ddef3b7cdd43581e768c2956/c=144-0-1856-1712/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Nashville/B9317500472Z.1_20150527150451_000_GRRATF6RV.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b7cb150f84f783d82fa825cfe26e620e3bf7a0d/c=0-106-2000-1606/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Nashville/B9317500472Z.1_20150527150451_000_GRRATF6RV.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/acd4095a06265462b85e19d00fcf0366c1e3c5ee/c=0-294-2000-1419&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Nashville/B9317500472Z.1_20150527150451_000_GRRATF6RV.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-05-27T14:04:51-05:00", "shorthed": "Nashville transit system must improve", "articleid": 28023757, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6432b50e3ca4fc7129ee15cb89ba2f6407e82c20/c=0-294-2000-1419/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Nashville/B9317500472Z.1_20150527150451_000_GRRATF6RV.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b989372cc9409931e37e83d6db05f4a8572b6c84/c=518-0-1481-1712/local/-/media/2015/05/27/Nashville/B9317500472Z.1_20150527150451_000_GRRATF6RV.1-0.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "data", "title": "Nashville should have world-class transportation system", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Megan Barry"}, "news_keywords": "transportation, transit, nashville, mayor, mayoral, complete streets, bus"}, "article_summary": "A world-class transportation system is essential to a vibrant city.\nInitiatives such as NashvilleNext and MTA\u2019s strategic plan \u201cnMotion\u201d are opening doors to the development of a thriving transit system for both city and region.\nMegan Barry (Photo: Submitted) Story Highlights Sharpen focus on transit by creating Office of Transportation to coordinate departments.\nCreate \u2018complete streets\u2019 to make roads safer for bikers, pedestrians, bus riders and drivers.\nDeveloping complete streets creates good-paying jobs for local residents during construction."}
