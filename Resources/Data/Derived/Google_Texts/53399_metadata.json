Elizabeth Warren and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio joined its chief economist Joseph Stiglitz at its press conference.\n\n\u201cThe American economy no longer works for most Americans\u2026 What is causing this dysfunction?\u201d the report opens, then answering that question and making dozens of specific law and policy changes, listed below.\n\n\u201cSome point to technological change or globalization,\u201d it said. \u201cSome posit that government has shackled the free enterprise system and hobbled business. Some say that our economy is simply rewarding the risk takers and job creators who have earned the riches coming their way\u2026 None of these arguments gets it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cSkyrocketing incomes for the 1 percent and stagnating wages for everyone else are not independent phenomena, but rather two symptoms of an impaired economy that rewards gaming the system more than it does hard work and investment,\u201d it states. \u201cThe roots of this dysfunction lie deep in the rules and power dynamics that have prioritized corporate power and short-term gains at the expense of long-term innovation and growth. The outcomes shaped by these rules and power dynamics do not make the economy stronger; indeed, many make it weaker.\u201d\n\nWhat follows are 37 specific laws and policy changes to restore fairness and balance to the economy without undermining American capitalism.\n\nFix The Financial Sector\n\n1. End \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d by imposing additional capital surcharges on systemically risky financial institutions and breaking up firms that cannot produce credible living wills.\n\n2. Better regulate the shadow banking sector.\n\n3. Bring greater transparency to all financial markets by requiring all alternative asset managers to publicly disclose holdings, returns, and fee structures.\n\n4. Reduce credit and debit card fees through improved regulation of card providers and enhanced competition.\n\n5. Enforce existing rules with stricter penalties for companies and corporate officials that break the law.\n\n6. Reform Federal Reserve governance to reduce conflicts of interest and institute more open and accountable elections.\n\nIncentivize Long-Term Business Growth\n\n7. Restructure CEO pay by closing the performance-pay tax loophole and increasing transparency on the size of compensation packages relative to performance and median worker pay and on the dilution as a result of grants of stock options.\n\n8. Enact a financial transaction tax to reduce short-term trading and encourage more productive long-term investment.\n\n9. Empower long-term stakeholders through the tax code, the use of so-called \u201cloyalty shares,\u201d and greater accountability for managers of retirement funds.\n\nMake Markets Competitive\n\n10. Restore balance to intellectual property rights to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joseph Stiglitz, Elizabeth Warren and the Roosevelt Institute weigh in on the defining issue of the 2016 elections", "title": "37 ways to un-rig the U.S. economy so it no longer favors the rich", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Joseph Stiglitz, Elizabeth Warren and the Roosevelt Institute weigh in on the defining issue of the 2016 elections", "title": "37 ways to un-rig the U.S. economy so it no longer favors the rich", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/37_ways_to_un_rig_the_u_s_economy_so_it_doesnt_favor_the_rich_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/joseph_stiglitz_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joseph Stiglitz, Elizabeth Warren and the Roosevelt Institute weigh in on the defining issue of the 2016 elections", "title": "37 ways to un-rig the U.S. economy so it no longer favors the rich", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/joseph_stiglitz_rect.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Elizabeth Warren, Income inequality, Joseph Stiglitz, Roosevelt Institute", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe American economy no longer works for most Americans\u2026 What is causing this dysfunction?\u201d the report opens, then answering that question and making dozens of specific law and policy changes, listed below.\nEmpower long-term stakeholders through the tax code, the use of so-called \u201cloyalty shares,\u201d and greater accountability for managers of retirement funds.\nEnact a financial transaction tax to reduce short-term trading and encourage more productive long-term investment.\nBring greater transparency to all financial markets by requiring all alternative asset managers to publicly disclose holdings, returns, and fee structures.\nReform Federal Reserve governance to reduce conflicts of interest and institute more open and accountable elections."}
