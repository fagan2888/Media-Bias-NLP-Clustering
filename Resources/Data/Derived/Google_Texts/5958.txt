High water left quite a surprise for a Keota woman Monday.

Jennifer Dodd said she had stepped outside to let her dogs out of the house on Kerr Lake when she saw her neighbor and started talking about how high the water was.

"I had told him that the pond across the street was gone because Kerr Lake had taken it over. He then said, 'Well, did you see the barge on the other side of your house?'"

Dodd shared a photo of the wayward barge on the News On 6 Facebook page. She said her fiance has lived in the area his entire life and in 50 years has never seen the lake so high.

Dodd said a crew came and got the barge at about 12:30 Monday afternoon.

Kerr Lake is part of the Kerr-McClellan Navigation System that links the Tulsa Port of Catoosa with the Mississippi River. So far there's been no indication what the barge may have been carrying or to which company it belongs.
