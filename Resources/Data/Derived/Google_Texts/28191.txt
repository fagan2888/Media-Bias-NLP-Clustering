Newly minted Republican Senator Joni Ernst introduced legislation late yesterday to defund Planned Parenthood after a series of undercover videos by the Center for Medical Progress revealed the abortion giant selling baby parts and haggling over prices. (In case you missed the videos, Cortney has you covered here). The legislation is co-sponsored by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul and five other Republicans.

"A bill to prohibit Federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America," the legislation states. "IN GENERAL.â€”Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds may be made available to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, or to any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or clinics."



The legislation is set for a vote early next week ahead of the August recess.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fast-tracked the legislation Tuesday night using Rule 14 of Senate procedure, setting up a procedural cloture vote to move the bill to the floor as early as Monday. That all but assures the bill will get a final vote before Senators depart for August recess.

Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion supporters are scrambling to defend themselves after the undercover sting. The pro-abortion political outfit EMILY's List sent a frantic fundraising email early this morning warning about the legislation.

Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million per year in taxpayer funding. The organization receives enough money from donations every year to survive without it.
