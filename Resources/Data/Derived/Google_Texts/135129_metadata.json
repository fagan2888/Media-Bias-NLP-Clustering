First of all, let me set your mind at ease, O Entertainment Consumer: Yes, this is a 50-year-old French film with subtitles, but I promise you it isn\u2019t some talky, black-and-white odyssey into the soul. The cultural fatwa against all-that-is-not-fun is not violated here. This globetrotting farce-thriller from 1964 is driven by an escalating series of delightful stunts, most of them personally performed by Gallic superstar Jean-Paul Belmondo. In fact, this movie and the entire career of director Philippe de Broca belong to an entirely different trajectory of French cinema from the New Wave legacy of Godard, Truffaut, Jean-Pierre Melville and so on. If Belmondo is best known to the film-studies crowd on this side of the Atlantic for his classic bad-guy roles in \u201cBreathless,\u201d \u201cLe Doulos\u201d and \u201cPierrot le Fou,\u201d he was almost certainly more famous in France for playing swashbuckling heroes in movies like this one.\n\nThere are moments in \u201cThat Man From Rio,\u201d including an almost surrealistic chase scene shot against the nightmare-modernist construction site of Brasilia, Brazil\u2019s newly invented capital city, where de Broca seems to channel the spirit of modernist anomie found in, say, the contemporaneous films of Michelangelo Antonioni. I think that\u2019s pure accident, a case of inhaling the Zeitgeist without meaning to, but it\u2019s also true that there\u2019s so much bizarre social subtext in \u201cThat Man From Rio\u201d that you can\u2019t tell where intention ends and coincidence begins. I suppose this is a spoiler \u2013 can I spoil a movie made 50 years ago? \u2013 but at the very end of the story an apparent intervention by supernatural forces turns out to be something else entirely: Bulldozers felling the rain forest, to make way for a superhighway. (This was at least two decades before Amazonian deforestation became an important environmental cause.)\n\nThis is a high-spirited action-adventure \u2013 at times oppressively high-spirited, if you want the truth \u2013 that begins in Paris, where ne\u2019er-do-well French soldier Adrien Dufourquet (Belmondo) is taking a week\u2019s leave to see his girlfriend. Adrien represents the other side of the Belmondo persona from his tough-guy roles, a French stereotype that would soon disappear into cultural irrelevance: He\u2019s an unsophisticated country boy, masculine and cheerful, who may not be all that bright but is an unstoppable force once he gets going. Somewhat implausibly, his girlfriend is an upper-crust Parisian beauty named Agn\u00e8s (Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac), whose archaeologist father has been killed as part of some complicated mystery that is never entirely explained (because it doesn\u2019t make sense).\n\nNext a band of mysterious burglars steals a priceless statue from the museum run by her dad\u2019s old colleague, Prof. Catalan (the terrific character actor Jean Servais), who is then himself kidnapped. After that the thugs drug Agn\u00e8s and spirit her away as well, apparently because she knows where Dad buried another, identical statue on the grounds of the Rio estate where they once lived. That\u2019s quite enough for Adrien, who pursues her through Paris on a stolen motorbike and then buffaloes his way onto a Rio-bound flight at Orly Airport without a ticket or a passport. (It isn\u2019t all that plausible anyway, but yes, those were more innocent days in air travel.) If you haven\u2019t heard of Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac, by the way, she\u2019s another one of the odd historical ingredients in this movie. Not too many people have \u2013 Dorl\u00e9ac was a rising star in French film who died three years later in a car accident, at age 25. You\u2019ve heard of her younger sister, though, who went on to some success under the adopted name Catherine Deneuve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Madcap farce or cultural imperialism?
