So, this was really a fulfillment of what his vision was I think for his life from a very young age.\"\n\nNow 32 years old, and the youngest pastor in the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee, Bishop Gregory Parkes says the move assures the future of the parish is in good hands.\n\n\"I think that's just an expression of my confidence in him to be a good priest, to be a holy priest, to be a passionate priest about the gospel, to preach the gospel at all times, and to help others come closer to Jesus Christ,\" Parkes said.\n\nAccording to Nixon, he'll hope to provide energy to sustain his passion, while spreading the word of God.\n\n\"One thing that people might say is that I have a lot of enthusiasm,\" Nixon said. \"I definitely bring joy and enthusiasm to what I do, because I love what I do. If I had 100 lives to live, I would choose to be a priest every single time because it's an amazing life.\"\n\nNixon has served at St. Dominic for about two years.\n\nHe follows Father Pete Zalewski who served as pastor at the church for about 15 years, before being re-assigned to Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Tallahassee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds turned out Sunday to witness the beginning of a new era at Saint Dominic Catholic Church with the installation of its new pastor.", "language": "english", "author": "Zak Dahlheimer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/New-Era-Begins-for-St-Dominic-in-Panama-City--321196611.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_03231.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Hundreds turned out Sunday to witness the beginning of a new era at Saint Dominic Catholic Church with the installation of its new pastor.", "title": "New Era Begins for St. Dominic in Panama City"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds turned out Sunday to witness the beginning of a new era at Saint Dominic Catholic Church with the installation of its new pastor.", "title": "New Era Begins for St. Dominic in Panama City", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/New-Era-Begins-for-St-Dominic-in-Panama-City--321196611.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_03231.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "New Era Begins for St. Dominic in Panama City", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "New Era Begins for St"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17f6\"", "article_summary": "Nixon has served at St. Dominic for about two years.\nA journey beginning while a student at Florida State University, and that's taken him all throughout the state of Florida.\nHe follows Father Pete Zalewski who served as pastor at the church for about 15 years, before being re-assigned to Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Tallahassee.\nSo, this was really a fulfillment of what his vision was I think for his life from a very young age.\"\n\"From a young age, actually five years old or so, Mike seemed to have a calling to the priesthood,\" Jean said."}
