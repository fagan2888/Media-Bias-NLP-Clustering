If media outlets are going to make a big deal out of former Gov. Mike Huckabee’s (R-Ark.) remarks about women, then they should give equal time to comedian Sarah Silverman’s vaginal napkin stunt, according to Red Alert Politics editor Francesca Chambers.

Francesca appeared on Fox’s Huckabee on Saturday, along with two other Millennial panelists, Kayleigh McEnany and Shaaya Ellis. Huckabee asked the young people to weigh in on his comments about Democrats trying to make women dependent on the government — comments that sparked a media firestorm. Francesca argued that the media shouldn’t play favorites.

“When Sarah Silverman gets up and does a live telethon for abortion — she gets up there and she raffles off a vagina napkin, it barely makes a blip in the national media,” Francesca said. “But you get up there and say the word ‘libido’ and all of a sudden, it’s a national story. So I’m continually frustrated by the hypocrisy of the media.”

When it comes to income inequality, Francesca argued on behalf of education reforms, such as school choice and making colleges more affordable. She also pushed for transparency measures that would allow students to know more about their degrees before they choose them.

“If you’re going to go to a university, you should be able to see how many other people in that field got jobs, the percentages — how many in that field overall and how many people at your university were able to get jobs,” she said.
