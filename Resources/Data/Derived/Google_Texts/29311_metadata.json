The only difference going forward is that we\u2019ll be able to put up signs.\"\n\nMcColeman is facing a second challenge from 2011 runner-up Marc Laferriere for the NDP, as well as Liberal newcomer Danielle Takacs. The Green Party\u2019s Kevin Brandt and Libertarian party\u2019s Rob Ferguson are also in the race and have experience from last year\u2019s Brantford municipal election.\n\nPutting up lawn signs was first on the agenda for Takacs. Her team drove out to the home of former Ontario Liberal leader Robert Nixon on the eastern border of the riding within hours of the start of the campaign on Sunday.\n\nNixon, who is also former Brant MP Jane Stewart\u2019s father, asked for the first Takacs lawn sign following the formal start of the election.\n\n\u201cI was so excited when the request (from Nixon) came through,\u201d Takacs said. \u201cI thought it was a very creative way to connect the old and the new. To have his support is inspiring and keeps me motivated on the target.\"\n\nTakacs said they were poised and ready for the start of the early campaign. Her team planned to have a load of signs out over the weekend.\n\nShe said the official start didn\u2019t signify any big shift in what her team has been doing.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Takacs said. \u201cThat\u2019s how our campaign sees it. Everybody knew this was coming and knew it was coming early.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already been busy getting my name out there and talking to people.\"\n\nTakacs said she has been working hard to connect with the electorate as a first-time candidate.\n\n\u201cI have been proving to people that I have the skills to fight for them and I am ready to be the next MP,\u201d she said.\n\nTakacs has worked inside the Liberal party \u2013 federally and provincially \u2013 since she was inspired by former Brant MP Jane Stewart to join the Young Liberals club.\n\nThose years of work with the party have helped her make many Liberal connections.\n\nShe has brought in six Liberal MPs \u2013 Scott Simms, Adam Vaughan, Carolyn Bennett, Frank Valeriote, John McCallum and John McKay \u2013 for visits to Brantford-Brant since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cIt was a really great feeling to bring somebody like Adam Vaughan \u2013 who you know has a say in the Liberal platform \u2013 and have them walk away and say the visit to Brantford was worthwhile (for policy development),\u201d Takacs said. \u201cIt is exciting for me to then come back and show (the platform) and how we contributed to it in Brantford.\"\n\nFormer prime minister Paul Martin is next to visit. He and Takacs will meet with representatives from Six Nations and the Mississaugas of the New Credit on Aug. 21.\n\nThe local NDP campaign has been busy for a while now. They were the first to open a local campaign office in April.\n\nThe team took the Civic Holiday weekend off, knowing that the campaign would likely be launched.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked all our local volunteers to take Sunday and Monday off to be with their families and enjoy summer,\u201d Laferriere said in a statement on his website. \"Family should always come first.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Laferriere took the Conservatives to task, calling the extended election wasteful and unfair.\n\n\"It would give them a chance to outspend the other political parties under new rules brought in by the Conservatives \u2018unfair' elections act,\u201d Laferriere said. \"Welcome to big money in local politics.\"\n\nThe longer election period means political parties can spend closer to $50 million on the campaign. The usual five-week campaign caps spending at closer to $25 million.\n\nLaferriere said a longer election also means additional taxpayer costs to fund Elections Canada offices and staff for twice as long as usual.\n\n\u201c(It is) the longest election period since 1872, when candidates and leaders had to travel by train or horse and buggy to campaign,\u201d Laferriere said. \"In the information age we all live in now, 78 days is just too long, too expensive and completely unnecessary.\"\n\nMcColeman said the longer election period should have some benefits.\n\n\u201cThis provides for a much greater opportunity for more Canadians to participate in the political process,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people tend to just sit out the short election periods. But this allows for an extended opportunity to jump in and get involved.\"\n\nMcColeman, who was first elected in 2008, said one of the main issues for the campaign locally will be about continuing to provide for the needs of the communities.\n\n\u201cThat is what continues to be expressed to me throughout my years as MP,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure the needs of the city, county and two First Nations are a high priority.\n\n\u201cA lot of that recently has been for the federal government to recognize and participate in the shared expense of infrastructure and shared expense of programming.\u201d\n\nTakacs said she has been hearing at the doors that Brantford-Brant voters want a representative that will fight for them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting a lot of comparisons to Jane Stewart, which is really special for me,\u201d Takacs said. \u201cShe is the one who inspired me to get involved.\"\n\nTakacs singles out farming and agriculture, affordable hosting and building positive relationships with natives as three issues that she expects to resonate in Brantford-Brant.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "Brantford-Brant candidates prepared for 11-week marathon campaign", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
