From 2006 to 2008, women\u2019s rights were front and center when South Dakota sought to outlaw abortion. Cecelia Fire Thunder, the first woman tribal president in Pine Ridge, moved to establish a women\u2019s clinic on the reservation, and it have included the right to choose.\n\nFire Thunder was ultimately impeached for her unyielding position that all women deserve to make their own decisions about their personal choices. The film covers her impeachment and the effect it had on the 21-year-old Clifford twins. Their friend Brandon Ferguson, a young father, begins the film as a journalist covering the impeachment, but clearly is at odds with his feelings about abortion and friendships are tested. The impeachment had a direct affect on the lives of all three, who begin to question traditions that are brought to the fore.\n\nIn a panel discussion following a community screening event in Rapid City, South Dakota, panelists Fire Thunder, Oglala, Sunny Clifford, Oglala, Marion Lipschutz and Rose Rosenblatt, who co-directed and produced the film and are both from New York City, discussed the importance of the film.\n\n\u201cI stood by what my belief is,\u201d Fire Thunder said about her impeachment. \u201cLakota women, way before Columbus came, made choices about our lives. In our teachings, women are sacred, that is our Lakota way. I have the gift of thought, the gift of spirit, the gift of heart and all I have to do is make choices for myself.\u201d\n\nFire Thunder engaged the audience bringing many laughs and nods of agreement, saying, \u201cWhen we allow people in power, in government, to tell us what we do, it is wrong. No man has a right to tell me as a woman what is right for me.\u201d\n\nThroughout the film, Sunny is at the center of the action. She speaks of the challenges of avoiding pregnancy and having a healthy relationship. Sunny said this film is her encouragement to all young girls who might see it. She hopes the film will \u201cbe a film for younger girls to realize they can have control over their lives and their future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lipschutz and Rosenblatt, the two filmmakers, legislation quite similar to the proposed bans of 2006 are now resurfacing across the country, making the film all the more relevant today.\n\nLipshutz laughed when someone from the audience asked them how two white ladies from New York City came to make a film about South Dakota. \u201cWe have made a lot of films on reproductive rights and justice,\u201d Lipshutz said. \u201cWe did one in Texas and New Hampshire,\u201d which covered different aspects of the topic. \u201cAnd that brought us to South Dakota.\u201d\n\nRosenblatt said they had heard about Fire Thunder, \u201cand we followed the pack.\u201d\n\nFire Thunder noted the state bill outlawing abortion was defeated because women of all walks of life, from all races and backgrounds, came together. \u201cLeadership is the willingness to take on the tough stuff. No matter what they say and do to you, you have to stay in the battle.\u201d\n\nFire Thunder said the film is not just about educating girls, but boys and men, too. \u201cNever forget the message when we talk about reproductive justice. Young men are part of the equation, too. How do we engage boys, young men, and grown men about respecting women? That when a woman says no they mean no?\u201d\n\nAimed at mobilizing groups and individuals, the filmmakers hope to inspire support for reproductive health and justice policies, and that \u201cYoung Lakota\u201d builds leadership and coalitions between Native groups, youth-serving organizations, and the reproductive rights and justice movement.\n\nAn announcement for the film notes that Young Lakota is making a timely arrival during this year\u2019s 40th Anniversary of Roe v.
