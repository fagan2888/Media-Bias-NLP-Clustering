Last week, Khloe Kardashian raised hackles in Indian country when photos of her wearing a feather headdress hit the internet. She had donned the normally-sacred headwear because she thought it was appropriate for the Coachella-derived theme of "Kidchella"—a party thrown at sister Kourtney's house to celebrate the first birthday of North West, daughter of sister Kim and hip hop star Kanye West.

In the wake of the controversy, a Twitter user from Indian country contacted Khloe over Twitter, and the reality TV celebrity responded. Here's the exchange:

Lisa Votino-Tarrant @lmvotino : @khloekardashian mM husband & daughter are Shinnecock. We would love to show you the Shinnecock Museum so you can learn about our history.

Khloe @khloekardashian : @lmvotino thanku 4being 1of the ONLY people who care enough 2educate rather than threaten/attack. Ur culter is beautiful &I would love2learn

Lisa Votino-Tarrant @lmvotino : @khloekardashian Please reach out, my husband is the Asst. Curator there and he said any time that works for you :)

Will this prove to be a first step on the road to understanding—or another empty gesture from a celebrity? Time will tell. As of this writing, neither Khloe nor half-sister Kylie Jenner have removed the controversial photos from their Instagram pages.
