NEW YORK (MainStreet) — It’s a fair bet that if you work for a sizable company, there is a workplace “wellness program” offered to employees. As part of that benefit you may earn a discount on a gym membership, have access to a weight loss or smoking cessation program or other informational and healthy lifestyle resources. Nearly two-thirds of smaller companies (199 workers or less) and a vast majority (94%) of companies with 200 or more workers offer such programs, according to The Kaiser Family Foundation.

It’s certainly a worthwhile effort – up to a point. But then there are the health “risk assessments.” So-called “health fairs” or “biometric screenings” can pry into personal medical histories – and may be illegal.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has filed lawsuits against two companies this year, claiming some medical exams and non job-related lifestyle inquiries violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

One company required employees to participate in medical exams and health inquiries or face penalties. One worker who declined to submit to the exams was denied company-paid insurance benefits and forced to pay the entire premium for her employee health benefits. She was eventually even fired.

Another firm mandated employee participation in a similar medical testing and assessment program or face cancellation of health insurance, additional “disciplinary action,” as well as payment of a full premium in order to maintain coverage, according to the EEOC.
