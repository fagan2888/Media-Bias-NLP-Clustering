The only charge filed by a special prosecutor brought in for the case was a child endangerment misdemeanor charge for leaving the then-14-year-old on her front lawn in January of 2012 while she was drunk and unconscious. The accused, Matt Barnett, will plead guilty.\n\nColeman\u2019s story became a flash point for national frustration over how rape allegations are handled when it first came to light in October. Her alleged rapist was not only a popular football player, but also the grandson of a prominent Missouri state senator \u2014 something Coleman, her mother, and many advocates for rape victims thought may have led to the slow investigation that was ultimately dropped by local police the first time around. Police, and the original prosecutor in the case, said it was dropped because of a lack of evidence, and because Coleman and her mother stopped cooperating.\n\nAfter her story gained national attention thanks to an expose in the Kansas City Star, a new prosecutor was assigned to the case. Thursday, the public learned that prosecutor will not be pursuing a rape charge either. This does not mean that a rape never occurred. Rather, like the high-profile rape accusations against college quarterback Jameis Winston, it simply means the prosecutor could not find enough evidence to bring a rape charge.\n\n\u201cIn this case there was insufficient evidence to go forward on a sexual assault charge,\u201d the special prosecutor said in a press conference, saying that her team was unable to obtain a video of the incident that was rumored to be in circulation. \u201cWe don\u2019t always like the outcome but it is evidence-based and therefore it works.\u201d\n\nDaisy\u2019s mom told CBS that she was disappointed with the prosecutor\u2019s decision, but, \u201cConsidering all the evidence that had been lost, destroyed, tampered with or returned\u2026 There wasn\u2019t a lot she could do.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional essay published in October, Coleman spoke openly about becoming emotionally unstable after her case was dropped. \u201cSince this happened, I\u2019ve been in hospitals too many times to count. I\u2019ve found it impossible to love at times,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve gained and lost friends. I no longer dance or compete in pageants. I\u2019m different now, and I can\u2019t ever go back to the person I once was. That one night took it all away from me. I\u2019m nothing more than just human, but I also refuse to be a victim of cruelty any longer.\u201d\n\nDaisy Coleman attempted suicide on Tuesday. There is no confirmation that it had to do with the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to try Barnett for rape, though the prosecutor did say they have been in talks about a plea deal for about a month. Coleman put out a statement that the prosecutor read during the press conference. It said, \u201cI want to thank everyone who supported me and my family during these past two years\u2026 I am ready to move forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Matt Barnett will face one charge: Child endangerment, for leaving Daisy Coleman out in sub-zero temperatures when she was drunk and unconscious.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Matt Barnett will face one charge: Child endangerment, for leaving Daisy Coleman out in sub-zero temperatures when she was drunk and unconscious.", "title": "Prosecutor Will Not Bring Maryville Rape Allegations To Trial", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/09/3142331/prosecutor-pursue-maryville-rape-allegations/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/daisy_coleman_tpftd-e1382381594101.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Matt Barnett will face one charge: Child endangerment, for leaving Daisy Coleman out in sub-zero temperatures when she was drunk and unconscious.", "title": "Prosecutor Will Not Bring Maryville Rape Allegations To Trial", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/daisy_coleman_tpftd-e1382381594101-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@ARStrasser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/daisy_coleman_tpftd-e1382381594101.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/daisy_coleman_tpftd-e1382381594101.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-09T14:38:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98cd\"", "article_summary": "Health Prosecutor Will Not Bring Maryville Rape Allegations To Trial CREDIT:Melinda and Daisy Coleman give a CNN interview about the Maryville rape case CREDIT: CNNDaisy Coleman \u2014 the 16-year-old Maryville, MO, girl who accused a neighborhood football player of raping her and leaving her out in the snow exactly two years and one day ago \u2014 will not see her rape allegation go to court, a prosecutor assigned to the case indicated Thursday.\nRather, like the high-profile rape accusations against college quarterback Jameis Winston, it simply means the prosecutor could not find enough evidence to bring a rape charge.\nThursday, the public learned that prosecutor will not be pursuing a rape charge either.\nColeman\u2019s story became a flash point for national frustration over how rape allegations are handled when it first came to light in October.\nPolice, and the original prosecutor in the case, said it was dropped because of a lack of evidence, and because Coleman and her mother stopped cooperating."}
