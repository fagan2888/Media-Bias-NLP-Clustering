But the facts have to be told, to help explain the sickening sense that we\u2019re becoming a nation without a middle class, paralyzed by the inequality deniers and excuse makers who refuse to admit there\u2019s something wrong with their free-market capitalist system. The extremes are becoming almost intolerable.\n\n1. A Broken System of Compensation: The Combined Salaries of 350,000 Pre-School Teachers is Less Than That of Five Hedge Fund Managers\n\nPre-school teaching may be our nation\u2019s most important job. Numerous studies show that with pre-school, all children achieve more and earn more through adulthood, with the most disadvantaged benefiting the most.\n\nHedge fund managers, at the other extreme, are likely to bet on mortgages to fail or on food prices to rise.\n\nIt\u2019s a frightening commentary on our value system that the total income of over a third of a million pre-school teachers is less than the combined income of just five big-money speculators.\n\n2. Diminishing Support for Society: The 1% Made More from their Investments in 2013 than the Entire Cost of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Safety Net\n\nAmerica\u2019s wealth grew by almost $9 trillion in 2013. The richest 1% own 34 percent of the wealth (Table 6 here or Table 2 here), or about $3 trillion of the 2013 gain.\n\nThat is far more than the budget for Social Security ($860 billion), Medicare ($524 billion), Medicaid ($304 billion), and the entire safety net ($286 billion for SNAP, WIC [Women, Infants, Children], Child Nutrition, Earned Income Tax Credit, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Housing).\n\n3. Capital\u2019s Long-Term Dominance of Labor: Since 1900, a Dollar of Labor has Grown to $127, a Dollar of Stocks to $1,247\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason why the super-rich are cleaning up in the stock market. Thomas Piketty explains that, barring war or depression, the return on capital far outpaces economic growth, causing average workers without a stock portfolio to drop further and further behind. A look at stock market growth over 114 years (Page 60) confirms that a dollar of capital is now worth ten times more than a dollar of labor value.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thomas Piketty argues that the antidote is a global wealth tax, but it may not go far enough", "title": "5 ways massive inequality is paralyzing American society", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Thomas Piketty argues that the antidote is a global wealth tax, but it may not go far enough", "title": "5 ways massive inequality is paralyzing American society", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/5_ways_massive_inequality_is_paralyzing_american_society_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/thomas_piketty.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thomas Piketty argues that the antidote is a global wealth tax, but it may not go far enough", "title": "5 ways massive inequality is paralyzing American society", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/thomas_piketty.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Buchheit", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Global Wealth Tax, Income inequality, Thomas Piketty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3be\"", "article_summary": "Numerous studies show that with pre-school, all children achieve more and earn more through adulthood, with the most disadvantaged benefiting the most.\nHedge fund managers, at the other extreme, are likely to bet on mortgages to fail or on food prices to rise.\nA look at stock market growth over 114 years (Page 60) confirms that a dollar of capital is now worth ten times more than a dollar of labor value.\nTopics: AlterNet, Global Wealth Tax, Income inequality, Thomas Piketty, Business News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThe severing of our society into a plutocracy and a peasantry is so far along that statistics almost cease to have meaning.\nThe richest 1% own 34 percent of the wealth (Table 6 here or Table 2 here), or about $3 trillion of the 2013 gain."}
