For some, it could mean less of a refund coming back from the tax man.\n\nAnthony Lopez is one of more than 1 million Californians who are enrolled in Covered California.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with what I got so far,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nAfter guessing his income for this year, the college student and part-time caregiver shells out only $54 a month for a Silver Pro plan. The federal government picks up the rest of his premium in the form of tax credits.\n\nTax attorney Betty Williams says that credit could bring a crushing surprise when it comes to enrollees\u2019 tax refunds.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t be happy because suddenly they won\u2019t have that money coming to them,\u201d she said.\n\nRefunds for some may be affected, depending on how accurately they estimated their income.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out their income was higher than they anticipated and too much was paid, they essentially have to pay it back,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the way it\u2019s paid back is through whatever type of refund they might have.\u201d\n\nThat means if you told Covered California you were going to make one annual income, but really made more money, you may have to give some of your tax credits back.\n\n\u201cLikely to be most affected with this are people who changed jobs and perhaps got a higher-paying job and didn\u2019t make an adjustment,\u201d she said.\n\nOr people who simply made more than they thought, like Lopez. He ended up working more hours than he planned, but didn\u2019t think to report the change to Covered California.\n\n\u201cI do caregiving for two patients, and it just goes by the hour and our budget is based on California and their state budget,\u201d he said.\n\nCovered California spokesman Dana Howard says participants should be updating their income throughout the tax year if that income changes.\n\n\u201cCustomers and the consumers are advised when there is an income change during the course of the year to get in touch with the service center to notify us about that change,\u201d he said.\n\nLopez relies on his tax refund, and he\u2019s concerned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a student, so the tuition and my job\u2014I just always, I like to have the tax rebate,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California enrollees who underestimated their income when signing up for California\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act may be hit with sticker shock when tax season rolls around.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/01/06/health-care-sticker-shock-tax-refunds-could-be-taken-to-make-up-for-low-income-estimates/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/covered-california.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/covered-california.jpg?w=640", "height": 360}, "type": "article", "description": "Covered California enrollees who underestimated their income when signing up for California\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act may be hit with sticker shock when tax season rolls around.", "title": "Health Care Sticker Shock: Tax Refunds Could Be Taken To Make Up For Low Income Estimates"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/covered-california.jpg?w=640", "title": "Health Care Sticker Shock: Tax Refunds Could Be Taken To Make Up For Low Income Estimates", "site": "/social/", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Covered California enrollees who underestimated their income when signing up for California\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act may be hit with sticker shock when tax season rolls around."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Sacramento", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Sacramento", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "affordable care act, local, news, seen on, syndicated local, affordable care act, covered california, tax season, taxes", "article": {"publisher": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/", "author": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e592dab1a834e9f02fdb648f19487a6?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, covered california, tax season, taxes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc9f\"", "article_summary": "Covered California spokesman Dana Howard says participants should be updating their income throughout the tax year if that income changes.\nHe ended up working more hours than he planned, but didn\u2019t think to report the change to Covered California.\nAnthony Lopez is one of more than 1 million Californians who are enrolled in Covered California.\nTax attorney Betty Williams says that credit could bring a crushing surprise when it comes to enrollees\u2019 tax refunds.\nLopez relies on his tax refund, and he\u2019s concerned."}
