LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” stayed on top of the North American box office for the fourth week, beating out Leonardo DiCaprio in “The Revenant,” and becoming the third-largest grossing movie in the world ever.

According to studio estimates Sunday, the adventures of Rey, Finn and stalwarts from the previous “Star Wars” films raked in $41.6 million in the U.S. and Canada and $104.3 million overseas, led by a record-breaking opening in China.

In the U.S. and Canada, it is the biggest movie ever and the first to pass $800 million with $812 million so far.

Its global total now stands at $1.73 billion, according to The Walt Disney Co., passing “Jurassic World,” with $1.67 billion.
