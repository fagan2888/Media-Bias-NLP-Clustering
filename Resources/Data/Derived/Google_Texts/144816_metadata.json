This, as many of you have discovered, makes it hard to read the newspaper \u2014 with all those ears, tails and antlers in the way.\n\nSeriously, a Colorado Parks and Wildlife count estimates the state\u2019s mule deer population has dropped from some 614,000 in 2005 to 390,000 in the most recent survey. That\u2019s upwards of 200,000 missing deer.\n\nNow the good news: They\u2019re in my yard.\n\nThat was just a joke, of course. Obviously not all of the 200,000 missing deer are in my yard. Nope, several of them are on my front porch, having learned \u2014 and I\u2019m not kidding \u2014 to climb the six steps from the driveway to feast in the fall on pumpkins and during the summer on my wife\u2019s flower pots.\n\nAnyway, there has indeed been a rather drastic decline in the Colorado deer population, the wildlife biologists tell us, down some 36 percent from 2005 to 2013.\n\nThere are known factors for the decline, including predation by coyotes, mountain lions and bears. Another factor is the increase in vehicle traffic that results in collisions with the deer and also cuts off traditional feeding and migration routes.\n\nAnd, of course, many mule deer are handcuffed and beaten by the Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nTwo years ago, the CPW says, our mule deer herd numbered about 408,000. That\u2019s far below the population objective set by wildlife biologists of 525,000 to 575,000.\n\n\u201cUnlike previous times in history when mule deer populations have bounced back, we\u2019re in a time right now where mule deer populations are continuing to decline,\u201d the CPW\u2019s Jody Kennedy told The Associated Press.\n\nAnd CPW biologist Brad Weinmeister told Denver Post writer Scott Willoughby: \u201cThe last 10 to 20 years there has been a lot of growth in homes in the country with the new roads, driveways, dogs, horse pastures and traffic. It takes away habitat and puts stress on the animal.\u201d\n\nAn example of that kind of severe stress on deer occurred outside my home near the Air Force Academy two weeks ago when the ear-piercing, roaring sound of my riding lawnmower caused a buck resting in the middle of my backyard to almost get up. I actually mowed in a circle around the big guy, leaving him bedded in a 15-foot diameter of long and matted-down grass.\n\nLike me, many people across the state have noted a dramatic increase in the number of deer in our yards over the past 20 years. A month ago, as another example, in the early morning hours a doe gave birth to a fawn just 25 feet from my back door. (I love those spotted fawns. Especially with a baked potato and A1 Steak Sauce.)\n\nAs for the actual deer that now routinely climb our front steps, well, I\u2019ve resorted to stretching a length of rope at night between the railings to prevent them from eating our flowers. It seems to be working.\n\nOn a slightly less positive note, I forgot to tell my neighbor Russ about the rope and last Thursday night he tripped violently up the steps while returning some Tupperware. Doctors say he\u2019ll be OK. Although they added that the recovery time would have been lessened if I hadn\u2019t field-dressed him.\n\nContact Rich Tosches at richtosches@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tosches: Where are all the deer?
