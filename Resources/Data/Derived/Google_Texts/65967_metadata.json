JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images\n\n(Reuters Health) - Newly diagnosed and seriously ill patients who need spiritual support, but can\u2019t travel for it, can now get free counseling via Skype or by phone from chaplains working with ChaplainsOnHand.org, ChaplainCareforVeterans.org and CantBelieveIHaveCancer.org.\n\nThe three websites also offer resources to assess spiritual distress, aids in defining personal spirituality and guides to end of life decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen people are faced with a crisis, somewhere in their minds and in their hearts, they ask questions about why this is happening to them,\u201d said Rev. Eric Hall, President of the HealthCare Chaplaincy Network (HCCN), the New York-based nonprofit which launched the services in the past year. \u201cWe face our own frailty, and people want an answer and to be able to talk it out.\u201d\n\nThe initiative reflects a growing prevalence in tele-health, increased outpatient care delivery and shorter hospital stays, Hall says. He calls this service one step among many that the field of chaplaincy must take to keep up with current modes in providing care.\n\nResponse has reflected demand. CantBelieveIHaveCancer.org attracted 200,000 unique visitors in its first four months online. Chaplains of diverse affiliations across the country respond to requests for support within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cPeople are isolated and alone so much of the time, and spiritual care is something that has often been dismissed and ignored,\u201d said Rev. Amy Strano, HCCN\u2019s Director of Programs and Services. In the project\u2019s early months, loneliness has been most frequently cited as the factor driving requests for spiritual care. Guilt and questions about suffering have also been common.\n\n\u201cAfter patients are no longer in the hospital, many find themselves without the spiritual support they had while hospitalized,\u201d said Lisa Anderson-Shaw, the University of Illinois Hospital and Health System\u2019s Director of Clinical Ethics and a contributing author to Handbook for Rural Health Care Ethics: a Practical Guide for Professionals.\n\n\u201cMany rural areas may not have a church,\" she said. \"Or, the closest church may be many miles away, making homebound persons unable to find the spiritual care they wish to have. Privacy may also be a concern for patients and families who live in small, rural communities and wish to keep health information more private.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, one-fifth of the U.S. public now identifies as religiously unaffiliated. The HCCN maintains that this statistic supports the need for this service, as chaplains are trained to guide patients through existential questions about meaning, pain, isolation and relationships - either within or outside of theological frameworks.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, everyone belonged to a local congregation, and the pastor, the rabbi, or the imam came to the house,\u201d said Rev. George Handzo, HCCN\u2019s Director of Health Services, Research and Quality. \u201cThat day is gone. Our services are aimed at those that for whatever reason are thankfully not dying in hospitals. Who reaches out to them? You can\u2019t just send a chaplain up and down halls like we used to.\u201d\n\nChaplains in the halls of health institutions are increasingly rare. According to the Institute of Medicine, only two-thirds of U.S. hospitals have chaplains. However, the presence of chaplaincy services has been associated with lower rates of hospital mortality and higher rates of hospice enrollment.\n\n\u201cThis provides more people access and resources to end of life questions, faith questions and prayer,\u201d said Eric Price, spiritual care manager at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago, who is not affiliated with the tele-chaplaincy service. \u201cHowever, many hospitals may see this as a more valuable alternative than live face-to-face contact, because it is cheaper than a chaplain. At its best, it will offer another tool for the staff chaplain. At its worst, it may replace the profession.\u201d\n\nThe HCCN funded the initiative\u2019s roll out and is now seeking grant support and hospital partnerships for fiscal sustainability.\n\nStrano acknowledges the limits of tele-chaplaincy, describing it as a \u201cspiritual first-aid\u201d capable of connecting patients with local resources for further support. \u201cSomething is better than nothing,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "seriously, ill, patients, can, get, spiritual, counseling, skype", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Newly diagnosed and seriously ill patients who need spiritual support, but can\u2019t travel for it, can now get free counseling via Skype or by phone.", "title": "Seriously Ill Patients Can Benefit From Using Skype", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seriously-ill-patients-can-get-spiritual-counseling-skype-348022", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/16/skype.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newly diagnosed and seriously ill patients who need spiritual support, but can\u2019t travel for it, can now get free counseling via Skype or by phone.", "title": "Seriously Ill Patients Can Benefit From Using Skype", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seriously-ill-patients-can-get-spiritual-counseling-skype-348022", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/16/skype.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/16/skype.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-08-16T10:03:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-16T10:03:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Newly diagnosed and seriously ill patients who need spiritual support, but can\u2019t travel for it, can now get free counseling via Skype or by phone."}, "article_summary": "In the project\u2019s early months, loneliness has been most frequently cited as the factor driving requests for spiritual care.\nJONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images(Reuters Health) - Newly diagnosed and seriously ill patients who need spiritual support, but can\u2019t travel for it, can now get free counseling via Skype or by phone from chaplains working with ChaplainsOnHand.org, ChaplainCareforVeterans.org and CantBelieveIHaveCancer.org.\n\"Or, the closest church may be many miles away, making homebound persons unable to find the spiritual care they wish to have.\n\u201cPeople are isolated and alone so much of the time, and spiritual care is something that has often been dismissed and ignored,\u201d said Rev.\nStrano acknowledges the limits of tele-chaplaincy, describing it as a \u201cspiritual first-aid\u201d capable of connecting patients with local resources for further support."}
