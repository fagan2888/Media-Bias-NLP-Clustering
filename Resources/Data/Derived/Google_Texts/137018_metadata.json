He and his classmates made Carson the subject of Black History Month projects that celebrated Carson\u2019s rise from the same gritty Detroit streets where they lived to become one of the nation\u2019s leading neurosurgeons in the 1980s.\n\nAfrican-American churches have a complicated relationship with Carson. They took a special interest in him, supporting his autobiography \u201cGifted Hands\u201d and staging reenactments of his inspirational life story \u2013 contributing to his celebrity before he ever decided to enter the political arena.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, however, Carson, a Seventh Day Adventist, has alarmed many in the black church with his incendiary remarks about guns, Muslims, and another hero, President Barack Obama. To some of those who grew up in the church idolizing him, the Carson who has emerged in the presidential race is a far diminished figure.\n\nHis failure to capitalize on his longstanding relationship with African-American church leaders has potentially robbed Carson, who is sinking in national opinion polls, of a potential base of support in the runup to early nominating contests and, should he become the Republican nominee, the November 2016 election.\n\nRev. Delman Coates, a pastor in Clinton, Maryland, said African-American churches have always had a special connection to Carson, who has credited much of his professional success to his Christian faith.\n\nIn the past, Coates said he has used lessons from Carson\u2019s life in his own sermons. But now, Coates said, Carson\u2019s politics and some of his views have \u201ctainted some of that reputation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, polls show that Carson\u2019s political ascent largely has been fueled by the support of white evangelicals, not African-American churchgoers, who historically align with the Democratic Party. That has made Carson at times an estranged figure from the men and women who grew up idolizing him.\n\n\u201cI would not call him an African-American leader,\u201d said Coates, who was particularly bothered by Carson\u2019s suggestion that Muslims should be barred from seeking the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being an African-American voice and being a voice of African-Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cLORD, YOU BE THE NEUROSURGEON\u201d\n\nLong before he entered political life, Carson raised his profile by speaking at churches and telling his story. His address at a Miami church in 2011 was emblematic of his message.\n\nTalking about his success as one of the nation\u2019s foremost pediatric neurosurgeon, Carson sermonized, \u201cI realized it wasn\u2019t me after all. It was the Lord. That\u2019s when I said, \u2018Lord, you be the neurosurgeon, I\u2019ll be the hands.'\u201d\n\nFor Carson, trying to convince black pastors and their congregants that his values line up with theirs remains a significant challenge, even though African-American voters tend to have more conservative views on issues such as gay marriage and abortion than their white counterparts.\n\nIn theory, states such as South Carolina and Michigan, which have so-called \u201copen\u201d primaries, black voters could cross party lines and vote for Carson without having to register as Republicans, a potentially hidden wellspring of support if he can tap into it.\n\nArmstrong Williams, a top advisor to Carson, conceded that the candidate has, at times, alienated some African-Americans with his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThere are things that Dr. Carson has said in the past \u2013 equating Obamacare to slavery has not gone over well in that community,\u201d he said in an interview. But now \u201che\u2019s learned how to better communicate, better to speak the language and say it in a way that is not offensive.\u201d\n\nBlack churchgoers will be willing to listen to Carson because of their shared history, Williams said. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to give him a second chance and a third time.\u201d\n\nCarson held a press conference in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on Wednesday where he was endorsed by 20 national and local pastors, nearly half of whom were ministers of African-American churches.\n\nAt the press conference, Bishop Ron Thomas, a black pastor at Reconciliation Apostolic Ministries in Las Vegas, Nevada, said he was backing Carson out of worry \u201cthat our country is really losing touch with God.\u201d\n\nBut Thomas may be the exception. The more typical response to Carson\u2019s candidacy is that of Detroit\u2019s Jacqueline Galloway-Blake, who met Carson more than 20 years ago when he came to address her church in Inkster, Michigan.\n\n\u201cI was in awe of him,\u201d she said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t feel that way now. When he likened Obamacare to slavery, Galloway-Blake said she was horrified. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to hear him,\u201d she said.\n\nSTRUGGLE TO RECONCILE\n\nIn Detroit and elsewhere, prominent African-American church leaders struggle to reconcile Carson the legend with Carson the politician, whose verbal missteps on the campaign trail have been well documented.\n\nBishop Charles Ellis, who oversees the massive 4,000-seat Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, was quick to praise Carson\u2019s influence on a generation of African-American doctors\n\nimage: http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/icon1.png\n\n. The Sunday School at Greater Grace once staged a reenactment of Carson\u2019s life story.\n\nBut in his next breath, Ellis, a supporter of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, compared Carson to 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who was lampooned for some of her statements.\n\n\u201cI also can understand how you can be very intelligent and very knowledgeable in one area, and be totally ignorant in another arena or area of life,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cPolitics is not for everybody.\u201d\n\nRev. Anthony Evans, president of the Washington-based National Black Church Initiative, an African-American advocacy group, described Carson as having two personalities, that of the gentle physician and the second, a hyper-conservative political novice. He criticized Carson for being too passive on the issue of tensions between African-Americans and urban police departments.\n\nFor Carson\u2019s supporters in the African-American faith community, it\u2019s made for an uphill battle.\n\nRev. Altheresa Howard, a pastor of a church in Lancaster, South Carolina, has been trying to recruit other black ministers to back Carson, including several who attended Carson\u2019s press conference.\n\nStill, she added, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nSource: White House hopeful Carson struggles to connect with the black church | Reuters", "article_metadata": {"WT.cg_n": "Blogs - FaithWorld", "WT.ti": "White House hopeful Carson struggles to connect with the U.S. black church - FaithWorld", "SEARCH.AUTHOR": "Reuters Staff", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "When David Bullock, a minister at Greater St. Matthew Church in Detroit, watches Ben Carson center stage at Republican presidential debates, he shakes his head.", "title": "White House hopeful Carson struggles to connect with the U.S. black church", "url": "http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2015/12/08/white-house-hopeful-carson-struggles-to-connect-with-the-u-s-black-church/", "image": "http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld//files/2015/12/or_72_preacher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.ContentType": "Blog Post", "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Blogs", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/opinion/faithworld/article", "CREATION_DATE": "2015-12-08 2:29:45", "SEARCH.BLOG_NAME": "FaithWorld", "fb": {"app_id": 1446663712275737}, "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "White House hopeful Carson struggles to connect with the U.S. black church - FaithWorld", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Staff", "DCSext.rCountry": "US", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "FaithWorld", "WT.cg_s": "FaithWorld"}, "article_summary": "Still, she added, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201dSource: White House hopeful Carson struggles to connect with the black church | Reuters\nAs a presidential candidate, however, Carson, a Seventh Day Adventist, has alarmed many in the black church with his incendiary remarks about guns, Muslims, and another hero, President Barack Obama.\nThe Sunday School at Greater Grace once staged a reenactment of Carson\u2019s life story.\nIn the past, Coates said he has used lessons from Carson\u2019s life in his own sermons.\nSTRUGGLE TO RECONCILEIn Detroit and elsewhere, prominent African-American church leaders struggle to reconcile Carson the legend with Carson the politician, whose verbal missteps on the campaign trail have been well documented."}
