With each passing day, it becomes clearer that the names \u201cClinton\u201d and \u201cTrump\u201d will likely appear on the general election ballot in November.\n\nThe uniqueness of this potential presidential contest comes from the unpopularity of the two candidates.\n\nTrump\u2019s wave of controversial rhetoric has sparked protest at many of his rallies and outside of his luxury estate in New York City. Trump has characterized Mexicans as \u201crapists,\u201d proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and spoken lowly of respected people.\n\nThe billionaire is on record discrediting former Republican presidential nominee, John McCain. \u201cHe is not a war hero. He is a war hero because he was captured, I like people that weren\u2019t captured,\u201d said Trump. He has also called 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, a\u201dchoke-artist\u201d for losing the last election to current President Barack Obama.\n\nClinton has been the subject of skepticism for most of her time in the public spotlight. Hillary is the wife of former President Bill Clinton and the marriage has been one of controversy. Bill Clinton was impeached (he was acquitted and remained in office) after the Monica Lewinsky scandal. It was alleged by many that Hillary only remained with her husband for political power.\n\nDistrust of Clinton also stems from her role in the Benghazi attacks of September 11th, 2012 that killed four Americans during her tenure as U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nIn March 2015, reports were released that revealed Clinton used her personal email address to handle official government business in her time as Secretary. Americans affiliated with both parties suggested that she put National Security at risk. She is on record admitting that she used her personal email address purely out of \u201cconvenience\u201d and recognizes that \u201cit was a mistake.\u201d\n\nBoth Trump and Clinton have changed their positions on a multitude of topics. In a 1999 \u201cDateline\u201d interview, Trump proclaimed himself a \u201cliberal on health care,\u201d saying \u201cI like universal [health care].\u201d Throughout his campaign, he has repeatedly stated that he will get rid of the Affordable Care Act ( legislation that expanded health coverage) and \u201creplace it with something great.\u201d\n\nAs a U.S Senator in 2004, Clinton described marriage as \u201ca sacred bond between a man and a woman.\u201d Now, she is in support of same-sex marriage and even included an image of two males holding hands in her presidential candidacy announcement video.\n\nIn a 1999 \u201cMeet The Press\u201d discussion, Trump identified himself as pro-choice and now he is openly pro-life. Hillary has a history of supporting trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed into law by her husband on December 8th, 1993. Initially, Clinton showed support of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement but has since come out against it in debates with Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nIf these two candidates were too clash in the general election, each would have plenty of rhetoric to use against the other.\n\nThis potential match-up has another dynamic. Clinton and Trump know each other on a personal level. The former First Lady attended Trump\u2019s last wedding and Trump has donated money to Clinton in the past.\n\nA Clinton-Trump bout would be a movement versus a political dynasty. Trump\u2019s rhetoric is perceived as heroic by his supporters. Trump critics describe him as having a bad temperament while his supporters see him as \u201ctelling it like it is.\u201d The billionaire has unapologetically worn the mantle of the loudest and boldest candidate. He claims he is able to behave this way because his campaign is self-funded and therefore he does not have to compromise his beliefs. Trump recognizes that the Republican establishment is not fond of him, but claims he has the American people\u2019s support and that is why he is winning.\n\nMeanwhile, the Clinton organization is sophisticated and has allies among the Democratic establishment. Both Hillary and Bill Clinton have been involved in politics for decades. The perception is that Clinton knows the \u201cins and outs\u201d of Washington politics.\n\nWill our next president be the self-funded, resolute Donald Trump?\n\nOr will America elect the first woman president in the nation\u2019s history?\n\nTwo candidates with two public histories of success and controversy.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.peacetimesonline.com/election-2016/2016/04/14/clinton-trump-clash-of-the-unpopulars/", "site_name": "The Peace Times", "type": "article", "description": "If the two front-runners of both the Democratic and Republican parties win the nominations, America is on a collision course for one of the most polarizing presidential elections in this nation\u2019s history.
