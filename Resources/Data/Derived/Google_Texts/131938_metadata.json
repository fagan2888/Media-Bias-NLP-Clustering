And with election season 2015 beginning to gear up, you can bet that the dynamic, engaged population of elders at Woodland Pond at New Paltz will be following the candidates and issues with avid interest \u2014 and not just by reading newspapers or watching TV news. Woodland Pond\u2019s Political Affairs Committee (PAC) will see to that.\n\nAlmost from the very beginning of the continuing care retirement community, a group of politically aware and active seniors has been meeting regularly, organizing events to keep residents well-informed and making sure that they can get to the polls. \u201cWhen Woodland Pond first opened in 2009, we were talking about a committee,\u201d recalls the PAC\u2019s chair, Dorothy Jessup, who was a professor of sociology at SUNY New Paltz before her retirement. \u201cMax Finestone suggested we have a group to educate people about local politics\u2026. We were pretty small. Max and I did most of the planning, and the group came up with ideas.\u201d\n\nFinestone, who had been a Democratic Party district leader in the Town of Rochester and, according to Jessup, \u201chad lots of contacts\u201d among Ulster County politicos, died in 2011, although his widow, Annette Finestone, now in her 90s, remains an active member of the PAC. Other members deeply involved in the group\u2019s startup, including Mildred Huberman, Gerry Russo and Vivian Moskowitz, have since aged out, but, says Jessup, \u201cAs more people moved in, the committee expanded.\u201d\n\nBesides Jessup and Finestone, the core group currently includes former Village of New Paltz trustee Vici Danskin, Ann Gordon, Janet Kissinger, Ren\u00e9e Sachs, Virginia Cannon and Mary Lou Van Winkle. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot of women,\u201d Jessup observes. As this issue goes to press, they will be meeting to strategize ways to get Woodland Pond residents out to the upcoming New Paltz party caucuses.\n\nJessup notes that the preponderance of female members in the group is not just a matter of longer average lifespans; she says that men who join tend not to stay long. \u201cThe only time a man comes to a meeting, he comes with a complaint or an issue. Then he leaves when it gets resolved.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge for the group is the fact that membership has historically skewed to the progressive side of the political spectrum. From the outset, says Jessup, \u201cWe knew it had to be nonpartisan. We have a lot of people registered in third parties, fourth parties, even fifth parties!\u201d She recalls issue-oriented educational events like a screening of a documentary and subsequent discussion about climate change at which some \u201cmore conservative\u201d residents felt outnumbered and walked out. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get a group together and lead a discussion on something controversial,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very successful at keeping this community very welcoming and friendly.\u201d\n\nOne way of addressing this problem was to spin off a separate Current Events group, led by Carol Nectow, in which about 30 members meet biweekly. \u201cPeople take turns presenting topics,\u201d says Jessup. \u201cThey sit in a circle and pass around a microphone.\u201d\n\nWhen election time rolls around, the Political Affairs Committee invites candidates to come in person to Woodland Pond and present their platforms. At first they tried a League of Women Voters-style moderated debate format, but these events eventually reached an audience capacity crisis. The 2012 Democratic primary debate, when Joel Tyner challenged Julian Schreibman for nomination for the 19th Congressional District seat vacated by an ailing Maurice Hinchey, was \u201cthe peak of excitement here. People were clamoring to get in, and had to sign up in advance,\u201d recollects Jessup.\n\nSince residents were permitted to invite outside guests, inevitably some were unable to get into the auditorium for the debate on account of fire code restrictions. \u201cWe got picketed. People said it was unfair,\u201d says Jessup. \u201cSo for the Congressional election, we decided we\u2019d invite each candidate separately,\u201d and such events are no longer open to the general public.\n\nCandidates in local races are also invited by the committee to make presentations at Woodland Pond. \u201cAnybody running for supervisor, we have them speak\u2026. We always have a moderator \u2014 often someone from the Chamber of Commerce.\u201d The PAC meets beforehand to brainstorm a list of questions for the candidates: \u201cWhat do we want to know from these people?\u201d After the prepared questions, \u201cWe let the audience ask follow-up questions.\u201d\n\nInformation sessions on hot-button issues have also been organized by the group, since its early days when talk of consolidation of the town and village governments was much in the air. \u201cThe big thing that we did this year was the school bond issue. We had people from the superintendent\u2019s office come to speak.\u201d Efforts were also made to find spokespersons for the opposition to the New Paltz Central School District capital project, but organizers found themselves stymied by the fact that opponents didn\u2019t identify themselves by name on the anti-bond flyers being circulated. So the moderators played devil\u2019s advocate and \u201cposed their accusations to the speakers,\u201d Jessup explains.\n\nOther speakers are brought in by the PAC for lectures and presentations on a variety of subjects related to politics. In the group\u2019s first year, party leaders gave a talk on the process by which candidates are nominated. Former mayor Thomas Nyquist spoke about \u201cthe history of why we have a town and a village\u201d in New Paltz. Gerald Benjamin has lectured on New York State history. And Bob Griss, who works at a think tank in Washington, DC and is the son of Woodland Pond resident Doris Griss, gave a presentation explaining the Affordable Care Act, according to Jessup.\n\nBut practical matters related to keeping seniors engaged in the political process, even when they become mobility-impaired, are the PAC\u2019s top priority. At a recent workshop on how to apply to become a permanent absentee voter, a representative from the Ulster County Board of Elections assisted residents with completing the appropriate form correctly. Making sure that new Woodland Pond residents move their voter registration to their new address and arranging transportation to the polls or to campaign debates, political speeches and lectures at other venues are all high on the group\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to see firsthand how many passionate voters and advocates we have at Woodland Pond and what positive changes they have helped implement,\u201d says Michelle Gramoglia, executive director of Woodland Pond at New Paltz. \u201cOur residents and team members are encouraged by the Political Affairs group to educate themselves on what\u2019s happening in the political sphere and to make informed decisions when voting. I am really proud of this committee\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nCandidates for political office, listen up: You ignore these activist elders at your peril! They\u2019re informed, they\u2019re impassioned \u2014 and they vote.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "New Paltz, Gardiner, Highland, news, newspaper, village, town, gunks, mohonk, hudson valley, ulster publishing, ulster county, web, online", "og": {"site_name": "New Paltz Times", "description": "According to the US Census Bureau, voters aged 65 and older had a 72 percent turnout during the last presidential election: the highest percentage of any age group.
