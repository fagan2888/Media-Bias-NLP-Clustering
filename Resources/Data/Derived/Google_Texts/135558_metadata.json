Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\u201d\n\nMadison\u2019s argument was meant to alleviate the concerns among his many forceful state opponents, the Anti-Federalists. Madison believed the charter governing the new national government, as drawn up in Philadelphia, would prevent the government from devolving into despotism, forcing its will upon its creators, the states.\n\nGuns are not the problem; Obama\u2019s gun control is no solution\n\nGeorge Mason in his argument against the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, wrote:\n\n\u201cIf strong and extensive powers are vested in the Executive, and that Executive consists only of one person, the government will of course degenerate (for I will call it degeneracy) into monarchy.\u201d\n\nRobert Yates, taking the Anti-Federalist position in 1788, wrote:\n\n\u201cWhat is to limit the oppression of the general government? Where are the rights, which are declared to be incapable of violation? And what security have people against the wanton oppression of unprincipled governors. No constitutional redress is pointed out, and no express declaration is contained in it, to limit the boundaries of their rulers,\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s ratification was secured only after the Federalists promised that the first Congress would amend the document and draft a Bill of Rights to be ratified by the states.\n\nToday, the Bill of Rights doesn\u2019t matter all that much.\n\nDemocratic Senate leader Harry Reid submitted a constitutional amendment designed to water down the First Amendment in an effort to limit campaign financing, while granting Congress power to regulate speech.\n\nAnd a few days ago, President Obama appeared on national television, shed the tears of a clown, and announced his latest royal decree to further erode our \u201cinalienable\u201d Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\nAnd the high court has served to uphold the most draconian expression of despotism in modern American history: the U.S. government\u2019s confiscation of medicine, Obamacare, using the Democratic Party\u2019s opponent-targeting Gestapo \u2013 the IRS \u2013 to write its regulations and impose its provisions on a once free people.\n\nSo it\u2019s understandable that Liberty-loving Americans now believe the guarantees of the well-meaning James Madison, that the powers of his constitutional government are \u201cfew and defined,\u201d aren\u2019t worth a bucket of warm spit.\n\nBut in their laziness, they forget Madison\u2019s brilliant emergency provision in the Constitution\u2019s Article V, which states that if the\n\n\u201cLegislatures of two thirds of the several States\u201d call for a \u201cConvention for proposing Amendments,\u201d they \u201cshall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before the Texas Public Policy Foundation last Thursday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said,\n\n\u201cWhen measured by how far we have strayed from the Constitution we originally agreed to, the government\u2019s flagrant and repeated violations of the rule of law amount to a wholesale abdication of the Constitution\u2019s design,\u201d\n\nadding that\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s unilateral action on gun control \u201cthreatens Second Amendment rights, even though the entire point of the Bill of Rights was to protect Americans from invasions of their liberties.\u201d\n\nThat last sentence is worth unpacking.\n\nWhere does all sovereignty rest in Great Britain? Its Parliament.\n\nWhere does all sovereignty rest in America? \u201cWe the People.\u201d\n\nYou can find the beating heart of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d expressed in the fading parchment of our Declaration of Independence. It boldly states that the American people should \u201cassume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God entitle them.\u201d\n\nIt obliquely references another declaration that states, \u201cSince the creation of the world, God\u2019s invisible qualities \u2013 his eternal power and divine nature \u2013 have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse,\u201d says the New Testament book of Romans.\n\nThat is what Thomas Jefferson meant when he said,\n\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident [\u201cpeople are without excuse\u201d] that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights [\u201cGod\u2019s invisible qualities]; that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights exists to emphasize that America is founded on the sanctity of individual freedom against the arbitrary whims of a government representing the democratic mob.\n\nThese individual rights are \u201cinalienable,\u201d not transferable to a weeping, gun-grabbing Democratic president or subject to repudiation by prominent Democratic Senators determined to squelch free speech.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s crocodile tears\n\nIndividual liberty is, by its very nature, undemocratic. That is why the First Amendment, which sets the tone for the original 9 that follow, begins with the five most beautiful words in the English language \u2013 the godlike prohibition \u2013 \u201cCongress shall make no law.\u201d\n\nThe sovereignty of the individual is the essence of American exceptionalism.\n\nThis explains why President Obama became confused and disoriented when he attempted to define American exceptionalism, confusing it for big-government internationalism. \u201cI suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism,\u201d he said.\n\nIn support of Texas Gov. Abbott\u2019s call for an Article V constitutional convention of states, GOP presidential candidate and former Texas solicitor general, Senator Ted Cruz, said,\n\n\u201cThere are many more amendments we need, in part because the federal government and the courts have gotten so far away from the original text and the original understanding of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe constitutional changes suggested by Abbott are:\n\nProhibit Congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one State.\n\nRequire Congress to balance its budget.\n\nProhibit administrative agencies\u2014and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them\u2014from creating federal law.\n\nProhibit administrative agencies\u2014and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them\u2014from preempting state law.\n\nAllow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nRequire a seven-justice super-majority vote for U.S. Supreme Court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law.\n\nRestore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution.\n\nGive state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds.\n\nAllow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a federal law or regulation.\n\nIt\u2019s unreasonable to expect the three branches of our national government to relinquish all the power they have usurped for themselves.\n\nIt falls to the states, Washington\u2019s creators and masters, to reclaim the \u201cnumerous and indefinite\u201d powers granted them by their individual sovereigns \u2014 \u201cWe the People of the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "James Madison's Constitution guaranteed that American's \u201cinalienable rights\u201d are not transferable to a weeping, gun-grabbing Democratic president, or his senate", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Stephen Z.
