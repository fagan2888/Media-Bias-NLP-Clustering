Supreme Court\n\nNow, at the beginning of 2015 \u2014 three months after the court ordered the rules adopted \u2014 the Council on Affordable Housing is still deadlocked and has no plans yet to try to come to a consensus.\n\nIt has left members of the state\u2019s highest court, which is now poised to decide whether certain towns will still be protected from affordable housing lawsuits, expressing their frustration aloud.\n\n\u201cWhat more do we have to do?\u201d Justice Barry Albin asked one attorney involved in the case, during a lengthy hearing Tuesday in Trenton. Later, with another attorney before the bench, he asked: \u201cHow much longer do you want the poor people of the state wait until they get affordable housing?\u201d\n\nThe question has lingered over New Jersey since 1975, when the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark case known as the Mount Laurel decision that municipalities cannot shape their land-use laws to discriminate against the poor, and that developers had a right to build affordable housing.\n\nThe first and second rounds of housing regulations were in place by 1999. But since then, the third round has been stalled by legal action, an attempt by Governor Christie to disband the council and, now, an impasse on the final vote. The six-member council voted 3-3 in October.\n\nAll the while, municipalities have no clear direction with regard to their affordable housing obligations, potentially exposing the towns to lawsuits.\n\nThe council, commonly referred to as COAH, has not taken any action since its deadlock vote and has no plans to meet, said Geraldine Callahan, an attorney for the council.\n\nCallahan and six other lawyers in the case appeared before the Supreme Court to make their case for what the court should do next, including deciding whether municipalities should be protected from lawsuits, as afforded by the council\u2019s administrative process for municipalities in the affordable housing certification process. Roughly 300 of the state\u2019s 565 municipalities are in some stage of certification.\n\nIn a nearly four-hour hearing that was scheduled for two, attorneys spent much of their time focusing on the granular points of the administrative process.\n\nBecause the council has not acted on the court\u2019s order to issue the latest regulations, some argued that municipalities should no longer be protected from lawsuits alleging exclusionary zoning, commonly known as builder\u2019s remedy suits. Kevin Walsh, attorney for the Fair Share Housing Center, an advocacy group to end exclusionary housing, argued that the lawsuits should be moved into trial courts to decide on a case-by-case basis, \u201cso that they have to prove why there is a need for immunity\u201d from litigation.\n\nBut Jonathan Drill, who represents six towns, suggested municipalities at least get temporary immunity from lawsuits because they are going through the motions to be certified by the council.\n\n\u201cGive municipalities a soft landing, not a hard landing,\u201d he said.\n\nJeffrey Surenian, representing Atlantic Highlands in Monmouth County, argued that the court should order the council to reconvene and provide periodic reports to the court on how it intends to break its deadlock. Stripping immunity from municipalities trying to meet their affordable housing obligations, he argued, would then open them up to costly builder\u2019s remedy lawsuits.\n\n\u201cMunicipalities shouldn\u2019t be responsible for COAH\u2019s failure,\u201d Surenian said.\n\nJudge Mary Catherine Cuff, assigned temporarily to the Supreme Court, replied: \u201cIf COAH is not doing its job, what other choice do we have?\u201d\n\nEdward Buzak, a lawyer for the New Jersey League of Municipalities, laid out a five-point set of recommendations for the court, and he urged that the court \u201cshould not jettison\u201d the work of the council to this point.\n\nBuzak, speaking well after the lunch hour had passed and with justices seeming eager to wrap up, also noted that the council had approved a final round of regulations in 2004, but an appellate court later ruled that they did not comply with the Mount Laurel doctrine and the Fair Housing Act, the 1985 law requiring the council to adopt affordable housing regulations.\n\n\u201cCoulda shoulda woulda,\u201d Albin said. \u201cHere we are. Now we have to do something.\u201d\n\nEmail: racioppi@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "New Jersey's state Supreme Court is wrestling with how to make sure affordable housing gets built after a state agency failed to approve revised rules toward that end and comply with a court order.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "DUSTIN RACIOPPI", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/n-j-supreme-court-takes-up-affordable-housing-and-agency-s-noncompliance-1.1186857", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.1186858!/fileImage/httpImage/nj-supreme-court.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "New Jersey's state Supreme Court is wrestling with how to make sure affordable housing gets built after a state agency failed to approve revised rules toward that end and comply with a court order."}, "title": "Stalemate on affordable-housing rules frustrates N.J. justices", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "DUSTIN RACIOPPI", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Stalemate on affordable-housing rules frustrates N.J. justices"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc243\"", "article_summary": "Since 1999, the state Supreme Court has rejected petitions, issued orders and imposed deadlines in an effort to get the latest round of affordable housing rules put in place in New Jersey.\nAll the while, municipalities have no clear direction with regard to their affordable housing obligations, potentially exposing the towns to lawsuits.\nIt has left members of the state\u2019s highest court, which is now poised to decide whether certain towns will still be protected from affordable housing lawsuits, expressing their frustration aloud.\nStripping immunity from municipalities trying to meet their affordable housing obligations, he argued, would then open them up to costly builder\u2019s remedy lawsuits.\n\u201cWhat more do we have to do?\u201d Justice Barry Albin asked one attorney involved in the case, during a lengthy hearing Tuesday in Trenton."}
