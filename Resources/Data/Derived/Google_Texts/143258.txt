WASHINGTON -- Sen. David Vitter, R-La., continues to hammer away at what he considers lax enforcement of immigration laws by the Obama administration.

On Monday, Vitter said the administration isn't doing enough to block illegal immigrants from collecting subsidies for health insurance purchased via exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.

Last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 115,000 who signed up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act haven't offered proof of citizenship. That's down from 310,000 people on August 28.

The agency's officials said they would move to cut off benefits to those who haven't provided proof of citizenship by Sept. 30.

Vitter said the Obama administration is moving too slowly to ensure that people in the United States illegally don't get health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.

"The Obama Administration is bending over backwards to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants -- but won't protect hard working American citizens who are losing their health care coverage," Vitter said. "The Obama administration has been granting deadline extensions, making excuses, and turning a blind eye to falsified documents by illegal immigrants. Enough is enough, and they need to provide answers to why they think illegal immigrants should be eligible for Obamacare."

Vitter and other Republicans have sought legislation to allow small businesses to continue to offer coverage that does not meet the minimum standards set by the Affordable Care Act. Vitter maintains that starting next month small businesses with plans viewed as substandard will lose that coverage.

Some groups have said that some legal immigrants have had a hard time getting their submissions of legal status recorded so that they can keep their health coverage.
