Just because she plays someone who’s technically undead on doesn’t mean Nina Dobrev doesn’t care about health.

The Vampire Diaries star posted a photo to her official Instagram account, showing her support for Obamacare by going topless, covering herself with a sign imploring fans to get coverage under the new healthcare plan.

In explaining the decision to bare all, Dobrev wrote in the photo’s caption, “Im Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered ,Because w/o it, youre naked.”
