A member from Illinois, who served in Brazil, was arrested Friday. As you can imagine, we are heartsick at the thought that children have been victimized. While we are trying to confirm whether there is a connection between the personal actions of the accused and our organization, we have put the accused on immediate leave. We intend to cooperate fully with authorities and are grateful to them for reaching beyond U.S. borders to identify and stop abusers. It has been frustrating in years past that this was not always possible. The protection of children is of vital importance to us. Please pray.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are heartsick,\u201d McCurdy said to Reuters in an email.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New Tribes Mission missionary was sentenced to 58 years in prison recently for child pornography involving indigenous children from the Amazon.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/04/missionary-convicted-child-pornography-involving-indigenous-153342", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/warren_scott_kennell_-_courtesy_seminole_county_jail.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Missionary Convicted of Child Pornography Involving Indigenous"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-04T14:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Missionary Convicted of Child Pornography Involving Indigenous"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/04/missionary-convicted-child-pornography-involving-indigenous-153342", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "New Tribes Mission, Missionary, Warren Scott Kennell, Brazil, Child Pornography, Indigenous Peoples, Indigenous Children, Amazon", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Missionary Convicted of Child Pornography Involving Indigenous"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93d5\"", "article_summary": "The child victims are members of an indigenous tribe in the Amazon, where Kennell was setting up a church for the New Tribes Ministry.\nAccording to a statement from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Tampa, Florida, Kennell, 45, had pled guilty in September to two charges of producing child pornography between 2008 and 2011.\nA former New Tribes Mission missionary, Warren Scott Kennell was sentenced to 58 years in prison January 28, for taking pornographic photographs of tribal children in the Brazilian Amazon, Reuters is reporting.\nNew Tribes Mission, located near Orlando, Florida, identifies itself on its website as an evangelical Christian ministry focused on planting new churches among indigenous tribes, which it describes as isolated from the Bible because of language and culture, Reuters reports.\nWe intend to cooperate fully with authorities and are grateful to them for reaching beyond U.S. borders to identify and stop abusers."}
