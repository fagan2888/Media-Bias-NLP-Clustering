The deadline to avoid the penalties is February 15, 2015. Uninsured Americans will be faced with a fines of $325 per adult or two percent of family income, whichever is higher. But whether the IRS will be able to effectively enforce the individual mandate remains to be seen.\n\nThe Hill noted that the fines in 2016 will be significantly higher than in 2015, when uninsured Americans are due to pay either $95 per adult or one percent of family income this tax season. Under the second year enrollment rules, families without insurance could owe as much as $1,000, possibly more.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Americans are unaware that they will even have to report their insured status on their 2014 tax returns, according to a TurboTax survey released earlier this month.\n\nThe Hill observed that the looming deadline is compelling some Americans to turn to the exchanges before they\u2019re closed, while insurance companies are using the deadline as a means to drive in customers.\n\nAmericans who purchase health insurance through their employers should have a relatively easy time filing taxes, but those who purchased insurance on the open market will have to complete an IRS Form 8965 that entails pages and pages of instructions.\n\nAnd because of the complications involved in this process, tax preparation companies are working to win over customers by touting themselves as experts in navigating ObamaCare rules and capitalizing on Americans\u2019 fears about the penalties. Jackson Hewitt\u2019s marketing strategies involve assuring its customers that employees at Jackson Hewitt \u201cwork harder to keep up with the latest tax law changes to protect you from possible penalties \u2014 not everyone else does.\u201d\n\nIn promotional materials, companies such as H&R Block promise solutions for their customers, pointing out that healthcare reform is making tax planning more difficult. \u201cThe ACA [Affordable Care Act] has changed the landscape of both healthcare and tax,\u201d H&R Block states online, inviting consumers to calculate their mandate penalty or receive a \u201ctax impact analysis\u201d when they become a client.\n\nSome taxpayers can utilize a hardship exemption if they meet the qualifications, including the death of a close relative, the cancellation of a previous health plan, or an increase in expenses brought on by caring for an aging family member. \u201cThere are a lot of people who will qualify for an exemption,\u201d said Avalere Health CEO Dan Mendelson. \u201cIf a company can save someone the 2 percent fine on $50,000 of income, that is significant.\u201d\n\nBut according to CPA Practice Advisor, Americans who are expecting to pay a fine in 2015 have entirely too much faith in the IRS and its abilities. According to that site, \u201cThe IRS has absolutely no way of verifying whose insurance coverage did not qualify under the law and who pays the penalty.\u201d Citing all the obstacles the IRS faces in enforcing the mandate, the site concludes that the IRS will be unable to effectively enforce the mandate:\n\nWith just under 25 million people enrolling in the federal and state health exchanges (including Medicare and Medicaid recipients), plus the estimated 150 million who have employer-paid health care plans, there are still some 62 million people who would have to pay a penalty but likely will not. For those who do the math the IRS apparently did not, that\u2019s a potential loss of nearly $6 billion in revenue....\n\nBut wait, it gets worse. Some 3.6 million more people were laid off during the year and lost their health benefits \u2014 becoming liable for some or all of the penalty for the months they were not covered. Call that another billion and a half dollars.\n\nAnd even worse. Those who successfully did enroll in Obamacare and received a premium credit must repay the overage if the IRS finds that the customer\u2019s 2014 income increased over the 2012 income used as a benchmark. That\u2019s the theory, but with the start of tax season mere weeks away there is no mechanism to make that comparison. The final rules say there will be income comparisons, but who will do this?\n\nAnd worse yet. Those who do not meet the \u201cessential minimum coverage\u201d threshold for individuals can still avoid paying the penalty if they meet one of the dozen or so exemptions, which seem to be granted to any person who breathes air, or has a life crisis like missing a utility bill payment, or having a family member [who] becomes ill or even a family pet with a flea problem. It really doesn\u2019t matter, because there is no place to report either the coverage status or the exemption if you are not already enrolled in a qualified program. Those are supposed to be covered under rules that the IRS has not yet drafted.\n\nThe site concludes that agency is clearly too riddled with financial problems and racked by scandal to have set up a \u201csimple database matching program.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Congress\u2019 spending bill has cut the IRS\u2019s budget by $1.3 billion, making it even more difficult for the agency to enforce the mandate.\n\nAs if this isn\u2019t enough of a blow to the Obama administration, some Democrats are now beginning to voice regret over the healthcare reform. Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said earlier this month that ObamaCare has not been worth the political cost. While giving a speech at the National Press Club, Schumer stated that Democrats \u201cblew the opportunity the American people gave them\u201d by passing healthcare reform in 2010 rather than working on legislation that would improve the economy and help middle-class voters.\n\nSimilarly, Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, told The Hill that in retrospect, Democrats should not have passed the bill. Harkin, who co-authored the law and is retiring at the end of this Congress, said, \u201cWe had the power to do it in a way that would have simplified healthcare, made it more efficient and made it less costly, and we didn\u2019t do it. So I look back and say we should have either done it the correct way or not done anything at all.\"\n\n\u201cWhat we did is we muddled through and we got a system that is complex, convoluted, needs probably some corrections and still rewards the insurance companies extensively,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "without insurance, Obamacare penalty, IRS, insured", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/19764-obamacare-fines-hang-over-uninsured-heads-but-can-the-irs-enforce-them", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/4948cbe3712c522c0242d7b1b505a26c_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Americans without insurance are running out of time to avoid the significant ObamaCare penalties that are scheduled to hit in 2016, but at least for now, the IRS doesn't have the means to determine if you  bought insurance or not anyway. by Raven Clabough", "title": "ObamaCare Fines Hang Over Uninsured Heads, But Can the IRS Enforce Them?"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/4948cbe3712c522c0242d7b1b505a26c_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0777\"", "article_summary": "Uninsured Americans will be faced with a fines of $325 per adult or two percent of family income, whichever is higher.\nBut whether the IRS will be able to effectively enforce the individual mandate remains to be seen.\nThe Hill noted that the fines in 2016 will be significantly higher than in 2015, when uninsured Americans are due to pay either $95 per adult or one percent of family income this tax season.\nAs 2014 nears its close, Americans without insurance are running out of time to avoid the significant ObamaCare penalties that are scheduled to hit in 2016.\nUnder the second year enrollment rules, families without insurance could owe as much as $1,000, possibly more."}
