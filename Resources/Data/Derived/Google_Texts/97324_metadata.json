Aster Fellow\n\nThomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies\n\nIt\u2019s that time when we reflect on the past year while making resolutions for big accomplishments in the year ahead. Come next week, the gyms will be packed, and you\u2019ll hardly be able to find any kale at the grocery. However, fewer than one in 10 actually sticks to their New Year\u2019s resolutions.\n\nAs it turns out, Congress has a roughly similar success rate when it comes to sticking to resolutions. Exhibit A: federal spending.\n\nEarlier this year, Congress passed its first budget in six years. Like any proper New Year\u2019s resolution, the budget was ambitious and based in good intentions.\n\nLawmakers know that the country is on a dangerous spending trajectory. The budget resolution provided a credible alternative. It proposed cutting the deficit by $5.3 trillion over the next 10 years, simply by reducing the growth in spending. It also included pro-growth policies that, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, would have added 1.2 million jobs. And it laid the groundwork for repealing Obamacare through the budget reconciliation process.\n\nThe resolution sought to accomplish these goals by building on the Budget Control Act\u2019s discretionary spending limits and making long-overdue reforms to the nation\u2019s overly complex tax code and fiscally unsustainable entitlement programs.\n\nBut Congress abandoned its version of a regular diet and exercise regime almost immediately. As the year comes to a close, the budgetary scales show that, rather than trim spending, lawmakers wound up adding almost $1.2 trillion to the debt this year.\n\nRather than build on the discretionary spending limits, Congress and the president cut a deal in October that blows through the limits \u2014 piling up an additional $85 billion in red ink over the next three years and laying the framework for another financially irresponsible \u201cgrand bargain\u201d before 2018.\n\nAnd rather than reform entitlement programs, lawmakers increased mandatory spending (including debt service payments) by more than $390 billion.\n\nOne area where Congress actually may be able to keep a commitment from their resolution is on using the budget reconciliation to repeal Obamacare. Before Thanksgiving the Senate passed a bill that would repeal most of the new spending programs \u2014 including the premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion \u2014 as well as most of the new Obamacare taxes. The bill also would eliminate the penalties for individuals and employers who decline to purchase Obamacare coverage and sets up a transition period for Congress and the next president to replace the health care law with a proposal that reduces costs for families and the federal government. Finally, the bill would restrict Medicaid funding for abortion providers affiliated with Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\nBut just to be clear, Congress has already found even this reduced commitment hard to keep. Earlier in the year, the House used budget reconciliation to restrict Medicaid funding for abortion providers but neglected to repeal the core provisions in Obamacare.\n\nThe House\u2019s partial-repeal approach fell far short in a number of important ways, including leaving most of the law\u2019s taxes in place as well as $1.5 trillion of the $1.7 trillion in new spending needed to finance Medicaid expansion and new premium subsidies for Obamacare-compliant insurance plans.\n\nThe House blamed its anemic opening bid on a procedural hurdle unique to the Senate known as the \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d which prohibits provisions that are extraneous to the budget process from being included in reconciliation bills. Based on what the Senate was actually able to achieve, we now know that these excuses don\u2019t hold water.\n\nWhen the House starts a new session next week, it will have a chance to make good on one of its 2015 resolutions: Lawmakers can vote on repealing the budgetary heart of Obamacare. Even with the presidential veto, a vote to repeal will set a new and important floor for what can be accomplished using budget reconciliation.\n\nPaul Winfree is director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies.\n\n\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Washington Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Heritage Foundation", "title": "Congress Needs to Start 2016 on a Diet", "url": "http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2016/1/congress-needs-to-start-2016-on-a-diet", "image": "http://www.heritage.org/~/media/heritage.ashx", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heritagefoundation"}, "twitter": {"site": "@heritage", "card": "summary", "creator": "@heritage"}, "robots": "NOODP", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One area where Congress actually may be able to keep a commitment from their resolution is on using the budget reconciliation to repeal Obamacare.\nThe budget resolution provided a credible alternative.\nEven with the presidential veto, a vote to repeal will set a new and important floor for what can be accomplished using budget reconciliation.\nAnd it laid the groundwork for repealing Obamacare through the budget reconciliation process.\nAs it turns out, Congress has a roughly similar success rate when it comes to sticking to resolutions."}
