That\u2019s nearly 1,000 infants exposed to drugs in the womb, the highest number on record and a more than fivefold increase since 2006.\n\nThis chart reflects instances where health care providers reported to the state that they had reasonable cause to suspect:\n\n\u2014 The infant was affected by illegal substance abuse\n\n\u2014 The infant showed withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure (either illicit or prescribed, including mothers on methadone treatment for opioid addiction)\n\n\u2014 Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. With all the focus on heroin and narcotic painkillers, let\u2019s not forget that alcohol use during pregnancy is the leading known cause of preventable birth defects. In 2012, 13 percent of pregnant women in Maine had consumed alcohol in the month before the survey and three percent reported binge drinking, according to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s innocent in Maine\u2019s drug crisis, it\u2019s those babies.\n\nMedical providers are careful to note these babies aren\u2019t \u201cdrug-addicted.\u201d Addiction involves a pattern of behavior that infants are incapable of, including seeking a high, they say.\n\nThe state is responding by hosting a conference later this month. Maine DHHS will convene a Substance Use and Pregnancy Conference on Sept. 30 in Portland to discuss the effects of prenatal substance use, how to prevent it, and ways to support families.\n\n\u201cWe have to get a handle on the drug epidemic ravaging our young people in Maine,\u201d Gov. Paul LePage said in a Friday news release announcing the conference. \u201cThe damage it\u2019s doing to our babies and children is the worst symptom of this scourge.\u201d\n\nDr. Mark Publicker, an addiction medicine specialist who practiced at the Mercy Recovery Center in Westbrook until its recent closure, will be the keynote speaker. He\u2019s very well qualified, as a former president of the Northern New England Society of Addiction Medicine and editor-in-chief of the American Society of Addiction Medicine magazine, among other relevant experience.\n\nBut he\u2019s an interesting pick, considering he has openly criticized the LePage administration\u2019s policies, including a failed bid to end MaineCare funding for methadone treatment and a crack down on the prescribing of narcotic painkillers through the health insurance program.\n\nPublicker doesn\u2019t provide medical care to drug-affected babies, but he\u2019s likely treated some of their mothers and fathers for addiction during his 30 years in the field.\n\nDHHS encourages clinicians, counselors, support services representatives, and other treatment providers from around the state to attend the conference. Those attendees will receive a certificate upon completion.\n\nThe conference will be held at the Seasons Event and Conference Center in Portland, with registration beginning at 7:30 a.m. The registration fee is $30.
