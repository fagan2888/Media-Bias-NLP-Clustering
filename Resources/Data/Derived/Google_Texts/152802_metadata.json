But if the patient has MaineCare, the state would reimburse the clinic about $150 to $200, depending on what services are provided. MaineCare is a state-run health insurance program for low-income residents funded with a blend of federal and state dollars.\n\nSince Maine trimmed eligibility for MaineCare, reducing the ranks of Medicaid patients from 357,000 in 2011 to about 290,000 this year, community health centers have increasingly felt the financial fallout.\n\nThe Portland health center has seen its revenue drop by $1 million \u2013 out of a $4.1 million budget \u2013 and without financial help it would have to close or refuse to accept all new patients. The center is on track to be unable to pay its bills at the end of the fiscal year in June, when it\u2019s projected to have a $500,000 deficit with no cash reserves.\n\n\u201cWith this patient mix, our business model does not work,\u201d said Leslie Clark, the center\u2019s CEO. \u201cIdeally, we would have a reserve. We don\u2019t have any reserves. We can\u2019t cut staff anymore.\u201d\n\nA RELIANCE ON MAINECARE\n\nThe clinic relies on MaineCare income for more than half of its operating budget, but it has seen its MaineCare reimbursements plummet from $2.9 million in 2010 to $1.9 million this year. The clinic is also funded directly by the federal government and other grants.\n\nPortland is not the only community health center feeling the pinch. Centers in Sanford, Eastport and elsewhere are reporting financial problems, according to an executive who represents the clinics.\n\nFour years ago, before Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s administration began reducing the MaineCare rolls, Medicaid patients made up 57 percent of all patients at the Portland center. That number has gone down as fewer people are eligible for MaineCare, and it was reduced even further during the latest MaineCare cutback in January 2014, when the state tightened eligibility requirements, removing 25,000 childless adults and parents from the rolls.\n\nNow, only 37 percent of the center\u2019s patients are on Maine-Care, and 46 percent are uninsured, compared to a 32 percent uninsured rate in 2010. Meanwhile, most of the people who have gained insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act go elsewhere for treatment, Clark said. Maine\u2019s overall uninsured rate has declined from 16.1 percent in 2013 to 13.3 percent in 2014, but more of the uninsured in the Portland area appear to be going to the Portland clinic.\n\nThe center serves 4,000 patients, triple its 2010 patient population. The problem, Clark said, is that about half of all new patients are uninsured.\n\nBy law, community health clinics are not permitted to refuse new uninsured patients while still accepting MaineCare patients. The clinics must treat everyone who walks in the door, but can refuse to see all new patients. But at the Portland clinic, refusing to see all new patients does not fit with its mission, and it does not help the situation because the current mix of patients is financially unsustainable, Clark said.\n\nClark said that after LePage was re-elected governor in November \u2013 effectively ending any chance for Medicaid expansion \u2013 the center was left looking at budget cuts to stay afloat. It cut $300,000 and left a few vacancies unfilled, but now, with an ever-growing patient population, the center can\u2019t cut anymore, she said, and still be able to deliver services.\n\n\u201cOur whole goal was to get through the year and get MaineCare expanded,\u201d Clark said.\n\nDr. Renee Fay-LeBlanc, chief medical officer at the Portland health center, said she ran in a fundraiser in Florida and collected several thousand dollars in donations for patients who can\u2019t afford their prescriptions, such as antibiotics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really challenging on a day-to-day basis right now. We\u2019re under so much financial stress,\u201d Fay-LeBlanc said.\n\nASKING ADMINISTRATION FOR HELP\n\nThe problem is so acute that the Maine Primary Care Association, which represents the state\u2019s 17 health clinics, is asking the LePage administration to pump $3 million into the clinics over two years.\n\n\u201cThis is an untenable situation. At some point there comes a breaking point,\u201d said Vanessa Santarelli, CEO of the primary care association. \u201cOur need is much greater than what we\u2019re asking.\u201d\n\nSantarelli said she has met with the administration but has not received any signals that it would support the funding, although she said the clinics have pledges of support from Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not clear whether the administration will support the request, LePage\u2019s proposed two-year state budget would devote more money to primary care reimbursements, providing more than $15 million a year to offset federal cutbacks. David Sorensen, Maine Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, said the agency had no comment on the issue because it has not yet received a formal funding request from the clinics.\n\nSantarelli said she hopes the LePage administration\u2019s emphasis on primary care funding will bode well for the $3 million budget request.\n\nIn Eastport, Holly Gartmayer-DeYoung, CEO of the Eastport Health Care clinic, said the reduced MaineCare reimbursements are having a \u201cdevastating effect,\u201d and she worries about being able to finish the year in the black. Gartmayer-DeYoung said she didn\u2019t yet have a backup plan for when the money runs out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. It\u2019s a nightmare. I have sleepless nights worrying about it,\u201d she said.\n\nFEWER SERVICES FOR UNINSURED\n\nMartin Sabol, executive director of Nasson Health Care in Sanford, said the situation there is \u201cnot as dire\u201d as in Portland, which serves a much higher uninsured population, but it, too, is feeling financial strains from having more uninsured patients.\n\nNewly uninsured patients who were previously on MaineCare also receive fewer services, and have to rely entirely on clinic services instead of at times being referred to other doctors who take MaineCare patients.\n\nFor Joss Beane, 33, of Portland, losing his MaineCare coverage in January 2014 sent him into a \u201cdeep depression.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in a bad state of depression for nine months,\u201d said Beane, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. \u201cI\u2019m finally getting to the point where I feel like I can start contributing again.\u201d\n\nStill, Beane said he notices that the Portland health center cannot provide the same level of services as when he was on MaineCare. For instance, when he had MaineCare coverage, he could go to the health center and then be referred to a psychiatrist for counseling. Now, he is briefly counseled by a social worker at the clinic, which does not offer extensive, in-house mental health services.\n\nBeane said he also needs a tooth pulled, which can\u2019t be done at the health center, but would have been covered by MaineCare. He said he\u2019s going to somehow scrounge up money to get his aching tooth removed. Beane said he gets angry about the many people who are in the same situation as he is \u2013 no longer having MaineCare coverage.\n\n\u201cIf something serious happened to me, it would be really crushing, financial and otherwise,\u201d Beane said. \u201cAccidents happen, and people get all kinds of injuries and maladies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still out here. We\u2019re not just going to disappear.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patients who lost coverage are showing up at clinics across Maine, and the cost of treating them with little or no reimbursement is creating financial problems.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Patients who lost coverage are showing up at clinics across Maine, and the cost of treating them with little or no reimbursement is creating financial problems.", "title": "Community health clinics struggle with impact of MaineCare cuts - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/584604_103388-mainecare0001.jpg", "height": 586}, "updated_time": "2015-02-07T22:19:30-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/02/08/community-health-clinics-struggle-with-impact-of-mainecare-cuts/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patients who lost coverage are showing up at clinics across Maine, and the cost of treating them with little or no reimbursement is creating financial problems.", "title": "Community health clinics struggle with impact of MaineCare cuts - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/584604_103388-mainecare0001.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2015-02-08T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-07T22:19:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By law, community health clinics are not permitted to refuse new uninsured patients while still accepting MaineCare patients.\nFrom uninsured patients, who pay on a sliding scale based on their income, the clinics would typically receive about $10 or $20 per visit.\nFor instance, when he had MaineCare coverage, he could go to the health center and then be referred to a psychiatrist for counseling.\nBeane said he also needs a tooth pulled, which can\u2019t be done at the health center, but would have been covered by MaineCare.\nPortland is not the only community health center feeling the pinch."}
