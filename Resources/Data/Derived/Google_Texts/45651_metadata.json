Now, everyone from former congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to Polifact admits that President Obama misled the public (and implicitly accused him, therefore, of lying when he denied saying so). Having caught him egregiously dissembling to the voters on his primary domestic \u201cachievement,\u201d the question now is whether the media will be as tough on his equally dishonest statements on Iraq.\n\nPresident Obama reads his speech to photographers after delivering a televised address marking the end of the U.S. combat mission in Iraq from the Oval Office of the White House on Aug. 31, 2010. (Susan Walsh/Associated Press)\n\nIt\u2019s generally seen by commentators and many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that failing to keep troops in Iraq contributed to the disastrous rise of the Islamic State and the near-destruction of Iraq. That\u2019s a problem, of course, because Obama pulled them out. The president and his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, have now come up with their version of the Obamacare canard: If you like our troops, you can keep them in Iraq.\n\nUnbelievably, Obama now claims he didn\u2019t make the decision to pull them all out. Only the commander in chief could pull them out, of course, and he did, just as he had promised throughout his 2008 campaign. In 2011 in a speech to the nation entitled \u201cEnding the War in Iraq,\u201d he declared: \u201cAs a candidate for president, I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end \u2014 for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world. After taking office, I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011. As commander in chief, ensuring the success of this strategy has been one of my highest national security priorities. Last year, I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq. And to date, we\u2019ve removed more than 100,000 troops. Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their country\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nHe continued into his second term, bragging in State of the Union addresses that he had brought all the troops home. He touted his full withdrawal in his presidential debate with Mitt Romney. Not until Iraq came apart at the seams did he indicate that he had wanted to leave troops behind.\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201dSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was asked what he\u2019d say about Obama\u2019s insistence that it wasn\u2019t his decision to pull out troops:\n\nI\u2019m telling the president, you\u2019re rewriting history at your own convenience. You got the answer you wanted. You promised to get us out of Iraq and you were hell-bent to get out of Iraq. When everybody told you, you need to leave a force behind, you made it impossible for the Iraqis to say yes. Mr. President, you authored us getting out of Iraq, and during a debate with Governor Romney, Romney suggested I could support 10,000 troops like the president intends to leave behind, and the president said in the debate, I\u2019m not leaving any troops behind. I\u2019m not going to get entangled in Iraq yet again. Mr. President, you\u2019re rewriting history.\n\nWhat we know from multiple sources, including the then-ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Croker, is that the George W. Bush administration had hoped and planned to leave a stay-behind force. The military commanders recommended that 10,000 troops be left in place. However, Obama knocked that number down to 3,000. Meanwhile, Iraqi officials willing to have a U.S. presence in Iraq told the Americans that a guarantee of legal immunity for U.S. troops couldn\u2019t be gotten from parliament but could be given by the Iraqi prime minister. (Recently, the Iraqi government did precisely that, allowing about 800 U.S. advisers to return to the country.) That was not good enough for the Obama-Clinton team \u2014 or, if you prefer, provided the pretext for doing what Obama had wanted to do all along. All troops were removed, and Obama was able to brag about it for three years.\n\nThere is something truly jaw-dropping about the president\u2019s attempt to deny his responsibility for what was the subject of his 2008 campaign and of his ongoing boasts for years. Surely, he is not so disconnected from reality to know that this was his aim to bring all the troops home and that he thought this was a great accomplishment. Does he really expect the public to buy the notion that someone else made the call or that he was helpless to take the steps that his critics insisted were necessary to retain hard-fought gains? It no doubt is a bitter pill for him to swallow \u2014 namely, that Romney, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and the entire Bush team were right that a stay-behind force was essential \u2014 but it\u2019s no justification for rewriting his presidency. In any honest fact-checking or questioning of the president, the media have the obligation to make clear that Obama is now running from a central tenet of his presidency and of leftist dogma for a decade.\n\nThe question is then whether the media will hold him to account for misrepresenting what he told the public on Iraq, as they did on his Obamacare excuse. His repeated promise about keeping your doctor was rated the \u201clie of the year\u201d in some quarters. Surely his latest Iraq whopper rates as high.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The mainstream media should hold Obama to account for his total pullout from Iraq.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The mainstream media should hold Obama to account for his total pullout from Iraq.", "title": "Obama\u2019s latest whopper: If you like the troops, you can keep them in Iraq", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/08/11/obamas-latest-whopper-if-you-like-the-troops-you-can-keep-them-in-iraq/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/05/23/National-Enterprise/Images/AP1008311631241400867042.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/08/11/obamas-latest-whopper-if-you-like-the-troops-you-can-keep-them-in-iraq/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obama and Iraq, Obama and stay-behind force, Obama and Iraq troops, Obama and Islamic State, Hillary Clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obama and Iraq, Obama and stay-behind force, Obama and Iraq troops, Obama and Islamic State, Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb80a\"", "article_summary": "Not until Iraq came apart at the seams did he indicate that he had wanted to leave troops behind.\nto Polifact admits that President Obama misled the public (and implicitly accused him, therefore, of lying when he denied saying so).\nAfter taking office, I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011.\nYou promised to get us out of Iraq and you were hell-bent to get out of Iraq.\n(Susan Walsh/Associated Press)It\u2019s generally seen by commentators and many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that failing to keep troops in Iraq contributed to the disastrous rise of the Islamic State and the near-destruction of Iraq."}
