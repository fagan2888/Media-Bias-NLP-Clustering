Through AccessHealth, she was seeing a primary care doctor at Spartanburg Regional.\n\nThen, she bought an insurance plan via healthcare.gov.\n\nShe chose Consumers' Choice, one of three insurance providers with plans on the exchange. BlueCross BlueShield (which has two plans) and Coventry, which was acquired by insurance giant Aetna last year, are the other two. Consumers' Choice has sold more plans than any other provider on the marketplace, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nWhat West learned after she bought insurance caught her by surprise.\n\n\u201cConsumers' Choice (representatives) told me I could go to Regional, but I was going to have to pay out of pocket,\u201d West said.\n\nOf the insurance providers with plans for sale on healthcare.gov, Spartanburg Regional, has a contract only with Coventry. It will accept patients with the other plans, but those patients must pay out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nSpartanburg Regional did not respond to questions about why it contracts only with Coventry, whether it is losing patients and about the need for patients it has served for years to go elsewhere.\n\nSpokeswoman Maria Williamson did issue the following statement: \u201cSpartanburg Regional Healthcare System is committed to helping patients navigate the complexities of health plans.\u201d Williamson said there is a phone line patients can call with questions they may have regarding their health plans. She said that while the hospital is currently contracted with Coventry, it is in negotiations with the other providers. The extent of the negotiations is unclear.\n\nA Consumers' Choice spokeswoman said the company had discussions with Spartanburg Regional, but has not been able to reach an agreement.\n\nA BlueCross BlueShield representative said the hospital opted out of its exchange network.\n\nCoventry spokesman Walt Cherniak said Regional is part of a high-performance network with the insurance provider. In a high-performance network, Coventry collaborates with one health care system, he said.\n\n\u201cThe focus is on better management of a patient population across the health care system and increased member engagement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is designed to improve quality and deliver care more efficiently and cost-effectively.\u201d\n\nWhat it means for patients who aren't in the Coventry network is that they will be denied full coverage at the Gibbs Cancer Center. Their insurance won't cover the delivery of a baby at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center. And patients, like West, will have to leave their favorite doctor and seek a new medical home.\n\n\u201cThings were better before I had to get insurance,\u201d West said. \u201cI didn't have these headaches.\u201d\n\nBig Flaw\n\nLynn Bailey, an independent health care economist in Columbia who specializes in strategic management and planning for health care providers, calls the situation one of the big flaws of Obamacare.\n\nDuring a phone interview, she said other patients across the state and country are experiencing similar challenges.\n\nIn fact, consumers in Spartanburg who purchased a plan with Coventry are likely to recognize issues as well, if they haven't already.\n\nMary Black Health System, a private, for profit hospital located only a few miles from Spartanburg Regional, has contracts with three of the four health exchange companies that provide coverage in South Carolina. The exception is Coventry.\n\nCherniak said Coventry does not have an exclusive arrangement with Spartanburg Regional. Members who buy the CareLink Health Plus plans can obtain care from other doctors or hospitals, but for a cost.\n\n\u201cThey will pay higher out-of-pocket costs and receive reduced benefits if they access care from other providers,\u201d he said.\n\nBailey said the insurance networks (places that accept a certain insurance) are narrow, thin and inadequate.\n\n\u201cAs people have gotten insurance and tried to use their insurance, they are understanding that they can no longer go where they used to go. It's not fair at all, and people who buy insurance don't know this going in. Many enrollees in exchange plans already face barriers to care, and now they are finding that locating a new provider for themselves or their families to be yet another barrier.\u201d\n\nBailey added that this issue should have been anticipated and health plans need to honestly inform enrollees that their local hospital is not in their network.\n\nAdrian Grimes, spokeswoman with Consumers' Choice, said the company is transparent with customers, but agrees that there is still a lot of work to do with education.\n\n\u201cOur provider directory is on our website and we have summaries of plans online. We also have our customer service number available, and customers should call before they purchase,\u201d she said.\n\nCertified application counselors are working in each county to help patients understand, apply and enroll for insurance on healthcare.gov.\n\nReGenesis Health Care is one of several health facilities in Spartanburg with these counselors, and that is where West went for help when it was time to enroll.\n\nAnn Roberson, a spokeswoman with the S.C. Department of Insurance, said these counselors should tell patients which health care providers are in each network.\n\nBut West said she didn't find out Regional wasn't in Consumers' Choice network until after she had already bought the insurance.\n\nChanging market\n\nShalama Jackson, with the South Carolina Hospital Association, which oversees both Mary Black and Spartanburg Regional, said the health care market is changing.\n\n\u201cWe won't be able to go to anybody we want when we want to. \u201cIt's going to be a much more narrowly defined marketplace,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere we go is being defined by our insurance carriers.\u201d\n\nJackson said one of the hospital association's priorities has been to help South Carolinians gain access to coverage and affordable care.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace is one avenue for South Carolinians to get access to affordable care and coverage. With insurance, individuals and families gain access to preventive care and a medical home. It can also allow individuals and families to receive the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting outside of the hospital emergency department.\u201d\n\nBut she said contracts at hospitals are likely to change over time.\n\n\u201cCould more insurance providers be added for Regional? It's possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThe networks that we have today may not be the networks we have next week or tomorrow. Contracts are still being worked out.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Insurance encourages people to know what providers are in their networks before they buy insurance from the exchange.\n\n\u201cIt is important when reviewing plans to check the individual policy language and review the Summary of Benefits and Coverage, provider networks, prescription/drug formularies as well as other information before making a final selection of coverage,\u201d Roberson said. \u201cThose plans offered through the federally facilitated marketplace tend to have more narrow networks than what we saw prior to 2014.\u201d\n\nAs for Mary West, she said she is going to miss her doctor at Spartanburg Regional. He was good, she said.\n\nShe is going to start seeing a doctor at ReGenesis Health Care. ReGenesis Health Care is a federally qualified health system and is required by law to accept insurance from every provider on the marketplace.\n\n\u201cI'm just going to pray and hope it works out,\u201d she said. \u201cI'll give it a chance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shortly after Mary West bought health insurance, she realized there was a problem.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-A132E868-0DC0-4A66-9F77-3B2A8DD09E3E-pubSJ"}, "og": {"site_name": "GoUpstate.com", "description": "Shortly after Mary West bought health insurance, she realized there was a problem.", "title": "Newly insured patients find they can't use local hospital or doctors", "url": "http://www.goupstate.com/article/20140405/ARTICLES/140409873", "image": "http://www.goupstate.com/global/images/fb/SJ.png", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20140405, "fb": {"app_id": 179941415376591}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-140409873-pubSJ"}}, "keywords": "SPARTANBURG (SC),  Health,  Yahoo"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe56d7\"", "article_summary": "A Consumers' Choice spokeswoman said the company had discussions with Spartanburg Regional, but has not been able to reach an agreement.\n\u201cI didn't have these headaches.\u201dBig FlawLynn Bailey, an independent health care economist in Columbia who specializes in strategic management and planning for health care providers, calls the situation one of the big flaws of Obamacare.\n\u201cThe focus is on better management of a patient population across the health care system and increased member engagement,\u201d he said.\nFor years, the Spartanburg resident was treated by a doctor at Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.\nChanging marketShalama Jackson, with the South Carolina Hospital Association, which oversees both Mary Black and Spartanburg Regional, said the health care market is changing."}
