He said he struggled with it several years until he got signed up to the ACA in early 2014. That\u2019s when he was finally able to see an ear, nose and throat specialist. The physician ordered surgery, which opened up Conklin\u2019s sinuses after a decade-long ordeal.\n\n\u201cToday is the first time in four years that I\u2019m able to go out during the season,\u201d he said Thursday morning at Florida state Rep. Ed Narain\u2019s district office in Tampa\u2019s Ybor City. \u201cDuring this whole time, I lived in my bedroom 20 hours a day, sealed my windows, sealed my bedroom, and moved my business into my closet.\n\n\u201cIf I had to go out of the house, I had to have my emergency inhaler.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in swing states across the nation held news conferences to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. They say the much-debated health care overhaul has made a real difference in the lives of millions of people.\n\n\u201cTwenty million Americans gained access to insurance through the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said St. Petersburg allergist Dr. Mona Mangat. She said the uninsured rate in Florida has dropped from 21.3 percent to 15.2 percent since the law was implemented. \u201cSo access has improved. People\u2019s lives have been saved, and less people live in fear of medical bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nBut Narain and Magat said more can be done: They\u2019re pushing the Florida Legislature to expand Medicaid, which state lawmakers have refused to do the past four years.\n\nNarain predicts the Legislature will do so next year \u2026 if a Democrat is elected president.\n\n\u201cI believe that Florida\u2019s resistance to Medicaid is simply political,\u201d the second-term representative said. \u201cThere\u2019s a belief that if a Republican is elected (president), you would see them take Obamacare and change it to a block grant program. Then you may see Florida Republicans say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll accept the money and enact our own plan.\u2019 But, if a Democrat is elected, I think think you\u2019ll the see continuation of the ACA in its current format over the next eight years. At that point, I think Florida politicians will have no choice but to accept the money.\u201d\n\nAlthough a passionate supporter of the ACA, Mangat said the law definitely needs improvements. She mentioned network adequacy, which has become more difficult with mergers of large insurers. \u201cNetworks are getting smaller, choices becoming less, and that\u2019s an issue that needs to be addressed,\u201d she said.\n\nManga also mentioned the rising price of drugs and out-of-pocket costs for those on the plan. She said if there wasn\u2019t so much gridlock in Washington, changes already would have been made.\n\nFlorida saw the highest enrollment through an Obamacare health insurance exchange of any state in the country, with 1.7 million people signing up for coverage this year. Overall, the Obama administration says 20 million people have obtained health insurance as a result of the law.\n\nNationally, Republicans continue to resist the bill. On Wednesday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said, \u201cIt\u2019s been six years since America\u2019s healthcare system was thrown into turmoil by the signing of ObamaCare \u2013 a bad law that has resulted in six years of broken promises and higher health care costs as premiums and deductibles continue to rise. There is no way to justify the law\u2019s continued failure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Ken Conklin says the Affordable Care Act literally saved his life.
