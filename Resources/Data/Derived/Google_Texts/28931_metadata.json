While walking into Verboten, a Williamsburg club, Quann \u201cgot in the way\u201d of police attempting to arrest a drug suspect. When an NYPD lieutenant shoved Quann from behind, she asked the law enforcement officer to be more careful.\n\nFrom the Daily News:\n\n\u201cCan you please watch where you are pushing. \u2026 I am a woman,\u201d Quann told the lieutenant, who is identified in the lawsuit as Stephen Conforti.\n\nThat\u2019s when Quann claims she was grabbed by cops who held her arms, frisked her and snapped on handcuffs.\n\nThe suit, filed Monday in Brooklyn Federal Court, states that Quann spent 24 hours in police custody before she decided not to fight the charges and reluctantly \u201cagreed to accept an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal for disorderly conduct.\u201d\n\nQuann, a model who has also appeared in Vogue, Gap and a number of other blogs and publications, was not in any way involved in the arrest of the drug suspect.\n\nSelected as one of @Oprah's \"Favorite Things\" of 2015, see why we teamed up with @Jawbone \u25ab\ufe0f\u25ab\ufe0f\u25ab\ufe0f Let's face it, keeping on track towards your fitness goals or routine is not always a walk in the park\u2026if it was, quotes such as \"No pain, No gain\", \"The pain you feel today is the strength you feel tomorrow\", \"You may see struggle but you will never see me quit\" or \"It is a long road, it seems impossible, but it is worth it\" would not even exist. \u25ab\ufe0f\u25ab\ufe0f\u25ab\ufe0f With that being said, you can find creative ways to make fitness work in your favor and have fun while doing it. Incorporating a consistent routine into your weekday is impertinent to the quality of life we should all be living, and of course this not rocket science, we all know the benefits our mental and physical well being reaps. Though for many of us it is not just the physical act itself that is the most challenging, but the mental strength in staying focused daily.
