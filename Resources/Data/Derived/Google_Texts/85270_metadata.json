Police determined she was killed by her ex-fiance, who afterward hanged himself.\n\nTara DeLorme\u2019s hands shook and tears occasionally rolled down her cheeks as she told the story of her friend\u2019s murder to the Ocean County chapter of NOW (National Organization for Women) as the group met at the county library on Sept. 10.\n\nDespite the clear toll the telling takes on DeLorme, she vowed to tell Letizia \u201cLisa\u201d Zindell\u2019s story \u201cagain and again, until there are proactive protections in place\u201d for victims of domestic violence.\n\nDeLorme is the president and founder of Lisa\u2019s Light Foundation, a nonprofit domestic-violence education organization formed in October 2009 to honor her friend\u2019s memory. Zindell was found beaten and strangled in the backseat of her car in Toms River on Aug. 14, 2009. Her ex-fiance, who had repeatedly violated a restraining order, \u201cwas found shortly thereafter by police hanging in the detached garage of the residence they once shared,\u201d DeLorme said.\n\n\u201cPolice determined it was a murder-suicide. Lisa was 30 years old,\u201d she told the group of women, who seemed to mirror DeLorme\u2019s anguish as they heard the tale.\n\n\u201cLisa\u2019s death illuminated the dark cracks in the laws as they are now,\u201d DeLorme told the dozen women, who met not just to learn about Lisa\u2019s Light but also to see what they could do to help the organization.\n\nDeLorme came to the NOW meeting not only to provide general information on her organization but also to discuss a proposed statewide domestic-violence law, which Gov. Chris Christie conditionally vetoed on Jan. 17.\n\nKnown as \u201cLisa\u2019s Law,\u201d the measure, which unanimously passed both the state Senate and the Assembly, calls for repeat restraining-order violators to be electronically monitored with a system that would provide automatic alerts to both law enforcement officials and domestic violence victims when a restraining order is being violated.\n\nA clearly frustrated DeLorme told the group that the legislation \u201cwas created responsibly, supported by the community and local law enforcement (and) was simply a pilot program to demonstrate it would be successful statewide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vote was unanimous and bipartisan. I truly believed at that time, that the governor would sign the bill into law within hours,\u201d DeLorme said. Several days later, Christie conditionally vetoed the bill \u201cciting questions of the technology\u2019s viability and availability,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe governor\u2019s decision called for the Attorney General\u2019s Office to complete a 120-day study regarding these issues. When DeLorme spoke on Sept. 10, more than 174 days had passed without the study being released.\n\nDeLorme said she has contacted both the governor\u2019s office and the Attorney General\u2019s office and cannot get any additional information about this study. (The Attorney General\u2019s Office also did not return calls regarding this story.)\n\n\u201cIt is an insult to victims of domestic violence that there has been both inaction and a total disconnect by these offices. We already know the technology exists, we utilize it for both house arrests and high-level repeat sex offenders. We already know the system if viable, as it is utilized with a high success rate in many states,\u201d DeLorme said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get people to pay attention to women\u2019s issues,\u201d said NOW chapter president Helen E. Fitzsimmons of Beachwood, as chapter members bobbed their heads in agreement. \u201cHere is a woman from Ocean County who was brutally murdered. Imagining her last minutes is horrible. This law would give the individual the power to react.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not continue to watch homicide after homicide and pretend nothing could be done to stop it. It is organizations such as yours that can help Lisa\u2019s Law spring into action,\u201d DeLorme said, urging NOW members to contact the governor\u2019s office to \u201cprovide a voice for those who have been silenced.\u201d\n\nBefore discussing the proposed law, DeLorme first spoke about her friend and her background. She told how Zindell was raised in Island Heights and earned high honors at Central Regional High School in Berkeley.\n\nWhat several at the meeting found particularly unsettling is that Zindell was educated in social work and earned two master\u2019s degrees, one in social work and another in criminal justice. She also worked for the Division of Youth and Family Services.\n\n\u201cAs a social worker, Lisa knew the appropriate steps to take to protect herself\u2026.she changed her routine, made an effort not to go places alone and even left her home to stay with a friend,\u201d DeLorme said.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s someone who knew exactly what to do and did everything she was supposed to. What hope does anyone else have?\u201d questioned Gloria McCormack, of Beachwood.\n\nDeLorme said Zindell \u201cwas adored by family, loved by friends and respected and admired by her colleagues. She had a light, a glow about her that left a lasting impression on everyone she met.\n\n\u201cThe last weeks of Lisa\u2019s life were a devastating reminder that domestic violence is an epidemic in our society that can affect any person at any time,\u201d said DeLorme.\n\nNoting that the NOW chapter has \u201ca lot more members than you\u2019ll ever see at a meeting,\u201d founding member Lynda Fote of Toms River pledged to get the word out to the chapter\u2019s email list, asking members to contact the governor as well as other officials and to write letters to the editor to local media outlets urging Christie to take additional action.\n\nFitzsimmons noted that the group is open to new members and works to support women\u2019s issues.\n\n\u201cWe are not looking for something with her name on it to make us feel better. We want to save lives,\u201d DeLorme said. \u201cIn the time that we\u2019ve been waiting, we\u2019ve lost more people to domestic violence.\u201d\n\nBoth Lisa\u2019s Light Foundation and NOW Ocean County can be found on Facebook.
