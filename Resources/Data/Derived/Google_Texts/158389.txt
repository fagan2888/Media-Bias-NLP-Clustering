Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro methodically laid out her case Sunday night against President Obama’s contract with America being null and void because he “lied” his way into the White House and has done nothing but lie to the American people ever since.

Pirro began her argument with a look back at Obama’s lies on Benghazi and Obamacare during the 2012 presidential campaign and then showed how the “fraud continued when Obama belittled” Mitt Romney over Russia in the now famous, “the 1980’s called and want their foreign policy back,” video.

Pirro said Obama hasn’t just lied, he continues to prove his “complete lack of knowledge on the world stage” by taking the military back to “pre World War II capabilities.”

“The truth,” she said, is that Obama’s “mission is to minimize United States exceptionalism” and that “day by day, [Obama] does everything in his power to make sure we are not” exceptional.

Saying Obama has looked the “fool” and is “embarrassing to watch on the world stage as Putin outsmarts” the president at “every turn,” Pirro agreed with former Ambassador John Bolton who said Obama is America’s ‘biggest national security crisis” during his speech last week at CPAC.

“I have an idea, why don’t you just put your sticks down and come home from Key Largo and do something for us?” Pirro demanded of Obama.

“Mr. President, you lied to get here, you’ve been outsmarted, outclassed and out punched by a KGB tough guy, and as far as I’m concerned, this contract is null and void.”
