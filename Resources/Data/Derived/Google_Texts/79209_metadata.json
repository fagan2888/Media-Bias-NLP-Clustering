Health and Human Services \u201cright now is doing what we\u2019ve done with other states, which is communicate with the state about our concerns to make sure people are obeying statutes in terms of access to providers.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission informed several Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas last week that their ability to provide care through the state\u2019s Medicaid program was being revoked because of alleged violations documented in an undercover video released this summer by an anti-abortion group. The state is also investigating alleged Medicaid fraud stemming from illegal billing practices by the affiliates.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing and has until mid-November to appeal the decision.\n\nTexas Democrats have called on Burwell\u2019s office to investigate the decision, calling the state\u2019s actions politically motivated.\n\nBurwell\u2019s comments came during a visit to Parkland to promote efforts to boost participation in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplace ahead of the Nov. 1 start of the open enrollment period.\n\nTexas has the highest rate, and the highest total number, of uninsured residents in the country, according to data released by the Census Bureau last month. In 2014, 19.1 percent of Texans, about 5 million people, didn\u2019t have health insurance, a slight decrease from the 22.1 percent uninsured the year before.\n\nBurwell identified Dallas as one of five priority cities targeted for improved enrollment. She\u2019ll travel to Houston on Wednesday to continue her campaign.\n\nBurwell touted the progress being made in Texas, but said much more work needs to be done to raise awareness about the available options and to educate residents about the subsidies available that can help drive down costs of insurance.\n\n\u201cEmphasizing this affordability point and the importance of the Advanced Premium Tax Credits so that people know care can be subsidized so they can have affordable premiums is such an important part,\u201d she said.\n\nBurwell\u2019s visit included a meeting with Parkland officials, Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Monica Alonzo and leaders from a variety of faith and community groups to discuss efforts to boost Affordable Care Act enrollment.\n\nBurwell praised the groups for playing a key role in spreading information about the law and getting people signed up for coverage.\n\nParkland chief executive Fred Cerise said 48 percent of the care the hospital provides is to uninsured patients. Any increases in Affordable Care Act enrollment help \u201ctake more pressure off Parkland and taxpayers,\u201d he said.\n\nTwitter: @conor_shine", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sylvia Burwell, secretary of Health and Human Services, says the agency is monitoring the state\u2019s effort to block the group from getting Medicaid dollars.", "og": {"description": "Sylvia Burwell, secretary of Health and Human Services, says the agency is monitoring the state\u2019s effort to block the group from getting Medicaid dollars.", "title": "Planned Parenthood case in Texas is on federal officials\u2019 radar", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151027-planned-parenthood-case-in-texas-is-on-federal-officials-radar.ece", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151027-congress_dietary_guidlines_46522443.ece/BINARY/original/CONGRESS_DIETARY_GUIDLINES_46522443", "height": 683}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-10-28T03:19:11Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-10-28T03:19:11Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Planned Parenthood case in Texas is on federal officials\\u2019 radar\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151027-planned-parenthood-case-in-texas-is-on-federal-officials-radar.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151027-congress_dietary_guidlines_46522443.ece/BINARY/original/CONGRESS_DIETARY_GUIDLINES_46522443\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2505257\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-10-28T03:19:11Z\", \"section\": \"State Headlines\", \"author\": \"CONOR SHINE\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20151027-congress_dietary_guidlines_46522443.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/CONGRESS_DIETARY_GUIDLINES_46522443", "publishtime": "2015-10-28T03:19:11Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Any increases in Affordable Care Act enrollment help \u201ctake more pressure off Parkland and taxpayers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not familiar with all the specifics of the local case,\u201d Burwell said during a news conference at Parkland Memorial Hospital.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Monday that her office has been in touch with Texas officials over state efforts to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid dollars, but she didn\u2019t indicate whether any federal action would be taken.\nPlanned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing and has until mid-November to appeal the decision.\nTexas Democrats have called on Burwell\u2019s office to investigate the decision, calling the state\u2019s actions politically motivated."}
