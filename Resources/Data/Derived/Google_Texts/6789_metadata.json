Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has surveyed what he calls \u201cthe Obama-Clinton foreign policy,\u201d and he does not like what he sees.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday at The Heritage Foundation, Cruz condemned current policy as \u201cappeasement and moral equivalency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen America recedes from the world, the world is more dangerous,\u201d says @SenTedCruz.\n\nSaid Cruz: \u201cOne of the sad legacies of the last six years\u201d is that \u201cour friends no longer trust us and our enemies no longer fear us,\u201d and that the United States risks going from \u201cthe leader of the free world to a dutiful and obedient member of the international community.\u201d\n\nCruz criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s remarks that we should \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cempathize\u201d with our enemies.\n\n\u201cWhat our foreign policy needs isn\u2019t empathy,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cWe need clarity, force and resolve. When America recedes from the world, the world is more dangerous.\u201d\n\nCruz denounced the idea that providing \u201clethal aid\u201d to Ukraine would \u201cprovoke\u201d Russian leader Vladimir Putin, saying Putin was \u201calready provoked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeakness is provocative,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nCruz said Putin\u2019s \u201cpetro-dictatorship\u201d is weakened by falling oil and gas prices. He said his colleague, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., refers to Russia as \u201ca gas station with a country attached.\u201d\n\nCruz called Iran the \u201csingle greatest threat to our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a nation calls you \u2018the great satan,\u2019 it ain\u2019t good,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cCutting a deal with Iran would be the Obamacare of [the president\u2019s] second term.\u201d\n\nIn a humorous moment, Cruz mispronounced former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s name and joked that \u201cit would be easier if his name was Smith.\u201d\n\nCruz said Israel is \u201cin a tough neighborhood\u201d and deserves to be \u201cvigorously and robustly\u201d supported by the United States.\n\nCruz hopes \u201cthe new occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\u201d is a \u201cvery different president who can be trusted by friend and foe alike.\u201d\n\nHe called the \u201cmoral equivalency embraced by the administration\u201d between Israel and its enemies a \u201ccomplete and stunning indictment of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruly, we have gone with Alice through the looking glass,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session after his remarks, Cruz was asked about the CIA torture report recently released by Senate Democrats.\n\nCruz said that \u201ctorture is wrong\u2014period, unambiguously.\u201d\n\nHe then called the report \u201cpartisan\u201d and a \u201cbiased view of what occurred.\u201d He warned that the risk of retaliation is real.\n\n\u201cIn a time when the world is on fire, of course you want to harken back to your predecessor,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cEverything, everything, everything is George W. Bush\u2019s fault. Enough already.\u201d\n\nCruz concluded that in two years, he hopes \u201cthe new occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\u201d is a \u201cvery different president who can be trusted by friend and foe alike.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a speech at The Heritage Foundation, Ted Cruz takes President Obama to task because \"our friends no longer trust us, and our enemies no longer fear us.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In a speech at The Heritage Foundation, Ted Cruz takes President Obama to task because \"our friends no longer trust us, and our enemies no longer fear us.\"", "title": "Ted Cruz on Obama Foreign Policy: Weakness Is Provocative", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix082140.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BbgVkt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In a speech at The Heritage Foundation, Ted Cruz takes President Obama to task because \"our friends no longer trust us, and our enemies no longer fear us.\"", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix082140.jpg"}, "title": "Ted Cruz on Obama Foreign Policy: Weakness Is Provocative", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "diplomacy,security", "published_time": "2014-12-10T23:14:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Senator Ted Cruz, foreign policy, Obama, Hillary Clinton, Iran, Russia, Putin, Ukraine, Israel"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06ac\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
