If the full legislature passes the funding, Florida\u2019s tourism arm will direct a marketing campaign that plays up the state\u2019s health care providers and specialty medical services to an international audience.\n\nMedical tourism usually brings to mind the hundreds of thousands of Americans \u2014 both insured and uninsured \u2014 who go to other countries such as Costa Rica, Mexico, India, Thailand, and Brazil to seek treatment because medical care in the United States can be prohibitively expensive. But according to Patients Beyond Borders, between 600,000 and 800,000 foreign patients came to the U.S. for health services in 2013 despite the relatively high costs of care here. These patients are often from countries that have yet to develop certain advanced procedures or technologies, or where those procedures are still far too costly. For instance, many international consumers visit well-known clinics such as the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, Johns Hopkins in Maryland, and the Mayo Clinic arms in Arizona, Minnesota, and Florida for cancer care and dental, orthopedic, and cosmetic surgery.\n\nThose are all still pretty expensive and lucrative specialized procedures that attract patients who can afford them (on top of an international trip to the United States). So it\u2019s not surprising that the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida is a big supporter of the bill, which was proposed by state Senate Health Policy Committee Chair Aaron Bean (R). \u201cFlorida can and should be a top-tier health care destination,\u201d said Bean of his legislation.\n\nBut while Bean and his fellow lawmakers think it\u2019s worth spending millions in state dollars catering to a relatively wealthy international crowd\u2019s health care needs, they\u2019re much less inclined to take approximately $51 billion from the federal government to expand Medicaid under Obamacare and provide basic health benefits to about 850,000 poor people who are actually living in the state today.\n\nFlorida has the second-highest uninsurance rate in the entire country. Very few adults qualify for Medicaid under the state\u2019s current rules, which only makes the program available to parents with dependent children who make just a third of the poverty level. Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL) stunned many political observers by embracing the Medicaid expansion in early 2013. \u201cWhile the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care,\u201d said Scott at the time.\n\nBut Florida lawmakers have repeatedly failed to pass Medicaid expansion, and Scott began dodging questions on whether he still supports the provision after he filed for re-election. Most recently, reports have surfaced that Bean \u2014 the medical tourism bill\u2019s main sponsor \u2014 may block a GOP proposal to accept billions in Medicaid expansion dollars. Bean prefers \u201ca state-based, highly limited insurance exchange that\u2026 technically cannot be called an \u2018insurance exchange\u2019 because the products are so limited they do not meet the legal definition of insurance,\u201d according Florida health reform advocate Gary Stein.\n\nThe Scott administration is currently facing fines by the federal government for imposing an illegal cap on the number of times that Florida\u2019s Medicaid beneficiaries can visit the emergency room annually.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Florida lawmakers may spend millions to encourage more people to use health care services in the state.
