Heritage Action for America announced today that it will host a forum for presidential candidates in the early primary state of South Carolina this September.

According to Heritage Action, during the forum, candidates who are seeking the Republican nomination will partake in a “wide-ranging” policy discussion and outline their platforms.

The candidates participating in the forum will be joined by Gov. Nikki Haley, R-S.C., former senator Jim DeMint and Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action.

Haley said that the forum will be an opportunity for the voters of South Carolina to hear from the candidates.

“We have a strong slate of candidates running for the Republican nomination for president, and ahead of our primary, South Carolina voters want to hear from each candidate personally about the most important issues—from health care to jobs and the economy—facing the states and our nation,” said Haley. “We couldn’t be more excited to welcome our candidates to South Carolina and offer them the chance to talk face to face with our voters.”

DeMint and Needham said that the forum will be a productive policy discussion.

“For too long, the playing field has been tilted toward those who try to game the system, and the American people are tired of it,” said DeMint. “They’re looking for leaders who demonstrate a principled commitment to opportunity for all Americans. Instead of ‘gotcha questions’ or the usual political fights, we will discuss solutions on issues that matter to families like education, health care, energy, foreign policy and more.”

“Every candidate runs against Washington because every voter knows the town is a well-oiled machine that works only for the well-connected,” said Needham. “This will be an opportunity for the candidates to articulate their desire to deliver a bold agenda that will bring opportunity for all and favoritism to none.”

The forum will be held on Sept. 18 in Greenville, S.C., at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena.
