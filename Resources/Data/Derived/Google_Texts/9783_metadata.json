Harmony singing requires that you enlarge yourself, not use any kind of suppression. Harmony is the ultimate love.\u201d\n\nPhillip Everly was born on Jan. 19, 1939, in Chicago, the son of two country musicians, Ike and Margaret Everly.\n\nWith Ike Everly on guitar, the family was a traveling act and had a radio show in which Phil and Don performed between commercials for XIP rat poison and Foster\u2019s 30-minute Wonder Corn and Callus Remover. Legendary Nashville guitarist Chet Atkins was one of their earliest supporters.\n\n\u201cOne thing that impressed me when I met those kids was that they were so intelligent,\u201d Atkins said on the Everly family fan site. \u201cDon and Phil used proper English and I just thought they were a cut above \u2026 intellectually and education-wise.\u201d\n\nTheir breakthrough hit, \u201cBye Bye Love,\u201d came in 1957 and rose to No. 2 on the U.S. charts. It was their first million-seller and the first of numerous Everly tunes written by Boudleaux Bryant and his wife Felice, including, \u201cAll I Have to Do Is Dream,\u201d \u201cWake Up Little Susie\u201d and \u201cDevoted to You.\u201d\n\n\u201cWake Up Little Susie,\u201d also released in 1957, was their first No. 1 hit. A song about two teenagers falling asleep at the drive-in theater and waking up long after curfew, it was banned in Boston for its ever-so-slightly suggestive lyrics.\n\nIn 1960 the brothers signed with a new record label, Warner Bros., agreeing to a 10-year, $1 million contract and making their debut with their own song, \u201cCathy\u2019s Clown,\u201d but by then their career was in decline.\n\nThe Beatles may have led to the clean-cut brothers\u2019 undoing in the tumultuous 1960s, but they were on a downward path at least a year before the Fab Four exploded on the scene, according to the Country Music Hall of Fame, which inducted the Everlys in 2001.\n\n\u201cThey broke with [record producer] Wesley Rose in 1961, moved to California, and began making singles that were probably too experimental for the time,\u201d it said, also citing a slowdown in touring and a loss of access to the Bryants\u2019 songs due to a split with music publishing firm Acuff-Rose.\n\nBut the songs lived on through some of the biggest acts of the era including Simon and Garfunkel, who recorded \u201cBye Bye Love\u201d on their 1970 hit album, \u201cBridge over Troubled Water.\u201d\n\nArt Garfunkel told Rolling Stone that the brothers\u2019 harmonizing had taught him that \u201cevery syllable can shine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were Kentucky guys with beautiful, perfect-pitch harmonies and great diction. All those vowels and consonants, those s\u2019s and t\u2019s, every one of them killed me,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1973, with both suffering health and stress problems from years of touring, the Everlys broke up during a concert at Knott\u2019s Berry Farm amusement park in Buena Park, California.\n\n\u201cPhil Everly threw his guitar down and stormed off the stage during a performance of \u2018Cathy\u2019s Clown,\u2019 leaving Don to tell the stunned audience the group was finished,\u201d Rolling Stone said.\n\nIn September of 1983, after a decade of solo projects, they reunited for a show at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall. Backed by a rock-solid band that included Albert Lee on guitar, the brothers drew critical acclaim, and the concert yielded an album and a DVD.\n\nThe Everlys released \u201cEB 84\u2033 in 1984 to more acclaim and scored a minor hit with the album\u2019s \u201cOn the Wings of a Nightingale,\u201d written for them by Paul McCartney.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Phil Everly, whose high, close-harmony singing with his older brother Don made the Everly Brothers one of the biggest rock and country acts of the 1950s and early 1960s, died on Friday at the age of 74, the Los Angeles Times reported.
