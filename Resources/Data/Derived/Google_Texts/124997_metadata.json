They can use a foot or their head or an elbow,\" Alren Klamm, said.\n\nIt's fun and educational for both the parent and the child.\n\n\"It's actually a very useful skill because toys are more motivating than a lot of other activities for kids and it's a cause and effect skill they can learn playing with toys,\" Klamm, said.\n\nWhile the idea of adapting a toy may sound intimidating to some parents, it's actually very simple and affordable.\n\n\"The supplies for each toy are about 50 cents, after you bought some of the tools that you need to do it.

She says learning how to adapt a toy will be beneficial at home and at her job.\n\n\"I work with kids K-5 that have disabilities and also use a lot of switches so having my experiences with Jaiden at a very early age has helped me to be able to and learn ways that are effective for my students,\" Domanuge, said.\n\nAdapting electronic toys, just in time for the holidays.\n\n\"I will be able to adapt Jaiden's toys for Christmas and his birthday is coming up in December so he gets really spoiled around this time of year so this will be really good for him,\" Domanuge, said.\n\nThere will be a Toy Adaptation workshop next Tuesday, December 2nd at the LifeScape Rehabilitation Center.\n\nThey will provide step by step directions on how to make an adaptation to a toy.\n\n\n\nhttp://lifescapesd.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Children like toys, especially 7-year-old Jaiden Bents, who lives with a disability. &quot;It&#39;s very empowering for Jaiden because he knows", "title": "Adaptive Toys Just In Time For The Holidays", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/healthbeat/adaptive-toys-just-in-time-for-the-holidays", "image": "http://kelolandassets.blob.core.windows.net/kelolandassets/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/60952.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Children like toys, especially 7-year-old Jaiden Bents, who lives with a disability. &quot;It&#39;s very empowering for Jaiden because he knows"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92c6\"", "article_summary": "These adapted toys also help him gain fine motor skills.\n\"It's actually a very useful skill because toys are more motivating than a lot of other activities for kids and it's a cause and effect skill they can learn playing with toys,\" Klamm, said.\nYou can use a wide variety of toys and install an adapted switch to tailor the toy to fit your child's needs.\nSioux Falls, SDChildren like toys, especially 7-year-old Jaiden Bents, who lives with a disability.\nAdapting electronic toys, just in time for the holidays."}
