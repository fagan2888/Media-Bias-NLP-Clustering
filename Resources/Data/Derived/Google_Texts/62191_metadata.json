Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n2 The Real Reason Neocons Are So Upset About Donald Trump\n\n3 Elizabeth Warren Takes On the \u2018Gig Economy\u2019\n\n4 Benedict Anderson\u2019s View of Nationalism\n\n5 No, Paul Ryan, Austerity Will Not Fix the Starving Puerto Rican Economy\n\nIn a disappointing twist, the Arnold Foundation is among those megafoundations whose larger charitable ambitions fall squarely within the plutocratic agenda. Armed with a staff that includes a former chief of staff to Dick Armey and a Tea Party challenger to Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, John Arnold is a key player in the aggressive anti-government edge of mega-philanthropy. Along with the funding of education reform measures like charter schools, he has made one of his major causes reforming public pensions,, including slashing benefits and moving funds under private management. The Arnold Foundation\u2019s report on pensions suggested that states should \u201cstop promising a defined benefit\u201d to pensioners.\n\nAs Matt Taibbi put it in Rolling Stone, while describing the efforts of the Arnold Foundation and others to undermine the legitimacy of pensions,\n\nThe battle increasingly centers around public funds like state and municipal pensions. This war isn\u2019t just about money\u2026. it\u2019s also about blame. In state after state, politicians are\u2026 using scare tactics and lavishly funded PR campaigns to cast teachers, firefighters and cops\u2014not bankers\u2014as the budget-devouring boogeymen\u2026\n\nCompared to the billions spent on influencing public education reform, the Arnold\u2019s $10 million gift to maintain an existing social program is almost quaint, both in terms of size and in terms of ambition for control (or in this case, lack thereof). According to Chrystia Freeland in her 2012 book Plutocrats,\n\nArguably the most coveted status symbol isn\u2019t a yacht, a racehorse, or knighthood; it\u2019s a philanthropic foundation\u2026one actively managed in ways that show its sponsor has big ideas for reshaping the world\u2026. the ambition of the philanthro-capitalists doesn\u2019t stop at transforming how charity works. They want to change how the state operates, too\u2026\n\nThe futile standoff over the Affordable Care Act is undergirded by a fantasy of a world in which the government\u2019s power is vastly reduced and private citizens step into the breach with better, more innovative ideas for solving social challenges. Rob Reich, a political theorist at Stanford, has researched how philanthropists have become increasingly political, not just in terms of what institutions they fund but in their ideology about the private sector\u2019s qualifications to solve social problems. \u201cA democratic society is committed, at least in principle, to the equality of citizens, but foundations are the voice of plutocracy,\u201d Reich wrote for Boston Review.\n\nThat voice is growing louder, as we might expect during this era of inequality. According to Joanne Barkan\u2019s recent reporting for Dissent,\n\n[Big] philanthropy in the United States is booming\u2026. In September 2013 there were sixty-seven private grant-making foundations with assets over $1 billion\u2026 Mega-foundations are more powerful now than in the twentieth century\u2014not only because of their greater number, but also because of the context in which they operate: dwindling government resources for public goods and services, [and] the drive to privatize what remains of the public sector\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to fund poor children\u2019s early education, particularly during an emergency. Unfortunately, for the Arnolds this seems to be a fleeting moment of self-awareness that, for all their wealth, they are part of a larger community that requires a major central government to properly care for all its citizens. Otherwise, it\u2019s back to aggressively undermining the legitimacy of public employees and institutions, because billionaires know best. They certainly have quite the head start of their own.\n\nA new poll says Americans blame Republicans for the government shutdown.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutdown_treasury_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Amy Schiller", "description": "Billionaires John and Laura Arnold are using the government shutdown to promote a very different vision for America's future.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Billionaires John and Laura Arnold are using the government shutdown to promote a very different vision for America's future.", "title": "Can Billionaire Philanthropists Replace the Federal Government?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/can-billionaire-philanthropists-replace-federal-government/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutdown_treasury_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 415}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T05:52:21+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Billionaires John and Laura Arnold are using the government shutdown to promote a very different vision for America's future.", "title": "Can Billionaire Philanthropists Replace the Federal Government?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/can-billionaire-philanthropists-replace-federal-government/", "image": {"height": 415, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutdown_treasury_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutdown_treasury_ap_img.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "October 11th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "Can Billionaire Philanthropists Replace the Federal Government?", "keywords": "The Nation, Amy Schiller, Head Start, John and Laura Arnold Foundation, government shutdown", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 88627, "sailthru.tags": "Budgets,Business,Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "government shutdown", "published_time": "2013-10-11T20:45:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:52:21+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "Some wealthy individuals are using the government shutdown to promote a very different vision for America\u2019s future.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutdown_treasury_ap_img.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce75d\"", "article_summary": "The Arnold Foundation\u2019s report on pensions suggested that states should \u201cstop promising a defined benefit\u201d to pensioners.\nAlong with the funding of education reform measures like charter schools, he has made one of his major causes reforming public pensions,, including slashing benefits and moving funds under private management.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s back to aggressively undermining the legitimacy of public employees and institutions, because billionaires know best.\n\u201cA democratic society is committed, at least in principle, to the equality of citizens, but foundations are the voice of plutocracy,\u201d Reich wrote for Boston Review.\nAccording to Joanne Barkan\u2019s recent reporting for Dissent,[Big] philanthropy in the United States is booming\u2026."}
