OrthoPediatrics specializes in developing medical devices for children.

WARSAW, Ind. (WANE) OrthoPediatrics is a one-of-a-kind business in Warsaw. It’s the only business in the U.S. specializing in orthopedic medical devices for children, and two years ago the small company of a little more than 80 employees was hit with medical device tax. The tax was put in place to help fund the Affordable Care Act.

“It definitely slows the development of new products for children in those surgeries because we don’t have the funds to support the new products,” CFO Fred Hite said.

Every other week medical device companies have to pay a 2.3 percent tax based on their revenues. However, that’s all about to change with lawmakers voting to suspend the tax for two years.

“We’re extremely happy and pleased to hear that. It costs us several hundred thousand dollars every single year,” Hite said.

OrthoPediatrics is just one of more than 300 Hoosier medical device companies, employing more than 20,000 people in Indiana.

“Indiana is a hub for medical product innovation and Warsaw in particular and this has got a severe impact on the development of new products by millions and millions of dollars,” Hite said.

Now, OrthoPediatrics is reworking the budget and will use the money that would have gone to the tax to develop new products to help children with deformities and traumatic injuries.

“Luckily now we’ll be able to go back and review that and remove the expense and cash that we had put in to the budget for the medical device tax and instead replace that with incremental programs developing new projects,” Hite said.
