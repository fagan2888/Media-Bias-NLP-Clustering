A second \u201caccount insights\u201d interface will also provide advertisers with information about the non-paid content they post on the service.\n\nThe idea is to help its advertisers better understand their Instagram audiences, and to figure out the types of content they\u2019re most interested in, the Facebook-owned service said. The tools will not be made available to marketers that do not purchase ads across Instagram, however.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to brands and businesses a bunch over the last six months, and these tools are largely based on their feedback,\u201d Instagram product manager, Jeff Kanter, told CMO Today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to provide measurement to really prove the platform\u2026 We heard from brands that they wanted more insight into how people engage with their organic content and ads,\u201d Mr. Kanter added.\n\nThe analytics interfaces will now allow advertisers to access and analyze their ad campaign data in real-time. Previously Instagram sent that information to advertisers manually upon request.\n\nA third \u201cad staging\u201d tool will also allow marketers and creative teams to preview how their ads will look before they go live across Instagram.\n\nTo actually purchase ads marketers will still have to work directly with Instagram salespeople, however. There\u2019s no self-service ad buying tool on offer yet. Mr. Kanter said the company would consider extending similar analytics tools to non-advertisers \u201cover the long-term,\u201d but explained that its attentions are focused on its advertiser clients for now.\n\nInstagram will continue to add new features and other tools based on advertiser feedback. The company is already evaluating adding time-spent metrics for video content, for example, in response to advertiser demand.\n\n\u201cOur doors are open and we\u2019re working with a lot of large brands now to prove that Instagram works,\u201d Mr. Kanter said.\n\nBrands already making use of the tools include Banana Republic.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Instagram is rolling out new tools for advertisers in an attempt to help them better understand the impact of their activity across the image-centric social network.
