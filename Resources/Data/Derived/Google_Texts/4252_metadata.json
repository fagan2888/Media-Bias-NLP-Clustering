Ed Narain\u2019s (D-Tampa) bill provided a public records exemption for the identity of a witness to a felony. It\u2019s gone through some other changes, but the measure has now been narrowed again.\n\n\u201cIt basically narrows this public records exemption to provide that it will only apply to witnesses of a murder, instead of all felonies,\u201d said Narain.\n\nThe measure stems from a 14-year-old, who was murdered in a park. According to the Tampa Police Department, Edward Harris was a witness to crimes that led to multiple arrests.\n\n\u201cYou have the opportunity today to stop the snitching mentality, and supporting House Bill 475, you have the opportunity today to save my life, your life, and a child\u2019s life by supporting this bill,\u201d said Tangela Sears.\n\nSears is the founder of Miami Dade Parents of Murdered Kids. She spoke recently to lawmakers at a House panel about the measure, and she brought with her other parents who had similar stories.\n\nAmong them is Tranell Harris, who used to be a mother of four living children. That quickly changed, when her son Richard Hallman\u2014an aspiring engineer\u2014was fatally shot in March of last year. With no witnesses coming forward, it\u2019s now an unsolved murder.\n\n\u201cThe last conversation I spoke with my 16-year-old son was \u2018I love you,\u2019 and he walked outside and I got a call back three hours later, my son was dead,\u201d said Harris. \u201cAnd, yes, we do have people that see something, that know something, but of course, they\u2019re scared to speak. I\u2019m a mother of three now. I support this bill not only as a bill of words, but a bill of movement.\u201d\n\nWhile Leon County Public Defender Nancy Daniels says the bill is heading in the right direction with its latest change of protecting witnesses to murder, she still has an issue with the bill. She represents the Florida Public Defenders Association.\n\n\u201cOur only issue is at line 19, where it states that the only entities that can get access to this information are governmental entities for use of the performance of official duties,\u201d said Daniels. \u201cAs criminal defense lawyers who represent people charged with crimes, we are entitled under the rules of discovery and the Constitution\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation to find out the names and identifying information of witnesses that are going to testify against our client. It\u2019s part of our due process of law.\u201d\n\nBarbara Petersen, the President of the First Amendment Foundation, had similar objections. She\u2019s voiced her concerns to the measure in all its forms in the past, saying it\u2019s unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to narrow it, but they\u2019re still not addressing the issue of the constitutionality of denying this information to a criminal defendant,\u201d said Petersen. \u201cAnd, once information is lawfully obtained\u2014in other words, once the prosecution gives the information to the criminal defendant, who has the right to confront his or her accuser\u2014once that information is given to the criminal defendant, the government cannot control the downstream use of the information. So, I just don\u2019t see how this is going to work.\u201d\n\nStill, Narain\u2019s bill has encountered bipartisan support, earning all \u201cyes\u201d votes so far. It now has one more stop before heading to the House floor. Meanwhile, the Senate bill by Inverness Republican Senator Charlie Dean has not yet had a hearing.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A bill initially aimed at protecting the witnesses to a felony crime has now gone through another change in the House, after passing a second committee.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/mothers-murdered-kids-advocate-behalf-bill-aimed-protecting-murder-witnesses", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201601/464613798.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A bill initially aimed at protecting the witnesses to a felony crime has now gone through another change in the House, after passing a second committee.", "title": "Mothers Of Murdered Kids Advocate On Behalf Of Bill Aimed At Protecting Murder Witnesses"}, "story_id": 464613766, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sascha Cordner", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Mothers Of Murdered Kids Advocate On Behalf Of Bill Aimed At Protecting Murder Witnesses"}, "nid": 13408, "datePublished": "2016-01-28", "keywords": "murder witness, public record, public record exemption", "wordCount": 708, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A bill initially aimed at protecting the witnesses to a felony crime has now gone through another change in the House, after passing a second committee.\nOriginally, Rep.
