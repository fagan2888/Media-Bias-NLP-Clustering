Every Friday, we take a look at three pieces by right-leaning writers that intelligently and lucidly articulate core elements of their worldview. The goal isn\u2019t to find conservatives telling progressives how right they are, but rather to pick out writing that helps liberals understand where their ideological foes are coming from.\n\nSo let\u2019s get started.\n\n1. \u201cWas Russia\u2019s WTO Membership a Mistake?\u201d \u2014 Seth Mandel, Commentary\n\nTwo of the major fault lines separating progressives and conservatives on foreign policy are rogue states and international institutions (i.e., the U.N.) Progressives think the U.S. should engage constructively with rogue states; neoconservatives think it usually ends up covering for their evils. Progressives think the U.N. and international law are worthy projects; neoconservatives are skeptical.\n\nMandel\u2019s piece neatly ties the conservative side of both arguments together. As you might guess from the title, he\u2019s examining whether Russia\u2019s recent accession to World Trade Organization membership was a mistake. But the substantive questions he raise are much broader:\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that U.S.-Russia trade suddenly materialized out of nowhere when Russia joined the WTO\u2013of course that\u2019s not the case. But it does raise questions about authoritarian actors joining international institutions that don\u2019t require more sturdy political liberalization (like NATO). I\u2019ve written in the past about \u201creverse integration,\u201d James Mann\u2019s theory of how China could take advantage of economic integration not to play by international rules but to weaken the threshold for rogue regimes to be granted increased international legitimacy and thus dilute, not enhance, global democracy. That is not quite the concern here with Putin (or at least not the main concern). Russia\u2019s membership in the WTO doesn\u2019t seem to be de-democratizing economic institutions here or abroad. Rather, Putin has taken advantage of economic integration with the U.S. to dull any American response to his adventuresome foreign policy. Because that response already had virtually no military component, weakening or greatly delaying any financial sanctions would tie both the West\u2019s hands behind its back while he did what he wanted.\n\nMandel\u2019s point is that closer ties with rights-abusing regimes gives those nations more avenues to enable their abuses. Integrating China and Russia into economic institutions like the WTO gives them more power to shape the codes that govern the institutions, including the rules about using economic power to punish bad actors. It\u2019s a trenchant point, and one that should trouble progressives who believe in international law\u2019s power to make the world a better place.\n\n2. \u201cOur Property Principle\u201d \u2014 Richard Epstein, Defining Ideas\n\nWhen I mentioned that I was including this essay in the roundup to my colleague Ian Millhiser this morning, Ian referred to Epstein as the \u201cgodfather\u201d of contemporary libertarian legal thought. Many of the constitutional arguments you see against progressive laws \u2014 including the ones used against Obamacare \u2014 date back to Epstein\u2019s legal scholarship.\n\nIf you want to understand the thinking behind these arguments, then, Epstein\u2019s new column defending an aggressively libertarian theory of constitutional property rights is worth your time. Epstein believes that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s property rights protection (\u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\u201d) reflects a basic philosophical commitment on the part of the founders to strong protection against government seizure of property. The reasons behind this commitment are compelling:\n\nToday, with weak property rights protection, the dangerous dynamic of majoritarian politics can engulf all government actions. In the absence of a strong just compensation requirement, nothing ensures that government takings, even when done for public use, will be worth more to the public at large than to its private owners. Protecting private property does not stand in opposition to the welfare of the community at large, but is thoroughly consistent with it. For example, forcing New York City to put the cost of landmark preservation \u201con budget\u201d improves the political process by forcing a more candid deliberation of relative costs and benefits. It is the failure to incorporate this check on deliberation that has contributed so much to economic stagnation in New York City and the nation. The City thus labors under the massive misallocations caused by rent stabilization because it refuses to put on budget the losses incurred by landlords from tenants who can force the renewal of their leases at below market rates. It is just this unwillingness to respect financial liens that accounts for the deplorable conduct of the federal government in the continuing scandal over the expropriation of the private shareholders of Fannie and Freddie.\n\nThough Epstein doesn\u2019t out-and-out say it, the subtext here is that property rights are a critical bulwark against the abuse of minority rights by the majority. Given that members of majority, privileged groups tend to dominate government in a democracy, the people most likely to be victimized by government seizure of property are oppressed minorities. Expanding the government\u2019s legal power over the economy, then, isn\u2019t always progressive: in some cases, it can reinforce race-and-class hierarchies rather than undermine them.\n\n3. \u201cYour Questions, My Answers (I)\u201d \u2014 Ross Douthat, The New York Times\n\nI think Ross Douthat is the New York Times\u2019 best columnist. That\u2019s not because he\u2019s the Grey Lady\u2019s most *correct* columnist. I often find Douthat\u2019s arguments infuriating, particularly on religion and morality. Rather, Ross wins the op-ed page by performing the most valuable public service of anyone writing in that space: he teaches the Times\u2019 more-liberal-than-not audience why smart people might disagree with them.\n\nA lot of progressives dismiss religious conservatives as pro-tanto irrational or, worse, stupid. Douthat\u2019s sharp writing gives the lie to this stereotype, giving open-minded progressives a golden opportunity to understand a rich worldview they may not come into contact with often. Today\u2019s blog post, where he responds to questions about his views from readers, is an almost perfect example of this function of his work. Take this response to a reader asking about whether conservatives\u2019 \u201cbelief in American exceptionalism [is] a rational philosophy or a naive and sentimental view of the world?\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t it be both, depending on how far it\u2019s taken? I think there\u2019s a wise version of American exceptionalism that admires and defends our particular folkways \u2014 the religious balancing act I just mentioned, our rich associational life and civic life, our democratic culture and longstanding skepticism of centralized authority, our commercial and technological dynamism, etc. \u2013 without taking the na\u00efve and sentimental step of asserting that our way is the Only Way, Period, and that every other culture and society and government should be judged by how closely it hews to our particular model. The first kind is the kind of exceptionalism I endorse, and the kind of conservatism I subscribe to \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t see America as perfect and sinless, but thinks that our overall way of life is one of humanity\u2019s great achievement, with major virtues that are worth defending. And in the specific case of health care, I think that kind of exceptionalist attitude would be willing to look the problems with our system \u2013 the cost overruns, the millions left uninsured \u2014 squarely in the face, and not just take refuge in the \u201cwe have the best health care in the world\u201d assertions that you sometimes hear from Republican politicians. But it would also be conscious of the cultural particularities at work here (policy isn\u2019t the only reason, or even the major reason, why America has higher obesity rates than northern Europe), and the distinctive virtues of our system (we really do drive a lot of the world\u2019s health care innovation), and it would look for reforms that would work with the American grain\u2026 rather than just assuming that we can drop Sweden\u2019s system into the American Southwest and get exactly the same outcomes. That\u2019s the goal of a wise exceptionalism, I\u2019d say: Not a resistance to any form of change, but a quest for changes that are in continuity with the American experiment\u2019s best features.\n\nIt\u2019s as clear a response to a perennial progressive question (\u201cwhy can\u2019t conservatives admit that life is so much better for Europeans?\u201d) as one could hope for. It also succintly expresses a number of important conservative insights: policy doesn\u2019t always drive social trends, contextual differences between societies matter greatly, and the the free market in works in subtle ways to make people\u2019s lives around the world better. This is the sort of conservatism that progressives need to take seriously.\n\nOne final note: this will be my last week walking you through the best in conservative writing, and at Think Progress in general.
