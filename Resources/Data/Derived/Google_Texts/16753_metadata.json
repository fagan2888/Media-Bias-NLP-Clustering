Whether you\u2019re talking about startups like Betterment and Wealthfront or entrenched giants like Charles Schwab, the idea of having your money managed by software rather than a person is one of the biggest stories in finance.\n\nThe knock against robo-advisers, however, has always been what happens in a crisis. When markets pull back, will investors be comfortable trusting an algorithm to manage their money or will they want a human adviser to call?\n\nThe robos got their first real gut test in August, when the S&P 500 fell more than 6% on the month. That included the extremely painful Aug. 24, when the Dow plunged more than 500 points.\n\nI\u2019ve been a robo client for almost a year now, and witnessed the pullback first-hand. Here was my experience:\n\nI try to be a disciplined investor, but when the markets start crashing, I get the same panicked feeling as most people. Could this be 2008 all over again? Could I lose half of my money? I start checking my account more and more frequently. I feel an urge to do \u2026 something. It\u2019s hard to just sit there and lose money!\n\nWhen Aug. 24 hit, I had all those feelings. But when I logged into my robo account, I was put at ease. Most software-based advisers are programmed to harvest losses when markets pull back, and when I logged in, I saw my account doing just that. My old ETF positions were being sold and rotated into new ones. Tax losses were piling up. There were articles on the site explaining what was going on.\n\nSomehow\u2013and this surprised me\u2013the fact that my portfolio was following a plan scratched my itch to react. It almost didn\u2019t matter what it was doing. It was clear that there was a plan, and the program was making the most of it. I felt no urge to bail. I was actually excited to see the tax losses pile up.\n\nI called around to a few of my friends who have human advisers, and their experiences weren\u2019t nearly as good. Two phoned their advisers but hadn\u2019t heard back. One was fretting to himself. Their portfolios weren\u2019t doing anything.\n\nI firmly believe in the ability of human advisers to provide real value to clients. I think the industry has a bright future. But if advisers want to compete going forward, they are going to have to co-opt the best things that robo-advisers do: tax-loss harvesting, automatic updates on portfolio moves, mass communication. If not, I believe they won\u2019t be able to compete.\n\nMatt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) is president of ETF.com.\n\nRead the latest Investing in Funds & ETFs Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Robo-advisers are hot.
