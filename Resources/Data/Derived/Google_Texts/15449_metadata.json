Missing the deadline could create a coverage gap for those converting from an old plan to a new one, or delay coverage for the uninsured.\n\nA healthcare reform specialist helps people select insurance plans at the free Affordable Care Act (ACA) Enrollment Fair at Pasadena City College on November 19, 2013 in Pasadena, California.

(The deadline varies somewhat by state and by insurer.)\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced this morning that nearly 365,000 Americans had signed up for private health insurance under Obamacare. The vast majority came from 14 states running their own insurance exchanges, while 137,000 came by way of HealthCare.gov , the much-faulted federal Web site that handles enrollment for the remaining states.\n\nThat\u2019s slow going, according to consultants and some insurers, raising the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS is releasing.\n\n\u201cThere is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments,\u201d industry consultant Robert Laszewski wrote in an email. \u201cOne client reports only 15% have paid so far. It is still too early to know for sure what this means, but we should expect some enrollment slippage come the payment due date.\u201d\n\nAnother consultant Kip Piper, agreed. \u201cSo far I\u2019m hearing from health plans that around 5% and 10% of consumers who have made it through the data transfer gauntlet have paid first month\u2019s premium and therefore truly enrolled,\u201d he wrote me.\n\n\u201cIt naturally varies by insurer and will hopefully increase as we get close to end of December and documents flow in the mail,\u201d added Piper, a former official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cBut overall I\u2019m hearing it\u2019s a small portion so far. And that, of course, is a fraction of an already comparatively small number of people who have made it through setting up an account, getting verified, subsidy eligibility determined, plan selected, complete and correct data transferred to the insurer, and insurer set out the confirmation with invoice for consumer\u2019s share of the first month\u2019s premium.\u201d\n\nBlue Shield of California said it has sent out thousands of payment request letters.\n\n\u201cMembers do not know they need to make their first month\u2019s payment until they get this letter. Payments are trickling in and while we expect an uptick over the next week, members have until January 6 to make this payment,\u201d spokeswoman Mia Campitelli wrote in an email.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s deadline is later than most, and consumers need to check for the deadline for the insurance plan they choose. Campitelli said Blue Shield does not have a projection of what percentage of enrollees will pay up by the deadline.\n\nWith problems plaguing HealthCare.gov until the end of November, consumers don\u2019t have much time to pick plans. Some consumers, on the advice of federal officials, have turned in paper applications \u2014 and those are still being processed. That leaves little time to send invoices and process the first month\u2019s payment.\n\nKen Wood, a senior adviser to Covered California, the state\u2019s exchange, said it is \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d what would happen. \u201cRemember that we have 11 different plans with 11 different billing systems \u2014 some more flexible than others,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cExcluding only Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day, there are only eight business days between the December 23rd cutoff for enrollment and the January 6th deadline for payment.\u201d\n\nWood said the consequences of missing the first payment differs by person.\n\n\u201cThe good news for this first open enrollment is that missing a payment deadline just rolls your effective date a month,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is OK for the uninsured but a potential concern for the insured who are rolling over into a compliant plan since they will now have a gap in coverage.\u201d\n\nCovered California is promoting \u201cgive the gift of health\u201d where a grandparent or parent would pay for the coverage with a debit or credit card. Some enrollees who receive subsidies still have to pay $1 a month for their coverage, \u201coddly a real billing and collection concern because it is easy to overlook,\u201d Wood said, \u2014 so Covered California is encouraging them to pay $12 for the year and be finished. \u201cThe barriers to paying the entire amount are the systems capability of the health insurers,\u201d Wood said.\n\nNew York\u2019s State of Health exchange does not have data on how many enrollees have paid premiums, spokesman James O\u2019Hare said. \u201cIn the event that an enrollee does not pay his/her premium, coverage does not go into effect, and they will no longer be enrolled in NY State of Health,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nJames Stover, CEO of University of Arizona Health Plans, said he expects more than 85 percent of enrollees to pay the premium on time. \u201cRight now we\u2019re comfortable with the process we have in place,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as we get the information in, we\u2019re reaching out to the individuals to let them know what their binder payment is. We\u2019ll follow up with them.\u201d\n\nStover said that enrollment has been lower than expected. A couple of weeks ago, only one person had signed up. By early this week, the figure had increased to 35. \u201cWe plan to have triple digits in the next couple weeks and greater growth in the next couple months. We initially expected to have somewhere between 5,000 to 6,000 by June 30, 2014.\u201d\n\nWhile saying it is difficult to guess what will happen, Piper said he believes \u201ca plan will be lucky if half of applicants pay first month\u2019s premium on time for January coverage start but that perhaps three-quarters will pay in time for coverage start by February or March.\u201d\n\nOne additional point to keep an eye on: If consumers pay their first month\u2019s premium but then stop paying, insurers cannot drop them from their plans for 90 days.\n\n\u201cUnder the rule interpreting the law, insurers offering plans on the exchanges must provide a three-month grace period to individuals who have enrolled and who have stopped paying their premiums. In the first 30 days, the insurer must continue to pay incurred claims. But for subscribers who ultimately fail to pay premiums within the 90 days and whose coverage is terminated, payers are not required to pay for claims incurred during the last 60 days of the 90-day period,\u201d Modern Healthcare reported in August.\n\nHealthcare providers are nervous that they will be on the hook for services delivered to patients who haven\u2019t paid their premiums.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This post is adapted from Ornstein\u2019s \u201cHealthy buzz\u201d blog.
