Her main concern centers around Section 4 of the compact, which reads, \u201cEach Member State, within its State, may suspend by legislation the operation of all federal laws, rules, regulations, and orders regarding Health Care that are inconsistent with the laws and regulations adopted by the Member State pursuant to this Compact.\u201d\n\nA bill would need to be passed allowing control of Medicare in Kansas, but Praeger says lawmakers clearly have the authority to do so under the Health Care Compact.\n\nPraeger says conservative Republicans led the legislative effort to join the Health Care Compact with one goal in mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about undermining the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s very, very much politically-motivated. It\u2019s about saying, \u2018We\u2019re not gonna participate in any of that health care reform. We\u2019re gonna do it our own way in Kansas\u2014including Medicare,\u201d said Praeger.\n\nBudget Director Shawn Sullivan says Praeger is right about the real target being the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt upsets me that many are using this issue to their own advantage, and trying to scare seniors that receive Medicare benefits. The intent of the governor when he signed it was that this would not touch Medicare. This would not privatize Medicare,\u201d said Sullivan.\n\nSullivan went on to say that he\u2019s worked with seniors long enough to know there is no way they would allow Kansas legislators to privatize their Medicare program.\n\nTo become a reality, The Health Care Compact has to be approved by Congress, and then signed by the President. If that should happen, Kansas lawmakers might never use it to take control of the Medicare program. But there\u2019s nothing in the law to stop them. In fact, the Texas billionaire who came up with the idea of the Health Care Compact said in a 2011 interview with \u201cMother Jones\u201d magazine that finding a better way to deliver health care to senior citizens was his main motivation.\n\nThe rest of the story is available from Kansas Public Radio.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HPPR Government & Politics", "description": "Budget Director Shawn Sullivan says Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger and others are participating in election-year scare tactics with warnings that a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://hppr.org/post/state-official-says-health-care-compact-criticism-politically-motived", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/hppr/files/styles/medium/public/201411/HealthCareCompACT_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Budget Director Shawn Sullivan says Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger and others are participating in election-year scare tactics with warnings that a", "title": "State official says Health Care Compact criticism politically motived"}, "story_id": 361295924, "twitter": {"site": "@/#!/hppr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@/#!/hppr"}, "author": "Cindee Talley", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "State official says Health Care Compact criticism politically motived"}, "nid": 38981, "datePublished": "2014-11-03", "keywords": "Health Care Compact, Affordable Health Care Act, Obamacare, Sandy Praeger, Shawn Sullivan", "wordCount": 538, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03af\"", "article_summary": "Praeger says conservative Republicans led the legislative effort to join the Health Care Compact with one goal in mind.\nTo become a reality, The Health Care Compact has to be approved by Congress, and then signed by the President.\nIn fact, the Texas billionaire who came up with the idea of the Health Care Compact said in a 2011 interview with \u201cMother Jones\u201d magazine that finding a better way to deliver health care to senior citizens was his main motivation.\nIt\u2019s about saying, \u2018We\u2019re not gonna participate in any of that health care reform.\nPraeger says a state takeover of Medicare could jeopardize the benefits of more than 450,000 Kansans."}
