Amazon.com on Sunday showed off a new drone prototype for its planned 30-minute unmanned delivery service.

It’s the first new prototype Amazon has shown publicly since it first announced its drone plans two years ago, also on the day before Cyber Monday, one of the retailer’s biggest days for shopping.

The new prototype combines elements of a helicopter and airplane including a rear-facing propeller. Amazon claims it can fly 15 miles and can reach an altitude of nearly 400 feet. In a promotional video posted on its website, Amazon showed the drone storing a package within the fuselage rather than extended below as in a previous design.

The latest drone design demonstrates Amazon’s commitment to the technology, even as it faces significant regulatory hurdles. The company has bulked up its Prime Air team and run tests abroad, though apparently it has yet to make deliveries to customers using the unmanned vehicles.

Amazon said in the video that it plans different drone types for different environments. Critics have voiced concerns that drones may be susceptible to weather events, bird attacks or other obstacles.

Google and Wal-Mart are also developing drones for package delivery, though Amazon has become a leading lobbyist for the concept.
