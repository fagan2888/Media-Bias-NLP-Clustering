Sonny Perdue and former Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas.\n\n\"We're not preparing young people well enough in mathematics and their literacy skills, their reading comprehension, they're not where they need to be to be successful in the workforce,\" Engler says in one video advocating for the more strenuous Common Core guidelines.\n\n\n\nMichigan is one of more than 40 states to adopt the standards, although lawmakers explored abandoning the Common Core last summer before ultimately giving the Michigan Department of Education the go-ahead to keep the guidelines in place.\n\nCritics of the standards have drawn comparisons between the Common Core and the Affordable Care Act, calling the guidelines \"Obamacore\" and alleging they represent a federal takeover of education.\n\nEngler directly addresses the issue of President Barack Obama's involvement in the standards in one of the videos, saying the standards are a state, not federal, effort.\n\n\"These were all designed by governors and state and local education officials prior to his being elected,\" Engler said.\n\nThe videos were released Wednesday as a partial response to conservative commentator Glenn Beck, a frequent critic of the Common Core who hosted a live event simulcasted to movie theaters across the country Tuesday evening.\n\nBeck's event, titled \"We Will Not Conform,\" was designed to encourage organized opposition to the standards as well as promote his latest book, which also criticizes the Common Core.\n\nBrian Smith is the statewide education and courts reporter for MLive.
