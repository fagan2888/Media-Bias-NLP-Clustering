Some are pushing to end the sport, and thousands of jobs and millions of dollars are at stake.\n\nLee Devon is a spirited champion Greyhound who loved hamming it up for our camera. She lives at this Madison county breeding farm with a hundred other dogs who are being trained for racing.\n\nRon Gurley is a Greyhound Breeder\n\n\"She runs every Monday and Thursday morning.\n\nReporter: \"For how long\"\n\n\"About 30 seconds.\"\n\nReporter: \"Really, that's all?\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\nUsing reports to the state would show 70 dogs died last year.

That would mean there'd be no place for these dogs to go.\n\nFlorida currently has 12 active dog tracks producing about 24 million in tax revenue each year.\n\nThe Madison County greyhound farm is also rehabbing 15 dogs who were injured at tracks.
