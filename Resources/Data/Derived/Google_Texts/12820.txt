Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez said Friday that his department worked “very closely” with the SEC in crafting its proposed new fiduciary rule.

The secretary’s comment, made during an interview on CNBC, came after Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Congress filed formal requests with the DOL to provide documentation of all communications with the SEC relating to the rulemaking process.
