Abby Pell, 33, was trying to inspire other moms to get in shape when she captioned a photo of her ab muscles, "I have a kid, six pack, and no excuse." Unfortunately, not everyone took it that way.

Fit mom Maria Kang was accused of fat shaming when she posted a picture of her impressive, post-pregnancy ab muscles with the caption, “What’s your excuse?” Though some find this inspiring, others accused her of fat-shaming. Now, they’re accusing Abby Pell.

The Daily Mirror reported Pell, 33, posted pictures of her ab muscles to Instagram with the caption, “I’ve got a kid, a six pack and no excuse.” As was the case with Kang, people accused Pell of fat shaming “pure and simple.” Another comment read, “Exploiting your motherhood to show off is despicable and shameless.” Presumably this was in response to the pictures Pell poses with her daughter Bella.

In fact, Bella is who inspired Pell to include her caption after saying she looked like Wonder Woman.

“I never meant to offend anyone — my life is better now that I’m in shape, so I hoped I could encourage others to do the same,” Pell said.

After Bella was born, Pell struggled to lose the 50 pounds she gained during her pregnancy. She tried a handful of diets, including Atkins and The South Diet, but they never helped her curb cravings and feel satisfied with her meals. This final go-round, she adjusted her diet and fitness routine, focusing on lifting weights. This is when she started to see results.

"Now going to the gym is where I have my 'me-time,' which all mums know they need."
