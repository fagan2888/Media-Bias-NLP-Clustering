The U.S. Supreme Court is looking into a case that could affect when and how federal benefits laws trump state insurance laws.

Insurers argue that letting FEHBA preempt state laws is important.

Lawyers for Coventry Health Care of Missouri Inc., for example, argue in a brief filed in connection with the Nevils case that the text of FEHBA is similar to the section of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) that preempts state efforts to shield patients from plan moves to seek reimbursement for benefits paid from lawsuit recoveries.
