COURTESY OF ST. BERNARDINE MEDICAL CENTER FOUNDATION Related article \u00bb\n\nFor nearly four decades, the nonprofit St. Bernardine Medical Center Foundation has received and disbursed charitable gifts to the medical center, and in the process its has assisted those in need who cannot afford care.\n\nIn 1928, when San Bernardino was a rapidly expanding community with little access to quality medical facilities, Dr. Philip Savage, a local surgeon, envisioned a first-class hospital. Savage approached the Rev. Patrick Dunn, pastor of St. Bernardine Catholic Church, hoping to work with the Franciscan Sisters, who had hospitals around the country.\n\nIn 1931, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word founded the St. Bernardine Medical Center. The original hospital had 125 beds. It featured five surgery rooms, an operating theater for observation and teaching, six solariums, well-equipped clinical laboratories, X-ray rooms and modern kitchens.\n\nToday, St. Bernardine Medical Center is a 342-bed, nonprofit, acute care hospital with the latest technology and advanced services, from family care to cardiac surgery. As a nonprofit, any funds generated that exceed the expense of running the hospital go directly back into the community.\n\nSt. Bernardine Medical Center Foundation administers the funds, but the amount of services and programming the foundation supports far exceeds what the hospital generates. So the foundation is also supported by Dignity Health, government grants and community donations.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge underserved population that doesn\u2019t have health insurance and cannot pay for medical services,\u201d said Holly M. Valencia, the manager of foundation relations. \u201cEven with the Affordable Care Act, we still help a large number of people.\u201d\n\nMany of the foundation\u2019s clients are homeless or mentally ill. Clients are assigned a \u201cpatient navigator\u201d who helps them make it to appointments, find a stable place to live and locate family. It even provides shoes and clothing. The foundation partners with many other organizations to ensure many of a patient\u2019s needs are met.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond a medical necessity,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cWe care for people, not just their conditions. It\u2019s about not just looking at a disease or sickness. It\u2019s about looking at a person and knowing that they are mother or father, daughter or sister (or) child.\u201d\n\nBeyond providing medical care, the St. Bernardine Medical Center Foundation offers a large array of programming to benefit the community. Its Family Focus Center, run by hospital staff, offers children a safe place to go after school and serves up to 80 kids a day. The foundation also offers a Stepping Stones program, which provides teens and young adults a chance to volunteer in various areas of the hospital, opening up learning opportunities and educational growth.\n\nThe community can help support the foundation by attending events. Its next fundraiser, the annual Charity Golf Classic for St. Bernardine, will take place June 17 at Morongo Golf Club at Tukwet Canyon in Beaumont.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it is our mission as a hospital to care for those who are poor and disenfranchised not only medically but wholly,\u201d Valencia said.\n\nFor more information about St. Bernardine Medical Center Foundation, visit supportstbernardine.org or call 909-881-4516.\n\nThe Community Foundation\u2019s mission is to strengthen Inland Southern California through philanthropy.\n\nContact the writer: community@pe.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "REBECCA K.
