While some states running their own Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchanges are offering employee choice, this benefit had been delayed until 2015 for the 32 states relying on the federal government to run their SHOP exchanges.\n\nEarlier this month, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) gave state insurance commissioners the opportunity to request another year-long delay for employee choice, if they believed it would lead to significant price increases in the small-business insurance market. CMS announced Tuesday that 18 states were granted a delay until at least 2016.\n\nThe states granted the delay were Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.\n\nMeanwhile, 14 states using federally facilitated SHOP exchanges, including Arkansas Georgia, Florida and Indiana, will be instituting employee choice in 2015.\n\nA Closer Look at Employee Choice\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAside from the tax credits available to employers purchasing plans on the SHOP exchanges, the employee choice benefit was widely seen as one of the top reasons why small employers might use the SHOP exchange.\n\n\u201cEmployee choice is a critical element of the small business health insurance marketplaces. Small business owners want their employees to be able to choose among multiple insurance carriers when picking a health plan,\u201d said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer in a statement released by the group.\n\nArensmeyer added that delaying employee choice in some states puts businesses in those states at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting workers.\n\nThe 18 states delaying employee choice were asked to submit recommendation letters to the administration due June 2, 2014. Those letters, published on CMS\u2019s website, express a variety of concerns about the ways that employee choice would increase prices in the small-business insurance market.\n\n\u201c[E]nrollees with ongoing medical conditions or anticipated elective procedures will choose more expensive benefit plans while enrollees who do not anticipate such expenses will often choose lower premium, lesser benefit plans,\u201d wrote Louisiana Insurance Commissioner James J. Donelon, referring to an effect known as \u201cadverse selection.\u201d \u201cAs a result, issuers will anticipate higher medical costs, and thus will increase health insurance rates anywhere from 2%-7%, and postponement of such increased costs is desirable.\u201d\n\nWhile the anticipated price increases vary from state to state, an insurance industry spokesperson told FOXBusiness.com that some states could even see costs go up by 8% to 10% due to adverse selection.\n\nIn Oklahoma and a number of other states, insurance commissioners also suggested that the administrative complexity associated with employee choice would also lead to higher costs.\n\n\u201cEqually important is the level of consumer confusion the companies believe would be exacerbated with implementation of the model in 2015,\u201d added Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doak.\n\nSHOP Exchanges Not a Priority?\n\nSome experts say the employee choice delay reflects the administration\u2019s inability to get the SHOP exchanges fully up and running on-time.\n\n\u201cMy opinion is that it was delayed because [health-care reform] is complicated,\u201d said Tom Harte, a New Hampshire insurance broker and the president of the National Association of Health Underwriters. \u201cIt\u2019s evidence that trying to transform health insurance is more complicated than Congress ever expected.\u201d\n\nAt the National Federation of Independent Business, analyst Kevin Kuhlman said the many SHOP-related delays broadcast an important message to the small-business community.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mean from the administration in terms of the implementation and rollout? What it says is that clearly the SHOP exchanges are kind of an afterthought and small businesses are low on the priority list,\u201d said Kuhlman, the NFIB\u2019s manager of legislative affairs. \u201cThe emphasis is on the individual exchanges, and getting those up and running.\u201d\n\nThough some insurers expressed concerns about employee choice raising costs, Kuhlman said the NFIB was hopeful that giving employees the option to select their own plans would increase competition between insurers, thereby decreasing costs.\n\n\u201cWe never wanted this to totally disrupt or ruin any small group market, but the status quo isn\u2019t working either. We need to insert some innovation or additional choices in there -- this is one of the limited ways the health-care law did that,\u201d said Kuhlman. He added that without employee choice, he thinks the SHOP exchanges will likely remain unpopular with small employers.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/Small Business",
