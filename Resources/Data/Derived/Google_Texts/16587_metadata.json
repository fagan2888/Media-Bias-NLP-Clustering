Sabato has been forecasting elections and analyzing the results\u2014correctly predicting 98 percent of Senate, House and governor winners in, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012. Starting with this column, Sabato, a university professor of politics and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, joins Politico Magazine as a regular contributor. Twice a month, he\u2019ll be sharing his insights on how the 2014 midterm races are shaping up\u2014and the factors that really matter.\n\n***\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnother midterm election beckons, and over the next 10 months we\u2019ll see headlines about a thousand supposedly critical developments\u2014the \u201cgame changers\u201d and the \u201ctipping points.\u201d But we all know there aren\u2019t a thousand powerful drivers of the vote. I\u2019d argue that three factors are paramount: the president, the economy and the election playing field. And, at least preliminarily, those three factors seem to be pointing toward Republican gains in both houses in the 2014 midterms.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. The president. His job approval numbers are perhaps the best indicator of the public\u2019s overall political orientation at any given time, a kind of summary statistic that takes everything at the national level into account. In a large majority of cases, the president\u2019s party does poorly in midterms, especially the second midterm of a two-term administration. It\u2019s a rare president who doesn\u2019t make enough mistakes by his sixth year to generate a disproportionate turnout among his opponents\u2014thus producing a political correction at the polls. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower in 1958, Lyndon Johnson in 1966, Richard Nixon/Gerald Ford in 1974, Ronald Reagan in 1986 and George W. Bush in 2006 all experienced significant corrections in their sixth-year elections.\n\nStill, this doesn\u2019t always happen. Presidents Franklin Roosevelt in 1934 and Bush in 2002 managed to gain a few House seats, but this was in their first midterm. The Democrats lost no Senate seats and actually picked up a few in the House in 1998, President Bill Clinton\u2019s second midterm.\n\nPresident Barack Obama might take some heart from the Clinton example, but only up to a point. Like Clinton in 1994, Obama was unpopular enough by 2010 that Democrats lost the House in a landslide. That and partisan redistricting\u2014a tactic engaged in by both parties but currently tilted to the GOP\u2014reduces Republican chances for a House seat sweep in 2014 because there simply aren\u2019t many additional seats available for Republicans, barring a tidal wave of voter anger even larger than 2010.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s popularity has sagged badly in his fifth year. While some unforeseen event in 2014 might add some points to his job approval average, the odds are against a full restoration; it\u2019s just as likely Obama\u2019s polling average, currently in the low 40s, will decline further\u2014though Obama may have a relatively high floor because of consistent backing from minority voters and other elements of the Democratic base.\n\nAs 2014 begins, the environment for the Democrats in this election year is not good. The botched, chaotic rollout of the Affordable Care Act is the obvious cause, but it is broader than that: the typical sixth-year unease that produces a \u201csend-them-a-message\u201d election. Fortunately for Democrats, the GOP-initiated shutdown of the federal government in October has tempered the public\u2019s desire for a shift to the Republican side, too. \u201cNone of the above\u201d might win a few races in November if voters had the choice.\n\n2. The economy, but mainly if it\u2019s bad. Eisenhower\u2019s 57 percent approval rating couldn\u2019t prevent Republicans from losing 47 House seats and 13 Senate seats in 1958 because of a shaky economy. GDP growth had contracted by an astounding 10.4 percent in the first quarter of that year, though it rebounded later in the year. More recently, there was the 2006 election; while most analysts thought the Democratic takeover of Congress that year was mainly about Bush\u2019s war in Iraq, the economy wasn\u2019t performing on all cylinders. GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2006 was an anemic 1.6 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. The economy, still reeling from the 2008 economic near-collapse, was also the root cause of the Democrats\u2019 2010 debacle.\n\nMidterm Madness As a general rule, the president's party does poorly in midterm elections. Especially the second midterm of a two-term administration.\n\nBut in politics the converse does not always prove the rule; in fact, a good economy doesn\u2019t seem to help the president\u2019s party much in many midterm elections, with 1950, 1966 and 1986 being strong examples. So while economic hard times are likely to hit a president\u2019s party hardest, it may be that restless voters shift their concerns and unhappiness about a president to other topics in the absence of economic woes. So even if the economy continues to improve, Obama and the Democrats might not reap an electoral benefit.\n\n3. The electoral playing field. How many vulnerable seats are there in the House for the president\u2019s party? This is mainly a result of prior elections. A presidential victory with coattails (think 1936, 1948, 1964 and 2008) results in a party winning lots of vulnerable seats that can be swept away when the tides change in subsequent midterms. The Democrats lost their weaker members in 2010 and failed to add many seats in 2012; these disappointments protect them from drastic House losses this coming November.\n\nThe Senate is a different story. There is no such thing as a typical Senate election. These high-profile contests are idiosyncratic, driven by distinctive circumstances, sometimes quirky candidates and massive spending. A hidden determinant is the division of the Senate into three classes\u2014one-third is elected every two years, making the combination of competitive Senate seats unpredictable and ever shifting, unlike in the heavily gerrymandered House. One party is usually favored to gain seats from the outset, thanks to the pattern of retirements as well as the structure of the Senate class on the ballot.\n\nSo: How many Democratic Blue or Republican Red seats are there in an election year? How many incumbents are running, and did any senators holding seats in states favoring the opposite party step aside? How strong has the candidate recruitment been in both parties? Generally speaking, this year\u2019s Senate slate strongly favors the Republicans.\n\n***\n\nAt this early stage, the combination of these three factors suggests a good election year for the GOP. The president is a Democrat and his approval is weak. The economy may be improving, based on GDP growth ( 4.1 percent in the third quarter), but voters still don\u2019t believe their personal economy, at least, has picked up much. Instead, the major national issue of the moment is Obamacare, which at this point is a loser for Democrats. The structure of the election in the House and Senate also bends in the GOP direction.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "A definitive guide to the 2014 elections from our new columnist.", "title": "Republicans Really Could Win It All This Year", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/midterm-elections-republicans-really-could-win-2014-101802.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/06/140106_sabato_mcconnell_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republicans,2014 Elections,Midterm Elections,GOP,Politics", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "A definitive guide to the 2014 elections from our new columnist.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c49\"", "article_summary": "Eisenhower\u2019s 57 percent approval rating couldn\u2019t prevent Republicans from losing 47 House seats and 13 Senate seats in 1958 because of a shaky economy.\nIn a large majority of cases, the president\u2019s party does poorly in midterms, especially the second midterm of a two-term administration.\nTwice a month, he\u2019ll be sharing his insights on how the 2014 midterm races are shaping up\u2014and the factors that really matter.\nThere is no such thing as a typical Senate election.\nMidterm Madness As a general rule, the president's party does poorly in midterm elections."}
