Charleston County deputies responded to a home invasion on Baptist Hill Road in Hollywood Saturday afternoon around 12:35 p.m.

Officials report a deputy met the victim upon arrival in the driveway of the scene. The victim informed the deputy that three black males kicked in his front door and held him with four additional victims at gun point.

The victim stated one of the black males forced him outside to his vehicle at gun point, and demanded money.

According to the victim's report, he and the black male got into a struggle in which the victim was able to push away and escape running into the woods.

The victim told the deputy the black male fired a shot at him as he ran through the woods.

The victim reported he then ran into the parking lot of Baptist Hill High School, and another of the black males fired a shot at him as the victim crossed Baptist Hill Road.

The victim reported running behind a residence on Baptist Hill Road, where he saw the three subjects running down the road toward Toogoodoo Road.

According to officials, the deputy located a female victim in the high school parking lot. She reportedly told the deputy she had been asleep in her bedroom and was awakened by one of the black males, whom she stated was carrying a long gun.

The female victim claimed she was hit in the head multiple times and was forced into the living room with the other victims.

Criminal Investigation units and detective units were called to the scene.

While the units were en route, the deputy located one 7.62 shell casing in the parking lot, a report says.

All victims declined to be checked out by EMS, officials say.

This is a developing story.

Authorities say detectives have not identified or arrested any suspects in this investigation.
