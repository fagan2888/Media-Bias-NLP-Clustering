Ask when they've had a beer or two. For the coming election, WNIJ wanted to go beyond its usual in-depth coverage of the issues and candidates. So we invited Pushcart Prize-winning author Dan Libman to visit taverns and saloons in LaSalle County, an area served by our repeater station WNIW at 91.3 FM. Dan used his iPhone to interview imbibing patrons. The audio he brought back, and his essay below, reveal much about the mood of the electorate in Mendota and LaSalle-Peru.\n\nThe Economy is like the weather: Everyone talking about it, no one doing anything about it one way or the other. Or is that right? Unlike the weather we do have a bit of influence. During an election, we presumably get to nudge it slightly. The citizenry gets an opportunity to vote\u2014if we take advantage of it:\n\n\u201cThe economy is down for sure. As a bartender you can always tell.\u201d\n\nJackie mans the taps at the whimsically named RePhils on First Street near the Illinois river either in LaSalle, or Peru, but definitely in the area locally known as LaSalle-Peru. We were having a conversation on a recent Thursday evening. And we had plenty of time to talk, because even though her downtown establishment was filled with stools, beer and poker machines, it was not filled drinkers.\n\nShe continued, \u201cPeople don\u2019t have the money to go out or do anything any more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s affecting your business?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill that affect the way you vote in November?\u201d\n\nJackie had an easy, infectious laugh, and this idea struck her funny. She said, \u201cI probably won\u2019t vote because I don\u2019t trust any of them. They\u2019re full of lies. I\u2019m registered, I just won\u2019t vote for people I don\u2019t trust.\u201d\n\nI asked if she had voted in the last election?\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nRePhils had only two other customers, both friends of hers stopping by to say hello, and one of them wasn\u2019t even drinking. This was her barometer for a down economy, literally a bar-ometer. I also wondered if an empty saloon on a Thursday night was a harbinger of electoral mood, economic discontent, or just bad luck, so I caught up with NIU Political Science professor Matt Streb at Fatty\u2019s in DeKalb to ask.\n\n\u201cWe do have something in political science called retrospective voting,\u201d Matt explained. \u201cWhat retrospective voting says is that essentially it\u2019s really a referendum on the incumbent. And so if you are doing well or the economy is doing well you go and you vote and you say hey we\u2019re going to give the incumbent another term because we\u2019re happy. If we\u2019re not happy with the economy\u2014and this is an economic thing, it doesn\u2019t deal with anything else, it deals solely with economic issues\u2014if we\u2019re not happy, then we\u2019re going to throw the bums out and we\u2019re going to vote for the challenger.\u201d\n\nI like this idea of Retrospective Voting, but voter happiness turns out to be a pretty tough thing to gauge. I found a lot of discontent a little way up the road in Mendota, but not a whole lot of agreement on which \u2018bums to throw out.\u2019 Mendota\u2019s two bars on Main Street both had plenty of customers. Main Street Station Bar and Grill has a row of tables and a pretty extensive menu, including burgers and rib eye steaks, and according to a hand printed sign on the wall, every Tuesday tacos are served with an apostrophe S.\n\nAt the bar, just finishing dinner, I found Nancy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an independent,\u201d she told me. \u201cI voted for Republicans before but I\u2019ll never vote for another Republican as long as I live. They\u2019re idiots. Boehner is an idiot\u2014I like to call him John Boner.\u201d\n\nI asked her who her local congressman is and she paused before admitting, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSeparated from Nancy by one wall but political worlds apart I found Steve sitting at the bar next door, Cowboy and Tony\u2019s Butt Shack BBQ, having a beer over fried catfish and coleslaw.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m against gay marriage,\u201d he began as soon as I had my iPhone rolling. \u201cAnd abortions and stuff like that need to be stopped. Anything else conservative that you want to put in there,\u201d he laughed.\n\nI asked if the economy was at all on his radar or if he only concerned with social issues.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he said. \u201cMy thing is this: Once we as a nation get right with God, the money will fix itself. God will fix the money. I really believe that.\u201d\n\nThese to me seemed more like global concerns than local pocket book anxieties. I asked Matt Strebb which was more compelling to voters.\n\n\u201cI always ask my class this,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re going to say what is driving most people to the polls, is it your own individual personal situation, do I have a job, how are my stocks doing that type of thing, do you think that\u2019s what\u2019s drawing people to the polls and influencing people, or is it kind of the national economy as a whole. And I think most people would assume it\u2019s a pocket book voter, you know, I\u2019m not doing well, I\u2019m mad, and I want to vote the bums out. And it\u2019s not a perfect dichotomy but there is actual fairly significant percentage of the public that is voting based on an overall view of the national economy. They may not be blaming the president or their own congressman but they aren\u2019t happy if the economy as a whole isn\u2019t doing well.\u201d\n\nThis definitely squares with the feelings of Mark, whom I found having a cold one inside a corner bar in a working class neighborhood of LaSalle called Jake\u2019s Pour House. Mark was pretty sure he knew what he was going to hear leading up to November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to create more jobs,\u201d he recited. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you good paying jobs. I ain\u2019t seen it yet and I have not seen trickle down work yet. I\u2019m tired of the same old same old.\u201d\n\nBack in Mendota, my new drinking buddy Nancy shared this jaded outlook.\n\n\u201cLow wages, unemployment, our government, lazy government. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m retired,\u201d she added.\n\nMaybe not so much retrospective voting so much as invective voting? I checked with Matt Streb on this:\n\n\u201cLook, this fall you will see incumbents talking about the fact, we\u2019re\u2014especially Democrats\u2014we\u2019re moving out of the recession,\" he said. \"Things are going up, things are doing well, but it\u2019s never quite got over the hump yet and turned around. And I think you\u2019ll see Republicans try to exploit that.\u201d\n\nWe have one more major issue on the minds of the voters: I\u2019m very curious about the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare. Will it actually affect people\u2019s vote, or at this point is it just pundit chatter? To find out I\u2019m heading back out to the bars to have a beer and listen to voters. Remember, the first round is always on me.\n\n--Dan Libman\n\nPart three of \"Politics on Tap\" airs Monday, Sept. 8 during Morning Edition. Listen at 6:34 and 8:34.
