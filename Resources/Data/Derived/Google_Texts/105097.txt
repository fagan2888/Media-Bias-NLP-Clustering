Of the 9,000 or so individuals covered in Alaska by Premera, just under 5,400 were faced with losing their insurance before the reprieve, said Premera spokesman Eric Earling. Premera reenrolled them, though they could opt out by Dec. 31. Most likely will stick with their old plans, which generally should be less expensive than what's offered on the federally-run insurance marketplace unless the individual qualifies for a subsidy, Earling said. Some objected to requirements that new plans offer pediatric dental care and maternity care, even for a single man with no children, he said.
