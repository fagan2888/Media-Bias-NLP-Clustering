According to the city's Special Narcotics Prosecutor, D'Alessandro stole nearly 200,000 pills from the hospital between January 2009 and April 2014. He allegedly used his position to access the narcotics vault, made false entries in the hospital's inventory system and even filled out fraudulent prescriptions for his wife, ultimately obtaining a whopping 193,376 pills worth approximately $5.6 million on the black market.\n\nInvestigators say D'Alessandro's painkiller pilfering was caught by hospital administrators after Beth Israel's parent company merged with Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was suspended and then fired on April 29, 2014. \"This case underscores the vigilance required when addictive medication with a high resale value is readily available\u2014even to licensed professionals and trusted employees,\" Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said in a statement today. According to a statement from Mount Sinai spokesperson Sid Dinsay:\n\nWhen an anonymous complaint was received by the new administration at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Mount Sinai immediately conducted a comprehensive internal investigation and brought the results of our extensive investigation to the appropriate authorities. The individual was promptly suspended and then terminated. The administration of the Mount Sinai Health System and its hospitals have zero tolerance for theft and illegal activities and have been working closely with the district attorney's office throughout its investigation to assist in the prosecution.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Gothamist", "description": "He allegedly stole a whopping 193,376 pills from the hospital.", "title": "Ex-Beth Israel Pharmacy Director Allegedly Stole $5.6 Million In Oxycodone", "url": "http://gothamist.com/2014/07/08/a_former_pharmacy_director_at.php", "image": "http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2011/10/201110_pills-thumb-640xauto-668930.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He allegedly stole a whopping 193,376 pills from the hospital.", "title": "Ex-Beth Israel Pharmacy Director Allegedly Stole $5.6 Million In Oxycodone", "url": "http://gothamist.com/2014/07/08/a_former_pharmacy_director_at.php", "image": "http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2011/10/201110_pills-thumb-640xauto-668930.jpg", "site": "@gothamist", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 13927915491}, "vr": {"category": "news", "author": "Rebecca Fishbein"}, "taboola-recommend": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96fc\"", "article_summary": "Pills, pills, pills (Pete.Mac's flickr).\nA former pharmacy director at a prominent New York hospital was arrested and indicted on drug charges this week after authorities discovered he had allegedly stolen $5.6 million worth of oxycodone pills.\nAccording to a statement from Mount Sinai spokesperson Sid Dinsay:When an anonymous complaint was received by the new administration at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Mount Sinai immediately conducted a comprehensive internal investigation and brought the results of our extensive investigation to the appropriate authorities.\nInvestigators say D'Alessandro's painkiller pilfering was caught by hospital administrators after Beth Israel's parent company merged with Mount Sinai Medical Center.\nAccording to the city's Special Narcotics Prosecutor, D'Alessandro stole nearly 200,000 pills from the hospital between January 2009 and April 2014."}
