Health insurance mergers coming?

Posted: 11 am ET

The head honchos of health insurance are rumored to be on the prowl to snap up some competition.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Anthem Inc., the two largest U.S. health insurance companies by revenue, have been looking for ways to save money on costs associated with health care reform and have their eyes on mergers with smaller operations, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Anthem, which suffered a widespread data breach earlier this year, has been in talks with Cigna Corp. on a possible deal. UnitedHealth wants to buy Aetna Inc., while Aetna is said to be weighing its options for purchasing Humana Inc.

The insurers' takeover tango follows the hospital industry's own merger mania, which has been on the uptick in recent years. Buying smaller rivals affords health insurers more market share and leverage during rate negotiations with hospitals, the Journal reports.

What this means for you

While health insurers are finding creative ways to boost profits, they still have legal responsibilities to the states in which they operate, to the federal government and, of course, to consumers.

For example, Obamacare provisions protect consumers from dramatic increases in their annual health insurance premiums. Insurers who intend to mark up their rates by 10 percent or more must explain and submit their proposals to the federal or state government for review.

Additionally, insurance companies have to abide by the "80/20 rule," which requires them to spend at least 80 cents of every premium dollar on patient care. If they fail to meet that target, they must refund the difference to policyholders.

Several insurers are requesting double-digit percentage increases in their health insurance premiums for 2016. Find out how this may affect your wallet.
