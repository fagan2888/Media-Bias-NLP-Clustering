Around 10 a.m., when the meeting ended, Republicans had little good to say about the latest offers from the president and the Senate. Most of them avoided the cameras and returned to their offices. A handful of members spun out of the room and headed to the park on the west of the Capitol, just a couple hundred feet away.\n\nThey found sanctuary inside a small, triangle-shaped clearing blocked off by portable fences. Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks, two of the movement\u2019s oldest organizing forces, had asked activists to help \u201cfix up D.C.\u201d by filling in for the furloughed custodians of the national mall. Glenn Beck, who\u2019s been paid at least $1 million to work with FreedomWorks, had flown in to lead the clean-up. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, one of the capos of the \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d campaign, was his co-star. A hundred or so people gathered around the fences, snapping photos and listening to members of Congress update Lee and Beck.\n\nWashington was occupied all weekend by conservatives who insisted that the shutdown was an act of malice by President Obama.\n\n\u201cWe were told in conference that the president wants to use the Senate to break Republicans,\u201d Rep. Michele Bachmann told Lee. Lee explained that some silly Republicans were already willing to try to cut a deal with Obama\u2014\u201ctrust us this time.\u201d Beck sketched out his speech and smiled for photos with Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, who\u2019d come wearing jeans and a green trucker\u2019s hat that read, \u201cVOLUNTEER.\u201d None of them got any privacy to strategize until FreedomWorks\u2019 outreach director Deneen Borelli stepped up to a microphone to address the crowd, the noise drowning out everything else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cToday brings back great memories for me,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause four years ago FreedomWorks had the amazing march on D.C.\u20149/12. And that event drew over 800,000 freedom-loving Americans. Because of that rally I was launched as a national figure to stand for liberty.\u201d\n\nAnyone not at this rally would have been confused. Was Borelli, the author of Blacklash: How Obama and the Left Are Driving Americans to the Government Plantation, a \u201cnational figure?\u201d Was it the best idea to invoke the heyday of the Tea Party, when scores more people could have flooded the space around the Capitol? Two weeks into the shutdown, Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s \u201cgrassroots tsunami\u201d to defund Obamacare hasn\u2019t materialized. Polling suggests that the Republican position is waning from week to week.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nThe activists simply don\u2019t believe it. Washington was occupied all weekend by conservatives who insisted that the shutdown was an act of malice by President Obama, exemplified by the closure of national monuments. \u201cTruckers for the Constitution,\u201d a group of conspiracy theorists who occasionally appear on Fox News, won a mind-blowing amount of media attention for an attempt to \u201cshut down the Beltway\u201d with their several-dozen trucks. The Values Voter Summit, an annual meeting of social conservatives, made light of the shutdown by putting barricades on its stage\u2014a reminder of the haphazardly enforced gates in front of monuments on the National Mall. The Washington Examiner, a magazine that recently reduced its local reporting staff to focus on politics, told readers that an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showing the GOP badly losing was skewed toward government workers. That made it \u201call but useless as support for strategic decisions by anybody involved in the shutdown debate,\u201d but \u201cperfectly consistent with the conventional wisdom of the traditional media.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen much public reaction except people criticizing the administration,\u201d said Regis Campbell, a Maryland activist who\u2019d bought two rakes to the clean-up rally. \u201cSure, the polls do say people blame Republicans, but I don\u2019t know\u2014I think when push comes to shove, people will realize where the blame really lies. All [Obama] has to do is come down with an executive order to stop the mandate, OK? Then we could give him a clean CR.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating,\u201d said Pat Jakowski, a Maryland physical therapist who brought a garbage-picking wand to the Saturday rally. \u201cIf you really look at the demographics of the polls, you can see how easily they skew them. It\u2019s another misleading source of information. The intelligent people who really pay attention to information can\u2019t count on that.\u201d\n\nBeck\u2019s speech tested the theory. The former Fox News host, who now runs a subscription-based online news channel, regaled the crowd with the story of anti-slavery Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner. \u201cHe was, I think, the Ted Cruz or Mike Lee or Rand Paul of his day,\u201d said Beck. \u201cThe most hated Whig! He was the guy who was kind of really leading the Whig Party. There were only 20 of them, but they were tired of the lies. They knew the Whig Party was playing around with slavery, but it was time for slavery to end.\u201d\n\nSumner, according to Beck, was hated because he proved how phony the rest of his party was when it pretended to oppose a law, and that his Whigs needed to be replaced by a new, honest party. \u201cWhen Charles Sumner was on the floor of the Senate, a guy came from the House of Representatives came in with a big cane and beat him almost to death. Almost killed him! Nobody helped him\u2014the only reason he survived was that he was able to drag himself underneath his desk. It took him two years to heal. They never prosecuted the guy with the cane, because he was popular. He was in a special, protected class!\u201d\n\nBeck got the caning right, but basically nothing else. By 1856, when Sumner was caned, the senator was already aligned with the new Republicans. Rep. Preston Brooks\u2014the congressman who delivered the caning\u2014was a Southern Democrat, not an angry Whig punishing Sumner for making the party look bad. He resigned after a failed vote to expel him from Congress, and he was fined $300\u2014not the punishment he deserved, obviously, but a fluke of his support from the South, not a protection racket by the elites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDetails, details\u2014Beck\u2019s tailored history was much more inspiring than the truth. After he wrapped, the conservatives fanned out to clean the mall, dozens followed behind Beck to watch him work, share their stories, or join him in picking up a few cigarette butts and tossing them in garbage bags. After a few blocks, Beck reached one of the useless gates, warning passersby that the mall was closed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to flagrantly defy the law!\u201d laughed a cameraman.\n\nBeck cartoonishly \u201csneaked\u201d around the fence in the manner of Bugs Bunny coming up behind Elmer Fudd. His reward on the other side: A garbage can where one of the \u201cDO NOT ENTER\u201d signs had been junked. \u201cThat\u2019s too good,\u201d said Beck. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep that for the museum.\u201d\n\nThe clean-up went on for hours. If you stood anywhere on the mall between the Capitol and the World War II Memorial, you\u2019d see a conservative activist, or two or three, hunting for garbage on wet grass. It wasn\u2019t cynical for them. The media was cynical. The Republicans who trusted the media was cynical. When Beck wrapped up at the World War II Memorial (\u201chumbling to meet our veterans\u201d), he zoomed up Connecticut Avenue to the Values Voter Summit. \u201cYou're on the verge of winning,\u201d he told conservatives and C-Span cameras. \u201cIt's going to happen quickly if you don't compromise your values\u2014if you stay the course.\u201d\n\nAfter Beck left, I stuck around the summit for some conversation and a couple of closing breakout sessions. With the cameras off, the optimism about defunding Obamacare this year faded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cJohn Boehner\u2019s primary fear is the media,\u201d said Terry Jeffrey, a conservative journalist who now edits the Media Research Center\u2019s news arm. \u201cHe doesn't believe he can win with a conservative message in media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe inside game has failed,\u201d said Dean Clancy, vice president for policy at FreedomWorks. If Republicans couldn\u2019t be trusted to fight, conservatives needed to get 34 states to launch a new constitutional convention and undo the damage of the Progressive era. \u201cWe ought to look at the other way of amending the Constitution, and that\u2019s the Article V process. I think Mark Levin is right. I think George Mason and the founders put that in there for a reason. It\u2019s an \u2018in case of emergency, break glass\u2019 provision.\u201d\n\nJeffrey agreed with that. \u201cWe are going to have to engage in organized, peaceful disobedience,\u201d he said. On Sunday, the conservative movement did just that. Lee returned to the mall alongside Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, and hundreds of activists who swore to \u201cstorm\u201d the World War II memorial and liberate it from the \u201cBarrycades.\u201d Activists picked up the hated gates and dumped them as close as they could get to the White House, a few blocks away.\n\n\u201cThis belongs to you!\u201d thundered Lee at the memorial. \u201cThis does not belong to the government\u2014this belongs to the people!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this any way that a commander-in-chief would show his respect, his gratitude, for our military?\u201d asked Palin.",
