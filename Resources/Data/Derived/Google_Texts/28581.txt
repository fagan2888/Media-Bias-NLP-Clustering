Gov.-elect Tom Wolf has tapped former Department of Public Welfare Secretary Estelle Richman to serve as his transition team advisor on Medicaid issues.

Wolf said he will expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act for some 600,000 Pennsylvanians upon taking office on Jan. 20.

"Secretary Richman's experience and expertise will be crucial to moving toward full Medicaid expansion, which is both the right thing to do for thousands of Pennsylvanians and their families and the right thing to do for the economy," Wolf said in a statement.

Gov. Corbett is pursuing a private coverage option for the newly Medicaid eligible that is set to begin Jan. 1.

Richman, a career public servant and expert in social services and health issues, was the managing director for the City of Philadelphia before being named the top welfare official in Gov. Ed Rendell's administration in 2003. She most recently served as chief operating officer of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
