Last week, Senator John Cornyn (R., Texas) grilled Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary, about why the 45,000 \u201cnavigators\u201d who assist people in signing up for Obamacare aren\u2019t required to undergo a criminal-background check, even though they handle sensitive personal information.\n\n\u201cSo a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual unbeknownst to them?\u201d Cornyn asked her. \u201cThat is possible,\u201d said Sebelius, noting that states could always impose their own requirements \u2014 as some have done.\n\nThe risk that unscrupulous or untrustworthy people could hold federally funded jobs or own guns certainly concerns the Obama administration in other contexts. The Office of Personnel Management conducts more than 2 million background checks a year for federal jobs. The FBI conducted just shy of 20 million background checks on gun owners in 2012.\n\nIn 2009, Robert Groves, President Obama\u2019s handpicked director of the U.S. Census Bureau, announced that every one of the 1.2 million to 1.4 million people he would hire for the next year\u2019s national head count would be investigated and fingerprinted \u2014 and felons wouldn\u2019t be hired. \u201cThe goal is to ensure the public is protected,\u201d the bureau announced at the time.\n\nSo given all of the background checks at the federal level, why not include the Obamacare navigators?\n\nMichael Astrue, who served as commissioner of Social Security until earlier this year, and Scott Gottlieb, physician and resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, warned in the Wall Street Journal in September about the security risks presented by the navigators:\n\nThe Obama administration created unnecessary opportunities for fraud with the White House\u2019s pork-minded insistence on funding favored community groups to employ \u201cnavigators\u201d to solicit applicants and help them input their personal information, such as income and Social Security numbers. The navigators were hastily hired and trained (they are still being hired) and were not given extensive background checks. The personal data for millions of people will be entrusted to these navigators \u2014 and to a computerized system that has been rushed into operation.\n\nAstrue and Gottlieb cautioned against the possibility of identity theft. That is not idle speculation. Remember ACORN, the fraud-laced \u201ccommunity organizing\u201d group that once boasted Barack Obama had served as its lawyer and as one of its key trainers? ACORN finally went bankrupt in 2010 after dozens of its employees were convicted of voter-registration fraud and others showed up in undercover tapes offering advice on how to set up brothels and evade paying taxes. Investor\u2019s Business Daily has reported that United Labor Unions Local 100, a New Orleans group run by ACORN founder Wade Rathke, announced on its Facebook page that it\u2019s going \u201cto do mass enrollment and help navigate people into the marketplaces In Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas under the Affordable Care Act!\u201d\n\nMany of the groups that have divvied up the $67 million in federal money available for hiring navigators say that they can\u2019t afford the background checks some states are requiring. They note that the 20 hours of training each navigator receives includes warnings about the penalties for misuse of personal data. Amanda Ptashkin, outreach director for Georgians for a Healthy Future, complains that Georgia requires \u201ca time-consuming process\u201d that includes an affidavit of citizenship, a $50 fee, fingerprinting, and a background check. But the navigator jobs pay up to $48 per hour \u2014 exceptionally good money in a soft job market \u2014 and the burdens aren\u2019t different from those that many private-sector applicants face.\n\nBut even these basic requirements will change if many of the civil-rights and advocacy groups involved in the navigators\u2019 patronage trough have their way. There is an active campaign on the left to \u201cban the box,\u201d or remove the checkbox question that\u2019s common on job applications: \u201cHave you ever been convicted of a felony?\u201d\n\nLast month, California governor Jerry Brown signed a law banning public employers from asking about criminal records until the employer has established the applicant\u2019s \u201cminimum qualifications.\u201d The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a \u201cguidance\u201d last year saying that employers must establish that an inquiry into an applicant\u2019s criminal record is a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d before they can make the inquiry. Otherwise, the employer could face employment-discrimination lawsuits under the theory that such background checks have a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d on African Americans and Hispanics and are therefore unfair. The EEOC\u2019s guidance also effectively requires that employers signal to job applicants that they were screened out of the job-applicant pool because of their criminal records, making the odds of a lawsuit against them dramatically higher.\n\nEven worse, the EEOC has pursued employers that have a clear \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d interest in the integrity of their employees, such as G4S Secure Solutions Pennsylvania, a firm that provides security guards for nuclear power plants and other sensitive sites. The EEOC went after the security firm for not hiring an individual convicted twice of burglary. G4S thought it was merely being prudent: Pennsylvania law forbids the hiring of individuals as security guards if they have felony convictions.\n\nThe Obama administration is clearly moving away from its prior support for background checks, at least when its politically correct allies find such checks offensive. But I am certain that most Americans would be angry to learn that the kind of vigorous background checks census workers underwent just three years ago have been abandoned in the case of Obamacare navigators.
