The historic Main Street firehouse in Rapid City is still serving a purpose in the community 100 years after it opened, if not for what it was originally intended.



The station served as the headquarters for the Rapid City Fire Department for 60 years. But the department outgrew the building, moving to a new headquarters several blocks down Main Street.



The building is now being used as a restaurant, brewery and playhouse. Building owner Bob Fuchs opened Rapid City's first microbrewery in the old firehouse in 1991.



A centennial celebration for the building that is now home to The Firehouse Brewing Co. has been scheduled for Saturday.
