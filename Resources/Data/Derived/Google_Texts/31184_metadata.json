Curry connected inside and out - sometimes way out - to help the Warriors pull away, and James and the Cavs had no way to counter.\n\nThe Warriors will try to win their first title since 1975 on Tuesday night in Cleveland, which hasn\u2019t won a major sports championship in 51 years. Game 7, if necessary, would be in Oakland on Friday night.\n\nJames carried Cleveland as far as he could. The four-time MVP had 40 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists, slowing down the pace the way only he can.\n\nJames made 15 of 34 shots in 44 minutes.\n\nThere were 20 lead changes and 10 ties in a game that featured nearly as many bruises as baskets - but few big men - and the league\u2019s two biggest attractions trading thrilling scores.\n\nJames made a 34-footer with the shot clock about to expire midway through the fourth, and Curry answered with a step-back 3-pointer. Klay Thompson, who scored 12 points, followed with another from deep shot for the Warriors.\n\nAndre Iguodala later hit a 3 and then grabbed a rebound, tossing in a left-handed put back while getting fouled by Tristan Thompson. Iguodala strutted back to midcourt, staring at the announced crowd of 19,596 - just about all of them on their feet through the fourth - before missing the free throw.\n\nCurry added a cutting layup, then lost Matthew Dellavedova off the dribble and stepped back for a 3 that gave Golden State a 96-86 lead with 2:44 left.\n\nJames hit a 3-pointer, and the Cavs began fouling Iguodala - a sub-par free throw shooter - to try and extend possessions. But Curry never let the game get out of his hands, connecting on another 3-pointer with 1:12 left that had him pounding his chest and pointing to the sky.\n\nThe game followed a familiar formula.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr stuck with the small-ball lineup he used to win Game 4, starting swingman Andre Iguodala over center Andrew Bogut. Cavs coach David Blatt replaced 7-footer Timofey Mozgov with guard J.R. Smith - sliding James to center - after Cleveland fell behind 8-2 in the opening minutes.\n\nBoth teams lacked size. Neither lacked fight.\n\nSmith made four of his first seven 3-pointers before going cold, but landed his biggest shot when he extended his right forearm and shoulder to plow through Draymond Green\u2019s screen, knocking the Warriors forward to the ground. Officials called a flagrant 1 foul on Smith after a review.\n\nDellavedova dragged Green down going for a rebound in the second quarter, and the officials assessed double fouls after the players got tangled up on the floor. James Jones also grabbed Iguodala with two arms from behind on a layup attempt, which the Warriors argued should\u2019ve been a flagrant foul.\n\nThe physical first half ended with Harrison Barnes putting back Curry\u2019s miss for a dunk over James to start a three-point play that put the Warriors up 51-50. James scored or assisted on 16 of Cleveland\u2019s 17 field goals in the half.\n\nJames struggled to supply the same power in the third quarter, scoring just four points and handing out one assists.
