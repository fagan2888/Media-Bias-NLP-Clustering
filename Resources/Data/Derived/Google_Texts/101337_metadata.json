Definitive causes of death have not yet been determined.\n\nAccording to a report in the Daily News, Jeffrey Russ, 23, of Rochester, was rushed to Harlem Hospital at 3:10 a.m. Saturday but could not be saved.\n\nRuss posted a photo from the festival on Twitter at 8:43 p.m. Friday, hours before he died.
