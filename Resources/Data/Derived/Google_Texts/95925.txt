BERLIN (AP) — The Berlin Wall fell 25 years ago on Sunday, a key event in the collapse of communism and the preface to Germany’s reunification in 1990.

The anniversary is being celebrated in Berlin with concerts, speeches and the release in the evening of thousands of balloons illuminating a 15-kilometer (nine-mile) stretch of the former Cold War barrier.

Here are five things to know about the Berlin Wall:

PROTECTION AGAINST ‘FASCISM’

At 1 a.m. on Aug. 13, 1961, East Germany sealed off the border between the Soviet-controlled eastern sector of Berlin and the western sectors controlled by the Allies.

Over the following weeks, workers erected a 155-kilometer (96-mile) barrier encircling West Berlin. The Wall itself — up to 3.6 meters (12 feet) high — was merely the outermost part of a heavily fortified strip that variously included barbed wire, metal fences, guard towers, hidden alarms and dog walkways.

Communist leader Walter Ulbricht called it an “anti-fascist protective wall,” though in reality its purpose was to stop the flood of people leaving for the West.

GREAT ESCAPES

Despite the formidable obstacle and threat of stiff punishment if caught, thousands of people tried to escape by tunneling under, swimming past, climbing or flying over the wall.

Many took advantage of Berlin’s extensive sewer and subway network. Others used fake passports made out to West Germans, who were allowed to visit East Berlin.

Some dug their own tunnels, often with help from people on the other side. In one case, an entire family escaped using a home-made cable car.

WALL OF DEATH

At least 136 people, including several children, lost their lives along the Cold War barrier, according to the Potsdam Center for Historical Research.
