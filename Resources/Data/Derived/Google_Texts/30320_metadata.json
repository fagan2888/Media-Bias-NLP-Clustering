After resuming the search in daylight, the wreckage was discovered.\n\n\"The wreckage was scattered over a couple hundred yards. They crashed into a wooded area. It would have been really hard to spot from the air, because it was in small pieces,\" said Glenn Wheeler, with Tri-County Search and Rescue.\n\nIvan Williams notified air traffic control the plane was experiencing problems and the plane lost altitude while traveling at about 170 miles per hour.\n\n\"Just shocked everybody. [It's] a bad deal,\" said Roy Hamill.\n\nHamill owns a trucking business next-door to the Williams Construction company, and has known Ivan Williams for decades.\n\n\"He was just honest, kind, just a good fellow, just the kind of fellow you could sit down with, shake hands and do anything, you know?\" Hamill said.\n\nThe Williamses are being remembered as wonderful people, filled with kindness and generosity. It's why Pryor Mayor Jimmy Tramel fought back tears when talking about the loss.\n\n\"What Ivan and his family have given this community, the vision he's had for this community--you look at it, it's amazing,\" Tramel said.\n\nIvan and Adina Williams supported a number of non-profit groups and charities. Tramel said they cared deeply about others and the community.\n\n\"He was always there, greet you with a handshake, greet you with a smile. When you saw Adina, same way,\" Tramel said.\n\nLight rain was falling when the plane crashed. Investigators will determine if it was a factor.\n\nAccording to a public aircraft tracking site called Flight Aware, in the last few minutes before the crash, the plane's altitude dropped nearly 1,500 feet.\n\n\"We've lost a great person, him and his wife, to this community,\" Tramel said.\n\nAmong countless acts of generosity, the Williams family donated property for a city park in Pryor. Mayor Trammel said Ivan Williams was also instrumental in getting a recreation center built in Pryor.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "Ivan and Adina Williams were killed when their plane went down in a rainstorm Monday afternoon.", "author": "Craig Day, NewsOn6.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/23757092/pryor-business-owner-and-wife-lost-when-plane-crashes-in-arkansas", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23757092_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ivan and Adina Williams were killed when their plane went down in a rainstorm Monday afternoon.", "title": "Pryor Business Owner And Wife Lost When Plane Crashes In Arkansas"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23757092_SA.jpg", "description": "Ivan and Adina Williams were killed when their plane went down in a rainstorm Monday afternoon.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pryor Business Owner And Wife Lost When Plane Crashes In Arkansas"}, "wnreadableurl": "pryor-business-owner-and-wife-lost-when-plane-crashes-in-arkansas", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2013/10/22", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3dc\"", "article_summary": "Hamill owns a trucking business next-door to the Williams Construction company, and has known Ivan Williams for decades.\nIvan Williams III and wife Adina died when their single-engine Piper aircraft crashed Monday afternoon.\nIvan Williams is the CEO of Williams Construction in Pryor.\nIvan Williams notified air traffic control the plane was experiencing problems and the plane lost altitude while traveling at about 170 miles per hour.\nA Pryor business owner and his wife were killed in a plane crash in rural Arkansas."}
