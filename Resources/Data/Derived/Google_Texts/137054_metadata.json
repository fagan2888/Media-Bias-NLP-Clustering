It\u2019s a standard strategy for a frontrunner in a primary campaign to try to create a sense of inevitability. But few candidates have ever done it with the grandiosity of Trump.\n\nHe repeatedly claimed that he has been contacted by \u201cthe biggest people in politics\u201d in recent weeks, all seeking to align with him in advance of his securing the nomination. He even suggested that Republican politicians who say in television interviews that \u201cTrump must be stopped\u201d are actually calling him privately to express a desire to come together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing from virtually everybody in the Republican Party, and they\u2019re congratulating me and they\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to get together,\u201d he said during the nearly hour-long press conference, which was carried live by CNN. \u201cThey want to embrace it. Look, these are not stupid people.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cit\u201d they want to embrace, Trump explained repeatedly, is the alleged movement of \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of voters into the Republican Party because of his candidacy.\n\nRelated: 5 Times Donald Trump Condoned Violence at His Rallies\n\nTrump was asked about the final Republican National Committee-sanctioned debate of the cycle, set for March 21 in Salt Lake City, and appeared genuinely unaware that it was even on the schedule.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a next debate. No? They have yet another?\u201d he asked the reporter.\n\nHe repeated his claim that the television networks are reaping a \u201cratings bonanza\u201d from the debates and ought to be giving the money to veterans\u2019 charities. Then he said, \u201cNo, to be honest with you I think it\u2019s time to end the debates.\u201d\n\nThe Trump press conference came after the Carson endorsement, which struck many observers as odd, given the vitriol Trump spewed at the retired surgeon on the campaign trail. He repeatedly questioned Carson\u2019s mental stability and even repeatedly compared him to a \u201cchild molester.\u201d\n\nHowever, Carson said that he and Trump had \u201cburied the hatchet\u201d and said that he wanted to support his former opponent against \u201cpolitical operatives and parties trying to thwart the will of the people.\u201d\n\nRelated: 20 Picks for Trump's Vice President\n\nHe repeatedly spoke of Trump as someone who could \u201ccomfort\u201d the nation and defeat what he called \u201cagents of division\u201d \u2013 a puzzling contention, at best, given the recent events at Trump rallies.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s success in last Tuesday\u2019s primaries, the states that vote on March 15 now loom particularly large. Florida and Ohio, both winner-take-all states, will deliver 165 delegates all by themselves. Other states will deliver more than 200 additional delegates.\n\nRight now, Trump is only talking like he\u2019s the presumptive nominee. In less than a week, he could actually be the presumptive nominee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After a 12th Republican debate on Thursday night in which his opponents noticeably backed off in their attacks on him, Donald Trump on Friday morning collected the endorsement of his one-time challenger, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and began an effort to consolidate the Republican Party behind him.", "title": "Trump Moves to Take Control of the Republican Party", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/11/Trump-Moves-Take-Control-Republican-Party", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/11/Trump-Moves-Take-Control-Republican-Party", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After a 12th Republican debate on Thursday night in which his opponents noticeably backed off in their attacks on him, Donald Trump on Friday morning collected the endorsement of his one-time challenger, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and began an effort to consolidate the Republican Party behind him.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Declaring that, \u201cthe Republican Party has lost its way,\u201d he promised to lead the GOP \u201cto victory like the Republican Party has never had before.\u201d He went so far as to suggest that the party ought to cancel the final scheduled candidates\u2019 debate.\nLook, these are not stupid people.\u201dThe \u201cit\u201d they want to embrace, Trump explained repeatedly, is the alleged movement of \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of voters into the Republican Party because of his candidacy.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing from virtually everybody in the Republican Party, and they\u2019re congratulating me and they\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to get together,\u201d he said during the nearly hour-long press conference, which was carried live by CNN.\nRight now, Trump is only talking like he\u2019s the presumptive nominee.\nIn less than a week, he could actually be the presumptive nominee."}
