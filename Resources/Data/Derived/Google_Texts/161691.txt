More than 200 turkeys were donated to the Bayonne Economic Opportunity Foundation by Freeholder-elect Ken Kopacz in time for Thanksgiving, according to Bayonne city officials.

“It was really nice to kick off the holiday season giving to people (who are) less fortunate,” Kopacz, who is also the chairman of the BEOF, told The Jersey Journal yesterday.

Kopacz, principal at Washington Community School in Bayonne, added that the Bayonne High School baseball team helped package the turkeys before they were delivered to families.

The BEOF, which also received donations last week from Bayonne Councilman at large Juan Perez, distributes turkeys every Thanksgiving to people in need.

Bayonne city spokesman Joe Ryan said the BEOF received more than 600 requests for turkeys this year.

After defeating Republican candidate Michael Alonso earlier this month by winning nearly 80 percent of the vote, Kopacz will represent Bayonne and portions of Jersey City.
