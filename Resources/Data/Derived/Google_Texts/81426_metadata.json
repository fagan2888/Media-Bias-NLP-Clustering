After nearly 10 hours, the standoff ended with the suspect nowhere to be found.\n\nOfficers were called around 2:30 a.m. to the report of someone firing shots at people at a party near East 8th and Duncan streets. Officers arrived on scene, also hearing gunshots as well as loud music, and set up a perimeter around the home.\n\nNewton Police Chief Eric said five people were inside the home when shots were fired.\n\nSeveral homes in the immediate area were evacuated as officers attempted to make contact with the man inside the home. Murphy said contact was made at times, but the man would not communicate with authorities.\n\nAfter several hours, emergency response teams made entry into the home but did not locate the suspect. No one was seriously hurt.\n\nMurphy said the 32-year-old man is known to Newton police.\n\n\"We hear people down there yelling and cussing and then we heard two gun shots,\" said John McMonigle.\n\nMcMonical says he heard the disturbance around 2:30 a.m. \"I've been seeing officers in swat uniforms, walking back and forth, getting people out of their houses,\" he added.\n\nResidents say their neighborhood is quiet and this incident is concerning.\n\n\"I don't like it...nobody does,\" said Cindy Combs, \"its been a very quiet neighborhood. It's one of the things that I liked the most about Newton and my neighborhood is that it is very quiet.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Officers were called around 2:30 a.m. Sunday to the report of shots fired near East 8th and Duncan streets.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "Officers were called around 2:30 a.m. Sunday to the report of shots fired near East 8th and Duncan streets.", "title": "UPDATE: Police search for suspect following standoff in Newton", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Possible-standoff-in-Newton-375987451.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/79B/1D7/79B1D7D8E12C42E29BA9519B44353D19", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0BD/950/0BD950CBEDE94EAC8ABDEF28E88BA38C.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Officers were called around 2:30 a.m. Sunday to the report of shots fired near East 8th and Duncan streets.", "title": "UPDATE: Police search for suspect following standoff in Newton", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Possible-standoff-in-Newton-375987451.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/newton+standoff1.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Police search for suspect following standoff in Newton", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Police search for suspect"}, "article_summary": "A report of shots fired early Sunday morning led to a standoff in Newton.\n\"I don't like it...nobody does,\" said Cindy Combs, \"its been a very quiet neighborhood.\nSeveral homes in the immediate area were evacuated as officers attempted to make contact with the man inside the home.\nAfter nearly 10 hours, the standoff ended with the suspect nowhere to be found.\nIt's one of the things that I liked the most about Newton and my neighborhood is that it is very quiet.\""}
