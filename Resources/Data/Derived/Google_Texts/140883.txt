A Jersey City man has been charged with supplying the gun that was used in the shooting of three people — including the accused gunman — on a PATH train in Jersey City on Aug. 25.

Julio J. Mella, 28, was arrested Thursday by Port Authority police working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Jersey City police, Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo said.

He has been charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, improper transportation of a firearm, improper disposition of a firearm. Mella’s bail was set at $40,000, Pentangelo said.

Authorities say Mella transported a Glock-19 handgun from Newport News, Va., to New Jersey with the intent to sell it to Tari Turpin, the East Orange man who has been charged in the shooting.

A woman on the train told police that she asked Turpin not to lean on her while he slept on the train, police said. Turpin apparently became upset at the request and began firing, striking the woman, her brother and himself as the train pulled into the Newport station in Jersey City, police said.
