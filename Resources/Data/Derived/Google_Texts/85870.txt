We are digging deeper into a deadly crash on Alligator Alley that killed an 8-year-old boy.

“Even though you don't know anybody you still feel bad for the family,” Ken Pisel, who was driving in the second car said.

Pisel was driving with his wife when the SUV driving behind him overcorrected and eventually slammed into the jeep he was towing.

Six people were inside the SUV, including 8-year-old Andres Naranjo.

“At the point of impact I looked in the mirror and see that he's coming off of something over there. And then it just started rolling,” Pisel said.

Andres was killed at the scene. His 11-year-old brother was seriously hurt, but his family told us he is expected to survive.

“I think it's just a terrible tragedy. Obviously nobody wins,” Chris Adams, a driver said.

According to the accident report, it’s not known if either child was wearing a seat belt. Experts said not restraining children is a common mistake.

“Everything in the car that is not restrained becomes a moving object,” Richard Uber, an instructor at Ault’s Driving School said.

Troopers said the other teenagers and adults in the car were wearing seat belts and were not seriously hurt.

We did some digging and found 33% of children who died in crashes in 2011 were not wearing seat belts.
