(AP) - The makers of TV\u2019s \u201cSherlock\u201d say even a lobbying effort by British Prime Minister David Cameron wouldn\u2019t persuade them to produce more episodes each season.\n\nBut \u201cSherlock\u201d co-creator Steven Moffat and producer Sue Vertue tweaked Cameron anyway for lack of effort. It\u2019s been more than a month, they noted, since he visited China and was asked by fans there to press for more of the popular mystery series.\n\nHe praised the drama and told Chinese viewers who submitted the request to him online that he would try. But Cameron has yet to contact them, Vertue said this week.\n\nA droll Moffat added: \u201cDavid Cameron, calling you on that, mate. \u2026 All of China, they\u2019re waiting.\u201d\n\nThe British-produced modern take on Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s fictional detective has been a worldwide hit. It made its third season U.S. debut last Sunday on PBS, with husband-and-wife team Moffat and Vertue and star Benedict Cumberbatch on hand to promote it.\n\nFans have to make do with just a handful of episodes - three this season - as the show\u2019s in-demand makers and cast, including Martin Freeman and newcomer (and Freeman\u2019s real-life partner) Amanda Abbington, see to other projects. That includes the \u201cDoctor Who\u201d series for Moffat, \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d franchise for Freeman and a string of films for Cumberbatch.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a waste of time, sorry, China,\u201d Moffat replied when asked if \u201cSherlock\u201d might be expanded to more episodes. The nine that have aired since 2010 are the equivalent of cranking out nine movies, he and Vertue said.\n\nBut why apologize to the Chinese and not devotees elsewhere?\n\n\u201cWell, China were the ones who went to the top and asked,\u201d Moffat said.\n\nHe and Cumberbatch, who said he appreciated the fervor of fans, agreed they are committed to keeping \u201cSherlock\u201d going indefinitely.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org /", "article_metadata": {"description": "The makers of TV's \"Sherlock\" say even a lobbying effort by British Prime Minister David Cameron wouldn't persuade them to produce more episodes each season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The makers of TV\u2019s \u201cSherlock\u201d say even a lobbying effort by British Prime Minister David Cameron wouldn\u2019t persuade them to produce more episodes each season.", "title": "\u2018Sherlock\u2019 makers sticking to abbreviated seasons", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/22/sherlock-makers-sticking-to-abbreviated-seasons/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/22/5dfbf8001bf2a503490f6a7067007f75.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/22/5dfbf8001bf2a503490f6a7067007f75.jpg", "description": "The makers of TV's \"Sherlock\" say even a lobbying effort by British Prime Minister David Cameron wouldn't persuade them to produce more episodes each season.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Sherlock\u2019 makers sticking to abbreviated seasons"}, "Author": "LYNN ELBER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Steven Moffat, China, Sue Vertue, David Cameron"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc8b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNo, it\u2019s a waste of time, sorry, China,\u201d Moffat replied when asked if \u201cSherlock\u201d might be expanded to more episodes.\nBut \u201cSherlock\u201d co-creator Steven Moffat and producer Sue Vertue tweaked Cameron anyway for lack of effort.\nPASADENA, Calif.
