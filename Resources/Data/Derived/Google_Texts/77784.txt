Fresh off the heels of Zach Galifianakis‘ “Between Two Ferns,” Funny or Die is once again helping the president in final stretch of Obamacare enrollment

If you want to connect with young people, you have to speak their language: Niche pop culture references served up by lovable character actors.

Such has been the mission of President Obama and his brigade of media advisers over the last month, as they’ve sought to sign up the so-called “young invincibles” for health insurance in an all-out final stretch to make the enrollment targets set out for the Affordable Care Act.

It began with an appearance by the president himself on Zach Galifianakis‘ “Between Two Ferns” faux talk show on Funny or Die — which raised traffic to the Obamacare website by 40 percent — and has shifted back to Adam McKay and Will Ferrell‘s comedy hub for a new video starring Adam Scott… in his very douchey character from the 2008 film “Step Brothers.”

Playing “Derek Huff” (not to be confused with DWTS’ Derek Hough) and bro’ing out with Mark Cuban, Scott explains just how “lame” health insurance is — a dude like him can drink a bottle of anti-freeze, get struck by lightning seven times and have 14 concussions and love it, man — and then eat his words when his fragile, carb-less body suffers a simple fall.

If only he was insured, right?
