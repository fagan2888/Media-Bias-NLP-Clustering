The notion being that one size does not necessarily fit all and that the healthcare system should adapt to its patients, but in order for doctors to understand illnesses on the genetic level, they\u2019ll need a whole bunch of data and the initiative intends on addressing this need for large amounts.\n\nUT San Diego reported that the NIH director indicated on Thursday morning during a speech at the conference in La Jolla, California, that genomics, stem cells, increased participation between patients and researchers, and advances in handling data are working together to create new hope for patients in the form of genomic medicine.\n\nWith HealthCare.gov in regard, The Hill reports that the government\u2019s last large-scale health technology initiative lacked coordination, expertise in health information technology, and planning.\n\nWhat do you think, will the government pull this one off without a hitch or will Barack Obama\u2019s precision medicine program see its fair share of hiccups?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.immortal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamacare-precision-medicine-initiative.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, indicated that the data harnessed by Obamacare\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative will require software transparency and what he called \u201cexquisite\u201d data to be pieced together from existing studies.
