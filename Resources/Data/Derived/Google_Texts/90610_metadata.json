NTU offered its first four-year degrees in 2011 with Bachelor of Applied Science degrees in IT\u2014Computer Science, IT\u2014Digital Manufacturing, and IT\u2014New Media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so thrilled for the degree,\u201d exclaimed NTU Early Childhood Multicultural Education instructor, Della Begay, who also helped developed the curriculum for the new program. \u201cIt\u2019s what everybody\u2019s been waiting for.\u201d\n\nBegay started NTU\u2019s Early Childhood program in 2001 as a 3 credit hour, entry-level introductory course, which eventually developed into a certificate program and associate\u2019s degree. Currently, there are 118 students enrolled in the program.\n\n\u201cThere is a demand in this area for early childhood teachers because we have a head start program and two elementary schools in town,\u201d explained Begay. \u201cWe\u2019re feeding into the system, but the system is also feeding us. We\u2019re receiving a lot of interest from head start programs as well as home-based and FACE programs that send us their employees.\u201d\n\nNTU\u2019s Early Childhood Multicultural Education program requires approximately 128 credit hours to complete and includes two tracks, one with an emphasis on birth through age 4 and the other geared towards birth through age 8. Both tracks will prepare students to obtain early childhood licensure in the state of New Mexico.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a positive step,\u201d said Angelita Darwin of Standing Rock, New Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s opening up more opportunities for myself but also the younger generations. I\u2019m just excited and grateful the school acknowledged the fact we need more educators.\u201d\n\nDarwin will be graduating with her associate\u2019s degree in Early Childhood Multicultural Education in May, but upon completion, she plans on continuing into NTU\u2019s Bachelor of Science degree program.\n\n\u201cI like being here. It\u2019s cost effective and close to my home and family,\u201d Darwin stated. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive experience.\u201d\n\nCurrently, NTU offers an Associate of Science degree in Early Childhood Multicultural Education at two of its sites in Crownpoint and Chinle, and Early Childhood Multicultural Education classes at Teec Nos Pos. The baccalaureate degree will be offered at the Crownpoint campus only. According to Begay, the B.S. degree will align with NTU\u2019s Bachelor of Arts degree in Din\u00e9 Culture, Language, and Leadership in order to reinforce the multicultural aspect of the program.\n\nFor more information about NTU\u2019s Bachelor of Science degree in Early Childhood Multicultural Education, contact Della Begay at dbegay@navajotech.edu or call 505-786-4304.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Navajo Technical University has added its ninth baccalaureate degree, a Bachelor of Science degree in Early Childhood Multicultural Education.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/02/navajo-technical-university-adds-ninth-bachelors-degree-153345", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/della-begay-navajo-technical-university.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Navajo Technical University Adds Ninth Bachelor\u2019s Degree"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Navajo Technical University Adds Ninth Bachelor\u2019s Degree"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/02/navajo-technical-university-adds-ninth-bachelors-degree-153345", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-02T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Navajo Technical University, Native American Education, Native American students", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Navajo Technical University Adds Ninth Bachelor\u2019s Degree"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d12\"", "article_summary": "Navajo Technical University has added its ninth baccalaureate degree after receiving approval from the Institutions Action Council of the Higher Learning Commission to begin offering a Bachelor of Science degree in Early Childhood Multicultural Education.\nFor more information about NTU\u2019s Bachelor of Science degree in Early Childhood Multicultural Education, contact Della Begay at dbegay@navajotech.edu or call 505-786-4304.\n\u201cI\u2019m so thrilled for the degree,\u201d exclaimed NTU Early Childhood Multicultural Education instructor, Della Begay, who also helped developed the curriculum for the new program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive experience.\u201dCurrently, NTU offers an Associate of Science degree in Early Childhood Multicultural Education at two of its sites in Crownpoint and Chinle, and Early Childhood Multicultural Education classes at Teec Nos Pos.\ndegree will align with NTU\u2019s Bachelor of Arts degree in Din\u00e9 Culture, Language, and Leadership in order to reinforce the multicultural aspect of the program."}
