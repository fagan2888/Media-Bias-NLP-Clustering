Atlantic City to the Delaware River, cranberry bogs and the Pine Barrens: Where the state\u2019s other districts have been gerrymandered into twiddly bits, the second district seems large, substantial, and plausibly contiguous. Unlike the state\u2019s Gotham-gorged north, south Jersey is known for farmland, shore towns, and a struggling economy. It\u2019s not exactly the district where you\u2019d expect a \u2018coder to run for Congress\u2019\u2014but that\u2019s exactly what Dave Cole, native New Jerseyan and Obama campaign veteran is doing. In fact, that\u2019s his core pitch: He began his campaign with a Medium post announcing, \u201cI\u2019m a coder running for Congress.\u201d He calls himself an engineer, and he brings a startup\u2019s sensibility, systems\u2014and, perhaps, na\u00efvet\u00e9\u2014to the campaign. Chief among these? He\u2019s placed his full campaign platform on the code management software Github, and he\u2019s invited anyone to edit it.\n\n*** Cole should have an easier time than he\u2019s having. New Jersey\u2019s second district went to Obama by 8 percentage points in 2012 and 2008, yet its seat in the House has been controlled by a Republican congressman, Frank LoBiondo, since 1995. Cole would like to face LoBiondo, who doesn\u2019t exactly seem a friend of the president\u2019s. He\u2019s called Obamacare an \u201cworkable trainwreck.\u201d (He also, though, supported the extension of unemployment insurance.) First, though, Cole must defeat Bill Hughes in the primary\u2014Hughes, the establishment Democratic candidate; Hughes, whose father, William J., held NJ-2\u2019s Congressional seat for the two decades before LoBiondo won it. An Atlantic Special Report\n\nRead More What Cole brings to the fight is an Ur-Millennial resume. A child of the second district, he attended a local high school and Rutgers University, where he served as student council president for two years. While in school, he got caught up in the Obama campaign\u2019s New Jersey effort. Work in the White House followed 2008 victory: Cole served as \u201cSenior Advisor to Technology\u201d working to make government \u201cmore efficient and responsive.\u201d After leaving the White House, he joined the DC-based startup Mapbox, which creates maps from open-source data for non-profit use. His campaign-sanctioned bio labels him \u201can entrepreneur and an engineer.\u201d It\u2019s that engineering ethos which informs his use of Github. Github, for the uninitiated, is a piece of software and a website that programmers use to manage their code. Companies and organizations often manage their large library of code on the service, which maintains and stores different versions of the underlying text. While it costs money to host code privately on Github, open-source and public software projects can use it for free. For some startups, Github\u2019s built-in messaging features have replaced team email. Recently, people have started using Github for other purposes. They use the software to manage versions of images, databases, or just plain prose. Github has released new features to make those uses easier, and it\u2019s the prose function that the Cole campaign deploys. So: Go to Cole\u2019s campaign website and you can see his platform and take on the issues. That\u2019s not the only place that information resides, though: A clone of the text also exists on Github, where anyone can suggest changes to it. People who dislike some aspect of the platform can also submit a change by leaving a comment on Cole\u2019s website.\n\nCole\u2019s platform has been on Github for about a month. So far, three people have requested to change it through Github. They have made two policy changes and fixed a typo. J. Ren\u00e9e Beach made one of the changes. Where previously Cole\u2019s policy prescription read: Extend federal non-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Beach recommended it changed to: Extend federal non-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Beach is a programmer during the day and familiar with Github. Beach regularly works on open-source software projects, including the content management system Drupal. \u201cWhen I saw a line in Dave Cole\u2019s repo that I thought could be improved, I spent 3 minutes and suggested the change. I am transgender and for me, making a distinction between gender identity and gender expression at a legal level is very important,\u201d wrote Beach by email. \u201cDave\u2019s team could either accept the change or reject it,\u201d Beach said. \u201cEither way, I would know where they stand on the issue. For me, this is true democracy\u2014collaboratively solving problems and improving our processes.\u201d When I talked to Cole, he said his campaign puts its platform on Github\u2014and makes it editable\u2014to be more transparent. \u201cAs an engineer, I am ultimately judged on results\u2014the product I ship\u2014and not just what I say.\u201d \u201cWin or lose in this election, we want to make sure everything we do is open and transparent,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe wanted to state very clearly what solutions I\u2019d bring.\u201d Cole said that users could submit a comment to his platform if they weren\u2019t Github-inclined. And even if they didn\u2019t submit a change, Cole said, they can see the entire history of each page and the accompanying issue, Cole said. He said the great asset of making this kind of in-progress historical record was that it could \u201crebuild trust.\u201d This all fits with Cole\u2019s ethos: \u201cAs an engineer, I am ultimately judged on results\u2014the product I ship\u2014and not just what I say,\u201d he says on the homepage of his campaign site. But I\u2019m not sure that by publishing the haggling over his campaign platform, he\u2019s solving the problems of democracy that he thinks he is. Many questions of law or government have no empirically right or wrong answer, or, if they do seem to have a right answer, it\u2019s a more efficient one. The asset of Github, as Beach writes, is that it gets Cole\u2019s views into plain sight\u2014but I\u2019m not sure the campaign needed a specialized software platform to do that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This Congressional hopeful believes the code-management service will give voters a voice.", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "This Congressional hopeful believes the code-management service will give voters a voice.", "title": "Hacking the Political Platform: Why One Candidate Is Using Github", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/04/dave_cole_hi_res_4x3_660x494/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/hacking-the-political-platform-why-one-candidate-is-using-github/360501/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb097\"", "article_summary": "He\u2019s placed his full campaign platform on the code management software Github, and he\u2019s invited anyone to edit it.\nBut I\u2019m not sure that by publishing the haggling over his campaign platform, he\u2019s solving the problems of democracy that he thinks he is.\nGithub has released new features to make those uses easier, and it\u2019s the prose function that the Cole campaign deploys.\nCole\u2019s platform has been on Github for about a month.\nSo: Go to Cole\u2019s campaign website and you can see his platform and take on the issues."}
