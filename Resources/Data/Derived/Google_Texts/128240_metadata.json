Culver City, California-based NantHealth and parent company NantWorks announced the deal Tuesday, but did not reveal financial details.\n\nThe desire to include payers apparently has long been part of Soon-Shiong\u2019s plan. \u201cThe acquisition of NaviNet completes our 10-year vision at NantWorks and NantHealth to integrate and coordinate our complex healthcare ecosystem from the knowledge domain, to the care delivery domain and now to the payer domain, as a single sign-on, seamless, cloud-based, secure adaptive learning system for patients, payers and providers,\u201d the billionaire biotech baron said in a company statement.\n\nNaviNet historically had been a claims processor and number cruncher, but added secure communications for clinical collaboration in 2014 through a service called NaviNet Open. This element in particular intrigued Soon-Shiong.\n\n\u201cOur dream was to address the cognitive overload that faces clinicians today especially in the complexity of cancer, and support community oncologists as well as major academic centers. Finally, we have the infrastructure in place to make this a reality,\u201d he said.\n\nNantHealth President Robert Watson called the NaviNet purchase the company\u2019s \u201cmost significant\u201d acquisition so far.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s large installed base of health plans and provider offices gives us the payer relationships and scale for delivering best-in-class genomics and clinical solutions directly to providers,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether, we can now go to market with the industry\u2019s most comprehensive and integrated portfolios for cancer care, population health and wellness by deeply engaging every member of the healthcare ecosystem \u2013 payers, providers, patients and pharma.\u201d\n\nBoston-based NaviNet has eligibility and benefits information from more than 450 health plans, and reaches upwards of 170,000 provider locations nationwide, including 2,000 hospitals.\n\nNantHealth has been growing through a combination of product launches, acquisitions \u2014 most recently precision medicine startup Health Heritage \u2014 and outside investment, including from health IT giant Allscripts Healthcare Solutions.\n\nThe company had been planning an initial public offering, but Soon-Shiong told the Los Angeles Times in November that he would postpone the IPO until market conditions improved.\n\nPhoto: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images",
