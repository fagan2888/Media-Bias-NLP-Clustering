The developer behind the controversial “Ground Zero Mosque” has new plans for what to do with the land where he originally planned to build an Islamic cultural center.

Bloomberg reports real estate developer Sharif El-Gamal is proposing a 667 foot condo tower that will house at least 15 units spanning an entire floor. The square footage on the proposed units will range between 3,200 and 3,700 square feet and will likely be priced higher than $3,000 per square foot.

El-Gamal expects the tower to be a “market-maker” due to the fact that lower Manhattan is becoming an attractive destination for the super wealthy. Units in the building will reportedly be priced at least 13% higher than average new developments in Manhattan.
