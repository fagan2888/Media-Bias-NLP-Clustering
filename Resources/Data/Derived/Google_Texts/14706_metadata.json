The cuts are a result of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in December 2014.\n\nThe law allows for a reduction in benefits for multi-employer pension plans that were at risk of going broke. Prior to this legislation, pension plans in financial trouble could not reduce benefits to already retired workers.\n\nAs an employee of Nash Finch, a food distribution company that was acquired by Spartan Stores in 2013, Crouch was part of the Teamsters Local 908 union. Crouch explained the union is compensated by the Central States Pension Fund, a multi-employer fund that services mostly distribution and trucking companies. The money the union receives from Central States is then paid out to employees when they retire.\n\nCrouch said he paid between $44 and $64 a month in union dues the entire time he worked at Nash Finch. He said they even took a 6 percent cut in wages to ensure their retirement benefits would be saved. However, Central States had become severely underfunded in the last 15 years and was heading toward financial failure if action was not taken.\n\n\u201cOur pensions amounted to quite a bit of money you could live off of for the rest of your life,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cNow, with us being cut 30 to 70 percent, there is no life after retirement.\u201d\n\nIn a letter sent to Central States\u2019 members, executive director Thomas Nyhan stated the fund\u2019s decline is a result of a few factors, most notably a decrease in workforce coupled with an increased number of retirees, as well as two major recessions. According to the letter, the fund has more than three times as many retirees as active members, meaning fewer contributions are coming in than benefits being put out.\n\n\u201cTo put this in perspective, for every $3.46 that the fund pays out in pension benefits, only $1 is collected from contributing employers,\u201d Nyhan stated, \u201cwhich results in a $2 billion annual shortfall. Clearly the math will never work.\u201d\n\nIn order for the fund to survive, severe retirement benefit reductions were enacted through the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act.\n\nAnother Lima resident, Rodney Decker, is also feeling the effects of these cuts. Since retiring in 2000, Decker had been receiving $2,125 in retirement benefits each month. Starting July 1, his pension will be reduced to $1,333 a month.\n\n\u201cIt took a long time to work and get this thing built up to where we could have a comfortable retirement, now it\u2019s being taken away,\u201d said Decker. \u201cI\u2019m 75 years old, and my knees are all busted up. Who\u2019s gonna hire me?\u201d\n\nIf the multi-employer plan fails, retirees will be guaranteed a maximum of $12,870 per year for people with 30 years of service. The amount can be as low as $4,290 for those with 10 or less years of service.\n\nCrouch believes cutting pensions will also have a \u201ctrickle-down effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt trickles down to the employer,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you going to negotiate a contract or tell somebody to go work for Teamsters when the guys are going to have to work until they\u2019re 70 years old?\u201d\n\nAs a last ditch effort to save their pensions, Crouch and other local Teamsters are traveling to Washington, D.C. for a rally on April 14 on the front lawn of the Capitol Building. Crouch said Ohio Sen. Rob Portman will be in attendance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last stand we have,\u201d Crouch said.\n\nBefore leaving for D.C., local Teamsters will hold a rally in Lima to explain the situation and outline details of the trip. The rally will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday in the old Kmart parking lot, located near Westgate Entertainment Center off Allentown Road in Lima. Members of all unions are welcome to attend.\n\nA union member at a recent rally to protest pension cuts shows the back of his shirt, which reads: \u201cOur pension cuts will have an economic disaster on retired seniors across America.\u201d Local union members will hold another rally Saturday in Lima. http://limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_pension-cuts-1.jpg A union member at a recent rally to protest pension cuts shows the back of his shirt, which reads: \u201cOur pension cuts will have an economic disaster on retired seniors across America.\u201d Local union members will hold another rally Saturday in Lima.
