Reuters\n\nMaybe they\u2019re part of a larger social circle that favors communication and compassion over antagonism and aggression. Or maybe they\u2019re just too stoned to care. Either way, a new University of Buffalo study has found married couples who smoke weed are far less likely to engage in domestic violence.\n\nHere\u2019s a case where intuition may run both ways. On the one hand, it may be obvious that couples who smoke weed fight less, because the drug has depressive effects. But it\u2019s also easy to imagine people who use marijuana are more likely to use harder drugs that aren\u2019t so mellow. In their study, the researchers wanted to clarify this logical stopgap by looking at the data within the first nine years of marriage. Too many studies, they claim, fall into the trap of slicing only a tiny cross-section of time.\n\nThe team collected data on 634 couples. They drew assessments of interpersonal violence (IPV), both before and after marriage, marijuana consumption quantity, marijuana consumption frequency, and each partner\u2019s antisocial tendencies. They compared these over the first nine years of marriage to create a fuller picture of what\u2019s really going on. In typical studies, the sliver of time is merely a snapshot. It makes no claims about the trajectory or tendencies of a particular couple.\n\nAnalyzing their data, the researchers found the more often a couple smoked marijuana the less likely they were to engage in IPV. The relationship went both ways \u2014 meaning, husbands who used more marijuana weren\u2019t just less likely to be violent toward their wives; their wives were also less violent toward them.\n\nAccording to lead investigator Dr. Kenneth Leonard, director of the UB Research Institute on Addictions, the study leaves ample room for questions. While part of marijuana\u2019s reputation involves its relaxing effects, a variety of people consume weed for a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cIt is possible, for example, that \u2014 similar to a drinking partnership \u2014 couples who use marijuana together may share similar values and social circles,\u201d Leonard said in a statement, \u201cand it is this similarity that is responsible for reducing the likelihood of conflict.\u201d\n\nConcerning future research, Leonard and his colleagues hope to see the focus stay on a narrowing path. The data would be more compelling, they argue, if instead of showing the broad strokes of each couple\u2019s tendencies, it could depict the relationship between marijuana consumption and IPV on a consistent, nearly daily basis.\n\n\u201cAlthough this study supports the perspective that marijuana does not increase, and may decrease, aggressive conflict,\u201d he said, \u201cwe would like to see research replicating these findings, and research examining day-to-day marijuana and alcohol use and the likelihood to IPV on the same day before drawing stronger conclusions.\u201d\n\nSource: Smith P, Homish G, Collins R, et al.
