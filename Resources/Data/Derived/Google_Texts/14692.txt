ATLANTA (AP) - Jeff Teague’s Atlanta teammates raved about his pivotal scoring in the final quarter.

Teague said he was just trying to make up for his poor results the rest of the game.

Teague scored 12 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and the Hawks overcame poor 3-point shooting to beat the Milwaukee Bucks 101-90 on Friday night.

Teague missed each of his five 3-point shots and had a game-high six turnovers. But with the Hawks leading only 82-79 in the final period, the point guard delivered a decisive scoring spree.

Teague had three straight baskets, including two three-point plays. The second basket and free throw pushed the lead to 90-81.

“I tried to do something to help the team while I was out there on the floor,” Teague said. “It was just me attacking.”

The run came with Atlanta’s backup point guard, Dennis Schroder, on the bench with five fouls.

John Henson answered Teague’s run with a three-point play before Thabo Sefolosha countered with Atlanta’s only 3-pointer of the second half.

Paul Millsap had 14 points and 13 rebounds and Al Horford also had 14 points to keep the Hawks’ late-season surge going. They have won seven of eight and 10 of 12 to move to third place in the Eastern Conference.

The Hawks (43-30) are a season-high 13 games over .500 and got there despite making only 5 of 32 3-pointers.

Jabari Parker led Milwaukee with 19 points. Henson had 17 points and 10 rebounds.

The Bucks had only 16 assists with 15 turnovers.

“Guys are trying to do it themselves and sometimes that happens,” Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. “Moving the ball, trusting one another. Tonight we just didn’t trust one another.”

Atlanta dodged Milwaukee’s attempt for a sweep of the season series. The Bucks won the first two games against the Hawks in overtime, including a double-overtime win in Atlanta on Feb. 20.

Atlanta led 51-46 at halftime. The Bucks cut the Hawks’ lead to one point before Atlanta used a 10-2 run for a 75-66 lead.
