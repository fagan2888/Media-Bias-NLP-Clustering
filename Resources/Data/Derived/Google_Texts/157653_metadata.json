Though the employer market is difficult to calculate and data is hard to come by, he\u2019s made estimates for the small group and individual markets.\n\nIf you\u2019ve felt like your insurance has gotten more expensive, well, you\u2019re right: Gottlieb estimated an 11% increase in price in the small group and a 12% increase in the individual market. And it looks like it\u2019ll keep getting worse.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t look great for price-sensitive Americans who have feared that Obamacare will ruin the market for insurance \u2013 and certainly runs counter to the trumped-up claims from the Administration that Obamacare is engineered to lower insurance prices.\n\nIn 2009, the Congressional Budget Office forecast what insurance premiums would be in 2016 due to Obamacare. They found that in 2016 we should have expected a 10-13% increase in the individual market, which means that prices need to freeze right now for that to come true. It\u2019s unlikely to be the case. What\u2019s more, though, they predicted no change for the small-group market. Prices have skyrocketed there, and show no signs of slowing down.\n\nObamacare was sold to the American people on a boatload of broken promises, and it looks like we can toss \u201cbend the cost curve\u201d and \u201clower premiums for the average family by $2500\u201d onto the bin of lies.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Nobody is surprised, right?", "title": "Report: Obamacare causing insurance prices to skyrocket", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/08/report-obamacare-causing-insurance-prices-to-skyrocket/", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/blog/slide11.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-08T23:21:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-08T21:11:05+00:00"}, "keywords": "health insurance, ObamaCare, premiums,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b23\"", "article_summary": "Report: Obamacare causing insurance prices to skyrocketposted at 7:21 pm on April 8, 2014 by Kevin GlassScott Gottlieb, a resident fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, is out with his latest estimates of how Obamacare is affecting health insurance premiums around the country.\nThis doesn\u2019t look great for price-sensitive Americans who have feared that Obamacare will ruin the market for insurance \u2013 and certainly runs counter to the trumped-up claims from the Administration that Obamacare is engineered to lower insurance prices.\nIn 2009, the Congressional Budget Office forecast what insurance premiums would be in 2016 due to Obamacare.\nThey found that in 2016 we should have expected a 10-13% increase in the individual market, which means that prices need to freeze right now for that to come true.\nIf you\u2019ve felt like your insurance has gotten more expensive, well, you\u2019re right: Gottlieb estimated an 11% increase in price in the small group and a 12% increase in the individual market."}
