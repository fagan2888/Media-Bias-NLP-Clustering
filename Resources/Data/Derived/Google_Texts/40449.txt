Pelosi says 'the cupboard is bare'

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says that while deficit reduction is a laudable goal, there are precious few spending cuts left to negotiate in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.

"The cupboard is bare," the California Democrat said in an interview aired Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." "There's no more cuts to make."

"We all want to reduce the deficit," she added. "Put everything on the table, review it, but you cannot have any more cuts just for the sake of cuts. Right now you’re taking trophies."

Pelosi said raising the debt ceiling is "an issue that really shouldn’t be a conversation," defending President Barack Obama's record on deficit reduction so far.

She blasted House Republicans who eye reductions to entitlement funding and took aim at them on a budget strategy tied to defunding Obamacare that she said amounts to them as "legislative arsonists."

But on both issues, Pelosi sought to distinguish House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) from many of his members.

"I certainly don’t paint the speaker with that brush, but there are enough of them in their caucus to shut down the government," Pelosi said. "That would be a victory for them."
