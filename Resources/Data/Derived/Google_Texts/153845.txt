A bible that belonged to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his Nobel Peace Prize will be contested by his children in Atlanta on Tuesday.

Bernice King opposes the sale of both items, which she says her brothers Dexter and Martin Luther King III will do if Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney gives them control of the possessions.

President Obama used the bible to swear in for his second term, and the Peace Prize was given to the civil rights icon for his fight against racism, CNN reported Tuesday.

The Bible and the Nobel Peace Prize is being held in a safety deposit box until a final decision is made. Only Judge McBurney has a key to the safe, CNN reported.
