She's come around that and change her mind but she did say something that a lot of Americans, quite frankly, are saying to themselves, you know, a Bush or a Clinton, isn't there anyone else out there? And I\u2019m curious, when you hear that, do you understand where people are coming from?\n\nBush admitted that he\u2019s \u201ctotally self-aware and understand[s] that I have a challenge\u201d and that he \u201cintend[s] to overcome it by sharing my life story.\u201d\n\nWhen Muir shifted gears to immigration, he mentioned hecklers at his announcement speech and tried to hit Bush from the left: \u201cYou have said along the way you would be open to the idea of a path to citizenship, more recently, legal status. So, as we sit here today in Iowa, where do you stand?\u201d\n\nWhile Bush emphasized his position that \u201cwe ought to have a path to legal status\u201d for \u201cDream Act kids,\u201d Muir asked for confirmation on a \u201cpath to citizenship for them\u201d to which Bush responded \u201cabsolutely.\u201d Muir continued down that line by asking if he also meant for the parents of those individuals, but was rebuked when Bush maintained that he would not favor a path to citizenship for their parents.\n\nFollowing a brief discussion of Iraq, Muir told Bush he was \u201ccurious what you hope the [Supreme] Court decides\u201d on gay marriage with the ruling likely to come soon.\n\nAfter Bush responded that he\u2019d be in favor of the Court letting states make their own decisions, Muir came at the issue from an emotional perspective: \u201cA lot of people think that this issue in particular is a generational issue, and we saw your parents. We saw your father as a witness to a same-sex marriage in Maine.\u201d\n\nReaffirming that he was \u201ccurious,\u201d Muir wondered if he would \u201cwitness a same sex marriage if you were asked.\u201d The 2016 GOP candidate iterated that he would and \u201cif they were friends that I cared for them, of course I would.\u201d\n\nTaking into consideration what has been shown so far of the interview, it will be worth comparing Muir\u2019s questioning of Bush to what he would ask if the World News Tonight anchor had the opportunity to sit down with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe relevant portions of the transcript from ABC\u2019s World News Tonight with David Muir on June 17 can be found below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "ABC\u2019s World News Tonight aired on Wednesday night anchor David Muir\u2019s interview with 2016 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and, while the aired portions touched on issues such as Iraq and political dynasties, other topics were passed over included the economy, distrust in government, and ObamaCare.
