Their goal is to make these genes more like those of an animal that last walked the planet thousands of years ago: the woolly mammoth.\n\n\u201cAsian elephants are closer to mammoths than either is to African elephants, yet quite different in appearance and temperature range,\u201d notes Harvard geneticist and technology developer George Church. \u201cWe are not trying to make an exact copy of a mammoth, but rather a cold-resistant elephant.\u201d\n\nBut what if the new\u2014and fast advancing\u2014techniques of genome editing allowed scientists to engineer not only cold-resistance traits but also other characteristics of the woolly mammoth into its living Asiatic relatives? Scientists have found mammoth cells preserved in permafrost. If they were to recover cells with intact DNA, they could theoretically \u201cedit\u201d an Asian elephant\u2019s genome to match the woolly mammoth\u2019s. A single cell contains the complete genetic instruction set for its species, and by replicating that via editing a new individual can, theoretically, be created. But would such a hybrid\u2014scion of an Asian elephant mother and genetic tinkerers\u2014count as a true woolly mammoth?\n\nIn other words, is de-extinction a real possibility?\n\nThe answer is yes. On January 6, 2000, a falling tree killed the last bucardo, a wild Iberian ibex, which is a goatlike animal. Her name was Celia. On July 30, 2003, Celia\u2019s clone was born. To make the clone scientists removed the nucleus of a cell from Celia intact and inserted it into the unfertilized egg cell of another kind of ibex. They then transferred the resulting embryo to the womb of a living goat. Nearly a year later they delivered the clone by cutting her from her mother.\n\nAlthough she lived for a scant seven minutes due to lung defects, Celia\u2019s clone proved that not only is de-extinction real, \u201cit has already happened,\u201d in the words of environmentalist Stewart Brand, whose San Francisco-based Long Now Foundation is funding some of this de-extinction research, including Church\u2019s effort as well as bids to bring back the passenger pigeon and heath hen, among other candidate species. Nor is the bucardo alone in the annals of de-extinction. Several viruses have already been brought back, including the flu variant responsible for the 1918 pandemic that killed more than 20 million people worldwide.\n\nAnd yet, the bucardo remains extinct. The lack of progress stems partly from a lack of funds, according to Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez-Arias, the Spanish wildlife veterinarian who helped lead the bucardo cloning effort. But it also has to do with flaws in the method used to bring the species back to life. Researchers in Asia have been using the technique for a decade or more to try to resurrect the mammoth\u2014to no avail.\n\nNew genome editing techniques\u2014in particular the CRISPR system Church and his team are using\u2014offer new hope, however. In 1987 Japanese scientists found genetic sequences dubbed \u201cclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u201d inEscherichia coli bacteria. These CRISPRs, as they are known, were subsequently found to be ubiquitous in many bacteria, where they defend against viruses\u2014a simple but effective immune system.\n\nSpecifically, the enzyme known as Cas9 (for CRISPR-associated system 9) can attach itself to specific DNA in a virus and cut it, following the lead of an RNA guide. That cut kills the pathogen or at least disables it. And now geneticists, armed with the right RNA sequence to guide Cas9 exactly where they want it to go (an outcome still not always guaranteed), can unleash this editor from the Streptococcus pyogenesbacteria to add or subtract code from many genes, such as those that produce hemoglobin in the Asian elephant genome or even genes in human cells. Moreover, with the right RNA guide CRISPR can edit up to five genes at once\u2014a number that keeps growing as scientists continue to experiment. And RNA is quick and cheap to make with machines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harvard Medical School scientists are hard at work developing a method for de-extinction", "author": "David Biello", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Harvard Medical School scientists are hard at work developing a method for de-extinction", "title": "Can woolly mammoths be brought back from extinction?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/11/can_woolly_mammoths_be_brought_back_from_extinction_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_68528668.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Harvard Medical School scientists are hard at work developing a method for de-extinction", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_68528668.jpg", "title": "Can woolly mammoths be brought back from extinction?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Can woolly mammoths be brought back from extinction?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, De-extinction, extinction, Scientific American, Woolly Mammoth", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5f2\"", "article_summary": "But would such a hybrid\u2014scion of an Asian elephant mother and genetic tinkerers\u2014count as a true woolly mammoth?\nIf they were to recover cells with intact DNA, they could theoretically \u201cedit\u201d an Asian elephant\u2019s genome to match the woolly mammoth\u2019s.\nTheir goal is to make these genes more like those of an animal that last walked the planet thousands of years ago: the woolly mammoth.\nTo make the clone scientists removed the nucleus of a cell from Celia intact and inserted it into the unfertilized egg cell of another kind of ibex.\nScientists have found mammoth cells preserved in permafrost."}
