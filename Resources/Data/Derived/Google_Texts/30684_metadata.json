While the hosts were judging each contestant, they focused in on Miss Colorado, or Kelly Johnson, who came on stage dressed in scrubs and her stethoscope; Johnson said her true talent was nursing.\n\nCollins said that Johnson\u2019s monologue was \u201chilarious,\u201d adding she was \u201cbasically reading her emails out loud.\u201d Behar, on the other hand, was confused by the fact Johnson wore a doctor's stethoscope around her neck. As you could have guessed, these comments did not go over well with the audience, especially for those who are nurses like Johnson.\n\nOutraged by the comments, nurses took to the Internet to post pictures of themselves on a Facebook page, called \u201cShow Me Your Stethoscope,\u201d and used the hashtag #NursesUnite. These posts caused companies, like Johnson & Johnson and Eggland\u2019s Best Inc., to pull advertisments it had with the show. The View hosts have since issued an apology, but as E! Online reported, the nurses have not been so quick to forgive.\n\nSarah, from Baltimore, told E! that hearing \"the hosts of The View speak so ignorantly about a nurse just reminds me again how little people truly know about nurses.\" She explained that nurses deal with sickness, pain, and death on a daily basis; they work long hours, forgo lunch and bathroom breaks to ensure quality patient care; and they spend more time with their co-workers than their own families.\n\n\"This is the life of a nurse \u2014 my life,\" she said. \"The life of so many wonderful, caring, amazing people. \"\n\nAlexandra, from Mississippi, agrees with Sarah. Also speaking with E!, Alexandra said she loved her job and \"could not tell you how happy it makes me to help bring people back to life, help them cope with an illness or even to be a hand to hold when there is nobody there.\"\n\nAlexandra continued: \"For women who make more money in one hour sitting and blabbing about nonsense than I make in a month, I am absolutely horrified at the lack of respect they have for the working class...I will not watch that show. It is not worth my time...I will continue to do my job that I love because I love it!\"\n\n@TheView I use my stethoscope every day. I'm #notjustanurse - Im the nurse trying to save your life- YOUR nurse. #nursesunite #NursesMatter \u2014 Julianne van kalken (@JKalken) September 15, 2015\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, researchers have proven nurses are a vital part of the healthcare system. A recent study conducted by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that happy nurses were the key to a successful hospital. And when nurses report edsatisfaction and fulfillment from their jobs, mortality rates within a hospital fell as much as 20 percent.\n\nSo maybe the next time you want to poke fun at the careers of a hardworking, life-changing group of people, don't.\n\nSource: McHugh M, Aiken L, Burns L, et al.
