Rand Paul today stood by his comments last week criticizing Ted Cruz for being too aggressive and personal in his attacks on other senators.

It’s well-known Cruz isn’t terribly liked by many of his Senate colleagues, even on the Republican side, and him calling Mitch McConnell a liar on the Senate floor was a bridge too far for some.

A few days ago, Paul said that Cruz is “pretty much done for” legislatively because “in a democratic republic, you have to woo people, you can’t hit them over the head.”

On Fox’s MediaBuzz today, Howard Kurtz asked Paul why he went after Cruz like that.

Paul said his style when disagreeing with someone “is to not call them a name or to be inflammatory,” and he’s able to get along with Democratic colleagues he disagrees with without attacking them as “dishonest.”
