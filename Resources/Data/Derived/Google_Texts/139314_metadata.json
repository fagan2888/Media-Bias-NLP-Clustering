The bill-turned-amendment would give them the ability to do so in an attempt to prevent predatory towing.\n\n\u201cState and local governments provide the best authority to regulate the towing industry and protect Virginians from unfair, predatory practices,\u201d Rep. Beyer said in a press release. \u201cWe need more common-sense, consumer friendly solutions like this amendment to protect our constituents\u2019 wallets.\u201d\n\nThe predatory towing debate isn\u2019t new to Arlington. The issue received national attention this past spring when ESPN sportscaster and WJLA alumna Britt McHenry was caught on camera losing her temper at an employee at Ballston-based Advanced Towing.\n\nShortly after the video of the incident was published online, Beyer\u2019s bill was first introduced to the House.\n\nIn May, County Board Member Jay Fisette told ARLnow that under the legislation, he would support giving a towing veto to local businesses, requiring the owner\u2019s approval before a vehicle is removed from their property.\n\nThe legislation Beyer\u2019s bill would be amending, called the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act or STRR Act, is expected to pass in the House of Representatives by the end of the week, according to the Congressman\u2019s office.\n\nThe bill is nearly 600 pages long and would authorize more than $300 billion for transportation across the country. Specific plans for the funds include improving infrastructure, highway safety programs and public transportation.\n\nAccording to The Hill, Beyer\u2019s and Hollen\u2019s amendment is one of nearly 300 up for debate by the House before voting on the STRR Act.", "article_metadata": {"city": "Arlington", "description": "Arlington officials could soon have the full authority to regulate and combat predatory towing practices.
