Cardinal Health, one of the big three pharmaceutical distributors in the nation, is solidifying its relationship with CVS by joining in a 10-year agreement that covers supply contracts for generic drugs.

The supply deal, a 50-50 joint venture, was said by the companies to be the largest of its kind in the U.S. Cardinal Health will pay CVS $25 million every quarter over the life of the deal.

CVS has an existing pharmaceutical-distribution pact with Cardinal Health, which is being extended by three years through June 2019.

CVS shares were up 1.6% to $67.79.
