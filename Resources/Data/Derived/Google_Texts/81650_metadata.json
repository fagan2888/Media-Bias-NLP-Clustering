Dreessen doesn\u2019t see that in Julius Thomas, who ultimately replaced him as the Broncos\u2019 starting tight end.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a very special player,\u201d Dreessen said. \u201cIt was fun to watch him grow up last season. In this offseason, he really impressed me with his attitude and work ethic and how hungry he was.\u201d\n\nIt says something about Thomas that this testimony was delivered a couple hours after the Broncos released Dreessen. Not to mention what it says of Dreessen.\n\nThomas wasn\u2019t the first NFL player to break out from obscurity and have a terrific season. After catching one pass through his first two, injury-plagued seasons, Thomas made 65 receptions last year, 12 for touchdowns. He made the Pro Bowl team. He played in the Super Bowl.\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t satisfied. The 2013 season was great as it stands next to his first two. The plan is to have those numbers look smaller as Thomas\u2019 career moves along.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I did last year will be considered a high level when I\u2019m done playing,\u201d he said. \u201cI still have so much to learn. Statistically you can do well, but it doesn\u2019t mean I did everything well.\u201d\n\nA desire for greatness led Thomas to look up Tony Gonzalez this offseason. Thomas is resourceful that way. During the 2011 lockout, he was the only Broncos rookie to figure out how to attend the team\u2019s player-supervised workouts with trainer Loren Landow at Valor Christian High School.\n\nThomas demonstrated ambition again this offseason when he sought out the greatest receiving tight end in NFL history. Gonzalez was the first of several former college basketball players to become a star NFL tight end. Thomas is the latest.\n\nWATCH: Recap of Denver Broncos training camp Day 2\n\nThomas found out he and Gonzalez live fairly close to each other in the southern Los Angeles area and arranged to meet with the league\u2019s all-time leader in nearly every tight end category.\n\n\u201cI picked his brain on, what are sort of the things you\u2019re looking for?\u201d Thomas said. \u201cNot just technique, but what\u2019s going through your mind during plays? What do you focus on? How do you prepare for the day? His routine. Stuff you can only get from playing 17 years in the league. This is a guy who they\u2019ve probably already started making his bronze statue.\u201d\n\nThomas flashed enough last year for Broncos management to believe he warrants a nice, new contract. A free agent after this season, Thomas would like to play in Denver for a while. But that\u2019s the extent of his financial and future concern now that training camp has begun.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t focus on something like that\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of stuff that takes away from what you want to do here. If you want to be professional, you want to be a consistently great player, you can\u2019t focus on anything that takes away from what we\u2019re trying to do as a team.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s generally believed it will be impossible for the Broncos\u2019 offense to improve on last season\u2019s record-setting production. Thomas, though. is perhaps the one Peyton Manning weapon who has the most room between last season and his ceiling.\n\nThomas worked this offseason to improve his footwork and technique for route running, strength and technique for run blocking. And he wants to be smarter about figuring out defenses on the fly.\n\nGonzalez gave him tips in one conversation. Dreessen advised here and there during the past two years. Despite these heady times, Thomas is a young player who was willing to listen.\n\n\u201cEven before Joel\u2019s knee injury, he would talk about how in football, it can all be gone,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat\u2019s something he and I both know for personal experience. We both have been through a lot of trials and tribulations early in our career. We both understood that you can\u2019t expect to come to work each day thinking you\u2019re going to be able to do this for six more years.\n\n\u201cThe way I approach every day is enjoy it, give it 100 percent and cross your fingers, say your prayers and hope it lasts forever.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis\n\nHoops Dreams and the NFL\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 Julius Thomas is one of five current tight end/receivers who played college basketball:\n\n.tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n\n.tg .tg-oa1s{font-weight:bold;font-family:Georgia, serif !important;}\n\n.tg .tg-0wjy{font-weight:bold;font-size:14px;font-family:Georgia, serif !important;}\n\n.tg .tg-zfr1{font-size:14px;font-family:Georgia, serif !important;}", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Julius Thomas looks to turn great Broncos season into career success", "title": "Julius Thomas looks to turn great Broncos season into career success", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/25/julius-thomas-looks-to-turn-great-broncos-season-into-career-success/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__julius-thomas-denver-broncosp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__julius-thomas-denver-broncosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T16:49:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:37:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde78b\"", "article_summary": "A free agent after this season, Thomas would like to play in Denver for a while.\nThomas wasn\u2019t the first NFL player to break out from obscurity and have a terrific season.\nGonzalez was the first of several former college basketball players to become a star NFL tight end.\nDreessen doesn\u2019t see that in Julius Thomas, who ultimately replaced him as the Broncos\u2019 starting tight end.\nJoel Dreessen was a solid NFL player who saw his share of young egos expand whenever they were fed by the spotlight."}
