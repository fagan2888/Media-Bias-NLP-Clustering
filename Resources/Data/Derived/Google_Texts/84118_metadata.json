The details have been something of a surprise: fewer people than expected signing up on the exchanges, but fewer employers than expected dropping coverage, and more people signing up for Medicaid\u2014which means, incidentally, that Obamacare is looking much more like a single-payer system than anyone seems to realize. But the point is that reform has indeed delivered the big improvements in coverage it promised, and has done so at lower cost than expected.\n\nAfter recounting more Obama administration accomplishments in financial reform and the environment, Krugman concludes, \"The lesson of the Obama years, in other words, is that success doesn\u2019t have to be complete to be very real. You say you want a revolution? Well, you can\u2019t always get what you want\u2014but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.\"\n\nRead the rest of Krugman's column here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Krugman goes over some of the big accomplishments of the Obama years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Paul Krugman goes over some of the big accomplishments of the Obama years.", "title": "Krugman: Obama Didn't Bring Us Revolution, but He Sure Helped Make America a Better Place", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/economy/krugman-obama-didnt-bring-us-revolution-he-sure-helped-make-america-better-place", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/images/managed/storyimages_1337713228_krugmanpic.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Krugman: Obama Didn&#039;t Bring Us Revolution, but He Sure Helped Make America a Better Place"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-01T13:56:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Krugman: Obama Didn't Bring Us Revolution, but He Sure Helped Make America a Better PlacePaul Krugman goes over some of the big accomplishments of the Obama years.\nIn his Friday column, Paul Krugman ponders Obama's quiet uptick in popularity in recent months, about an 11 percent increase in approval nationally that has the president close to 50 percent.\nBut the point is that reform has indeed delivered the big improvements in coverage it promised, and has done so at lower cost than expected.\nWell, you can\u2019t always get what you want\u2014but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.\"\nAfter recounting more Obama administration accomplishments in financial reform and the environment, Krugman concludes, \"The lesson of the Obama years, in other words, is that success doesn\u2019t have to be complete to be very real."}
