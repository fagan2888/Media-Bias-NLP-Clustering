ACT Meteors coach Andrew Dawson is confident captain Kris Britt is on track for a bumper Women's National Cricket League campaign and the experience of bowling to Australian captain Meg Lanning would be invaluable for young bowlers Jenny Taffs and Nina Westenraad.

The Meteors played a 50-over and a Twenty20 game against Lanning's Victoria Spirit in Albury on Sunday as part of the pre-season preparations.

While the Meteors lost both games – the first by four wickets and the T20 by 17 runs – Dawson was happy with how his team was progressing towards its first-round clash against the NSW Breakers in a fortnight.

"With Britty, the last 18 months, she's really, really, physically worked very hard and she's in the best athletic shape of her cricket career, which is getting close to 14 years," Dawson said.

"I think last year the body was still adjusting to how she was, she's done a lot of physical and technical work."

While he said the fielding was a bit rusty against the Vics, he felt the experience of two teenagers bowling to Lanning would be invaluable.

"It was a great experience for a 16 and 19-year-old to bowl to Meg," he said.

"Meg is ranked the No.1 Australian batter, so it was a great opportunity for the younger players."

Taffs is a left-arm wrist spinner, while Westenraad is a young quick.
