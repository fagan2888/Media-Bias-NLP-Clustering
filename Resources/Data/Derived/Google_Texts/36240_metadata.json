The decision for both Republican governors was made easier by the increasing likelihood that one of the suicide bombers in the attacks arrived in Europe as a refugee through Greece. Will Gov. Greg Abbott \u2013 who has asked Texans to pause at noon today for a minute of silence to honor the memory of the victims \u2013 follow their lead?\n\nThe refugee conversation also dominated the Republican presidential race over the weekend, with each candidate jockeying to have the strongest opposition to President Obama's plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year. Here are where things stand: Ted Cruz has said Christians fleeing violence in Syria should be allowed into the country, while Marco Rubio wants a complete ban on new refugees, and Donald Trump wants to push out the refugees who have already settled here. For her part, Hillary Clinton, in the Democratic debate on Saturday, said the U.S. should take 65,000 Syrian refugees, focusing first on the most vulnerable populations fleeing the war-torn country, like religious minorities and women, but also said they have to be heavily vetted.\n\nTHE BRIEFING\n\nTHE LATEST ON THE PARIS ATTACKS \u2013 \u201cHeavily armed police officers wearing balaclavas descended on a Brussels neighborhood on Monday as the authorities intensified their manhunt for Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have helped carry out the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday. Meanwhile, the authorities in France announced that they had conducted sweeping police raids around the country overnight, detaining 104 people,\u201d per The New York Times.\n\n\u2014 Rick Perry looks for what\u2019s next. \u201cHis record will be back in the spotlight this week as the abuse-of-power case against him heads into a critical moment with a Wednesday hearing before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Its outcome will help shape his opportunities and his clout. \u2026\n\n\u201cBut whether the state\u2019s highest criminal court makes short work of the case or paves the way for a trial, Perry\u2019s lead lawyer says he\u2019s in for the long term, just one example of the loyalties Perry can count on as he moves forward after decades in public office capped by a record stint as governor,\u201d writes the San Antonio Express-News\u2019 Peggy Fikac.\n\n\u2014 What to know as the Affordable Care Act coverage deadline approaches. \u201cAs deadlines approach for Texans to buy, renew or switch health plans offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s state marketplace, consumers need to know about changes in prices, insurance product offerings and fines for those who forgo coverage.\n\n\u201cWhile experts and officials still clash over Congress\u2019 2010 decision to set up HealthCare.gov\u2019s state marketplaces, there\u2019s broad agreement that people who buy insurance on their own or who are uninsured have more choices and price information now,\u201d writes The Dallas Morning News\u2019 Bob Garrett.\n\n\u2014 A test of two Republican parties in Texas. \u201cRecent polling shows that not only are there strong factional differences between Tea Party and non-Tea Party Republicans, but also that the anti-establishment types are a sizable part of the Texas GOP. \u2026\n\n\u201cOne of the poll\u2019s co-directors, Daron Shaw of the University of Texas at Austin, reads that to say that 43 percent to 44 percent of the GOP primary voters are Tea Party voters. That faction is relatively small in the Legislature, especially in the Texas House. But they\u2019re bucking for a promotion, talking about entering enough candidates in the 2016 elections to seriously challenge the conservatives now in power,\u201d writes The Texas Tribune\u2019s Ross Ramsey\n\n\u2014 There is \u2018no meaningful risk\u2019 of Christian refugees committing terrorism, Ted Cruz says. \u201cCruz Sunday continued to call for Muslim refugees from Syria to be barred from entering the United States but opening the borders to displaced Christians, arguing there is not a \"meaningful risk\" that Christians will commit terrorist acts. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018It is precisely the Obama administration\u2019s unwillingness to recognize that or ask those questions that makes them so unable to fight this enemy,\u2019 he said. \u2018Because they pretend as if there is no religious aspect to this,\u2019\u201d reports The Washington Post\u2019s Katie Zezima.\n\nA programming note: PolitiFact Texas has a new partnership with the Houston Chronicle and the San Antonio Express-News, joining the fact-checking operation that the Austin American-Statesman began in 2010. http://goo.gl/G5drs\n\nSPEED READ\n\nAG to decide where guns allowed at K-12 schools, Houston Chronicle\n\nU.S. Supreme Court will take up Texas abortion law, Houston Chronicle\n\nVan de Putte, Andrade team up for high-powered consulting firm, San Antonio Express-News\n\nFikac: Cruz\u2019s \u2018oops\u2019 shows he has room for error, San Antonio Express-News\n\nHistory is not on Brady\u2019s side for sweeping tax reforms, Houston Chronicle\n\nUT/TT poll: Mental health top cause of mass shootings, Texas Tribune\n\nJerry Patterson registers as a lobbyist, works on a documentary, San Antonio Express-News\n\nPaxton\u2019s opinion sought on daily fantasy sports, San Antonio Express-News\n\nTexas Take: Grading Speaker Straus, Houston Chronicle\n\nAt Texas Facilities Commission, special treatment for some, Austin American-Statesman\n\nTravis County has no rules for registering lobbyists, Austin American-Statesman\n\nBlack Lives Matter searches for its next steps in Texas, Texas Tribune\n\nGame wardens aid on Texas-Mexico border, Associated Press\n\nQUOTE TO NOTE\n\n\"What we need to be able to do frankly is sort out that foreign fighter flow, those who have gone into Syria and come out and want to launch attacks or those people who have connections with ISIL in Syria.

Many Democrats and Republicans have accused the party of shielding the front-runner by scheduling the debates at times \u2014 such as Saturday evenings \u2014 that are likely to draw fewer viewers than the GOP events, which the DNC routinely denies,\u201d reports Politico\u2019sGabriel Debenedetti.\n\n\u2014 Rival campaigns are starting to fear Ted Cruz. \u201cHe has more cash than any other Republican candidate. He is organized in every county in the first four voting states. And he has served up one strong debate performance after the next. Now, not three months from primary season, rivals concede they have begun to fear Ted Cruz has an increasingly clear path to the Republican nomination,\u201d reports Politico\u2019s Katie Glueck.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "vf": {"section": "news", "unique_id": "chron-article-6635273"}, "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "Texas Take for Monday, Nov. 16, 2016", "title": "Texas Take: Nov. 16, 2015", "url": "http://www.chron.com/politics/texas-take/article/Texas-Take-Nov-16-2015-6635273.php", "image": "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/42/14/46/8964485/5/rawImage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@houstonchron", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BobbyCervantes"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 314935171989989}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Thousands of French troops deployed around Paris on Sunday and ... more Photo: Peter Dejong, AP Texas Take: Nov. 16, 2015 1 / 1 Back to GalleryTHE LEAD: The refugee crisis in Texas?\nTexas Take: Nov. 16, 2015Photo: Peter Dejong, AP Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 French soldiers patrol at the Eiffel Tower which remained closed on the first of three days of national mourning in Paris, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015.\n\u201cThe complaints are just the latest in a series of tense exchanges between the national party committee and the campaigns not belonging to Hillary Clinton.\n(AP Photo/Peter Dejong) less French soldiers patrol at the Eiffel Tower which remained closed on the first of three days of national mourning in Paris, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015.\n\u2014 A test of two Republican parties in Texas."}
