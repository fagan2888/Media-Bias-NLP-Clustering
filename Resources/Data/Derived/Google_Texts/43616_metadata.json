(AP) \u2014 Many preseason prognosticators believed Vanderbilt and Virginia had what it took to reach the College World Series finals again.\n\nThat the defending champion Commodores (50-19) returned is testament to their dominant pitching and the steady effort of a veteran group that got every opponent\u2019s best shot.\n\nThat the Cavaliers (42-23) ended up here is nothing short of a surprise given all the obstacles they had to overcome along the way.\n\nThe best-of-three finals start Monday night at TD Ameritrade Park\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve done and certainly glad to be here,\u201d Vandy coach Tim Corbin said Sunday.\n\nVirginia knew its young players would have to develop rapidly for it to make a title run. Injuries to veterans complicated matters. Outfielder Joe McCarthy had back surgery in January, utility man John LaPrise\u2019s season ended after four games because of a hip injury, and ace Nathan Kirby strained a back muscle in mid-April.\n\nThe Cavaliers were just 18-18 in March and April, finished 15-15 in Atlantic Coast Conference play and didn\u2019t qualify for the 10-team league tournament until the last week of the regular season. They were given a No. 3 regional seed and had to go to the West Coast for the start of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nSenior Kenny Towns said his sense of accomplishment is greater than in 2014.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been through this year, the ups and downs of the season, it\u2019s a little bit more satisfying,\u201d he said, \u201cjust because where we\u2019ve come from and how we\u2019ve been able to have the success late in the postseason.\u201d\n\nVanderbilt swept three games in bracket play and is 8-0 in the national tournament. The Commodores dropped 6 of 8 in April, but since losing a series to Florida on May 9 they haven\u2019t lost back-to-back games.\n\nBryan Reynolds and Rhett Wiseman have led the Commodores offensively through the postseason, and a pitching staff featuring first-round draft picks Carson Fulmer and Walker Buehler has a 1.33 ERA in the CWS and an opponent batting average of .163.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defending champ Vandy, Virginia to meet in CWS finals again", "title": "Defending champ Vandy, Virginia to meet in CWS finals again", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Defending champ Vandy, Virginia to meet in CWS finals again", "title": "Defending champ Vandy, Virginia to meet in CWS finals again", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/21/defending_champ_vandy_virginia_to_meet_in_cws_finals_again/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/cws-finals-baseball.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Defending champ Vandy, Virginia to meet in CWS finals again", "title": "Defending champ Vandy, Virginia to meet in CWS finals again", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/cws-finals-baseball.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Olson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(AP) \u2014 Many preseason prognosticators believed Vanderbilt and Virginia had what it took to reach the College World Series finals again.\nThe best-of-three finals start Monday night at TD Ameritrade Park\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve done and certainly glad to be here,\u201d Vandy coach Tim Corbin said Sunday.\nThat the defending champion Commodores (50-19) returned is testament to their dominant pitching and the steady effort of a veteran group that got every opponent\u2019s best shot.\nVirginia knew its young players would have to develop rapidly for it to make a title run.\nThe Commodores dropped 6 of 8 in April, but since losing a series to Florida on May 9 they haven\u2019t lost back-to-back games."}
