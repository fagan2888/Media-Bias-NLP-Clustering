Now is a useful time to assess his progress because the sixth year of any president\u2019s tenure tends to be seen as a low point. Familiarity breeds impatience and frustration \u2014 among commentators, at least, whose narrow focus on which party is perceived as \u201cwinning\u201d the day or the week misses the bigger picture.\n\nIn both the domestic and foreign spheres, Obama has had transformational impact. And there is more to come.\n\nReagan\u2019s great achievement at home was to shift the political spectrum to the right. People tend to forget how radical his ideas once seemed. Tax cuts and massive deregulation were somehow going to produce more revenue? Wealth would inevitably trickle down and benefit the middle class and even the poor? It was not a Democrat but a fellow Republican, George H.W. Bush, who mocked the whole concept as \u201cvoodoo economics.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d still call Reagan\u2019s program, but he altered the political debate to such an extent that what once were fringe ideas came to be seen as centrist. By the time Obama took office, the combination of Reaganite policies \u2014 taken to extremes the Gipper might never have contemplated \u2014 and globalization had produced a nation where the rich were becoming obscenely rich and everyone else was struggling to tread water.\n\nObama\u2019s impact has been to bring the words \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d back into the political lexicon.\n\nHis biggest legislative accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act, is a landmark because it establishes the principle that health care should be considered a right, not a privilege. Democrats such as Harry Truman \u2014 and Republicans such as Richard Nixon \u2014 sought for decades to move the nation toward universal care. The fact that Obama succeeded where others failed is, in itself, a huge achievement.\n\nPerhaps as important, however, is the fact that while Republicans still claim they want to repeal Obamacare, the debate within the party centers on how best to expand health insurance coverage. Returning to the way things were before the ACA is not an option.\n\nHealth care is part of a larger suite of issues on which Obama has swung the pendulum back to the left. He made the case, for example, that more regulation of the financial sector was needed. Republicans were forced to give way. The president has been hammering away in speeches about the need for an increase in the minimum wage. Republicans haven\u2019t caved on this yet, but in the end they almost surely will, because of widespread public support for it.\n\nWhether or not Democrats lose the Senate, Obama will have a tough time getting significant legislation passed in his final two years. Please don\u2019t tell me he simply needs to be a better politician, like Bill Clinton. Obama ran rings around both Clintons in 2008. A black man with the middle name of Hussein who gets elected president twice should be in the all-time-all-world Politics Hall of Fame.\n\nBut he can still have transformational impact. Working through the Environmental Protection Agency, Obama can take major steps to limit carbon emissions. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll go as far as I believe he should, but whatever he does will be, by definition, a big deal.\n\nIn foreign policy, Reagan applied pressure to the weak points of the Soviet empire and helped break it apart. Obama has taken on an equally big and important task: redefining the U.S. role in a vastly changed world.\n\nObama is not the first president to endorse multilateralism but he may be the first to mean it. He agreed to use force in Libya only after France and Britain nominally took the lead. He has kept the NATO allies together in cautiously dealing with the Ukraine crisis. He has refused to be drawn into Syria because he is unsure whether intervention would make the situation better or worse.\n\nThe president realizes that even the most powerful nation on earth cannot mediate every dispute, take sides in all wars, alleviate all suffering. He acknowledges our limitations and more narrowly defines our national interest. The public approves, even if some foreign policy sages are apoplectic.\n\nObama can be reserved and introspective. Usually, however, I find him energized, confident, determined \u2014 and fully aware that he is shifting the ground.\n\nReach Eugene Robinson at eugenerobinson@washpost.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1gpMD7T", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Commentators fail to see just how transformative Barack Obama\u2019s presidency has been.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Commentators fail to see just how transformative Barack Obama\u2019s presidency has been.", "title": "Obama brings back principles of fairness, equality", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/05/15/obama-brings-back-principles-fairness-equality/9095705/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Commentators fail to see just how transformative Barack Obama\u2019s presidency has been.", "title": "Obama brings back principles of fairness, equality", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2da59d19a3bf48dcaaf0d02d02ffea485b5ea7e9/c=0-84-321-405&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/14/robinson.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Barack Obama", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Barack Obama", "title": "Obama brings back principles of fairness, equality", "author": "Eugene Robinson", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04dad3e051ae28ec351d07afcea0debcf22485c5/c=0-30-321-458/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/14/robinson.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b0ac2f5e580858cea06c30902790e1b54135d77a/c=0-84-321-405/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/14/robinson.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/288860d81554cf6e8d5a070153e1750f0bc28e63/c=0-124-321-365/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/14/robinson.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef0d21ca5309d39f01573b0342c99d5edda68426/c=0-154-321-335&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/14/robinson.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-05-14T23:06:34.330000-05:00", "shorthed": "Obama brings back fairness principle", "articleid": 9095705, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ca4a4f0f82032caa95b95c675db1ceadc0f9a63/c=0-154-321-335/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/14/robinson.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/afeee393d7b420f538ffb20c329592ef86989775/c=24-0-298-488/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/14/robinson.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "In both the domestic and foreign spheres, Obama has had transformational impact.\nObama\u2019s impact has been to bring the words \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d back into the political lexicon.\nBut he can still have transformational impact.\nHealth care is part of a larger suite of issues on which Obama has swung the pendulum back to the left.\nObama is not the first president to endorse multilateralism but he may be the first to mean it."}
