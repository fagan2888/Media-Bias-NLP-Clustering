Donnell Barlow, a member of the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, and host of “Dance Jam Kitchen” shows viewers how to make a healthier version of pad thai.

To cut down on carbs, calories, and for those who need to eat gluten free, she substitutes zucchini for noodles.

“Zucchini is also filled with manganese, which helps the body fight free radicals as well as production in collagen, which is good for hair, skin and nails,” she says in the video.

In the video, Barlow walks viewers through making spicy thai chicken, panko crusted tofu, an almond dipping sauce, and fresh spring rolls.
