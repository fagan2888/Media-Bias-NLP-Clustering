Locals cast their lines into the Gulf Saturday morning for the start of recreational red snapper season in Gulf state waters.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission approved a 70 day snapper season, but it only applies to state waters.

This season is 18 days longer than last year, and officials with the FWC say snapper is a very important part of the local economy in coastal Florida communities.

"We have an influx of people who want to take advantage of that its been that way since last summer when red snapper was able to legally be harvested so people are out there trying to take advantage of it opening day," said Drew Nelson with the FWC.

A date for the Federal Gulf waters recreational snapper season has not yet been set.

Nelson says there are size and bag limits for the state season, and you can visit their website for that information: http://myfwc.com/
