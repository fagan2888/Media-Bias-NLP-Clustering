Between the Christian schools, homeschooling, the Christian group home (indoctrinating work camp) and different churches in different cities, I am a psychological, emotional and spiritual mess.\u201d \u2013A former Evangelical\n\nIf a former believer says that Christianity made her depressed, obsessive, or post-traumatic, she is likely to be dismissed as an exaggerator. She might describe panic attacks about the rapture; moods that swung from ecstasy about God\u2019s overwhelming love to suicidal self-loathing about repeated sins; or an obsession with sexual purity.\n\nA symptom like one of these clearly has a religious component, yet many people instinctively blame the victim. They will say that the wounded former believer was prone to anxiety or depression or obsession in the first place\u2014that his Christianity somehow got corrupted by his predisposition to psychological problems. Or they will say that he wasn\u2019t a real Christian. If only he had prayed in faith believing or loved God with all his heart, soul and mind, if only he had really been saved\u2014then he would have experienced the peace that passes all understanding.\n\nBut the reality is far more complex. It is true that symptoms like depression or panic attacks most often strike those of us who are vulnerable, perhaps because of genetics or perhaps because situational stressors have worn us down. But certain aspects of Christian beliefs and Christian living also can create those stressors, even setting up multigenerational patterns of abuse, trauma, and self-abuse. Also, over time some religious beliefs can create habitual thought patterns that actually alter brain function, making it difficult for people to heal or grow.\n\nThe purveyors of religion insist that their product is so powerful it can transform a life, but somehow, magically, it has no risks. In reality, when a medicine is powerful, it usually has the potential to be toxic, especially in the wrong combination or at the wrong dose. And religion is powerful medicine!\n\nIn this discussion, we focus on the variants of Christianity that are based on a literal interpretation of the Bible. These include Evangelical and fundamentalist churches, the Church of Latter Day Saints, and other conservative sects. These groups share the characteristics of requiring conformity for membership, a view that humans need salvation, and a focus on the spiritual world as superior to the natural world. These views are in contrast to liberal, progressive Christian churches with a humanistic viewpoint, a focus on the present, and social justice.\n\nReligion Exploits Normal Human Mental Processes.\n\nTo understand the power of religion, it is helpful to understand a bit about the structure of the human mind. Much of our mental activity has little to do with rationality and is utterly inaccessible to the conscious mind. The preferences, intentions and decisions that shape our lives are in turn shaped by memories and associations that can get laid down before we even develop the capacity for rational analysis.\n\nAspects of cognition like these determine how we go through life, what causes us distress, which goals we pursue and which we abandon, how we respond to failure, how we respond when other people hurt us\u2014and how we respond when we hurt them. Religion derives its power in large part because it shapes these unconscious processes: the frames, metaphors, intuitions and emotions that operate before we even have a chance at conscious thought.\n\nSome Religious Beliefs and Practices are More Harmful Than Others.\n\nWhen it comes to psychological damage, certain religious beliefs and practices are reliably more toxic than others.\n\nJanet Heimlich is an investigative journalist who has explored religious child maltreatment, which describes abuse and neglect in the service of religious belief. In her book, Breaking their Will,Heimlich identifies three characteristics of religious groups that are particularly prone to harming children. Clinical work with reclaimers, that is, people who are reclaiming their lives and in recovery from toxic religion, suggests that these same qualities put adults at risk, along with a particular set of manipulations found in fundamentalist Christian churches and biblical literalism.\n\n1) Authoritarianism,creates a rigid power hierarchy and demands unquestioning obedience. In major theistic religions, this hierarchy has a god or gods at the top, represented by powerful church leaders who have power over male believers, who in turn have power over females and children. Authoritarian Christian sects often teach that \u201cmale headship\u201d is God\u2019s will. Parents may go so far as beating or starving their children on the authority of godly leaders. A book titled, To Train Up a Child,by minister Michael Pearl and his wife Debi, has been found in the homes of three Christian adoptive families who have punished their children to death.\n\n2) Isolation or separatism,is promoted as a means of maintaining spiritual purity. Evangelical Christians warn against being \u201cunequally yoked\u201d with nonbelievers in marriages and even friendships. New converts often are encouraged to pull away from extended family members and old friends, except when there may be opportunities to convert them. Some churches encourage older members to take in young single adults and house them within a godly context until they find spiritually compatible partners, a process known by cult analysts as \u201cshepherding.\u201d Home schoolers and the Christian equivalent of madrassas cut off children from outside sources of information, often teaching rote learning and unquestioning obedience rather than broad curiosity.\n\n3) Fearof sin, hell, a looming \u201cend-times\u201d apocalypse, or amoral heathens binds people to the group, which then provides the only safe escape from the horrifying dangers on the outside. In Evangelical Hell Houses, Halloween is used as an occasion to terrify children and teens about the tortures that await the damned. In the Left Behind book series and movie, the world degenerates into a bloodbath without the stabilizing presence of believers. Since the religious group is the only alternative to these horrors, anything that threatens the group itself\u2014like criticism, taxation, scientific findings, or civil rights regulations\u2014also becomes a target of fear.\n\nBible Belief Creates an Authoritarian, Isolative, Threat-based Model of Reality\n\nIn Bible-believing Christianity, psychological mind-control mechanisms are coupled with beliefs from the Iron Age, including the belief that women and children are possessions of men, that children who are not hit become spoiled, that each of us is born \u201cutterly depraved\u201d, and that a supernatural being demands unquestioning obedience. In this view, the salvation and righteousness of believers is constantly under threat from outsiders and dark spiritual forces. Consequently, Christians need to separate themselves emotionally, spiritually, and socially from the world.These beliefs are fundamental to their overarching mental framework or \u201cdeep frame\u201d as linguist George Lakoff would call it. Small wonder then, that many Christians emerge wounded.\n\nIt is important to remember that this mindset permeates to a deep subconscious level. This is a realm of imagery, symbols, metaphor, emotion, instinct, and primary needs. Nature and nurture merge into a template for viewing the world which then filters every experience. The template selectively allows only the information that confirms their model of reality, creating a subjective sense of its veracity.\n\nOn the societal scale, humanity has been going through a massive shift for centuries, transitioning from a supernatural view of a world dominated by forces of good and evil to a natural understanding of the universe. The Bible-based Christian population however, might be considered a subset of the general population that is still within the old framework, that is, supernaturalism.\n\nChildren are Targeted for Indoctrination Because the Child Mind is Uniquely Vulnerable.\n\n\u201cHere I am, a fifty-one year old college professor, still smarting from the wounds inflicted by the righteous when I was a child. It is a slow, festering wound, one that smarts every day\u2014in some way or another\u2026. I thought I would leave all of that \u201cGod loves\u2026 God hates\u2026\u201d stuff behind, but not so. Such deep and confusing fear is not easily forgotten. It pops up in my perfectionism, my melancholy mood, the years of being obsessed with finding the assurance of personal salvation.\u201d\n\nNowhere is the contrast of viewpoints more stark than in the secular and religious understandings of childhood. In the biblical view, a child is not a being that is born with amazing capabilities that will emerge with the right conditions like a beautiful flower in a well-attended garden. Rather, a child is born in sin, weak, ignorant, and rebellious, needing discipline to learn obedience. Independent thinking is dangerous pride.\n\nBecause the child\u2019s mind is uniquely susceptible to religious ideas, religious indoctrination particularly targets vulnerable young children. Cognitive development before age seven lacks abstract reasoning. Thinking is magical and primitive, black and white. Also, young humans are wired to obey authority because they are dependent on their caregivers just for survival. Much of their brain growth and development has to happen after birth, which means that children are extremely vulnerable to environmental influences in the first few years when neuronal pathways are formed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some religious beliefs may alter brain function, making us more prone to anxiety and depression", "title": "The sad, twisted truth about conservative Christianity\u2019s effect on the mind", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Some religious beliefs may alter brain function, making us more prone to anxiety and depression", "title": "The sad, twisted truth about conservative Christianity\u2019s effect on the mind", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bible_in_hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some religious beliefs may alter brain function, making us more prone to anxiety and depression", "title": "The sad, twisted truth about conservative Christianity\u2019s effect on the mind", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bible_in_hands.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Marlene Winell and Valerie Tarico", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bible, Christianity, Conservatives", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd1c\"", "article_summary": "But certain aspects of Christian beliefs and Christian living also can create those stressors, even setting up multigenerational patterns of abuse, trauma, and self-abuse.\nThese views are in contrast to liberal, progressive Christian churches with a humanistic viewpoint, a focus on the present, and social justice.\nAlso, over time some religious beliefs can create habitual thought patterns that actually alter brain function, making it difficult for people to heal or grow.\nWhen it comes to psychological damage, certain religious beliefs and practices are reliably more toxic than others.\nSome Religious Beliefs and Practices are More Harmful Than Others."}
