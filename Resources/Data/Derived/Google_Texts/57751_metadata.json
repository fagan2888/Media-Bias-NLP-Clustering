Complaints of heavy-handedness led them to take for themselves the power to appoint committees and assign legislation to them, leaving him just presiding.\n\nThat arrangement triggered problems when responsibility was too splinted, and the GOP majority eventually restored most of his traditional powers.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like to talk about.\n\n\u201cRehashing the past isn\u2019t productive, and I am confident that we will continue our cooperative, effective relationship with my colleagues in the state Senate,\u201d he said.\n\nShould Stokes win, she can expect the same experience since Republicans are certain to control the Senate again, and it\u2019s the tactic they used the last time a Democrat was lieutenant governor and they had the majority.\n\nStokes isn\u2019t worried about that or with having to work with a governor of a different party.\n\n\u201cThe constitution gives me power as lieutenant governor to be president of the Senate, which is a leadership position,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019s assured she can reason with people who disagree with her.\n\nOf course, Cagle could find himself playing second fiddle to a Democratic governor if Jason Carter wins, but that is a possibility he didn\u2019t want to discuss either.\n\n\u201cI am confident Governor Deal will be successful and don\u2019t see engaging in hypotheticals to be productive,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his time in office, Cagle has poured his energy primarily into two projects.\n\nOne is a pool of taxpayer funds and venture-capital cash that will be invested in start-up companies as a way to eventually stimulate job creation.\n\nThe second is a growing network of high schools called career academies that offer technical skills and some college courses. He wants to have more of them across the state.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I am committed to expanding our efforts to ensure our students have the skills they need to compete in the 21st Century global economy by launching a world-class apprenticeship program that exposes children to the experience and skills needed to get a job,\u201d he said.\n\nStokes, though, blames him for what she considers inadequate funding of public schools. She argues that enough waste can be cut to boost education funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s budgetary,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we have no debt in education.\u201d\n\nAn additional priority of hers is the expansion of Medicaid by using financial incentives in the federal Affordable Care Act. Although Republicans say state taxpayers can\u2019t afford it, according to her, expansion would actually boost the economy and create health care jobs while extending benefits to more people.\n\nStokes\u2019 other goals are ensuring more women are appointed to state boards and that women and men earn equal pay.\n\nFollow Walter Jones on Twitter @MorrisNews and Facebook or contact him at walter.jones@morris.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Election, Local News, Walter C.
