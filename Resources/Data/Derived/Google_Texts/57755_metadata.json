Berger, an attorney at Ford & Harrison in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the term \u2018voluntary\u2019 confusing is the fact the ACA authorizes a more nominal surcharge or financial incentive,\u201d Svatek says. \u201cAt point does a financial inducement turn a wellness program from voluntary to involuntary? That answer is still to be determined.\u201d\n\nBut Tom Harrington, an attorney at Washington, D.C.-based The Employment Law Group, says that \u201cThe EEOC has provided guidance on how it interprets \u2018voluntary.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the EEOC, a wellness program is \u2018voluntary\u2019 as long as an employer neither requires participation nor penalizes employees who do not participate,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cThis is the key issue: such wellness programs have to actually be voluntary. They can\u2019t compel participation by imposing enormous penalties such as shifting 100% of the premium cost for health benefits onto the back of the employee or by just firing the employee who chooses not to participate.\"\n\n\n\nThe current scenario doesn't quite offer that freedom of choice.\n\n\n\n\"Having to choose between responding to medical exams and inquiries -- which are not job-related -- in a wellness program, on the one hand, or being fired, on the other hand, is no choice at all payment,\u201d Harrington says. Savings is an issue for both employees and employers.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "In an effort to protect employees against discrimination based on disability, the EEOC published its proposed rule on the application of the ADA to employer wellness programs.", "author": "S.Z.
