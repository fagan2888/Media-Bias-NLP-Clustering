REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES) US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN 2008 (USA) - RTR1WZCR\n\n4371513\n\nConservatives are sending a message to Senate GOP leaders: Keep the nuclear option!\n\nIn a letter obtained first by The Daily Caller, about 20 conservative leaders are pleading with the GOP leadership in the Senate not to do away with the drastic rules put into place by Harry Reid in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe decision by Senator Reid and his Democratic colleagues to deploy the so-called \u2018nuclear option\u2019 was transparently designed to facilitate the confirmation of judicial nominees who would insulate Obamacare and other aspects of President Obama\u2019s agenda from meaningful judicial review,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cRegardless of their motives, we see very little upside and significant downside in reviving the judicial filibuster.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Senate Democrats \u2014 led by Reid, the Senate majority leader \u2014 took the drastic step of changing the body\u2019s rules to prevent the minority party from being able to filibuster most of the president\u2019s nominees.\n\nBy employing the so-called nuclear option, Democrats changed the rules so that nominations voted on by the Senate \u2014 such as cabinet positions or appeals court judges \u2014 only need a majority of votes to pass, instead of the traditional 60 votes.\n\nRepublicans opposed Reid implementing the nuclear option in 2013. Now that Republicans are poised to take back control of the Senate in January, some conservatives are worried that Republicans will push to restore the old rules.\n\nOne conservative said that it\u2019s believed that Republican Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona are among those pushing to do away with the nuclear option.\n\nBut the fear among conservatives is fairness, especially when there is a Republican in the White House in the future.\n\n\u201cThe net result of a Republican effort to revive the judicial filibuster would be a self-imposed 60-vote threshold for Republican nominees and a 50-vote threshold for Democratic nominees,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nAmong those who signed the letter, being sent to elected officials on Wednesday: Gary Bauer of American Values, Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee and Phyllis Schlafly of Eagle Forum.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter\n\nREAD THE MEMO:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "'We see very little upside'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Conservatives are sending a message to Senate GOP leaders: Keep the nuclear option!
