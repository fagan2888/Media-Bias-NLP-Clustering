(We) came out like zombies to start the second half and we didn\u2019t give up. \u2026 Was proud of the way they played in the second half. More importantly, they didn\u2019t give up, made some good things happen.\u201d\n\nFreshmen Durand Johnson and Federico Mussini helped St. John\u2019s get back in the game after they fell behind 46-26 with 16 minutes left.\n\n\u201cIt is hard,\u201d Johnson said of the losing streak. \u201cEveryone wants to win.\u201d\n\nHe finished with 20 points while Mussini added 19, all in the second half. This is the worst start in the Big East since for St. John\u2019s since losing the first 10 conference games in 2003-04.\n\nSt. John\u2019s (7-13, 0-7 Big East) only trailed 22-21 early on before Marquette used a 24-5 run that spanned the half to build its big lead. The Red Storm then started pressing and forcing turnovers to get back in the game.\n\nMussini\u2019s 3-pointer with 5:59 left made it 61-59 and had the spirited crowd into the game. After Marquette got the lead back up to seven with 1:44 left, Johnson hit consecutive 3-pointers to get the Red Storm within 76-73 with 41.5 seconds left. Henry Ellenson missed a contested drive in the lane with 13 seconds left giving the Red Storm one last chance. But Mussini\u2019s contested 3-pointer was short with a second left and Ellenson hit two free throws to seal the victory.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to hit the 3-point shot, down by 3,\u201d Mussini said of his last-second chance. \u201cI thought it was going to go in. From what I was seeing it was straight on.\u201d\n\nFreshman Kassoum Yakwe added seven points, eight rebounds and seven blocks for the Red Storm, who have a bright future.\n\n\u201cChris is doing a great job with his team. It\u2019s not easy when you take over a program,\u201d Marquette coach Steve Wojciechowski said. This conference is a bear. \u2026 They\u2019re getting better all the time. Chris will have St. John\u2019s rolling in no time.\u201d\n\nDuane Wilson scored 17 points and Ellenson had 16 points and 18 rebounds to lead the Golden Eagles (13-7, 3-5).\n\nThe game was originally supposed to be played Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, but was moved to Sunday after a winter storm dropped nearly 27 inches of snow in New York.\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nMarquette: Ellenson has already earned Big East freshman of the week honors three times this season. \u2026 Marquette\u2019s last trip to New York was successful as the Golden Eagles won the Legends Classic at the Barclays Center in November.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the midst of the worst losing streak in school history, St. John's showed fight in its 10th straight loss.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/wilson-with-17-points-marquette-holds-off-st-johns/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "In the midst of the worst losing streak in school history, St. John\u2019s showed fight in its 10th straight loss.", "title": "Wilson with 17 points, Marquette holds off St. John\u2019s 78-73"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "In the midst of the worst losing streak in school history, St. John's showed fight in its 10th straight loss.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wilson with 17 points, Marquette holds off St. John\u2019s 78-73"}, "Author": "DOUG FEINBERG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Chris will have St. John\u2019s rolling in no time.\u201dDuane Wilson scored 17 points and Ellenson had 16 points and 18 rebounds to lead the Golden Eagles (13-7, 3-5).\nNEW YORK (AP) - In the midst of the worst losing streak in school history, St. John\u2019s showed fight in its 10th straight loss.\nThis is the worst start in the Big East since for St. John\u2019s since losing the first 10 conference games in 2003-04.\nTrailing by 20 early in the second half, the Red Storm rallied to within three in the final minute before falling 78-73 to Marquette on Sunday.\n(We) came out like zombies to start the second half and we didn\u2019t give up."}
