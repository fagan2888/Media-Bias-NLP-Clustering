Douglas Elmendorf, who ended in March a six-year run as director of the Congressional Budget Office, will be the new dean of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, the university said Thursday.

Mr. Elmendorf was widely respected heading the powerful nonpolitical office that holds considerable power over spending, tax and budget proposals from the White House and Congress. He took over the office days after President Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, and oversaw the CBO’s projections of the $787 billion economic stimulus package and the Affordable Care Act, two of the most complex pieces of legislation in recent decades.

Mr. Elmendorf, who completed his graduate studies in economics at Harvard and taught for five years as an assistant professor, worked in the Clinton administration’s Council of Economic Advisers under then-chairwoman Janet Yellen, who now leads the Federal Reserve, and in the Clinton Treasury Department.

He was named to the CBO post by Democratic leaders in Congress in 2009 and reappointed to a full four-year term in 2011. Some Republican-leaning economists had called on Republicans to reappoint him when his term expired this year. Republicans selected economist Keith Hall to replace Mr. Elmendorf in April.

In a statement released by the university, Mr. Elmendorf said he was honored to be chosen for the job. “During my public service, I have seen firsthand the essential role of innovative policy ideas and outstanding people to put those ideas into practice, and the Harvard Kennedy School is the pre-eminent provider of both to governments in this country and around the world,” he said.
