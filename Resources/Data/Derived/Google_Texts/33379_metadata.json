Until now.\n\nThat's because since my last visit Dr. K had changed to a \u201cconcierge medical practice.\u201d In order to continue receiving his healing touch, I would need to pay an annual \u201cmembership fee\u201d of $2,500.\n\nI learned this while being examined by his perky new nurse practitioner Maggie, who handed me Dr. K's brochure, \u201cPutting Patients at the Center of Health Care.\u201d As a paid-up member, I could count on such benefits as a custom-tailored wellness plan; on-time, \u201cunhurried\u201d appointments; the doctor\u2019s 24/7 availability by phone, email or text; and to top it off, Dr. K's \u201cundivided attention.\u201d I could even secure visits for friends and family\u2014all for just $6.75 per day.\n\nNurse Maggie comforted me with the knowledge that if I opted for non-membership, Dr. K would still oversee my care, just at a distance, without actually seeing me. And I could continue to take advantage of everything his rabbit-warren office has to offer, which I took to mean a free supply of tongue depressors and blood pressure tests for the asking.\n\nFeeling around my lymph glands, Maggie thought I might have a low-grade infection and jet lag from a recent trip to California. She suggested I take zinc and Vitamin D\u2014and pick up a contract form at the front desk if I was interested in joining Dr. K's inner circle of patients.\n\nBumping into the doc on my way out, I asked him what's what. He immediately swooshed me into an examining room and explained his switch.\n\n\"You gotta understand\u2014this is the only viable economic model for me to continue practicing,\" he said. \"I'm an internist\u2014not a surgeon replacing hips and knees at $25,000 a pop, or a GI guy racking up colonoscopies and endoscopies. All I have to offer is my time and advice, and under Obamacare, I'm earning $40 an hour to service everyone who walks in the door. After nearly 30 years I can't operate like that any longer.\"\n\nBut everything on his members\u2019 checklist were items I expected already as a longtime patient, I explained. Did I suddenly want hurried visits or his divided attention?\n\n\u201cYou're a reasonably healthy guy, who comes in a few times a year for this or that and doesn\u2019t require a lot of attention. In all honesty, you probably don't need this level of elevated care,\u201d he admitted.\n\n\u201cBut for the millennials and older patients, and those who have a lot of questions and special needs and touch points, this package is really a great deal and will let me stay in business with a core group of patients willing to pay for premium service,\u201d he said in as much time as it could have taken to check out my symptoms.\n\nHe had a point: Like everything else, you get what you pay for. However, I already was paying a hefty premium of $2,500 a month for the privilege of seeing him under my Oxford Freedom Plan policy. If Dr. K was now calling himself a concierge, couldn\u2019t I at least expect him to score tickets to Hamilton or a reservation at Pasquale Jones, rather than merely offering his cellphone number?\n\nBeing in the service business myself, I wonder if I could convince clients to switch to my concierge PR practice. They\u2019re welcome to avail themselves of my state-of-the-art phone and media database (sorry, my fax is on the fritz). But if they want my brilliant insights or their calls returned, that'll be extra on top of the retainer. I doubt I\u2019d get any takers.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no payer system like health care, where a third-party warps the relationship between buyer and seller. Imagine if you could subscribe to a service called Oxford Freedom Dining for $30,000 a year, ensuring a seat and covering the cost of a meal at hundreds of restaurants around town; you\u2019d only be obliged to drop a $30 co-pay for your octopus salad with hearts of palm. Sounds great, but don't expect the hostess to seat you right away or the waiter to be so quick with the giant pepper mill. It wouldn\u2019t be long before every chef and restaurateur would shift to members-only dining, drawing a sizable following.\n\nThe trend in breakaway MD practices is certain to climb, especially among solo practitioners and small groups forced to take higher patient populations with smaller reimbursement.\n\nConcierge Medicine Today, an Atlanta news site covering the niche, reports a steady growth of members-only practices in the New York area over the last several years, including many with specialties in cardiology, gerontology, pain management and other areas in addition to internal medicine. The site estimates a count of around 140 verified practices in the New York area and perhaps as many \u201cunder the radar\u201d offerings, since concierge medicine for now remains a branded business model and not a certified designation or one recognized by the American Medical Association. Nationally, Concierge Medicine Today projects as many as 6,000 concierge doctors.\n\nIt may not be long before whole stretches of Park and Fifth Avenue become known as Concierge Row, or when a theater-goer is stricken to hear the call go out: \u201cIs there a concierge in the house?\u201d\n\nI just wasn\u2019t ready to join the club. And so, I bid farewell to Dr. \u201cNot So Special\u201d K. But I was still feeling lethargic and wondered where to turn. Urgent care? Nah\u2014they\u2019re just ER rooms with nice carpeting. One of those house-call specialists? I didn\u2019t feel that sick.\n\nI decided to call on a family friend, an old-fashioned general practitioner affiliated with Columbia University Medical Center. At a first visit, Dr. M. gave me a total work-up\u2014bloods, urine and EKG included\u2014and called me first thing the next morning to deliver his diagnosis: \u201cWhatever you\u2019re feeling will go away in a few days. You\u2019re a healthy man,\u201d he assured. Plus, he gave me a great stock tip.\n\nAfter thanking him for such quality care, I asked him nervously if he would ever convert to a concierge practice. \u201cSure,\u201d he replied. \u201cI always wanted to work at the Ritz-Carlton.\u201d\n\nAllan Ripp runs a press relations firm in New York.\n\nGet Crain's Daily Alert Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter.
