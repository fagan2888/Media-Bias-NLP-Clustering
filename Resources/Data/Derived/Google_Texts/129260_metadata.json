Even if you haven\u2019t yet found the candidate who will make you swoon, one thing you\u2019ve got is choices. By my count, there are currently 10 candidates who are declared or all but certain to run, and another four who will probably run. But while the voters might find this an embarrassment of riches, for the party\u2019s leaders and financiers, it looks like a recipe for trouble. Which is how I interpret this news:\n\nIn a Saturday interview on the Larry Kudlow Show, a nationally syndicated radio broadcast, David Koch let it slip that the roughly $900 million that he and his brother, Charles, plan to lavish on the 2016 presidential race could find its way into the hands of more than one GOP contender. \u201cWe are thinking of supporting several Republicans,\u201d David Koch said, adding, \u201cIf we\u2019re happy with the policies that these individuals are supporting, we\u2019ll finance their campaigns.\u201d Koch said the brothers would begin writing checks to individual candidates in \u201cthe primary season, winter and next spring.\u201d\n\nUp until now, the Koch brothers hadn\u2019t indicated that they\u2019d be taking a side in the primaries. It almost seemed that they viewed that as the kind of thing amateurs like Sheldon Adelson do, throwing money at some candidate based on overly irrational personal feelings, while they keep focused on the real goal of getting a Republican \u2014 any Republican \u2014 into the White House. By saying they\u2019re going to support several candidates in the primaries, the Kochs are pledging to accelerate the winnowing process, by which the race\u2019s chaff can be sloughed off and the focus can stay on the serious contenders.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the line about them supporting all the ones whose policies they\u2019re happy with. That\u2019s because there\u2019s almost no disagreement among the candidates, at least on the issues the Kochs care about. All of them would like to see low taxes on the wealthy (most have even advocated a flat tax, a boon to people like the Kochs), a dramatic reduction in regulations that affect corporations and a rollback of the social safety net. Where the Kochs personally disagree with the candidates (as they may on some social issues or on immigration), they disagree with all the candidates, because the candidates\u2019 positions are so similar.\n\nSo mark my words: If the Kochs pick out a few candidates to support, it will be the ones they think would be the strongest in a general election and those they think put the best face on the GOP.\n\nAnd the Kochs aren\u2019t the only ones trying to do this winnowing. Fox News, which always keeps the long-term interests of the Republican Party in mind, recently announced that in the first debate of the season, it will be refusing admittance to all but 10 candidates. The excluded ones will in all likelihood find themselves caught in a vicious cycle where they can\u2019t get coverage because they aren\u2019t being taken seriously, and the can\u2019t get taken seriously because they aren\u2019t getting coverage. Ten is still a large number of candidates, but that first debate will be a key moment in the winnowing process.\n\nSo as open as the campaign is, certain key players still have ways to at least try to rein it in. But their power is limited. One result of the newly freewheeling nature of presidential elections is that a rich donor or two can prop up the candidacy of someone with little chance to win the party\u2019s nomination, enabling him or her to stick around and cause trouble months after he or she ought to have departed the race. This year, multiple candidates could have billionaires feeding them the money they need to keep their campaigns active deep into the primary season. If you\u2019re a thoughtful Republican, a primary with this many candidates is a cacophonous mess, full of extremist cranks squabbling with each other and taking progressively nastier potshots at the leaders, one of whom will end up as the nominee. The longer it goes, the more that nominee has to pander to the base and the less time he or she will have to focus on Hillary Clinton.\n\nIf the Kochs are ready to put some of their ample resources into the primary campaign, it\u2019s a sign that the enormous size of the primary field is generating some serious concern at the top of the GOP. The question is whether, even with their money, there\u2019s much they can do about it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Republican voters might find the large field of presidential contenders an embarrassment of riches, for the party's leaders and financiers, it looks like a recipe for trouble.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "While Republican voters might find the large field of presidential contenders an embarrassment of riches, for the party's leaders and financiers, it looks like a recipe for trouble.", "title": "The Koch brothers try to rein in the GOP presidential clown show", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/25/the-koch-brothers-try-to-rein-in-the-gop-presidential-clown-show/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2014/03/Forbeswealthy_4.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/25/the-koch-brothers-try-to-rein-in-the-gop-presidential-clown-show/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "gop nomination, republican nomination, koch brothers; campaign funding, 2016 presidential campaign, fox news debate,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "gop nomination, republican nomination, koch brothers; campaign funding, 2016 presidential campaign, fox news debate,"}, "article_summary": "Charles Koch, left (Associated Press) and David Koch (Bloomberg)If you\u2019re a Republican primary voter, you\u2019re probably feeling pretty good about the presidential primaries.\nThis year, multiple candidates could have billionaires feeding them the money they need to keep their campaigns active deep into the primary season.\nSo as open as the campaign is, certain key players still have ways to at least try to rein it in.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the line about them supporting all the ones whose policies they\u2019re happy with.\nEven if you haven\u2019t yet found the candidate who will make you swoon, one thing you\u2019ve got is choices."}
