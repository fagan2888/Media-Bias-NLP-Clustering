DMC: LIFE AS A FOR-PROFIT DMC made efforts under Vanguard to improve care

Detroit Medical Center's CEO Joe Mullany said the health system put several initiatives in place to increase quality of care since it became an investor-owned hospital system in 2011.



Suzanne White, M.D., DMC's chief medical officer, said reducing medical errors and improving patient safety have been the top priority.



"We know we have areas for improvement," White said. "There were significant changes when we became part of Vanguard."



White said DMC instituted the Safety for Life program under former CEO Mike Duggan, who now is mayor of Detroit. For example, all 14,000 employees in early 2012 went through quality training.



Mullany said that quality has been maintained or improved throughout DMC since it became investor-owned.



That's hard to measure, given the dozens of publicly available quality and patient safety measures to analyze.



On the one hand, DMC Harper University Hospital and DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital — two of DMC's largest hospitals — scored lower than Michigan averages in most patient experience questions on www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov, one of a number of growing websites people can visit to research hospital quality.
