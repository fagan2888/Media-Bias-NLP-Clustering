It\u2019s a question that bounces back and forth in the blogosphere. Are elites, economic and otherwise, happy with the pace of the weak recovery? Are they indifferent? Or are they actively worse off than they would be if unemployment were lower?\n\nThis question comes up when Emmanuel Saez updates his data on the incomes of the top one percent. Most of the coverage has focused on the rate of change for incomes of the top one percent, particularly the fact that the top one percent have enjoyed 95 percent of all income growth from 2009 to 2012. But I want to focus on levels. I\u2019m going to modify one of Saez\u2019s charts to show something I don\u2019t think has been pointed out:\n\nThis is the percentage of all income, excluding capital gains, that goes to the top one percent. And as you can see, it\u2019s not just back where it was before the recession; it\u2019s far exceeded that benchmark. And it\u2019s exceeded all the years on record, with the one exception of 1928.\n\nOver the past 20 years, this percentage dropped after each recession. If you look, you can see it drop in the early 1990s and 2000s. However, it then recovered and exceeded the old rates.\n\nWe saw this rate fall in the Great Recession. The obvious question was whether this would be a permanent break or whether it would recover and exceed the old rate. That question is now answered. As noted, the only year on record in which the top one percent took home a larger piece of the economic pie was in 1928, and then only barely.\n\nThis excludes volatile capital income, in part to see a cleaner trend and in part because tax changes from the fiscal cliff and Obamacare probably influenced the 2012 results. But the trend is nearly the same with capital gains, where this year\u2019s 22.4 percent share for the top one percent is closing in on 2007\u2032s 23.5 percent share (and 1928\u2032s record high 23.9 percent). This pattern is also true when using average incomes.\n\nBut this one chart is something I\u2019ve particularly watched during the Great Recession. Because you could, at one point, say that the rich had taken a huge fall in the Great Recession, and therefore it was in everyone\u2019s interest to get the economy back on track. That is harder to say today, and it will be harder to say next year as these trends continue in the absence of policy action.\n\n(Mike Konczal is a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, on whose blog his post first appeared.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rich-man-cash.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cec\"", "article_summary": "But this one chart is something I\u2019ve particularly watched during the Great Recession.\nAnd it\u2019s exceeded all the years on record, with the one exception of 1928.\nWe saw this rate fall in the Great Recession.\nAnd as you can see, it\u2019s not just back where it was before the recession; it\u2019s far exceeded that benchmark.\nThis excludes volatile capital income, in part to see a cleaner trend and in part because tax changes from the fiscal cliff and Obamacare probably influenced the 2012 results."}
