TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) — Terry Labonte will compete in his final NASCAR race Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway.

The two-time Cup champion ran 26 full seasons at NASCAR’s top level, and a partial schedule the last decade. Labonte first announced his retirement in 2006, at home track Texas Motor Speedway, but he’s raced 41 times since.

“You know, it’s only about the third time I’ve said this is going to be my last race,” he said Saturday. “But this is really going to be the last one. It’s been fun.”

Labonte, who turns 58 next month, had four scheduled races this season with Go FAS Racing and good friend and crew chief/owner Frank Stoddard. All four were at Daytona and Talladega, and he finished a season-best 11th at Daytona in July.

The final start for “Texas Terry” will be the 890th of his career, which is tied for third in NASCAR. It will be his 61st start at Talladega, which is tied for the most.

Labonte won his Cup titles in 1984 and 1996, and has 22 career victories. He drove 10 full seasons for Billy Hagan, three for Junior Johnson and 11 for Rick Hendrick. He also has driven for Richard Petty, Roger Staubach/Troy Aikman, Joe Gibbs and Michael Waltrip through his career.

Labonte cited his 1999 win at Texas as one of the “coolest” memories of his career.

“That’s the first time I think I ever noticed a crowd,” he said. “I was passing Dale Jarrett. We had really run good all day and they beat us on a pit stop and I ran him down and passed him with less than 10 laps to go and I saw the whole place stand up.
