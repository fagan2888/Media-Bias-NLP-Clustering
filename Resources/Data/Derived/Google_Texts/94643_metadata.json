Tom Wolf said Thursday.\n\nThe state recently tweaked CHIP by adjusting limits and co-pays on things such as preventive care, dental and orthodontic care, and eyeglasses.\n\nPrior to that, CHIP fell short of minimum benefits requirements of the Affordable Care Act, and some Pennsylvania families faced penalties for having coverage that failed to meet essential benefits requirements.\n\nThe penalties would have applied to about 3,600 families with higher incomes who pay the full cost of CHIP coverage, which covers children up to 18.\n\nThe changes to CHIP take effect Dec. 1. However, the state has obtained federal waivers and extensions so that the families won't be penalized for having the non-compliant coverage before Dec. 1.\n\nWolf announced Thursday the improved benefits will extend to all children covered by CHIP.\n\nMost of the 148,000 Pennsylvania children covered by CHIP come from families who qualify for state-subsidized coverage. For example, families earning up to $50,440 for a family of four pay nothing, and families with higher incomes pay from $49 to $77 per child. Families with incomes of more than $76,145 for a family of four can buy into CHIP at the state's cost, which is about $214 per child.\n\nMore information is available at www.CHIPcoversPAkids.com or by calling 1-800-986-KIDS.\n\nNote: this article has been revised.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Tom Wolfe, health care, politics, wolf, news", "title": "No Obamacare tax penalties for Pa.
