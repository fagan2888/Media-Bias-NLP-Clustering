Having cancer and ObamaCare can be a nightmare.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, \u201cHundreds of thousands of people lose subsidies under the health law, or even their policies, when they get tangled in a web of paperwork problems involving income, citizenship and taxes. Some are dealing with serious illnesses like cancer.\u201d\n\nIt hardly comes as a surprise that deeper government involvement in health insurance has led to increased red tape for patients. The American Action Forum estimates that the regulations issued under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u201cwill cost businesses and individuals more than $45 billion and will require approximately 165 million hours of paperwork in order to comply.\u201d\n\nNow imagine you\u2019re a cancer patient of modest means trying to figure out which ObamaCare policy to buy that will both cover your treatment, preferably at the provider of your choice, and be, as the law\u2019s moniker suggests, affordable. Then imagine that you get churned about in the wheels of bureaucracy and end up with either no coverage or coverage you can\u2019t afford.\n\nWalt Whitlow, a self-employed remodeling contractor from Volente, Texas, who suffers from throat cancer, told the AP his subsidy was revoked without his knowledge, causing his premium to quadruple and his deductible to more than quintuple \u2014 a state of affairs he discovered only when his doctor\u2019s office called.\n\n\u201cI was really impressed with the quality of care, but the paperwork was just unbelievable,\u201d said Whitlow, who told the news agency he had submitted bank statements to Healthcare.gov to prove his income. He appealed his case and eventually won, but only with the assistance of Foundation Communities, a nonprofit in Austin.\n\nAna Granado, a legal immigrant from Brazil who lives with her daughter in Charlotte, North Carolina, obtained coverage under the ACA despite already having been diagnosed with cancer, exactly as the law is ostensibly designed to work. But when it came time for her reconstructive surgery, \u201cshe was notified that her coverage would be canceled because of questions about her immigration status,\u201d wrote the AP. That issue was resolved quickly, but then her subsidy was suspended over income questions. Although she also won that battle \u2014 both wins courtesy of assistance from Charlotte-based Legal Services of Southern Piedmont \u2014 she said the fight had been \u201ca huge stress,\u201d something a cancer patient hardly needs.\n\nThose subsidies, by the way, are a big deal; without them, plans offered under the ACA are rarely affordable.\n\n\u201cWhen people get that bill for a full-price plan, they panic and they cancel the insurance,\u201d Foundation Communities\u2019 Elizabeth Colvin told the AP.\n\nThat is exactly what Lynn Herrin of Wimberley, Texas, did. Herrin, a widow who had sold a family business, bought ObamaCare exchange coverage in 2014, receiving a subsidy based on her projected income. Come tax time, however, she learned that she owed the government $700. Between that unwelcome surprise and the fact that, as is typical with exchange plans, Herrin had trouble finding a doctor who would take hers, she canceled her policy \u2014 only to be diagnosed with oral and neck cancer just months later, the treatment for which cost her about $70,000. She got a new policy this year.\n\n\u201cI ended up getting mad about it and just canceling, but I\u2019m the one who screwed up,\u201d Herrin told the AP. \u201cIt did make me mad that they quoted me an amount, and then I filled out my taxes and I owed. I don\u2019t think it is fair.\u201d\n\nFair or not, such paperwork issues plague a large number of Americans, reported the AP:\n\nThe government says about 470,000 people had coverage terminated through Sept. 30 last year because of unresolved documentation issues involving citizenship and immigration. During the same time, more than 1 million households had their financial assistance \u201cadjusted\u201d because of income discrepancies. Advocates say \u201cadjusted\u201d usually means the subsidies get eliminated.\n\nMuch of this is the result of provisions of the ACA and subsequent regulations designed to ensure that only those eligible for subsidies receive them. \u201cBut,\u201d noted the AP, \u201cHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell recently acknowledged the paperwork tangle is more likely to trap the innocent than fraudsters.\u201d Healthcare.gov has also purportedly been upgraded to reduce these types of bureaucratic bugaboos.\n\nOther cancer patients have suffered less from paperwork than from the collapse of the ObamaCare co-ops.\n\nIn New York, for instance, 250 cancer patients who were receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nearly lost both their coverage and their provider when the Empire State\u2019s co-op, Health Republic, announced last year it was shutting down after losing $130 million, stranding 100,000 New Yorkers without coverage. Of those 250 cancer patients, 114 \u2014 supposedly those undergoing active treatment at the time \u2014 were rescued by New York City taxpayers when the city\u2019s public health system agreed to cover them through 2016.\n\nThe Tennessee co-op, Community Health Alliance, shut its door at the end of 2015, leaving about 27,000 Volunteer Staters without coverage and causing more red tape and anxiety for those in the midst of treatment. John Vickers of Knoxville, who was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer last year, told WATE-TV that the change of insurers has wreaked havoc on his course of treatment. Vickers said the co-op paid for his surgery in November, and he bought exchange coverage through United Healthcare because it seemed the best fit for his treatment and had Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center in its network. But after he ended up hospitalized in early January, he found out Fort Sanders wasn\u2019t in his plan\u2019s network after all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that three day stay in the hospital is going to be expensive,\u201d Vickers said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a $50,000 copay to meet.\u201d\n\nVickers was later treated at his previous medical center under a special waiver, only to be told once again he wouldn\u2019t be covered, costing him about $25,000 more. That\u2019s \u201caffordable\u201d healthcare for you, courtesy of Uncle Sam.\n\nSuch troubles for patients do not bode well for the future of ObamaCare, which has some ACA advocates worried.\n\n\u201cThese problems can grow, and they can contribute to undermining consumer faith in the system, and that could lead to attrition,\u201d Rachel Klein of the pro-ObamaCare organization Families USA told the AP.\n\nThe alternative, however, is for people to remain in the system and keep dealing with the stress and uncertainty of red tape and coverage changes; and few are likely to want to do that, particularly if they are healthy. Besides, the more people suffer under ObamaCare, the more urgent the push for repeal will become.\n\nIn other words, whether the exchanges limp along or go belly up, pro-ObamaCare forces stand to lose \u2014 which makes for a favorable prognosis for Americans\u2019 health and liberty.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, paperwork, co-op, failures, cancer patients", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/22569-cancer-and-obamacare-a-double-whammy", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/15d09223fb7f4c09b3993c213843bf44_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Americans, including many cancer patients, are finding their troubles multiplied by ObamaCare paperwork and co-op failures. by Michael Tennant", "title": "Cancer and ObamaCare: a Double Whammy"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/15d09223fb7f4c09b3993c213843bf44_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Other cancer patients have suffered less from paperwork than from the collapse of the ObamaCare co-ops.\nHaving cancer and ObamaCare can be a nightmare.\nSuch troubles for patients do not bode well for the future of ObamaCare, which has some ACA advocates worried.\nHerrin, a widow who had sold a family business, bought ObamaCare exchange coverage in 2014, receiving a subsidy based on her projected income.\nBesides, the more people suffer under ObamaCare, the more urgent the push for repeal will become."}
