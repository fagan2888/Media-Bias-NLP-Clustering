I didn\u2019t vote for anybody. I couldn\u2019t vote for a war criminal. He\u2019s tied to war crimes and drones dropping bombs on innocent people. But no way I\u2019d vote for Romney.\n\nIn a video aired at Time.com, you get more than the published magazine offers. He suggested Obama\u2019s assassination of Americans with \u201cno due process\u201d amounts to a \u201cpolice state.\u201d\n\nCORNEL WEST: He takes over this system, and he cannot change it by himself. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not so much a personal attack. It\u2019s a critique of the priorities that he had. a Wall Street presidency, a drone presidency, a national surveillance presidency that violates rights and liberties vis a vis those dissenting voices \u2013 four Americans assassinated, no due process, no accountability. You see, for me, that\u2019s movements toward a police state, toward a neo-fascist state. It has to be said.\n\nIt has to be said...but Time doesn\u2019t have to print it all. Only the bolded part was published. Time and Luscombe never really explained where Cornel West lands on the ideological spectrum (another academic Marxist). But they suggested he's a prophet, based on his book's title Black Prophetic Fire.\n\nLuscombe asked \"Is a prophet always marginalized?\" West said yes. She followed up: \"Have you been marginalized?\" He said \"I've been very blessed, but you know, you've got character assassination. You got different lies told on you. That's a kind of marginalization.\"\n\nIn his \"four assassinations\" allegation, West is referring (in part) to Anwar al-Awlaki, who inspired several homegrown terror attacks like the first Fort Hood attack that killed 13. Others, including al-Awlaki\u2019s teenage son, were unintentionally killed in drone strikes. It\u2019s not a surprise that West\u2019s \u201cassassination\u201d talk echoes fringy LaRouche candidates for office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "In an interview with Time for 10 Questions in the October 13 edition, Time\u2019s Belinda Luscombe asked Marxist professor (and for a while, Tavis Smiley\u2019s public radio co-host) Cornel West whether he voted for Obama in 2012.
