Jerry Brown met with water, agricultural, and environmental leaders to collaborate and discuss solutions to address the state\u2019s worsening drought.\n\n.@JerryBrownGov meets w/water, agricultural & environmental leaders from across CA to talk #CADrought. #SaveOurWater pic.twitter.com/KloExvGQtm \u2014 Gov. Brown Press Ofc (@GovPressOffice) April 8, 2015\n\n\n\nBrown came under criticism last week for an executive order that targeted urban water consumption, but mostly left alone agricultural usage.\n\nThe governor\u2019s order mandates a 25 percent reduction in water use for urban areas\u2014through February 2016\u2014and also includes initiatives to encourage conservation.\n\nOther than a requirement for agricultural water suppliers to submit sustainability plans, the executive order focused very little on the industry\u2019s water consumption.\n\nWith a growing population of over 38 million, California is struggling to find a solution to its water crisis. But recent attention to water consumption has policymakers thinking of innovative ways to prevent future shortages.\n\nJennifer Clary, water program manager at Clean Water Action, sees the current crisis as an opportunity for California to make real policy reforms and encourage conservation.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining of a drought is that it gives you a chance to change behavior,\u201d Clary said. \u201cPolicies can do a little bit now, but a lot later.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining of a drought is that it gives you a chance to change behavior,\u201d Jennifer Clary, Clean Water Action\n\nClary says reforms like California\u2019s groundwater legislation, signed by Brown last September, provides adequate oversight of groundwater pumping, including consumption by private parties and for public use.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Water Resources, 30 to 46 percent of the state\u2019s total water supply comes from groundwater.\n\nThe legislation provides local agencies with the power to \u201cadopt and implement\u201d a groundwater management plan for high and medium priority underground water basins.\n\nHowever there are critics that say regulating consumption through government oversight and mandatory reductions is not the solution to California\u2019s water problem.\n\nRandy T. Simmons, professor of economics and finance at Utah State University, argues that California is missing a free market pricing system that could allocate water among consumers more efficiently.\n\n\u201cIdeally, water would be allocated based on a system of rights, so it could be traded in markets,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cRather than letting water be allocated by price, California is trapped in a system allocated by the government.\u201d\n\nSimmons believes that raising the price of water in relation to consumption could signal to consumers the value of water as a natural resource.\n\nAccording to California\u2019s Water Resources Control Board, urban water conservation in the month of February declined to 2.8 percent from 8 percent in January.\n\n\n\nDespite the decline in conservation, the state has made a conscious effort through its #SaveOurWater campaign, to educate the public on simple ways to reduce consumption.\n\nWater guzzlers would be punished under state proposal http://t.co/80QrQcyHhs via @SFGate #saveourwater #cadrought \u2014 Save Our Water (@saveourwater) April 9, 2015\n\nNick Loris, energy research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, explained that the increase in consumption could be the result of inadequate pricing in relation to consumer usage.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a proper water market with price signals that allocate resources appropriately will result in overuse and over consumption.\u201d Nick Loris, The Heritage Foundation\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of complex regulations and reforms that would need to happen,\u201d Loris said. \u201cBut the absence of a proper water market with price signals that allocate resources appropriately will result in overuse and over consumption.\u201d\n\nDavid Zetland, assistant professor of economics at Leiden University in Amsterdam, has been studying water policy for over 10 years.\n\nZetland argues that the western United States, especially California, is slowly coming to the grips with its water management problem.\n\n\u201cAfter you run out of the abundance of water, you need to start looking at water through a different management paradigm,\u201d Zetland said. \u201cYou have a physical system that is overextended, a political system that is very interventionist and a history in the world of not having water markets or water pricing.\u201d\n\nDespite political differences, Californian policymakers will be forced to decide how to best balance the water needs of communities, farms, and the environment.\n\n\u201cBreaking down the myth that your water comes out of a tap, and not from an ecosystem or a watershed, would be a great lesson to come out of this drought,\u201d Clary said.\n\n\u201cEvery time you make a choice to use that water, you make a choice to not use it somewhere else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "California's drought has policymakers thinking of innovative ways to prevent future water shortages.", "og":
