As we found out recently, it's by quietly sticking veterans on a waiting list and putting off their treatment for months\u2014sometimes until the patients are far too dead to need much in the way of expensive care. Which is to say, calling it a \"success\" is stretching the meaning of the word beyond recognition.\n\nAnd, while the White House insists it learned from press reports about the secret waiting lists, Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledges that the administration long knew about \"the backlog and disability claims\" that have accumulated in the VHA.\n\nThis should surprise nobody. Canada's government-run single-payer health system has long suffered waiting times for care. The country's Fraser Institute estimates \"the national median waiting time from specialist appointment to treatment increased from 9.3 weeks in 2010 to 9.5 weeks in 2011.\"\n\nLikewise, once famously social democratic Sweden has seen a rise in private health coverage in parallel to the state system because of long delays to receive care. \"It's quicker to get a colleague back to work if you have an operation in two weeks' time rather than having to wait for a year,\" privately insured Anna Norlander told Sveriges Radio\n\nAn article in The Local noted that \"visitors are sometimes surprised to learn about year-long waiting times for cancer patients.\"\n\nBritain's single-payer National Health Service (NHS) is up front about wait times for care, with the organization's website promising, \"you have the legal right to start your NHS consultant-led treatment within a maximum of 18 weeks from referral.\" Last year, the Daily Telegraph reported that \"waiting lists, which have hovered around 2.5 million patients in recent years, reached 2.88 million in June, the highest level since May 2008.\"\n\nWhy the common delays across single-payer health systems?\n\nIt's like that sign you see in car repair shops owned by wiseasses: \"Fast. Good. Cheap. Pick Any Two.\"\n\nAdvanced medical care costs a lot of money. Delivering it quickly costs more. To the increasingly limited extent that it's allowed, American private medicine recognizes the compromises that have to be made and offers a variety of coverage at different price points\u2014that is, you have some choice in which two you get. The British NHS also recognizes the need to compromise\u2014and there goes \"fast.\" (The NHS is known for holding back on \"good,\" too, when further cost controls are needed.)\n\nThe VHA has tried to pretend that compromises don't have to be made; that it can, somehow, deliver care to everybody without worrying about cost. But it faces the same lack of infinite resources as everybody else. If the VHA won't charge more for quick access to better care, fast will have to give. So we end up with secret waiting lists.\n\nThe VHA also often compromises on the good part, denying that illnesses exist, or that they're military-related and therefore its responsibility.\n\nSo the VA really is a good example of a single-payer, socialized health system. Just not in the way that fans of that approach mean.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Just a couple of years ago, Paul Krugman pointed to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as a \"huge policy success story, which offers important lessons", "title": "The Veterans Health Administration Really Does Offer 'Lessons' in 'Socialized Medicine'", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/05/20/veterans-administration-socialized-meds", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14005996809059.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just a couple of years ago, Paul Krugman\n\npointed to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as a \"huge\npolicy success story, which offers important lessons for future\nhealth reform.\" He gloated, \"yes, this is 'socialized\nmedicine.'\"\nSimilarly, a letter touted by Physicians for a National Health\nProgram", "creator": "@JD_Tuccille", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14005996809059.jpg", "title": "The Veterans Health Administration Really Does Offer 'Lessons' in 'Socialized Medicine'", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-05-20T16:25:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/jd-tuccille"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9582\"", "article_summary": "Just a couple of years ago, Paul Krugman pointed to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as a \"huge policy success story, which offers important lessons for future health reform.\"\nSo the VA really is a good example of a single-payer, socialized health system.\nWhy the common delays across single-payer health systems?\nCanada's government-run single-payer health system has long suffered waiting times for care.\nThe VHA also often compromises on the good part, denying that illnesses exist, or that they're military-related and therefore its responsibility."}
