Its counterpart in Minnesota proposed rate increases of at least 50 percent on several products.\n\nThe Blues isn\u2019t alone in proposing higher rates. HealthPartners Insurance Co. in Minnesota is proposing a 23.7 percent increase, and Medica Health Plans is asking for a 16.5 percent increase in North Dakota.\n\nYet experts pointed out the rates submitted last month only represent the biggest increases and not plans that are expected to keep premiums the same or lower. They also said it indicates insurance companies are adjusting to a new health care environment under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis is a new market to both the consumers and the insurance companies, and as in any new market, such fluctuations are expected,\u201d said Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a health economist and associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.\n\nFederal law requires rate increase requests larger than 10 percent to be submitted for review ahead of time. The requests and justifications for the increases were posted on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services website in the past few weeks.\n\nRegulators may push back against some rate increases, one expert said. Blue Cross Blue Shield North Dakota requested a 22.2 percent increase for 2015, but it was finalized at 13.2 percent.\n\nThe 18.4 percent increase BCBS in North Dakota is requesting for 2016 only affects individual plans and not employer groups. The increase would affect about 30,000 of its 500,000 members in the state, said Brad Bartle, the company\u2019s chief actuary.\n\nAdam Hamm, the North Dakota Insurance Commissioner, said his department will examine rate requests \u201cpiece by piece\u201d to see if the increase is justified. He said it\u2019s common for the final approved rate to be lower than the original requested increase.\n\nTrending upward\n\nBartle said rising health care costs are the biggest reason for the proposed premium increase. BCBS expects its members\u2019 claims to be 7 percent higher in 2016, he said.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in a series of tweets last month \u201chealth care costs in general seem to be trending upwards, so we should expect bigger premium increases in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe health conditions of newly insured people can may be driving up costs. The first years of the health insurance exchanges brought some uncertainty about who would buy new health plans and their health care costs, Karaca-Mandic said.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the enrollees ended up being older and sicker than they expected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is highly possible that there was a pent-up demand for health services among this population because of the many prior years of being uninsured and staying without health care.\u201d\n\nThe high cost of new specialty prescription drugs like treatment for Hepatitis C is also a factor, according to the Minnesota Council of Health Plans.\n\nMeanwhile, the phase-out of federal financial support is playing into the Blues\u2019 rate request, Bartle said. The support was meant to help smooth the transition into the new health care law.\n\nBartle added that the uncertainty surrounding health care reform is making it more difficult to set premium rates.\n\n\u201cThe ACA really changed a lot of the landscape in the health insurance marketplace,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a good thing that consumers have options, but \u201cthat means the insurance companies\u2019 enrollment is a little less stable than it was five years ago and it\u2019s harder to predict what the costs will be in 2016.\u201d\n\nWorking itself out\n\nExperts said the swings in health insurance rates should moderate over time.\n\nKaraca-Mandic said the \u201cpent-up demand\u201d for care will settle down, while Levitt said \u201cinsurers are basing 2016 premiums on real claims experience for the first time,\u201d so \u201csome big swings are to be expected.\u201d He pointed out that people buying health care on ACA marketplaces are receiving subsidies that could cushion premium increases.\n\nConsumer education could be a way to help control costs going forward, Karaca-Mandic said.\n\n\u201cIf it is true that the new enrollees had higher rates of emergency department use, part of that could be because they were uninsured before, and emergency room was their primary source of care,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOver time, the hope is for the new enrollees to have more stable usual source of care other than emergency room, and to emphasize preventive care that can prevent some avoidable emergency room visits and hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nBrad Gibbens, the deputy director for the Center for Rural Health at the University of North Dakota, said despite the noticeable increases proposed in the past couple of weeks, some are planning to reduce premium rates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an increase ... in the number of health plans that are available to people through the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cThat competition is having an impact on rates. That\u2019s why in some places on some of the plans you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s actually an decrease in premiums, and in other places there\u2019s going to be an increase.\u201d\n\nJim Schowalter, the president and CEO of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, said big changes like the ones that came with the new health care law \u201ctend to take a little while to work themselves out.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach year, we\u2019re going to get more information and understanding about who\u2019s going to be seeking insurance, what they\u2019re long-term health care costs are, and that will take some years to settle out,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,North Dakota,heath,Health insurance,increase rate,North Dakota,Blue Cross Blue Shield", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Hageman", "og": {"site_name": "The Dickinson Press", "description": "GRAND FORKS \u2014 Some of the biggest insurance companies in North Dakota and Minnesota have proposed double-digit rate increases for premiums on plans purchased outside of the workplace, a trend one official said has to do with higher health care costs.\r\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, the largest health ins...", "title": "Health insurers proposing rate increases for 2016", "url": "http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/north-dakota/3770639-health-insurers-proposing-rate-increases-2016", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/sites/all/themes/thedickinsonpress_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GRAND FORKS \u2014 Some of the biggest insurance companies in North Dakota and Minnesota have proposed double-digit rate increases for premiums on plans purchased outside of the workplace, a trend one official said has to do with higher health care costs.\r\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, the largest health ins...", "creator": "jhageman_", "url": "http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/north-dakota/3770639-health-insurers-proposing-rate-increases-2016", "image": "http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/sites/all/themes/thedickinsonpress_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "title": "Health insurers proposing rate increases for 2016", "site": "dickinsonpress", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1461994994027328}, "keywords": "News,North Dakota,heath,Health insurance,increase rate,North Dakota,Blue Cross Blue Shield", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Dickinson-Press/179055638616", "tag": "News,North Dakota,heath,Health insurance,increase rate,North Dakota,Blue Cross Blue Shield", "modified_time": "2015-06-19T23:27:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "GRAND FORKS \u2014 Some of the biggest insurance companies in North Dakota and Minnesota have proposed double-digit rate increases for premiums on plans purchased..."}, "article_summary": "The first years of the health insurance exchanges brought some uncertainty about who would buy new health plans and their health care costs, Karaca-Mandic said.\nHealth insurers proposing rate increases for 2016GRAND FORKS \u2014 Some of the biggest insurance companies in North Dakota and Minnesota have proposed double-digit rate increases for premiums on plans purchased outside of the workplace, a trend one official said has to do with higher health care costs.\nIts counterpart in Minnesota proposed rate increases of at least 50 percent on several products.\nFederal law requires rate increase requests larger than 10 percent to be submitted for review ahead of time.\nBartle added that the uncertainty surrounding health care reform is making it more difficult to set premium rates."}
