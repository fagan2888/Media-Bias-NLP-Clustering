The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, estimates that there are 4.5 million victims of forced sexual exploitation out of about 21 million people worldwide who are held against their will as laborers.\n\nIn 80 countries, the Talitha Kum nuns raise money to be used to buy the freedom of children being sold into sex slavery, and sometimes disguise themselves as prostitutes to enter brothels to ferret out such victims. The group\u2019s name means \u201carise child\u201d in Aramaic, an ancient Mideast language, and is taken from a Bible story that describes Jesus bringing a little girl back to life. The Thomson Reuters Foundation reported last month that the nuns plan to expand their efforts to around 140 countries, citing John Studzinski, an investment bank executive and the Talitha Kum chairman.\n\n\u201cThese sisters do not trust anyone. They do not trust governments, they do not trust corporations, and they don\u2019t trust the local police. In some cases, they cannot trust male clergy,\u201d Studzinski, a Blackstone Group vice chairman, said at a conference on women\u2019s rights and human trafficking, according to Thomson Reuters. \u201cThey work in brothels. No one knows they are there.\u201d\n\nAnother way that they disguise themselves, Studzinski said, is by dressing in work clothes alongside those victimized as slave laborers. Such forced labor can include people held in debt bondage, or by being paid too little to escape their often abusive situations. Studzinski said some employers hire the nuns\u2019 organization to investigate abuse in global supply chains that feed their industries. The UN agency said slave labor generates about $150 billion a year in illegal profits for companies and individuals.\n\nThe sisters also work in countries like Brazil, India and the Philippines to prevent parents from selling their children to traffickers, a practice that can be common in disadvantaged families.\n\nNot all view the nuns as heroic. Christina Arnold, the chief executive of Prevent Human Trafficking, told Fox News Tuesday that the group might be harming the fight against traffickers.\n\n\u201cPeople have their hearts in the right place,\u201d she said, but noted that while it may affect prices, interceding to buy a child from those who would sell that child into slavery merely perpetuates the trade. \u201cIt sounds like a good idea but it\u2019s actually a ludicrous one.\u201d\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/04/nuns-dress-as-prostitutes-to-save-trafficking-victims/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11114107225_64335528b1_o-e1453995302870.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "children, human trafficking, nuns, prostitution, sex slaves, sex trafficking, slave labor, Talitha Kum"}, "description": "In a less traditional piece of charitable work, more than a thousand nuns worldwide are swapping their habits for outfits typically worn by prostitutes or", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11114107225_64335528b1_o-e1453995302870.jpg"}, "keywords": "nuns,human trafficking,slave labor,children,prostitution,sex slaves,sex trafficking,talitha kum", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Nuns dress as prostitutes to save trafficking victimsPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/04/nuns-dress-as-prostitutes-to-save-trafficking-victims/(Photo courtesy of Flickr.com)LONDON \u2013 In a less traditional piece of charitable work, more than 1,000 nuns worldwide are swapping their habits for outfits typically worn by prostitutes or laborers.\nUnder federal law, sex trafficking is defined as \u201cthe recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.\u201d Statistics for those held in bondage for sex are difficult to track.\nStudzinski said some employers hire the nuns\u2019 organization to investigate abuse in global supply chains that feed their industries.\nIn 80 countries, the Talitha Kum nuns raise money to be used to buy the freedom of children being sold into sex slavery, and sometimes disguise themselves as prostitutes to enter brothels to ferret out such victims.\nThey do not trust governments, they do not trust corporations, and they don\u2019t trust the local police."}
