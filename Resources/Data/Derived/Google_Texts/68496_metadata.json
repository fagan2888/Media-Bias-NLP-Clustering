Butler, who sat out the last game with a right ankle injury, started the burst with a 3-pointer and added a three-point play that made it 57-52. That was the first of 12 straight points by the Bulls.\n\nAnother three-point play by Butler made it 66-52.\n\n\u201cComing out of halftime was a focus for us,\u201d Hinrich said.\n\nChicago (11-16) led by 19 at the end of the period after Reggie Evans\u2019 dunk with less than a second left ended a 5\u00bd-minute field goal drought for the Nets (9-19).\n\nBrooklyn couldn\u2019t get much closer in the fourth and was serenaded with a chorus of loud boos from the fans.\n\n\u201cThey cheer when things are good and they let you know when things aren\u2019t going good,\u201d Nets coach Jason Kidd said. \u201cThey expect good and they expect it 90 percent of the time, but right now we are 90 percent bad and so they have every right to boo and express how they feel.\u201d\n\nWhat once was viewed as a Christmas Day showdown between Eastern Conference contenders became a matchup of two of the NBA\u2019s biggest disappointments so far, as both teams have been plagued by injuries.\n\nDeron Williams scored 18 points and Mizra Teletovic added 17 for the Nets, who have lost four straight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at this season, how it\u2019s played out altogether,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nightmare the way the injuries have been, the things we talk about every day, the lack of effort, the lack of energy.\u201d\n\nThe victory was Chicago\u2019s second straight, the first time since five consecutive wins from Nov. 8-18 that the Bulls had two in a row. Chicago is starting to get healthy with the return Hinrich and Butler, both of whom started.\n\nHinrich spurred a 12-0 run midway through the second quarter that gave Chicago a 39-31 lead. Williams then scored seven straight to make it a one-point game. Chicago led 41-38 at the half before Butler took over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to get guys back,\u201d Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. \u201cOur starters were very solid and our bench guys did a great job. Taj was super.\u201d\n\nThe Bulls were still missing Luol Deng (Achilles) and Derrick Rose, who is sidelined for the season with a right knee injury.\n\nBrooklyn has its own injury issues with center Brook Lopez lost for the season Friday to a broken right foot.\n\n\u201cWe talk about it a lot. We\u2019re really trying to figure out what it is. It\u2019s tough,\u201d Teletovic said of the Nets\u2019 struggles. \u201cA lot of NBA teams aren\u2019t going to give you anything easy. You really have to concentrate and bring a lot of energy to win the game.\u201d\n\nThe two clubs were wearing their Christmas short-sleeve jerseys that look straight out of a rec league game. Instead of numbers and a team name on the front, there was a big shiny logo. There are numbers on the sleeves, while the backs look more like a normal NBA jersey.\n\nBoth squads were also wearing striped socks to complete the outfit.\n\nNotes: The Nets were still missing Andrei Kirilenko, who has been sidelined this season with a back injury. Kidd said before the game that his forward is making progress. \u2026 Kidd\u2019s always loved playing on Christmas. \u201cOne of the biggest honors as a player and coach is to participate on Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is watching so you can showcase your talent.\u201d \u2026 These two teams met in the first round of the playoffs last season and the Bulls won in seven games. \u2026 Chicago has won eight of the last 10 regular-season meetings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two teams were wearing their Christmas short-sleeve jerseys that look straight out of a rec league game.
