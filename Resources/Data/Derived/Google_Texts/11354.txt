Last night in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Arcade Fire paid tribute to one of the city’s most famous natives: Neil Young.

During this tour, for their record “Reflektor,” Arcade Fire has been playing location-based cover songs — Feist in Calgary, the Smiths in London, Nirvana in Washington state.

Arcade Fire played Young’s “Come On Baby Let’s Go Downtown,” which is from the 1975 album “Tonight’s the Night.” Instrumentalist Tim Kingsbury contributed vocals during this cover, according to Pitchfork. And Win Butler donned one of Arcade Fire’s signature paper mâché heads. Watch the video below via Pitchfork:
