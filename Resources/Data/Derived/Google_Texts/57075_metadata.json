People sent Thanksgiving greeting cards, people donned odd costumes and schools and communities staged elaborate parades and Thanksgiving pageants in which Native Americans and pilgrims gathered together and smiled and waved.\n\nThis year, as Forbes reports, \u201cMany stores will be open on Thanksgiving Day in order to gain an extra selling day.\u201d The sending of holiday cards by snail mail is in steady decline, according to the Hartford Courant. Millennials are moving toward healthier Thanksgiving dinners, The Washington Post reports, and tossing out the cranberry sauce. And the Thanksgiving Pageant has become politically controversial.\n\nLast November, writing in the San Diego Union, Logan Jenkins pointed out that the traditional Thanksgiving pageant \u2013 celebrated in schools for decades \u2013 has become challenging. He cites an instructional video \u2013 created by a California school district for kindergartners \u2014 that calls on all school-sponsored Thanksgiving celebrations to incorporate \u201cmore than one point of view\u201d.\n\nIncorporating the true feelings and actions of the Native Americans and the European immigrants is a complicated undertaking.\n\n\u201cIn practice, the easiest way out of the Thanksgiving mess may be to do what schools did with Christmas events many years ago,\u201d Jenkins wrote. \u201cTake it off the table.\u201d\n\nRight before our eyes, Thanksgiving is changing. Shape-shifting. Thanksmorphing. Why do some traditions abide and others appear \u2014 and then fade away \u2014 like floats and balloons in a Thanksgiving Day parade?\n\nThe Patriotic Turkey\n\nThe notion of the patriotic turkey, for instance. Who knows where it started? Perhaps in the 18th century when Benjamin Franklin famously praised the turkey as \u201cmuch more respectable\u201d than the national-symbol eagle. Or in the mid-19th century when people started habitually referring to the fowl in print as the \u201cnoble turkey\u201d. Or maybe it was around the turn of the 20th century, when the idea of the Thanksgiving turkey as sacrificial bird began to take flight.\n\nThis last construct was summed up in a Vest Pocket Essay published in the San Francisco Call on Nov. 18, 1911. \u201cThe turkey is the national bird of thankfulness,\u201d the writer expounded. And \u201cthe patriotic turkey dies for his country on Thanksgiving day.\u201d\n\nAll but forgotten nowadays, the patriotic turkey \u2014 bestrewn with bunting, flanked by flags \u2013was a popular character on another gone-with-the-wind Thanksgiving tradition\u2026\n\nThe Thanksgiving Greeting Card\n\nFirst advertised in the late 19th century, the Thanksgiving greeting card \u2013 like the Christmas card \u2014 was a prevalent holiday fixture in this country for decades.\n\n\u201cThe newest thing in picture cards,\u201d noted the Nashville Tennessean on Oct. 31, 1880, \u201care the thanksgiving cards to be sent on the Puritan festival, which has become a national holiday.\u201d\n\nA book store in Scranton, Penn., according to the local Truth on Nov. 18, 1910, sold linen Thanksgiving greeting cards with the message: \u201cA sincere wish from the sender / That your Bird will be plump and tender.\u201d Card and envelope cost a dime.\n\nCertain themes \u2014 such as huge turkeys pulling carriages, young children riding huge turkeys and the aforementioned patriotic turkey \u2013 came and went.\n\nSincerity was the mood a la mode. \u201cThe sentiments of the 1932 cards,\u201d the Daily Messenger in Canandaigua, New York, reported on Nov. 21, 1932, \u201chark back strongly to the courageous spirit of the Puritan Thanksgiving. Wise-cracking remarks or good wishes in the pert spirit of modern youth are rare.\u201d\n\nThe Parade Reigns On\n\nGone are the patriotic fowl and Thanksgiving greeting cards. But many traditional Thanksgiving traditions \u2013 such as turkey-centric cuisine and Thanksgiving pageants \u2014 prevail. The annual New York Thanksgiving parade is scheduled to take place Thursday morning despite security concerns, Agence France Press reports.\n\nAnd \u201cthe revisionist traditions of Thanksgiving are going strong,\u201d Brooke Hansen who teaches anthropology at Ithaca College tells NPR. \u201cWe just had our yearly educational moment at Ithaca College with a presentation by Perry Ground \u2014 an Onondaga Turtle Clan educator who does a fantastic job deconstructing the fables of American Thanksgiving \u2014 no, the Pilgrims did not land at Plymouth Rock, in fact they didn\u2019t even call themselves Pilgrims \u2026. Turkey was not eaten.\u201d\n\nPerry Ground has been thinking about Thanksgiving for years now. \u201cNot all Native Americans have positive feelings about the Thanksgiving holiday,\u201d he observes in a 2011 essay. \u201cTo some it is a reminder of the negative relations between European settlers, later Americans and Native peoples. Since 1970, a small group of Native people led by some Wampanoag community members have declared the day after Thanksgiving to be a National Day of Mourning.. This event, held in Plymouth, Massachusetts each year, recognizes these struggles\u2026\u201d\n\nGround writes that he celebrates Thanksgiving Day by eating turkey, cranberries and mashed potatoes with his family. \u201cWe will watch football, play games, take naps and get ready for the next day\u2019s shopping,\u201d he notes. And he will be thankful. \u201cThat is an idea that we can carry away from this holiday,\u201d he concludes. \u201cWe can be thankful for what we have every day.\u201d\n\nFollow me @NPRHistoryDept; lead me by writing lweeks@npr.org", "article_metadata": {"category": "Exclude", "description": "Though it may seem like a fixed point in a fast-moving world, the Thanksgiving holiday continues to change and evolve.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Though it may seem like a fixed point in a fast-moving world, the Thanksgiving holiday continues to change and evolve.", "title": "The Peculiar Parade Of Thanksgiving Traditions | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/exclude/2015/11/26/128760/the-peculiar-parade-of-thanksgiving-traditions/", "image": {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/25140016/postcard002-edit_sq-a7388473433a2e4242bca6485c53911cf35a2edd.jpg", "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/25140016/postcard002-edit_sq-a7388473433a2e4242bca6485c53911cf35a2edd.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 456357684, "twitter": {"description": "Though it may seem like a fixed point in a fast-moving world, the Thanksgiving holiday continues to change and evolve.", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/exclude/2015/11/26/128760/the-peculiar-parade-of-thanksgiving-traditions/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/25140016/postcard002-edit_sq-a7388473433a2e4242bca6485c53911cf35a2edd.jpg", "title": "The Peculiar Parade Of Thanksgiving Traditions", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Linton Weeks, NPR", "wordCount": 849, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-11-26T06:00:17+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "keywords": "Exclude, News, holiday, parade, thanksgiving, tradition", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "tradition", "published_time": "2015-11-26T06:00:17+00:00"}, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Why do some traditions abide and others appear \u2014 and then fade away \u2014 like floats and balloons in a Thanksgiving Day parade?\nThough it may seem like a fixed point in a fast-moving world, the Thanksgiving holiday continues to change and evolve.\nWise-cracking remarks or good wishes in the pert spirit of modern youth are rare.\u201dThe Parade Reigns OnGone are the patriotic fowl and Thanksgiving greeting cards.\n\u201cNot all Native Americans have positive feelings about the Thanksgiving holiday,\u201d he observes in a 2011 essay.\nTime was in America that stores routinely closed on Thanksgiving Day."}
