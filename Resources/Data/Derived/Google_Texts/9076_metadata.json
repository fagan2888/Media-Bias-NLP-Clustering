That includes 33 percent who think Republicans are too willing to grant legal status to immigrants and 18 percent who think the GOP does not go far enough.\n\nThirty-seven percent of Republicans said the party is doing a good job on immigration.\n\nAnother 53 percent of Republicans believe the GOP is not representing their view on same-sex marriage. Of those, 28 percent said the Republican Party is not willing enough to accept gay marriage, while 22 percent said the party is too willing.\n\nThirty-four percent of Republicans said their party is doing a good job on gay marriage.\n\nOn both gay marriage and immigration reform, young Republicans are most likely to say their party is not willing to go far enough.\n\nDemocrats are far more likely to say their party is doing a good job representing their views on gay marriage. Sixty-two percent believe the party is doing a good job, and 28 percent believe the opposite.\n\nBlack Democrats are the most likely \u2014 30 percent \u2014 to say the party is too willing to accept gay marriage.\n\nOn immigration, Democrats are divided.
