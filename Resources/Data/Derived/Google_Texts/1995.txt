Leslie Fitzwater will bring back her Edith Piaf show, a hit at the Skylight last season, as a benefit Sept. 12 and 13 at Pius XI High School.

Proceeds from the performances will support the Paula Foley Tillen Scholarship Fund, which Pius uses to help young singers and musicians pay for private lessons. Tillen, a local pianist, arranger and composer who's worked with Fitzwater on many projects, will accompany the singer for these shows, too. Both women are adjunct faculty members at Pius.

Performances begin at 7 p.m. at Pius' Father Robert V. Carney Performing Arts Center. Tickets are $10 for students, $20 for adults, $15 for ages 65 and older. Call (414) 290-0204.
