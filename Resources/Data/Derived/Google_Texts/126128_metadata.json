Hershey Medical Center and PinnacleHealth System is possible.\n\nBut Dr. Harold Paz, the CEO of Penn State Hershey, said even he doesn\u2019t know.\n\nNo one will know, Paz said, until after an independent consultant studies how Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth System might \u201cbroaden their existing relationship.\u201d\n\nThe consultant, which hadn\u2019t been hired as of last week, is expected to provide a recommendation by the end of March. Paz said he hopes a final outcome will be known by the end of June.\n\n\u201cWe are really at the beginning of a process,\u201d he said.\n\nPaz had been asked whether possible outcomes include full merger or one entity being sold to or otherwise absorbed by the other.\n\nAccording to Paz, the consultant will focus on questions including \u201cwhat could we do together to benefit the community and the region and the state,\u201d and will \u201crecommend the best structure for us to continue to grow our strategic alignment.\u201d\n\nHe stressed Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth already have substantial collaborations. These include the 74-bed Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute, which is a joint venture, and a decade-old arrangement in which Penn State Hershey medical students and residents train at PinnacleHealth.\n\nPaz said he and PinnacleHealth officials agreed to make an early announcement of the collaboration talks and to be highly transparent about the process.\n\nAsked whether merger is possible, PinnacleHealth spokeswoman Christina Persson wrote in an email that \u201cwe wanted to be open as best we could at this early stage. It\u2019s always a dilemma when we don\u2019t have the specifics, but we wanted the community and our employees to know that we are looking for new ways to work together so that they would not be surprised when further details are developed.\u201d\n\nPenn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth each have roughly 550 inpatient beds and are located only about 20 miles apart. But there are many differences between the two.\n\nPenn State-Hershey is an academic medical center and medical school and a major research institution. Its medical offerings include a children\u2019s hospital, the highest level of adult trauma care and a full range of organ transplants.\n\nPinnacleHealth operates two inpatient hospitals, Harrisburg and Community General Osteopathic, and is building a third in Cumberland County. It has long been one of the state\u2019s busiest hospitals for heart surgery. Unlike Penn State Hershey, PinnacleHealth is based in an urban area with a high concentration of uninsured people and people with low incomes.\n\nPenn State Hershey has about $1 billion in revenues from medical care annually, compared to about $700 million for PinnacleHealth.\n\nThe late-November announcement from Penn State-Hersey and PinnacleHealth comes amid a national wave of hospital merger and affiliation.\n\nEarlier in 2013, two of the Harrisburg region\u2019s smaller health systems, Good Samaritan Health System and Holy Spirit Health System, each announced plans to merge or affiliate with a larger partner.\n\nHoly Spirit is having formal talks with the vast Geisinger Health System center in Danville. Good Samaritan hopes to announce a partner next year.\n\nSome possible arrangements allow hospitals and health systems to remain separate while still taking advantage of concepts such as joint purchasing.\n\nDennis Oldstead, a health care economist for the Pennsylvania Medical Society, said \u201cit\u2019s likely Hershey is providing some kind of resource that Pinnacle can\u2019t offer, and Pinnacle might offer something to Hershey that they don\u2019t have \u2026 clearly everyone is looking to fill a void.\u201d\n\nHe also said the two could be reacting to the possibility of a large entity from outside the area entering the Harrisburg-area market.\n\nOlmstead believes full merger is possible. But he also believes there are many possibilities for collaboration that would enable them to remain separate.\n\nThese might include expanded efforts to train doctors and conduct research, and collaborating on an \u201caccountable care organization\u201d or ACO. ACOs are part of the Affordable Care Act and involve paying hospitals based on their success in managing large populations of patents.\n\nAnother possibility, Olmstead said, would be for the two to create their own health insurance company. That touches on another relatively new trend in which some health systems are becoming health insurers \u2014 and health insurers are acquiring hospitals \u2014 for reasons including eliminating a middleman.\n\n\u201cThe opportunities are endless for the organization they could become,\u201d Olmstead said.\n\nSimilar to Olmstead, Stephen Foreman, an associated professor of health care administration at Robert Morris University, believes full merger is possible, but other possible arrangements also make sense.\n\nForeman believes that one of the likely goals of a collaboration is to gain more negotiating power with insurers \u2014 a move that could lead to higher health insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to merge \u2026 the tighter the affiliation, the more bargaining power they will get out of it,\u201d he said.\n\nDescribing something of a worst-case scenario, Foreman pointed to the situation in western Pennsylvania. There, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is the dominant hospital system, is mired in a dispute with health insurer Highmark Inc., and plans to eventually stop allowing network access for Highmark members.\n\nLikewise, a Harrisburg area health system, if it was big enough, might offer a discount to a health insurer, but insist that the health insurer require its customers to use that health system exclusively. A combined Penn State Hershey-Pinnacle, or Holy Spirit-Geisinger, might be capable of wielding such power, he added.\n\nBut Paz stressed that Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth are both non-profits, and said the main purpose of their collaboration would be to provide better health care at a more affordable price, so more people have access.\n\nA merger or acquisition deal would have to be approved the Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Office, which would consider factors such as whether the resulting entity would have a negative impact on competition and access.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@topstories','health care'", "title": "Penn State Hershey CEO claims no inside scoop on potential of talks with PinnacleHealth", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Penn State Hershey CEO claims no inside scoop on potential of talks with PinnacleHealth\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/12/pinnacle_hershey_penn_state_pa.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/patriot-news/photo/2013/10/13597165-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11797217\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-10T14:18:19Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"health care\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/patriot-news/photo/2013/10/13597165-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@DavidRWenner", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Two experts believe full merger is a possibility, but not the only one."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, December 10, 2013,  9:18 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/patriot-news/photo/2013/10/harrisburg-hospital-emergency-department-8a85aa823399f8a2.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "Two experts believe full merger is a possibility, but not the only one.", "title": "Penn State Hershey CEO claims no inside scoop on potential of talks with PinnacleHealth", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/12/pinnacle_hershey_penn_state_pa.html", "image": "http://www.pennlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 10, 2013,  9:00 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "Two experts believe full merger is a possibility, but not the only one."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0514\"", "article_summary": "But Dr. Harold Paz, the CEO of Penn State Hershey, said even he doesn\u2019t know.\nUnlike Penn State Hershey, PinnacleHealth is based in an urban area with a high concentration of uninsured people and people with low incomes.\nPenn State Hershey has about $1 billion in revenues from medical care annually, compared to about $700 million for PinnacleHealth.\nEarlier in 2013, two of the Harrisburg region\u2019s smaller health systems, Good Samaritan Health System and Holy Spirit Health System, each announced plans to merge or affiliate with a larger partner.\nLikewise, a Harrisburg area health system, if it was big enough, might offer a discount to a health insurer, but insist that the health insurer require its customers to use that health system exclusively."}
