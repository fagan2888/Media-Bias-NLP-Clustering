He is being treated in a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atalanta.\n\nDr. Kent Brantly, an aid worker, is thought to be the first American infected with the disease. He and fellow Samaritan\u2019s Purse worker, Nancy Writebol, were infected with the deadly virus while working in a Liberian hospital. Writebol is expected to return to the United States in the next few days, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe Ebola virus, which has no known cure, has already claimed more than 700 lives in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and infected over 1,000, according to the World Health Organization. The virus is spread via contact with bodily fluids. In Western Africa it has a 60-80 percent death rate, according to the Associated Press.\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, spoke to NBC on Sunday morning about Brantly\u2019s condition:\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s encouraging. He seems to be improved from the reports we got earlier. Ebola can be deadly. But in people who are healthy, the case fatality rate may be lower than the ones that we\u2019re usually quoting because people like this doctor are much healthier going in than many of the people who unfortunately are still getting Ebola in Africa.\u201d\n\nHe also explained the decision to bring Dr. Brantly back to the United States. \u201cHe\u2019s an American citizen,\u201d Dr. Frieden explained. \u201cAnd what our role is in public health is to make sure that if an American is coming home with an infectious disease, we protect others so that they don\u2019t spread it. And that\u2019s what we did in transit and when he\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is thrilled with the decision to bring Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writbol home.
