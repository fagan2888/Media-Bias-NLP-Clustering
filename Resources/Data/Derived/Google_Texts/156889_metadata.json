He was not arrested as his father, Von, who was with him in the car, was allowed to drive.\n\nThe Broncos had no comment late Tuesday night. It\u2019s had to comment plenty in recent weeks.\n\nMiller\u2019s troubles began when the NFL ruled he was in violation of the league drug policy. Initially, the league was going to suspend Miller for four games without pay but upon further investigation, the NFL found several other transgressions and increased its punishment to six games without pay.\n\n\u201cI understand I\u2019ve made mistakes,\u201d Miller said during training camp in late July. \u201cBut the guy I was yesterday is not the guy I am today.\u201d\n\nTrouble, though, continues to find him.\n\nMiller received his suspension Aug. 20. Six days before that, he was arrested Aug. 14 by the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Department on a warrant he was issued for failing to appear in court stemming from several traffic violations. Miller had been charged in October, 2012 for careless driving, driving without a license and no proof of insurance. His court appearance was scheduled for January but when Miller failed to appear, the court issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\nMiller was trying to purchase a gun, or concealed-weapon permit from the Centennial Gun Club when a background check flagged the warrant.\n\nBefore his run of legal woes, Miller had emerged as one of the NFL\u2019s brightest young defensive stars. He was the defensive rookie of the year in 2011 and he earned a second Pro Bowl berth in his second season of 2012 when he had 18\u00bd sacks.\n\nMiller missed the Broncos\u2019 season-opening win last Thursday against Baltimore and he will not be able to play in the next five games. The Broncos will play next without Miller on Sunday against the New York Giants in New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium.\n\nMiller won\u2019t be eligible to play again until the Broncos\u2019 seventh game, Oct. 20, at Indianapolis.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller adds to list of transgressions", "title": "Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller adds to list of transgressions", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/10/denver-broncos-linebacker-von-miller-adds-to-list-of-transgressions/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130819__von-miller-broncos-081913ap1-4.jpg", "height": 393}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130819__von-miller-broncos-081913ap1-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-10T23:59:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:50:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9af5\"", "article_summary": "Miller had been charged in October, 2012 for careless driving, driving without a license and no proof of insurance.\nAdd a speeding ticket on top of Von Miller\u2019s lengthy list of recent transgressions, however, and the Broncos\u2019 linebacker may be flirting with serious trouble.\nThe Broncos will play next without Miller on Sunday against the New York Giants in New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium.\nMiller won\u2019t be eligible to play again until the Broncos\u2019 seventh game, Oct. 20, at Indianapolis.\nHis court appearance was scheduled for January but when Miller failed to appear, the court issued a warrant for his arrest."}
