ADP: One-third of midsize businesses fined for non-compliance

October 13 2014

More than one-third of midsize businesses have been fined or penalized for not complying with laws pertaining to how they manage their workforce, according to a new study released today by the ADP Research Institute. Of those fined, 58 percent did not know how much the fines cost and 47 percent did not know how many times they were fined.

The institute defines midsize businesses as those with 50 to 999 employees.

“According to ADP internal data, in 2013 alone there were more than 19,000 proposed changes to laws and regulations that impact how businesses manage employees, so it comes as little surprise that the level and volume of government regulation made our list of top concerns three years running,” said Anish Rajparia, president of major account services at ADP.

The survey also found healthcare benefits costs is the top concern for 69 percent of midsize businesses. The Affordable Care Act and the level of government regulations followed with 54 percent and 51 percent respectively.

Only 15 percent of midsize businesses surveyed were confident that the US economy will improve in the next 12 months. However, 51 percent expect they will see improvement in the industry in which they work.

The online survey included more than 750 owners and executives at companies with 50 to 999 employees.
