Williston, ND

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating two workplace deaths in Williams County over the last few weeks.



A fallen forklift crushed a 26-year-old Colorado man and killed him on Dec. 18. Daniel Okyere worked for the Williston branch of United Pulse Trading when his jacket got lodged in the lift.



On Dec. 31, a piece of drilling pipe dislodged and struck and killed Keith Munro of Sioux Falls, S.D., at a Nabors Drilling rig about 10 miles north of Williston.



OSHA Area Director Eric Brooks said both investigations are ongoing.



OSHA's procedure is to look at every aspect of the job being done, including training for the job, the equipment that was used and the service procedures surrounding the job.
