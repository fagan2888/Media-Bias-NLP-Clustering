The volume blares at 11 in some kind of weird tribute to Spinal Tap. The JumboTron appears straight out of science fiction like the command center for this spaceship.\n\nNothing is left to the imagination. This is NFL meets Sci-Fi meets \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d In the preseason finale, the field might as well be a stage. There were 28 Broncos who participated in a calorie-wringing, pregame workout. Peyton Manning, at one point, led sprints with the race beginning \u201con hut.\u201d The remaining 47 players are competing for playing time and scant jobs.\n\nThe roster doesn\u2019t have to be carved to 53 until 2 p.m. MT on Saturday, but there are expected to be some cuts Friday. With practice squads increased to 10 players this season, it\u2019s conceivable only 12 players will disappear entirely.\n\nIt appears increasingly likely that one or two known players will be cut, making the competition at defensive line interesting. Kevin Vickerson and Mitch Unrein are competing for spots on a defensive line that hasn\u2019t been this deep and talented since 2005.\n\nGAMETRACKER: Broncos vs. Cowboys preseason game in Dallas\n\nThe return of Quinton Carter creates a backlog at safety, meaning that last year\u2019s camp sensation Duke Ihenahco needs to finish strong. Among the rookies, this is the final resume tape for running back Juwan Thompson and receiver Isaiah Burse.\n\nThompson has led the Broncos in rushing in two of their preseason games, totaling 59 yards against the Seahawks reserves. His ability to play special teams \u2014 he started a game last year at linebacker for Duke \u2014 helps his chances. Burse finished strong on his last two punt returns against the Texans. With Jordan Norwood (knee) sidelined for the season and Wes Welker\u2019s status uncertain \u2014 and when he returns, it\u2019s hard to see him on special teams \u2014 Burse has a clear path to making the team. However, he is not a lock as the Broncos will keep an eye on the waiver wire if he doesn\u2019t perform well.\n\nOther players who are on the bubble include Zac Dysert (does the team have the luxury of carrying a third quarterback?) and tight end Gerell Robinson, who is sidelined with a leg injury.\n\nTroy E.
