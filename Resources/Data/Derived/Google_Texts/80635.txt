Heartland Senior Fellow Benjamin Domenech was a guest Wednesday night on “All In with Chris Hayes” on MSNBC. Chris was nice enough to call Ben “one of my favorite conservatives,” and you can see from his affable and fact-filled TV presence why that might be. Ben is also rare among people who go on TV to talk that he actually endeavors to answer the questions he’s asked.

Ben talked about the new Congressional Budget Office report stating Obamacare will end up removing millions of Americans from the full-time workforce. Chris seemed to think that’s a good thing. Ben disagreed.

Media Matters’ Eric Boehlert follows Ben. Media Matters, a lefty outfit few take seriously, has made a habit of attacking Heartland. Nonetheless, we’ve included it because Hayes referred again to the good, honest stuff Ben said.
