He\u2019s now putting his money where his mouth is, with an idea for a plan to improve the health of first his employees, then his customers, and then, well, how about all of America.\n\n\u201cHealth care is so broken in America,\u201d Mackey told Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s Brad Stone. \u201cIf we allow markets to work, if we allow entrepreneurs to get in here and do things like I\u2019m talking about doing, we will pretty much solve the health-care problem in a generation.\u201d\n\nHis plan focuses (at least in part) on America\u2019s diet, which he describes as \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nStep one, according to the Bloomberg piece, is opening Whole Foods\u2019 \u201cTotal Health Immersion\u201d program to more employees. It\u2019s a free weight loss retreat that includes medically supervised lab testing, cooking classes, and talks with nutritionists. And he wants to start offering it to customers too, as a weekend getaway, in Austin first, and then in other major cities if it works\n\nThe next step would be a Whole Foods medical clinic, inspired by one started by Rosen Hotels & Resorts. It has an on site medical facility focused on nutrition and preventative care that serves employees, which that company\u2019s founder says substantially reduced costs. Mackey was inspired to create something similar for his own employees, and potentially for his stores\u2019 customers after touring the facility.\n\nA Whole Foods\u2019 spokesman Stone spoke to described these programs as mere \u201cbrainstorms,\u201d but he says Mackey seems serious.\n\nMackey\u2019s not the first to propose internal clinics and wellness programs to reduce costs. But the track record of these programs is mixed, at best (paywall). Research has found some evidence of cost savings from proactive disease management, but only after several years, and has found little long term gain from the sorts of wellness programs Mackey is touting.\n\nOpening a clinic for customers faces potentially bigger hurdles. At his own company, Mackey can incentivize staff to participate in wellness programs or choose his clinic. That\u2019ll be tougher in a competitive health care market where his company has no particular expertise. Also, the average Whole Foods shopper is more likely to be higher income and health focused already, and less likely to need preventative or nutritional care.\n\nAs for Mackey\u2019s prophecies about diet, market-based solutions, and fixing health care in a generation, yes it\u2019s true that nutrition and preventative care are hugely important, but he ignores other massive drivers of health care costs.\n\nThey include administrative inefficiency, inappropriately aggressive and too\u2013frequent testing and treatment, the through-the-roof cost of end of life care. Oh, and drug prices. There\u2019s also a huge amount of inequity in the system, and regional variation in health and health care costs.\n\nHe says Obamacare is a stealthy attempt to replace employer insurance with a single-payer. Mackey may not like it, but Obamacare at least attempts to deal with some of these issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whole Foods founder John\u00a0Mackey is nearly as well known for making controversial statements\u00a0about health care as he is for popularizing natural and health foods.
