But over the past week, in one of those minor historical ironies, this rural Appalachian county on the Kentucky border has made national headlines for its school board's most un-FDR-like decision to close its three public schools\u2014and blame it on the cost of expanding health care coverage under Obamacare.\n\nThursday, after a lawsuit filed by two parents objecting to the closure was moved from chancery to federal court (since denying students an education might not be the best application of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment), Clay County reversed course and declared that the schools would reopen this coming Monday as scheduled, even if it means completely emptying the district\u2019s coffers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFor, school in or out of session, the school budget crisis remains acute, and Jerry Strong, the county\u2019s director of schools, doesn\u2019t sound convinced that educating the children of Clay County is the best use of the board\u2019s fast-dwindling funds: \"If we spend that, how are we going to put it back?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre we just not kicking the can further down the road to make it more difficult later on?\"\n\nThe county commission, which is responsible for funding schools, has repeatedly denied the school board\u2019s requests for more money, and an attempt to fill the gap by hiking property taxes\u2014the usual basis of school funding, and a broader denial of equal protection that extends far beyond Clay County\u2014has already failed, so now Strong can only hope that a scheduled wheel-tax referendum in March gives his schools the financial boost they so desperately need. If not, he can keep blaming Obama.\n\nOf course, earlier this year, Tennessee declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, even after hospitals agreed to pay the state\u2019s share of the costs (which, per an Obamacare provision, would never exceed 10 percent). Given that the median household income in Clay County was an abysmal $29,727 as of the last census\u2014almost identical to the national minimum Medicaid eligibility threshold of $29,700\u2014it is likely that many of the county\u2019s school employees would have qualified for Medicaid under the expansion (if they didn\u2019t already).", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Everyone at once: Always blame Obamacare!", "sailthru.author": "Laura Moser", "description": "Before this month, Clay County, Tennessee, was perhaps best known as the place where Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s long-serving secretary of state Cordel ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Before this month, Clay County, Tennessee, was perhaps best known as the place where Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s long-serving secretary of state Cordel ...", "title": "Clay County, Tennessee, Is Reopening Its Schools.
