As a Coloradan, chef, and restaurateur committed to farm-to-table quality, integrity, taste, health, and the environment, I encourage Coloradans to vote yes on Proposition 105 this November to require the mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods sold in Colorado.

Colorado's Proposition 105 calls for the mandatory labeling of foods containing ingredients from transgenic crops derived in the laboratory through recombinant DNA technology—a technology that splices genes from bacteria, viruses, or other foreign species into major food crops—pairings that would never occur in nature—to create genetically engineered crops that make their own toxic pesticides, or that can withstand ever increasing amounts of toxic, synthetic herbicides. The primary GMO crops include genetically engineered corn, soy, canola, cotton, and sugar beets, which make their way into just about all grocery products sold in the U.S.

More than 64 other countries, including the entire EU, China, Russia, Japan, Brazil, and elsewhere, require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered or GMO foods.

Advertisement In Colorado, anti-labeling forces have pumped nearly $17 million into the state to try to defeat a grassroots initiative with less than $1 million in funding. These corporations trying to kill Prop. 105 include just a handful of out-of-state, multinational pesticide and junk food companies like Monsanto, Pepsico, Kraft Foods, General Mills, and Smuckers.

In my restaurants, Colterra and SALT, I have taken extra steps to ensure my menu is non-GMO. Together, Colorado families can make a big change — one that can affect truth in labeling across the country — by voting Yes on 105. It's time for all of us to take responsibility for our broken food system and make a change with every purchase, and it starts Nov. 4.
