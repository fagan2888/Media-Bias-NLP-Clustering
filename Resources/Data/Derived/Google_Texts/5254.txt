Maybe I’m just being naive, but if it were up to me, reports on politicians’ pronouncements would provide some context about things those politicians have said in the past – just to help the readers, who probably don’t have dossiers ready to hand.

So, for example, if The Hill is going to report Sen. John Barrasso’s assertion that Obamacare may collapse this year, it would be a service to readers to note that Sen. Barrasso was one of the people claiming that more people would lose coverage than gain it under the Affordable Care Act – and who, when enrollments surged, declared that the administration was cooking the books.

But then again, context has a well-known liberal bias.
