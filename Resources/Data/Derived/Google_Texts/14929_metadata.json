Sorry, right-wing terror sprees.\n\nWhenever a deranged gunman decides to slaughter innocent people, partisans always seem to unearth a few nuggets of evidence that purportedly ties the irrational murders to some completely innocuous political speech they dislike. So when a disturbed couple ambush two Las Vegas police officers, kill a bystander, and leave behind swastikas (a sure sign of their opposition to higher top marginal tax rates, no?) and a Gadsden flag before committing suicide, we are left with only one question: Why do you do it, Republicans?\n\nTake, for instance, Paul Waldman in the Washington Post online: \u201cHow much does right-wing rhetoric contribute to right-wing terrorism?\u201d he asks. Not, \u201cdoes it\u201d contribute to terrorism, or \u201cis this\u201d even terrorism but \u201chow much\u201d\u2014which means we\u2019ve already answered an important question, doesn\u2019t it? But let\u2019s consider the evidence anyway:\n\nWhen GOP Senator Ron Johnson says that the Affordable Care Act is \u201cthe greatest assault on freedom in our lifetime,\u201d and hopes that the Supreme Court will intervene to preserve our \u201clast shred of freedom,\u201d is it at all surprising that some people might be tempted to take up arms?\n\nYes, of course it would be surprising. Fortunately, despite the active imagination of pundits, no one has taken up arms to repeal Obamacare\u2014ever.\n\nNow, some of you would-be enablers of terrorism might argue that an individual mandate that allows government to coerce all citizen to purchase a product on the open market is, as far as policy goes, unprecedented. It is then reasonable to believe that the law constitute one of the most serious \u201cassaults\u201d on individual freedom in recent memory. Nothing in that statement, though, intimates that Americans should ambush their local police officers. Nothing in that statement implies that that you \u201charbor anti-government ideology.\u201d We\u2019re just debating the size of government. Harboring a desire to cut the budget to 2008 levels does not, despite what you may have heard, make you an anarchist.\n\nAre we losing our \u201clast shred of freedom\u201d? That\u2019s certainly a bit hyperbolic. Kind of like accusing your political enemies of \u201cbetting against America.\u201d Or incessantly alleging your political opponents are conspiring to keep the poor poor. Or contending that the GOP wants to \u201cdeny\u201d sick children health care. Or arguing that Republicans are driven by bigotry, and teeming with misogynists and racists. Or, you know, about another dozen or so rhetorical exaggerations that the Left bludgeons its adversaries with every day. Alas, that\u2019s what happens when everything we do in life has a political component.\n\nWhite so not terrorism RT @nycsouthpaw Vegas shooters reportedly spread a Gadsden flag over bodies of their victims. http://t.co/zebShd7LcW\u2014 Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) June 9, 2014\n\nThe use of \u201cterrorism\u201d* in this instance is meant to suggest that there is restive violence rooted in traditionalist constitutional-centric rhetoric. (And isn\u2019t it remarkable how many of same people who claim that 9/11 was merely a criminal act will throw around the word). Which is preposterous. Terrorism is an act of violence intended to generate fear among the populace by deliberately targeting civilians for a religious or ideological goal. The madmen and mentally ill shooters we\u2019ve seen lately\u2014and acts of terrorism have been declining\u2014are neither organized not part of broader ideology that resembles anything in our contemporary political or religious discussion. None. Obviously, Islamic terrorists come in all races and ethnicities; the only thing they all share is an ideological and religious viewpoint. But, then again, why not squeeze every last drop of partisan ammo from a tragedy?\n\nIt is also plausible that many on Left believe their own histrionics, not to mention the simplistic caricatures of conservative and libertarians they\u2019ve created. It is conceivable that some leftist pundits make little distinction between white supremacists and Tea Party conservatives. It is likely that those who jumped to the conclusions about Jared Loughner had convinced themselves that half the country is not only populated by unintellectual God-fearing clods but probably plotting the overthrow of the government. You don\u2019t have to go farther than a Paul Krugman column to see how often those who\u2019ve stopped debating can demonize those who challenge their worldview.\n\nAccusing the other party of snatching \u201cfreedom,\u201d as Ron Johnson and others have, was a formulation regularly used by the Left regularly during the Bush years. And it has probably been used by every minority party since the Founding. If that level of rhetoric, as Waldman and others claim, can drive people to arms, then so be it. First, because it\u2019s not a lie to say we are losing freedom. Second, because even if the Vegas shooters were reading Milton Friedman and pondering Edmund Burke, it still wouldn\u2019t change the fact that mainstream and nonviolent ideology is appropriated by all species of nuts for all sort of screwy reasons. Should we start blaming environmental terrorism on apocalyptic talk that is regularly used by liberals these days? That game leads to de facto limitations on political speech.\n\nThis is all part of a broader movement to transform rhetorical opposition to goals of the progressive agenda\u2014from gay marriage or immigration reform or welfare expansion\u2014into condemnable hate speech. Because we must, as Ari Fleischer told us back when free speech was sacred, watch what we say. When you watch what you say, you can\u2019t say much of anything. Not if you\u2019re a conservative.
