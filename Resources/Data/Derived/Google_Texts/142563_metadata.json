Bush was still president and the economy had yet to officially collapse into recession. The television world was different, too. HBO and Showtime had proven that they could produce quality television, breaking the monopoly of the broadcast networks, but the idea of a cable channel like AMC producing something worthwhile still seemed far-fetched.\n\nAMC was hardly the ideal destination, but the show itself had been passed on by both HBO and Showtime, despite Weiner\u2019s enormous success with \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d A re-watch of the first season will make clear how tight that initial budget was.\n\nPhoto Gallery: Mad Men: 20 Random Fun Facts\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise the show caught fire. The reviews were strong, if not the initial ratings. A combination of witty writing, a rare-steak-juicy plot, and a charismatic cast made the show more than just an exercise in style. But with apologies to Steve Malkmus, it had style for miles and miles. The fedora and martini crowd welcomed it with open arms. Editors at men\u2019s fashion mags wept with joy, and outlets like Banana Republic soon raced to fill their racks with \u201cMad Men\u201d styles.\n\nFor those first three seasons, no show was hotter. The ratings may never have been as extraordinary as those of \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d but \u201cMad Men\u201d permeated the zeitgeist as much as Tony Soprano had.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget the degree to which the show contributed to saving a familiar third party. At a time when streaming was beginning to take off, Netflix was hemorrhaging quality content. It had made the bold move into original programming by outbidding HBO and AMC for \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d but the first season of that series was still nearly two years away from its premiere. In the meantime, Netflix had almost nothing to keep viewers hooked. Many subscribers were questioning the value of their monthly payment.\n\nBut a Draper-esque 11th-hour deal with AMC landed \u201cMad Men\u201d was exclusively in the Netflix catalog, and subscribers stuck around.\n\nRelated: Game of Thrones Season 4 Premiere:Can HBO's Juggernaught Maintain Its Momentum\n\nThe show lost a step after the end of Don and Betty\u2019s marriage, and newer and shinier shows (including AMC\u2019s own \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d neither of which would exist on AMC without \u201cMad Men\u201d) have replaced it as the apple of the public eye. But there are still plenty of viewers willing to ride the show to the end.\n\nThat end starts tonight with the premiere of the first half of the final season (split, like AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d into two half-seasons). Assuming creator Matthew Weiner doesn\u2019t go for some sort of crazy flash-forward to the \u201880s in the second half of the final season, the last episode of \u201cMad Men\u201d will take place in 1969 or \u201870. What began at the end of one era ends at the close of another.\n\nSo where will 1969 find Don and Company? Despite its period piece trappings and soap opera plotting, \u201cMad Men\u201d has always been about a man having an identity crisis. The fact that that identity was a fabrication to begin with only made the point clearer.\n\nIn the beginning, the tension was centered around the fact that Don had created this idyllic life for himself, but it didn\u2019t really make him happy. Now having tried on a few other personas (self-destructive divorcee, impulsively marrying his secretary and trying urban rather than suburban life), Don\u2019s still not happy. And he\u2019s lost his job, the one thing that most determined his identity. He was an Ad Man.\n\nThe question for the final season is \u201ccan anything make him happy?\u201d If last season\u2019s finale was any indication, perhaps Don is finally willing to be honest about his past. Maybe that will help?\n\nPeggy and Don have always been foils, so it\u2019s no surprise to find her ending in the role where Don started, but she too has buried a past and her happiness remains in question. Peggy has embraced the role of dour boomer go-getter, but to do so, she\u2019s had to ditch not just her outer-borough past and illegitimate child, but also her hippy boyfriend and ill-advised office affairs. She\u2019s Creative Director now, but is considered the office buzzkill and will always live under the shadow of Don, her mentor and frenemy.\n\nPete, most interestingly, is given a chance to totally shed his skin. His blue-blood parents are dead, his wife has finally given him the boot and his job has exiled him to the West Coast office. \u201cMad Men\u201d has always shown California as a place for reinvention. Perhaps Pete can start over there and lose the insecurity that has always made him such an insufferable character.\n\nAnd finally, the most important question: Will Roger Sterling continue to drop acid? Will he date a hippy? Will he go to Woodstock? The possibilities are endless.\n\nHaving endured a turbulent decade both on and off the screen, hopefully Weiner and company can bring the show and its beloved characters the closure they all deserve. We know they\u2019ll continue to look great doing it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The premiere of \u201cMad Men\u201d in 2007 might not seem that long ago, but George W.", "title": "\u2018Mad Men\u2019 Premiere Caps 7 Seasons of Change", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/13/Mad-Men-Premiere-Caps-7-Seasons-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Mad_Men_Show_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/13/Mad-Men-Premiere-Caps-7-Seasons-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Mad_Men_Show_article.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The premiere of \u201cMad Men\u201d in 2007 might not seem that long ago, but George W.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfe5\"", "article_summary": "Despite its period piece trappings and soap opera plotting, \u201cMad Men\u201d has always been about a man having an identity crisis.\nEditors at men\u2019s fashion mags wept with joy, and outlets like Banana Republic soon raced to fill their racks with \u201cMad Men\u201d styles.\nPhoto Gallery: Mad Men: 20 Random Fun FactsTo everyone\u2019s surprise the show caught fire.\nThe ratings may never have been as extraordinary as those of \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d but \u201cMad Men\u201d permeated the zeitgeist as much as Tony Soprano had.\nBut a Draper-esque 11th-hour deal with AMC landed \u201cMad Men\u201d was exclusively in the Netflix catalog, and subscribers stuck around."}
