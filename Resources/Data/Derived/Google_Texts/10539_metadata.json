Yet, although many of us think we look at our trees all the time, do we really see what\u2019s going on with them?\n\nNow\u2019s the ideal time to take a closer look at trees, and prune them to correct problems. In late winter, there are no leaves to hide crossed and rubbing branches, splintered wood and other issues. An expert certified arborist can see how a tree\u2019s entire canopy looks, and prune for the health of the tree, as well as for your safety.\n\nLate winter also is the time when it\u2019s easiest for trees to recover from pruning. Wounds from late-winter cuts will heal quickly when spring comes, even in trees like maples and birches that bleed sap. And at this time of year, most tree diseases and pathogens are not yet active, so chances of spreading those problems while pruning are minimized.\n\nWarming trend\n\nBut our climate is changing. Warmer weather is arriving sooner in Minnesota than in the past. The University of Minnesota Extension Service recently released a fact sheet suggesting that homeowners move quickly to cut out tree cankers and galls before the weather warms. Some of those pathogens begin to reproduce and spread when temperatures are just above freezing.\n\nAmong those diseases is black knot, a serious problem on plums and cherries that can kill young trees. Black knot\u2019s knobby, swollen masses are easily spotted on branches at this time of year.\n\nCrabapple and apple trees, pagoda dogwoods, mountain ash and honey locust can all develop cankers, some of which look like sunken dead or gooey spots on branches. Stressed trees that were improperly planted or not cared for are especially prone to cankers, so it\u2019s hard to eliminate the damage once it begins, especially if the canker is on the trunk.\n\nBut when galls like black knot and cankers are on branches, you can slow and perhaps stop damage now by pruning out affected branches, making cuts 6 to 8 inches below where the problem is.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to the U\u2019s bulletin on this issue: http://tinyurl.com/jhat3cr\n\nNow is also the time to prune for our own safety and convenience. While it\u2019s best to shape trees when they\u2019re young, most of us plant a tree and then forget about it. Tired of crouching to mow under that crabapple? Sick of that maple branch scratching the car as you drive up to the house? Now\u2019s the time for some judicious pruning.\n\nPruning tips\n\nIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that pruning is an art, so if you\u2019re going to tackle trimming a tree, do it correctly. Improper pruning prevents trees from healing themselves and can result in serious problems later. No more than a quarter to a third of a tree\u2019s canopy should be removed at one time, and trees should never be given a mindless haircut to reduce height. That practice, called topping, results in weak, spindly \u201cwitches broom\u201d growth.\n\nSo unless you\u2019re willing to learn a bit about pruning (a good guide is at http://tinyurl.com/zy6jbwu) and have a relatively small tree to test your new skills on, it\u2019s best to hire an expert to trim a tree. Pruning a large, mature tree is not only a skill, it\u2019s a dangerous job unless you know what you\u2019re doing. That means you don\u2019t hire the uninsured guys who cruise neighborhoods in pickups, chain saw in hand, to prune trees at bargain prices.\n\nInstead, look for a certified arborist who has training, experience and references and can offer proof of insurance. Such work isn\u2019t cheap; get several estimates. But it\u2019s worth investing in the health of trees. Studies show the benefits of mature trees include cutting air-conditioning costs, helping the environment and increasing your property values.\n\nStill doubt that trees are worth the expense? Studies also show that walking in areas with trees actually reduces stress. So be a pal and take care of our leafy friends. You won\u2019t be sorry.\n\nMary Jane Smetanka is a master gardener and Minnesota-based freelance writer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Late winter is an ideal time to take a good look at your bare trees and correct problems.", "title": "Tree care: Late winter is prime time for pruning", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/tree-care-late-winter-is-prime-time-for-pruning/370291141/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145651368829256.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145651368829256.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Late winter is an ideal time to take a good look at your bare trees and correct problems.", "title": "Tree care: Late winter is prime time for pruning", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/tree-care-late-winter-is-prime-time-for-pruning/370291141/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145651368829256.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145651368829256.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Late winter is an ideal time to take a good look at your bare trees and correct problems."}, "article_summary": "Late winter also is the time when it\u2019s easiest for trees to recover from pruning.\nThe University of Minnesota Extension Service recently released a fact sheet suggesting that homeowners move quickly to cut out tree cankers and galls before the weather warms.\nPruning tipsIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that pruning is an art, so if you\u2019re going to tackle trimming a tree, do it correctly.\nThat means you don\u2019t hire the uninsured guys who cruise neighborhoods in pickups, chain saw in hand, to prune trees at bargain prices.\nPruning a large, mature tree is not only a skill, it\u2019s a dangerous job unless you know what you\u2019re doing."}
