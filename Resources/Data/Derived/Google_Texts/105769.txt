Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played to a crowd of close to 60,000 at the

First National Bank Stadium in Johnannesburg, South Africa on Saturday.

FNB Stadium was where President Obama and other dignitaries spoke at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela on Dec. 10, 2013. It was also the site of Mandela's first speech in Johannesburg after his release from prison in 1990.

"Bruce has to work hard to get the crowd seated in the stadium up," my friend Mitch texted me from the show. "The pit is very energetic but those in the stands are just sitting. They finally got into it on Hungry Heart."

Bruce started the encores with "Who'll Stop the Rain" as it began to rain midway through the show. Mitch said "Bruce paid tribute to Mandela and Obama before playing it."

Overall it was 31-song, 3:22 show with a nice set list with a few surprises.

Bruce played a three-song preshow for the early arrivals, the first time he's done that this tour.

Here's pro-shot footage of "I'll Work For Your Love" and "Gowin' Up" performed during the preshow:
