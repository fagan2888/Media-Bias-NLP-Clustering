As an example, Nadler said, \u201cNinety-nine percent of all American women use birth control at some point in our lives. Their interests cannot be ignored and must not be cast aside.\u201d\n\nFights over birth control are nothing new for Brooklyn. In the last decades of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, contraceptives were illegal in the U.S. Margaret Sanger, a nurse, saw how many low-income women who were injured after self-induced abortions were unable to care financially for their large families, or became depressed after unwanted pregnancies. Sanger vowed that she would make birth control readily available in the U.S., just as it was in many European countries at the time.\n\nFor the site of the first birth control in the United States, Sanger, in 1916, chose a location on Amboy Street in Brownsville, Brooklyn (a street that became famous years later as the setting for Irving Shulman\u2019s 1947 youth-gang novel, \u201cThe Amboy Dukes\u201d). At the time, Brownsville was a poor, working-class area whose residents were mainly Jewish and Italian immigrants with little education. Sanger decided to open the clinic there after some local women came to her pleading for help after multiple births.\n\nA flyer Sanger put out in three languages \u2014 English, Yiddish and Italian \u2014 told women that they didn\u2019t have to have more children if they didn\u2019t want to, that they didn\u2019t have to \u201ctake lives\u201d (presumably, through self-induced abortions), and that \u201ctrained nurses\u201d were available to give information about birth control.\n\nSanger and her sister Ethyl were arrested several times and were eventually sentenced to a short term in the workhouse. Although the Brooklyn clinic was shut down, her movement finally won a victory of courts when a New York State Court of Appeals judge ruled in 1918 that doctors could prescribe contraception for their patients. Sanger opened more clinics and continued to lecture throughout the U.S. She is hailed as a pioneer, even though her belief that people with physical or mental diseases or problems like alcoholism should be discouraged from having children might raise some eyebrows nowadays.\n\nIronically, one of the last populations in the U.S. who don\u2019t use birth control \u2014 the Hasidim \u2014 make their home in Brooklyn. It is not uncommon for Hasidic families to have eight children. While Hasidic women may have some complaints, we don\u2019t hear them, since most are convinced that the number of children they have should be left to the Almighty. Often, they have a novel solution to the problem of raising so many children: The older children who are, say, ages 14 and 16, take on a secondary-parenting role, helping to raise the younger children who are ages 3 or 4.\n\nNext time you hear the phrase \u201cfamily planning,\u201d remember that it all began in Brooklyn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did you know that family planning was pioneered in Brooklyn?", "rights": "Copyright 2014 | Everything Brooklyn Media", "og": {"image": "http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/pages/Rev.%20Bruce%20Prescott%2C%20left%2C%20applauds%20during%20a%20vigil%20outside%20a%20Hobby%20Lobby%20store%20in%20Oklahoma.%20AP%20photo.png"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "robots": "follow, index, noarchive", "keywords": "Brooklyn, Brooklyn Eagle, NYC, New York, New York City, Hobby Lobby, SCOTUS", "abstract": "Did you know that family planning was pioneered in Brooklyn?", "news_keywords": "Brooklyn, Brooklyn Eagle, NYC, New York, New York City, Hobby Lobby, SCOTUS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd654\"", "article_summary": "As an example, Nadler said, \u201cNinety-nine percent of all American women use birth control at some point in our lives.\nTheir interests cannot be ignored and must not be cast aside.\u201dFights over birth control are nothing new for Brooklyn.\nIronically, one of the last populations in the U.S. who don\u2019t use birth control \u2014 the Hasidim \u2014 make their home in Brooklyn.\nSanger vowed that she would make birth control readily available in the U.S., just as it was in many European countries at the time.\nIn her article, Katinas quoted statements by Congressperson Jerrold Nadler (D-Brooklyn/Manhattan), Yvette Clarke (D-Brownsville/Crown Heights) and Carolyn Maloney (D-Brooklyn/Manhattan) blasting the decision."}
