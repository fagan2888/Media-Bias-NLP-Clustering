The world\u2019s newest genetically modified \u201cFrankenfruit,\u201d a purple tomato bringing cancer-fighting anthocyanins to a wider consumer audience.\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, researchers from the John Innes Centre in the UK are this month harvesting a crop of purple tomatoes grown inside a 5,000 square-foot glasshouse for regulatory study and other research as developers hope to move to market there within a couple of years. \u201cWe want to explore a way for consumers to benefit from our discoveries, as we are finding there is a demand for the added health benefits,\u201d genetic researcher Cathie Martin, told PhysOrg. \u201cWith these purple tomatoes you can get the same compounds that are present in blueberries and cranberries that give them their health benefits \u2014 but you can apply them to foods that people actually eat in significant amounts and are reasonably affordable.\u201d\n\nThe purple tomato may help improve the nutritional value of meals from pizza to pasta, with another variety already under development for use in skin care products. The fruit\u2019s color comes from high levels of anthocyanins, compounds found in blueberries, blackberries, and other dark-colored berries. Compared to nature\u2019s tomato, the new plant shows anti-inflammatory benefits \u2014 also slowing the growth of soft-tissue carcinoma in laboratory mice genetically designed for cancer experimentation.\n\n\u201cThe most amazing thing is the potential to supply an expensive compound from nature more economically to large markets for food, livestock feed, cosmetics, food colorings and even pharmaceuticals,\u201d said Paul Carver, CEO of New Energy Farms, which owns the glasshouse.\n\nLike many genetically modified foods, or GMOs, the value-added from human manipulation comes by introducing a foreign gene, in this case one from a snapdragon plant. The researchers hope to gain regulatory approval from Canada to sell fruit juice on the market within two years, finding the country\u2019s regulatory system more inviting to GMO food production than Europe.\n\nMartin described Canada\u2019s food regulatory system as \u201cvery enlightened,\u201d even as large swatches of the North American public remain wary of the 20-year-old technology. \"They look at the trait not the technology and that should be a way we start changing our thinking \u2014 asking if what you're doing is safe and beneficial, not 'Is it GM and therefore we're going to reject it completely,\u2019\u201d she said. \"It is frustrating that we've had to go to Canada to do a lot of the growing and the processing and I hope this will serve as a vanguard product where people can have access to something that is GM but has benefits for them.\"\n\nTo date, consumers might have seen genetic modification as a technology facilitating large profits from agribusiness behemoths, with no personal benefits beyond cheaper prices. A survey of Europeans in 2010 found widespread distrust of GMO technology, by a two to one margin. Similarly, a U.S. poll by ABC News last year found that 52 percent of Americans distrust the technology while another 15 percent said they didn\u2019t know enough to comment.\n\nAlthough the scientific community overwhelmingly supports the safety of GMO foods, researchers say only time \u2014 along with good regulation and demonstrations of safety in the scientific literature \u2014 will modify public opinion.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gmo foods, gm foods, purple tomato, genetically modified tomatoes, gm tomatoes, frankenfruit, gmo regulation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "By introducing a gene from the snapdragon, genetic engineers have imbued the purple tomato with the healing, cancer-fighting power of compounds nature placed in less popular (and more expensive) fruits, such as blackberries and cranberries.", "title": "Purple GMO Tomatoes Coming Soon To A Grocer Near You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/purple-gmo-tomatoes-healthier-nature-coming-soon-grocery-shelves-canada-uk-268021", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/27/scientists-develop-purple-gmo-tomato.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By introducing a gene from the snapdragon, genetic engineers have imbued the purple tomato with the healing, cancer-fighting power of compounds nature placed in less popular (and more expensive) fruits, such as blackberries and cranberries.", "title": "Purple GMO Tomatoes Coming Soon To A Grocer Near You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/purple-gmo-tomatoes-healthier-nature-coming-soon-grocery-shelves-canada-uk-268021", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/27/scientists-develop-purple-gmo-tomato.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/27/scientists-develop-purple-gmo-tomato.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-27T18:29:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T18:29:44-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "By introducing a gene from the snapdragon, genetic engineers have imbued the purple tomato with the healing, cancer-fighting power of compounds nature placed in less popular (and more expensive) fruits, such as blackberries and cranberries."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd433d\"", "article_summary": "The world\u2019s newest genetically modified \u201cFrankenfruit,\u201d a purple tomato bringing cancer-fighting anthocyanins to a wider consumer audience.\nNote: This photograph illustrates the concept of a purple tomato.\nMartin described Canada\u2019s food regulatory system as \u201cvery enlightened,\u201d even as large swatches of the North American public remain wary of the 20-year-old technology.\n\u201cWe want to explore a way for consumers to benefit from our discoveries, as we are finding there is a demand for the added health benefits,\u201d genetic researcher Cathie Martin, told PhysOrg.\nA survey of Europeans in 2010 found widespread distrust of GMO technology, by a two to one margin."}
