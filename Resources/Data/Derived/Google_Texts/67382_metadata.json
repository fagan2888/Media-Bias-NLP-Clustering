Still, this is below the previous forecast of 1.8 percent growth.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said he sees a high chance of meeting his 2 percent inflation target in the first half of fiscal 2016, but the Cabinet Office's forecasts would suggest this is less likely.\n\nIndeed, the Cabinet Office expects inflation to accelerate to 3.1 percent in fiscal 2017, but this would partly reflect a sales tax increase scheduled that year.\n\nFrom fiscal 2018 onwards, the Cabinet Office expects inflation to stabilize at 2 percent.\n\n($1 = 123.6400 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The target is considered an important checkpoint for Japan as it seeks to reduce a deb", "title": "Japan government says won't meet 2020 fiscal discipline targets", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/22/Japan-cut-discretionary-spending-10-percent-2016-budget-source", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-companies_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/22/Japan-cut-discretionary-spending-10-percent-2016-budget-source", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-companies_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The target is considered an important checkpoint for Japan as it seeks to reduce a deb", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "From fiscal 2018 onwards, the Cabinet Office expects inflation to stabilize at 2 percent.\nIndeed, the Cabinet Office expects inflation to accelerate to 3.1 percent in fiscal 2017, but this would partly reflect a sales tax increase scheduled that year.\nConsumer prices were forecast to rise 0.6 percent in fiscal 2015, a far slower than the 1.4 percent forecast in February.\nHowever, this still falls short of meeting the goal of returning to surplus in fiscal 2020.\nConsumer price inflation is expected to accelerate to 1.6 percent in fiscal 2016, partly as economic growth picks up due to gains in consumer spending."}
