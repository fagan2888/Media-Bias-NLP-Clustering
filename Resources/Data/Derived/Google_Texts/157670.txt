HONG KONG (AP) — More than 100 Indonesians in Hong Kong held a prayer vigil and demanded justice Sunday for two Indonesian women found stabbed to death in a case that has shocked this city.

Sitting on a soccer field in the city’s Victoria Park, many wept as they remembered the two victims, 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih and 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. Like the two women, many of those at the vigil came to Hong Kong as domestic workers.

British banker Rurik George Caton Jutting, 29, has been charged with murdering the two women but has not yet entered a plea. On Nov. 1, he led police to his 31st-floor upscale apartment near the city’s Wan Chai red-light district, where they found the two women’s bodies.

Ningsih’s cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen Ningsih in August in their home village in Indonesia. Like many Indonesians, Jumiati goes by only one name.

She said she called police about a week ago to report that Ningsih was missing and later was asked to identify her body. She said her cousin lived in Wan Chai.
