Diane Black (R., Tenn.) sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Wednesday warning that fraudulent Obamacare subsidies could cost taxpayers billions if the administration fails to remedy over 300,000 inconsistencies relating to applicants\u2019 immigration status.\n\nBlack, who sits on the House Ways and Means and Budget Committees, introduced legislation that would prohibit the payment of subsidies unless an applicant\u2019s information is fully verified. The income verification system within Healthcare.gov, which is used to determine subsidies, has still not been completed.\n\n\u201cThe numerous delays by HHS and the inability to resolve inconsistencies within the 90-day window required in statute has created doubt on the Administration\u2019s commitment to ensure proper protections are in place to ensure tax payer funded credits are not vulnerable to fraud, waste, or abuse,\u201d wrote Black, in a letter to HHS secretary Sylvia Burwell.\n\n\u201cThese credits represent the largest area of new entitlement spending in the federal budget and are estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost tax payers over $1 trillion over the next ten years, including an estimated $17 billion in 2014,\u201d she said.\n\nBlack\u2019s legislation warns that the back end of Healthcare.gov is not yet complete, leaving HHS unable to verify if individuals qualify for a subsidy.\n\nHHS warned 310,000 enrollees on Tuesday that their coverage would be dropped unless they prove they have legal status in the country by early September.\n\nThe department has closed roughly 450,000 immigration cases out of nearly 1 million applicants whose citizenship or immigration status did not match.\n\n\u201cNotices are being sent in English and Spanish and provide straightforward instructions on how to submit the necessary information and keep their coverage,\u201d HHS said in a press release.\n\nBlack questioned how the department would verify the remaining 310,000 applicants in her letter on Wednesday. She asked if HHS would review applicants with past coverage, what security mechanisms are in place for storing citizenship documents, and what internal verification process will be used.\n\nThe Tennessee Congresswoman also inquired how many of the 1.2 million applicants who also have \u201cinconsistencies\u201d related to their income have been resolved.\n\nBlack\u2019s bill, the \u201cNo Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2014,\u201d would require manual or electronic verification of an applicant\u2019s information before they could receive a subsidy. The bill notes that failure to verify subsidies for Obamacare plans could amount to an estimated $250 billion in fraudulent payments.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is operating a new federal entitlement program that fails to prevent fraudulent subsidy claims before administered,\u201d the legislation states. \u201cIn doing so, the Department of Health and Human Services has created a new \u2018pay and chase\u2019 program that places taxpayers at financial risk of fraudulent claims.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Rep.
