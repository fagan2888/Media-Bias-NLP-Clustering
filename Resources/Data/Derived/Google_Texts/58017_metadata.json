According to the latest Reason-Rupe poll, 45 percent of Americans say Amazon\u2019s planned use of drones for package delivery makes them think more positively about the future, while 44 percent say the idea makes them think more negatively about the future. Nine percent said the concept doesn\u2019t make them think one way or the other about the future.\n\nTraditional political party affiliation does not impact public opinion on this topic, though political philosophy does play a role, with self-labeled libertarians and progressives feeling most optimistic about this technology. Sixty percent of libertarians and 59 percent of progressives say drone-delivery makes them think more positively about the future, compared to 49 percent of self-labeled liberals, 43 percent of moderates, and 39 percent of conservatives. Fifty percent of tea party supporters are also optimistic, while 43 percent are not.\n\nAmericans\u2019 thoughts about the use of drones for package delivery is highly correlated with age, as younger people feel more positively about the technology than do older Americans. Fifty-nine percent of those under 35, including 68 percent of people 18-24, say Amazon\u2019s idea makes them think more positively about the future, compared to 44 percent of 35-54 year olds and just 34 percent of Americans ages 55 and over who agree.\n\nMen are 13 points more likely than women to report that the idea of this new use of technology makes them feel positively about the future.\n\nNationwide telephone poll conducted Dec 4-8 2013 interviewed 1011 adults on both mobile (506) and landline (505) phones, with a margin of error +/- 3.7%.
