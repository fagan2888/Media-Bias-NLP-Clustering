Two Topekans were arrested early Saturday when a police officer spotted a stolen car they were driving in mere minutes after it was reported missing.

Topeka police Sgt. Ron Ekis said an officer attempted to stop a white 2004 Buick Rendezvous in the 1400 block of S.W. Topeka Boulevard around 12:35 a.m., which was five or 10 minutes after the vehicle had been reported stolen.

Ekis said the Buick accelerated for two blocks and then two men bailed from the vehicle. The passenger, identified as Patrick Allen Baumann, 34, quickly surrendered, Ekis said.

The driver, identified as Christopher Wade Darnall, 24, fled on foot but was apprehended, Ekis said.

Shawnee County Jail records show the two were booked into its facility after 3:30 a.m.

Darnall was booked on suspicion of possession of a stolen vehicle, fleeing and eluding during the commission of a felony, interference with law enforcement officers, defacing identification marks on a firearm and multiple traffic violations.

Baumann was booked on suspicion of criminal possession of a firearm.

A jail official said both men remained behind bars Saturday evening. Darnall had a $15,000 bond and a $10,000 bond. Baumann had a $5,000 bond.
