The fine, for making “inappropriate gestures” in the direction of Flames defenceman Mark Giordano, was the maximum allowable under the collective bargaining agreement.

Toronto Maple Leafs’ forward Nazem Kadri has been fined U.S. $5,000 for making a throat-slashing gesture after taking a hit in a game in Calgary last Tuesday.

Kadri was rocked by a big open-ice hit from Giordano and was slow to get up off the ice. Once he staggered back to the bench, he started yelling in Giordano’s general direction and then made a throat-slashing gesture.

A cursory Google search of media coverage has found no mention of Kadri’s Muslim religion, which provides the relevant cultural context for understanding this gesture. This is doubly odd, since Kadri’s arrival in the NHL had been widely hailed, and his denunciation of Donald Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigration received wide publicity on both sides of the border.

Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch explains:

When you grow up hearing “When you meet the unbelievers, strike the necks” (Qur’an 47:4) and that sort of thing, even if you’re not all that devout yourself, it’s just possible that it might be in the back of your mind.

In fact, the current incident is not the first time Kadri has used this gesture:

The 25-year-old Kadri was disciplined for the same gesture while playing for Canada in a game against Switzerland at the 2010 world junior hockey championship. …

It is clearly part of his cultural heritage, and now that Muslim immigrants are flooding onto the United States at an unprecedented rate, it can’t be too much longer before throat-slashing becomes part of our culture. The NHL could even be accused of cultural insensitivity in fining him for his gesture. It may not be too long before such multi-culturalist dogma is applied.

In any event, we have a new kind of diversity to celebrate in our cultural mosaic.
