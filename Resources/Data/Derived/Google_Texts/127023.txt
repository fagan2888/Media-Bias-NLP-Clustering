The Economist is out with a new magazine cover that may shock you:

A picture is worth a thousand words but I should note that a majority of people now believe that "honesty and trustworthiness" do not apply to President Barack Obama.

A growing number of Americans doubt President Barack Obama's ability to manage the nation, according to a CNN/ORC poll released on Monday that reflects the possible larger impact of his administration's fumbled rollout of its healthcare law.



The poll also found that 53 percent of those polled said Obama is not honest or trustworthy, marking the first time that the CNN/ORC polling found a clear majority questioning the president's integrity, CNN said.





My how things have changed.
