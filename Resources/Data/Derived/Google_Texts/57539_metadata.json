What about the interfaces?\n\n\u201cWe don't interface with Allscripts,\u201d Taylor recounted being told by a major vendor. \u201cYou just have to buy our product.\u201d Taylor added \u201cobviously that didn\u2019t work for us.\u201d\n\nAnd that is just one of many harsh realities prospective customers face when trying to choose an EHR.\n\n[See also: Health systems underestimate time, cost of EMR rollouts.]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been extremely frustrating when you sit down to select one,\u201d Taylor continued. \u201cThere\u2019s not a one-size fits all vendor in the marketplace, nor do I think there ever will be nor do I think that\u2019s healthy. But the inability to take the best of each and pull them together to do what you're trying to do for healthcare and the patient, that\u2019s the frustrating piece.\u201d\n\nThe EHR landscape, peppered with software programs that for reasons technological as well as proprietary or financially-driven do not interoperate, integrate or even interface with each other, will get better in time, of course, as most markets invariably do \u2014 but when?\n\nDisjointed nature\n\nAmong the concerns Taylor rattled off about the current state of EHRs, in addition to how hard it is to select, purchase and implement, is not being able to get a complete picture of patients, and the difficulty of knowing how long the next EHR will effectively serve its purpose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned because I get the question if whatever we move to we\u2019ll be on 10-15 years, but I have trouble thinking beyond five,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be flippant about it but what else are you gonna do? There are only so many players in the market and we\u2019re starting to see that shake out.\u201d\n\n[See also: Object of beauty, or ungainly nuisance?.]\n\nIndeed, the EHR market is \u201cagitated\u201d and \u201cunstable\u201d according to a report published in late July by Black Book. Based on Black Book\u2019s and other firms\u2019 research little doubt remains that many healthcare organizations are either planning to or are already in the process of switching EHR vendors. It\u2019s worth noting that Black Book targeted replacement EHR buyers in its polling of 2,880 \u2014 and 81 percent of respondents are, in fact, planning to drop one EHR in favor of a newer model.\n\nThe less-covered but more surprising finding in Black Book\u2019s statistics, though, was that of the providers switching vendors, a market-quaking 88 percent short-listed at least two from a mere eight EHR makers, those being athenahealth, Care360 Quest, ChartLogic, Cerner, GE Healthcare, Greenway, Practice Fusion and Vitera.\n\n\u201cI hope somebody, somewhere is working to build the ultimate EHR because I just don\u2019t see it out there right now.\u201d \u2014 Mike Taylor, CIO, Roper St. Francis\n\nAgainst the backdrop of so many healthcare organizations looking to switch EHRs and, in so doing, considering a relatively small number of vendors, do the Black Book findings essentially foreshadow the market consolidation that so many people seem to be anticipating? The idea being that fewer EHR makers will survive but their products will be stronger, both more usable and interoperable than what exists today.\n\n\u201cThat observation is spot on,\u201d answered Black Book managing partner Doug Brown.\n\nSo we know a great shakeout is coming. What\u2019s harder to figure is the matter of timing.\n\nBeyond Stage 2\n\nAt least as far back as HIMSS12 in Las Vegas when many health IT professionals and policy makers alike were eagerly, if not anxiously, awaiting the final rule on Stage 2 of meaningful use, people were asking if the more stringent requirements would be a mixed blessing that made qualifying more difficult for providers while simultaneously whittling down the list of certified EHRs from which to choose, thereby rendering a more navigable market.\n\nAs of press time, Stage 2 had not been pushed back but several CIOs, Congressmen, EHR vendors and industry associations including CHIME, HIMSS, and MGMA have been calling for a pause or delay \u2014 whether at the onset or final attestation date \u2014 on the grounds that providers have heaping plates overflowing with Affordable Care Act provisions for payment reform, health information exchange, and ICD-10 compliance on the exact same deadline as Stage 2.\n\nThe cadre of mandates, indeed, threaten to create what Siemens Health Services CEO John Glaser called \u201ca perfect storm\u201d that could cripple some health systems and create a world of \u201chaves and have nots\u201d in which mid-size and smaller providers simply lack the resources to keep up, even to survive.\n\nIn mid-summer Senate Finance committee hearings, the strongest voice arguing against a delay was national coordinator Farzad Mostashari, MD, who earlier this month announced that he intends to step down come autumn, sparking a fistful of industry observers to wonder if that might be something of a tipping point leading to stage 2 delays.\n\n\u201cI think it will normalize after Stage 2 but I kind of think Stage 2 may move, at least I hope so,\u201d said Marc Probst, CIO of Intermountain Healthcare. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at another 4 years of significant effort being required.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s stage 2 or a new presidential administration that ultimately stabilizes the EHR market, as both roll in we\u2019re going to see an even more intense focus on standards to help smooth the waters existing in the industry, Probst added.\n\n\u201cEHRs, just from a workflow and how we do business perspective,\u201d Probst continued, \u201cit\u2019s going to take that long to really burn in.\u201d\n\nIn consensus, Brian Ahier of Advanced Health Information Exchange Resources (AHIER) and a DirectTrust board member, added that even more important than stages of meaningful use are the certification years.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the products aren\u2019t going to achieve 2014 certification,\u201d Ahier said, explaining that some EHRs currently certified as whole systems might only manage modular certification while others will simply fall by the wayside.\n\nPodcast: Preparing for patient portals under meaningful use Stage 2\n\nAssociate Editor Anthony Brino hosts this discussion about the challenges and opportunities CIOs face in implementing patient portals \u2014 and how they are finding that in some cases patients are ahead of the providers. Play in a new window.\n\nWhile 2014 will likely be the beginning of substantive change, Ahier added that it will ratchet up in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\u201cThe usability requirements will be what really solidifies the market,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will take until 2016 and 2017 to really cull the market. When we move usability to the front with Stage 3, that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to see a big whittling down of the EHR landscape.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate EHR and future HIE\n\nThe problems that the EHR market mess creates include the aforementioned limits on visibility into patient data and interoperability, the latter triggering issues with the potential to hinder care coordination as well as public and population health techniques that should be part and parcel of a digitized and modernized healthcare system.\n\nIndeed, once EHRs and ICD-10 do burn-in, Probst said, then the industry can get realistic about what to really expect from health information exchange. Just not before then.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be as interesting sometime in the future as it is today,\u201d Probst said.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Roper St. Francis\u2019 Taylor thinks the industry is ripe for some enthralling innovations.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that there are several guys in a garage right now coding the next EHR. I hope somebody, somewhere is working to build the ultimate EHR because I just don\u2019t see it out there right now,\u201d Roper St. Francis\u2019 Taylor said, fresh from shopping all the major vendors. \u201cHopefully something emerges in the next few years or somebody puts the venture capital together and builds something much simpler, easier and more interoperable than what\u2019s out there today.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The EHR landscape, peppered with software programs that for reasons technological as well as proprietary or financially-driven do not interoperate, integrate or even interface with each other, will get better in time, of course, as most markets invariably do -- but when?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "The EHR landscape, peppered with software programs that for reasons technological as well as proprietary or financially-driven do not interoperate, integrate or even interface with each other, will get better in time, of course, as most markets invariably do -- but when?", "title": "Is the right EHR even out there yet?", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/right-ehr-even-out-there-yet", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/probst.png", "updated_time": "2013-10-28T12:48:31-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/right-ehr-even-out-there-yet", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/probst.png"}, "description": "The EHR landscape, peppered with software programs that for reasons technological as well as proprietary or financially-driven do not interoperate, integrate or even interface with each other, will get better in time, of course, as most markets invariably do -- but when?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is the right EHR even out there yet?"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-03T10:39:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-28T12:48:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce08d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy hope is that there are several guys in a garage right now coding the next EHR.\nIndeed, the EHR market is \u201cagitated\u201d and \u201cunstable\u201d according to a report published in late July by Black Book.\nI hope somebody, somewhere is working to build the ultimate EHR because I just don\u2019t see it out there right now,\u201d Roper St. Francis\u2019 Taylor said, fresh from shopping all the major vendors.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Black Book targeted replacement EHR buyers in its polling of 2,880 \u2014 and 81 percent of respondents are, in fact, planning to drop one EHR in favor of a newer model.\nBased on Black Book\u2019s and other firms\u2019 research little doubt remains that many healthcare organizations are either planning to or are already in the process of switching EHR vendors."}
