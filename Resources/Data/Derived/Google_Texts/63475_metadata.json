Chris Smith, a Fort Lauderdale Democrat, had to temporarily pull the measure (SB 248) from consideration after objections from police and civil-rights organizations that the measure went too far \u2013 or not far enough.\n\nA House companion measure was withdrawn last month.\n\nThe cameras\u2019 benefit in memorializing police interactions has increased after the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Both were unarmed black men who died last year during altercations with law enforcement officers.\n\nMoreover, Florida has seen its own high-profile disputes over the merits of transparency.\n\nThe widow of race-car driver Dale Earnhardt won a court case to prevent release of his autopsy photos after his death in a last-lap wreck at the 2001 Daytona 500. News organizations sought their release to do their own investigations into the crash.\n\nThe Legislature later exempted such photos from disclosure without a court order.\n\nThis latest clash between privacy and openness, which already has resulted in a lawsuit, promises to affect Tampa: Its police department now is using 60 cameras in a one-year pilot study.\n\nElsewhere in Tampa Bay, the Temple Terrace Police Department and the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office also are using them.\n\nTampa Police Chief Jane Castor agreed to require her officers to inform crime victims when cameras are rolling and allow them to ask that a camera be turned off.\n\n\u201cWe get called into some of the worst moments in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Castor told The Tampa Tribune earlier this month. \u201cAnd I agree that private moments should be private.\u201d\n\nSmith, the state lawmaker, says much the same. His bill creates several exceptions to public disclosure, including body-cam footage taken inside a home; at a hospital, mental health or social services facility or at the scene of a \u201cmedical emergency.\u201d\n\nOther exemptions apply to video showing someone under 18 inside a school or on school grounds, or \u201ca child younger than 14 \u2026 at any location.\u201d\n\nA catch-all provision exempts any police body-cam video where an individual recorded had \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d\n\nSmith uses the hypothetical example of a certain celebrity gossip website and the actress wife of the Miami Heat basketball team\u2019s star guard.\n\nIf a police body-cam video was taken \u201cin a park, parking lot or other public place, fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if police are called to Dwayne Wade\u2019s house, TMZ shouldn\u2019t be able to get a tape of Gabrielle Union in (hair) rollers.\u201d\n\nSmith added: \u201cThe devil is in the details, and the problem we have is trying to get these details so that everything is fine. Every time we put something in, something else pops up.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned a section of his bill mandating law enforcement agencies keep body camera recordings for \u201cnot longer than 90 days.\u201d Law enforcement representatives told him that some internal investigations, for instance, can last up to four years, he said.\n\nNanette Schimpf, spokeswoman for the Florida Sheriffs Association, said her group was concerned the bill would apply to all audio and video recordings, including audio recordings at jails and dashboard camera video.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing a minimum record retention threshold be set, just like all other records in Florida,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers took issue with his exemption for children under 14, Smith said.\n\nThey mentioned 12-year-old Tamir Rice, the Cleveland boy shot dead by police as he held a toy gun. The incident happened to be caught by a park surveillance camera.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned because we thought the exemptions were too broad,\u201d said Michelle Richardson, public policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. \u201cThey could be used to suppress evidence of police misconduct.\u201d\n\nPolice and other law enforcers are less subject to brutality complaints when wearing body cams because they \u201crealize they can be held accountable for what they do,\u201d she said.\n\nHer organization\u2019s vice president, Michael Barfield, sued the city of Sarasota over access to body-cam footage.\n\nHe wanted a copy of 84 hours of video from when police there tested their body cameras last year, according to reports. Barfield balked when told it would cost $18,000.\n\nAs far as Smith\u2019s bill, Richardson said she hadn\u2019t found the perfect solution, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to keep working to find the right balance.\u201d Barbara Petersen, president of Florida\u2019s First Amendment Foundation, a nonprofit watchdog group, sent Smith a letter also warning that his bill was \u201coverbroad.\u201d\n\nShe questioned, for instance, the exemption for video taken in homes.\n\nPetersen explained it could keep hidden video of an arrest in someone\u2019s living room even if that person wanted to use it to show excessive force.\n\nConversely, police could have to get permission of someone in a body-cam video who filed a brutality complaint \u2013 even if the agency wanted to use the video to defend itself against \u201cfalse or overwrought accusations,\u201d the letter said.\n\nSmith \u201chas had no contact with us, which is not that unusual\u201d among lawmakers, Petersen said in an interview. \u201cUnless they want us to say we like something. Then they\u2019ll contact us.\u201d\n\nThe senator said that \u201cno one is trying to do anything nefarious.\u201d Rather, he\u2019s just \u201ctrying to find the sweet spots in all the language.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the bill was rescheduled to be heard by the Senate\u2019s Governmental Oversight and Accountability committee this Tuesday. A House measure similar to Smith\u2019s is expected to be filed soon.\n\nSmith is certain of a resolution that balances the right to access with a respect for privacy: \u201cI\u2019ve sat down with a lot of people; I\u2019m making notes ... There is a path.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 15 Mar 2015 19:02:57 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 In another example of the unintended consequences of new technology, the use of body cameras on law enforcement officers is on a collision course with the state\u2019s public r", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 In another example of the unintended consequences of new technology, the use of body cameras on law enforcement officers is on a collision course with the state\u2019s public r", "title": "Police body cameras could conflict with Florida\u2019s public records law", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/police-body-cameras-could-conflict-with-floridas-public-records-law-20150315/", "image": {"width": 2433, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150315/ARTICLE/150319433/EP/1/1/EP-150319433.jpg", "height": 2205}, "updated_time": "2015-03-16T08:22:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 In another example of the unintended consequences of new technology, the use of body cameras on law enforcement officers is on a collision course with the state\u2019s public", "title": "Police body cameras could conflict with Florida\u2019s public records law", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150315/ARTICLE/150319433/AR/0/AR-150319433.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-03-15T19:02:57Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-03-16T08:22:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2df\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 In another example of the unintended consequences of new technology, the use of body cameras on law enforcement officers is on a collision course with the state\u2019s public records law.\nBoth were unarmed black men who died last year during altercations with law enforcement officers.\nHe wanted a copy of 84 hours of video from when police there tested their body cameras last year, according to reports.\nIf a police body-cam video was taken \u201cin a park, parking lot or other public place, fine,\u201d he said.\nThis legislative session, one lawmaker filed a bill creating what he thought were common-sense exceptions to Florida\u2019s broad disclosure statute for public records, which would encompass body-cam recordings."}
