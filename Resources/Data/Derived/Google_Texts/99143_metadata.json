Martinez, who also delivered part of his speech in Spanish, and former Giants great Juan Marichal, elected in 1983, are the only Hall of Famers from the Caribbean nation.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, Martinez beckoned Marichal to the stage and they held their flag high, one last emotional gesture as the crowd roared.\n\n\u201cWe waited 32 years for another Dominican,\u201d said Martinez, who wore a patch honoring his nation\u2019s flag on one shoulder and another honoring the United States on the other. \u201cI hope all Dominicans remember this. I don\u2019t think the Dominican Republic will have a better image than me and Marichal on Father\u2019s Day (in the Dominican Republic) to be up there.\u201d\n\nPlaying through an era tainted by steroids and ruled by offense \u2014 compliments of bulked-up sluggers, a smaller strike zone and smaller ballparks \u2014 Johnson, Martinez and Smoltz proved indomitable. They combined for 735 wins, 11,113 strikeouts and nine Cy Young Awards.\n\nBiggio, who played four positions in his 20-year career, all with the Houston Astros, was indefatigable, becoming an All-Star at second base and behind the plate.\n\n\u201cWe changed the culture in Houston by making it a baseball city,\u201d said Biggio, who grew up on New York\u2019s Long Island. \u201cTo the Astros fans, you guys are the greatest fans in the world.\u201d\n\nMartinez, 219-100 for his career, helped the Red Sox break an 86-year-old World Series drought in 2004 and is the first Boston pitcher inducted. He grew up with five brothers and sisters in a one-room home on the outskirts of Santo Domingo and credits brother Ramon, a starter with the Dodgers during Pedro\u2019s rookie season in Los Angeles, as a key to his career.\n\n\u201cI have a second dad,\u201d said Martinez, who won 117 games and two Cy Youngs in seven seasons pitching in hitter-friendly Fenway Park. \u201cRamon, you are my second dad. I followed in his footsteps and it led me to where I am today.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, all three pitchers didn\u2019t stick around with their first clubs very long. Drafted by Montreal, Johnson made the Expos\u2019 roster in 1988 and midway through the 1989 season was traded to the Seattle Mariners.\n\nSmoltz, signed by his hometown Detroit Tigers after being selected on the 22nd round of the 1985 amateur draft, was dealt to Atlanta for veteran Doyle Alexander in August 1987. And the Dodgers, thinking he might be too fragile at 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds for the rigors of the game as a starter, traded Martinez to Montreal after the hard-throwing right-hander with the pinpoint control had a solid rookie season in the bullpen.\n\nOn this day, that was ancient history.\n\nJohnson, at 6-foot-10 the tallest player elected to the Hall of Fame, gave special thanks to his parents. His father died in 1992. His mother, Carol, was watching from the front row.\n\n\u201cThank you, mom. You\u2019re the Hall of Famer,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson became a 20-game winner in 1997 and won four consecutive Cy Young awards with the Arizona Diamondbacks, leading them to the World Series championship in 2001. He finished with 303 victories in 22 seasons.\n\nSmoltz won the 1996 Cy Young award and reached the playoffs 14 times with Atlanta. The Braves won five pennants and the 1995 World Series with Smoltz on the roster. He\u2019s the first pitcher to win more than 200 games and save at least 150 games. He\u2019s also the first player inducted with Tommy John surgery on his resume.\n\nSmoltz understood his debt to John.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a miracle. I\u2019m a medical miracle,\u201d Smoltz said. \u201cI never took one day for granted.\u201d\n\nSmoltz also heaped praise on former manager Bobby Cox and teammates Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, who were inducted a year ago, and delivered a message to parents of the players of tomorrow as the number of Tommy John surgeries continues to escalate.\n\n\u201cUnderstand that this is not normal to have a surgery at 14 or 15 years old,\u201d Smoltz said to warm applause. \u201cBaseball is not a year-round sport. They\u2019re competing too hard, too early. That\u2019s why we\u2019re having these problems.\u201d\n\nBiggio became the only player in major league history with at least 3,000 hits, 600 doubles, 400 stolen bases and 250 home runs while being asked to play four positions in his 20-year career, all with the Astros.\n\nHe paid special thanks to coach Matt Galante, who worked tirelessly over six weeks of spring training as Biggio made the transition from catcher to second base.\n\nAs he spoke, Biggio looked into the audience at Galante, a baseball lifer who was near tears before the ceremony even began.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here without that man,\u201d Biggio said.\n\nHALL OF FAMERS\n\nPlayers inducted Sunday\n\nCraig Biggio: After being drafted in the first round as a catcher and playing that position and in the outfield early in his career, the Houston Astros made a key decision to move him to second base, and it paid off with four Gold Gloves. Biggio played his entire 20-year career with the Astros, finishing with 3,060 hits, including 291 home runs, and a .281 batting average. The seven-time all-star is often regarded as the best player in Astros history, and he contributed to Houston\u2019s only World Series appearance in 2005. His 668 doubles rank fifth in major-league history.\n\nRandy Johnson: A five-time Cy Young Award winner, \u201cThe Big Unit\u201d was one of the tallest players in baseball history at 6-foot-10. He won 303 games to rank fifth among major-league left-handers, against 166 losses. He compiled a 3.29 career earned run average, playing for the Montreal Expos, Seattle Mariners, Astros, Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Yankees and San Francisco Giants. His 4,875 strikeouts rank him second behind Nolan Ryan and are the most by a left-hander. He was the co-MVP of the 2001 World Series for Arizona. He ranks No. 1 all time in strikeouts per nine innings pitched (10.67).\n\nPedro Martinez: He led the National League in ERA once and the American League four times, all with the Boston Red Sox, on the way to compiling a 219-100 record. He struck out 3,154 batters, including Andres Galarraga four times in a 1997 game at Coors Field. He was a three-time Cy Young Award winner.\n\nJohn Smoltz: \u201cSmoltzie\u201d was an eight-time all-star who won a Cy Young Award. He remains the only player in baseball history with at least 200 wins (finishing with a 213-155 record) and 150 saves (154).", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz, Craig Biggio enter Baseball Hall of Fame", "title": "Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz, Craig Biggio enter Baseball Hall of Fame", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/26/randy-johnson-pedro-martinez-john-smoltz-craig-biggio-enter-baseball-hall-of-fame/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726__baseball-hofp1.jpg", "height": 459}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726__baseball-hofp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T19:25:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T16:57:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1581\"", "article_summary": "Randy Johnson: A five-time Cy Young Award winner, \u201cThe Big Unit\u201d was one of the tallest players in baseball history at 6-foot-10.\nSmoltz won the 1996 Cy Young award and reached the playoffs 14 times with Atlanta.\nThey combined for 735 wins, 11,113 strikeouts and nine Cy Young Awards.\nJohn Smoltz: \u201cSmoltzie\u201d was an eight-time all-star who won a Cy Young Award.\nRandy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz and Craig Biggio were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday and basked in the spotlight one more time with at least 40,000 fans cheering from the sun-drenched field beyond."}
