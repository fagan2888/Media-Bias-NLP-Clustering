The legislation, which received broad bipartisan support, amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a certification program for Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs). The Act codifies the authority of certified PEOs to pay wages to worksite employees and to collect and remit payroll taxes for those wages.\n\n\"This is a landmark piece of legislation that will boost the confidence small and midsized businesses can have in their PEO partners,\" said Maria Black, president of ADP TotalSource\u00ae. \"We welcome IRS certification of qualified PEOs, as not all PEOs participate in industry accreditation and financial assurance programs, such as the Employer Services Assurance Corporation (ESAC), the way ADP TotalSource does. This law sets clear rules and sends a signal that PEOs must adhere to high standards so their clients can enjoy the advantages of the PEO model,\" Black added.\n\nOnce effective, the law will grant certified PEOs successor employer status for FICA and FUTA taxes, eliminating the double taxation that can occur from a wage base restart when a client joins or leaves a PEO mid-year. The Act also confirms that clients of a certified PEO, rather than the PEO itself, can claim certain tax credits related to employment taxes, such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.\n\nTo qualify for IRS certification, PEOs will have to adhere to specific bonding and independent financial review requirements, and certified PEOs will also have ongoing reporting and recordkeeping responsibilities.\n\nThe Act directs the IRS to establish the voluntary PEO certification program prior to the law's anticipated effective date of January 1, 2016.\n\nFor the relevant text of the Act, see: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr5771pcs/pdf/BILLS-113hr5771pcs.pdf (Division B, Section 206)\n\nAbout ADP TotalSource\n\nADP TotalSource is a comprehensive business process outsourcing solution from ADP, a leading provider of human capital management services.
