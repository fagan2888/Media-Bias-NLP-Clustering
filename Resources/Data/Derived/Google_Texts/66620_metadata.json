And why not? Many employers already are giving the motivational kick in the pants for their workers to get fit.\n\n\u201cWe will still have open memberships, but we gear more toward business owners and personal training,\u201d Means said. \u201cEvery year students come and go. This could create a more sustainable business.\u201d\n\nMeans targets nearby businesses to develop wellness plans. The more employees that sign up, the cheaper the rate for everyone, he said.\n\nMany businesses are trying to capitalize as corporate wellness grows. It\u2019s a $7.4 billion industry that\u2019s grown 19 percent in the last two years, up from $6.3 billion in 2012, and is projected to balloon to $11.3 billion by 2019, according to a corporate wellness services industry report by IBISWorld, an independent industry research company based in New York City.\n\nEfforts such as the Blue Zones Project, a rise in the cap on discounts for wellness programs allowed through the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act, and a desire to control rising health care costs are fueling an expansion of corporate wellness.\n\nThat in turn feeds external wellness-related services such as fitness clubs, health risk assessment, weight management, nutrition and smoking-cessation programs.\n\nThe hope is healthier employees will miss fewer days at work, be happier on the job and therefore lead to less turnover, and need less medical care, which ideally would cut back on an employer\u2019s health benefits costs.\n\nSome employers offer cash payouts or days off for participating in wellness programs, and if screenings show employees are maintaining or improving health the incentive may increase, said Thomas Banta, organization lead for Blue Zones Project in Iowa City. Employers are hoping to do right by their employees but also build a more productive and stable work force, he said.\n\n\u201cHappier and healthier employees produce more and cost less,\u201d Banta said.\n\nA 2012 Mercer Survey found that 87 percent of employers with at least 200 employees plan to add or strengthen incentive programs.\n\nMeanwhile, incentives of $50 or more have proved to entice people to join wellness programs, and incentives of $200 or more lead to \u201cstatistically significant\u201d increases in weight loss, smoking cessation and exercise, according to the RAND Corp., the not-for-profit research institute.\n\nBecause of all this, Corridor business owners such as Kristi Bontrager, of Jazzercise Fitness Center in Iowa City, are finding more opportunities to work with employers.\n\nACT has contracted Bontrager to offer classes on its Iowa City campus. Last month, she provided free sessions for Procter & Gamble employees at the Jazzercise gym.\n\nBontrager also attends local health fairs, such as at ACT and through the Iowa City Community School District.\n\nBut those fairs are becoming more saturated with vendors, she said.\n\n\u201cI do think there is more of an emphasis corporately ... and that helps those of us in the fitness industry,\u201d Bontrager said. \u201cThat corporate push encourages their employees to be more fit, and nothing motivates better than your boss encouraging you to be healthy.\u201d\n\nAs the corporate wellness industry grows, so does competition, and not just from external service providers. The IBISWorld study found more employers are increasing in-house services.\n\nACT, for example, hired a wellness manager, Sandy Stewart, to cultivate a healthier work force.\n\nShe\u2019s set up lunch hour sessions of Zumba, fusion fitness and martial arts, and discount rates at local fitness facilities. Meanwhile, ACT is also building a free on-site fitness center with cardio equipment, weights, locker rooms and showers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about going to the gym, it\u2019s about being more active,\u201d she said.\n\nl Comments: (319) 339-3177; brian.morelli@thegazette.com", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | IOWA CITY - Six months ago, Adam Means shifted the business model at his downtown gym, Iowa City Fitness.Rather than market to the ever-transient student popula", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "IOWA CITY - Six months ago, Adam Means shifted the business model at his downtown gym, Iowa City Fitness.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/gyms-wellness-providers-capitalize-on-corporate-kick-for-fitness-20150308", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20150308/ARTICLE/150309681/EP/1/3/EP-150309681.jpg", "article": {"section": "News"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/gyms-wellness-providers-capitalize-on-corporate-kick-for-fitness-20150308", "description": "IOWA CITY - Six months ago, Adam Means shifted the business model at his downtown gym, Iowa City Fitness.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Gyms, wellness providers capitalize on corporate kick for fitness"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2015-03-07T22:17:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_news", "pubDate": "2015-03-08T07:00:00-05:00", "title": "Gyms, wellness providers capitalize on corporate kick for fitness"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "IOWA CITY \u2014 Six months ago, Adam Means shifted the business model at his downtown gym, Iowa City Fitness.\nRather than market to the ever-transient student population in this college town, he refocused around corporate wellness.\nMany businesses are trying to capitalize as corporate wellness grows.\n\u201cI do think there is more of an emphasis corporately ... and that helps those of us in the fitness industry,\u201d Bontrager said.\n\u201cThat corporate push encourages their employees to be more fit, and nothing motivates better than your boss encouraging you to be healthy.\u201dAs the corporate wellness industry grows, so does competition, and not just from external service providers."}
