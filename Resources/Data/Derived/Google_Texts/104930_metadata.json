Red Lake leads their Section 8A (Minnesota Class 1A) and recently ended a season-best eight-game winning streak.\n\nIn the classroom, the team has excelled as well, boasting a team grade-point average of 3.0, led by Samantha Roy and Tanisha Beaulieu, who are on the school\u2019s academic honor roll.\n\nAll students at Red Lake High take Ojibwe language classes and have the opportunity to learn Ojibwe traditions from community elders.\n\nThe Atlanta Dream\u2019s Shoni Schimmel, a Native American, has visited the school and is among one of the program\u2019s top supporters.\n\n\u201cIn the community, the Lady Warriors assist with a number of events, including organizing and serving a Christmas dinner for the elderly, working the community soup line and decorating the reservation\u2019s cultural center for community events,\u201d said the release.\n\nThe release also included a statement from the Atlanta Dream:\n\n\u201cThe Atlanta Dream would like to congratulate Sam Roy, Angel McCain, Danielle Seki, Alexis Desjarlait, Grace White, Averi Holthusen, Tanisha Beaulieu, Suanne Crowe and Sidney Beaulieu for their exceptional efforts and for earning this week\u2019s Atlanta Dream Girls\u2019 High School Basketball Team of the Week Award. Red Lake High School is led by head coach Randy Holthusen.\u201d\n\nThe Addie award was inspired by Lakeview High School (Ohio) 2016 team captain and senior Addison Becker, who contacted the Dream about her concern for the lack of coverage and recognition for the accomplishments of female high school athletic programs regionally and nationally.\n\n\u201cI am writing because something has come to my attention that I feel can no longer be simply ignored,\u201d Becker wrote.\n\n\u201cI play basketball for myself and for the love of the game. However I have noticed that less girls are picking up a basketball in our community. I feel this is due to the lack of attention, recognition and most importantly the support they receive. Female athletes are just as dedicated as their male counterparts and I feel it is time young people brought attention to this matter. I want to change this mindset and what is now a social normality, so I am reaching out for help.\u201d\n\nThe Dream liked the idea and named the Atlanta Dream\u2019s Girls\u2019 High School Basketball Team of the Week Award as the \u201cAddie,\u201d after Becker.\n\nThe Dream will continue to honor one team a week during the high school girls\u2019 basketball season. Each winner will receive 10 complimentary tickets to the May 22 season opener vs. Chicago and be recognized on-court at Philips Arena and the 2016 Atlanta Dream Girls\u2019 High School Basketball Team of the Year will be recognized.\n\nIn addition, each weekly winner will enjoy a post-game meet and greet with a Dream player on May 22, as well as a visit to their school by Atlanta Dream mascot \u201cStar.\u201d.\n\nTo nominate your team for the honor, please visit AtlantaDream.net or CLICK HERE for the nomination form.\n\nFollow ICTMN\u2019s A&E, Sports and Pow Wows Editor and contributor Vincent Schilling (Akwesasne Mohawk) on Twitter - @VinceSchilling", "article_metadata": {"description": "Go High School Ballers!
