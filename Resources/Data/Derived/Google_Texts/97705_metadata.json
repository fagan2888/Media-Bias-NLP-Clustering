(USCCB) once again urged the Obama administration \u201cto reconsider\u201d its new rules for religious institutions and some non-profits in ObamaCare\u2019s HHS mandate.\n\n\u201cThe administration continues to propose an unjust and unlawful mandate; an arbitrarily narrow exemption for houses of worship; no exemption at all for most stakeholders; and an 'accommodation' that still requires employers that fall outside the narrow government definition of 'religious employer' to facilitate the objectionable coverage,\u201d the USCCB said in comments presented to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Wednesday.\n\nThe bishops were commenting on the latest version of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cRules on Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe mandate, which requires most employers to provide free contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and abortion-inducing drugs to employees through their health insurance plans, had its eighth accommodation issued by the Obama administration August 22 in response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision finding that the mandate as-is violates the religious freedom of some closely-held for-profit companies.\n\nClick \"like\" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!\n\nThe administration opened a 60-day public comment period the same day of its proposed \u201cinterim final rules\u201d slightly modifying the government\u2019s \u201caccommodation\u201d for nonprofit religious organizations not exempted from the mandate, and \u201cproposed rules\u201d on extending the accommodation to closely-held for-profit companies.\n\nUSCCB attorneys submitted comment on both proposals.\n\n\u201cThe mandate continues to substantially burden the religious liberty of stakeholders with religious objections to the mandated coverage,\u201d the USCCB said in its comments on the interim final rules. \u201cBecause it does not further a compelling government interest by the means least restrictive of religious exercise, the mandate continues to violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\u201d\n\nThe USCCB said that the interim final rules do not change the mandate itself, or its exceedingly narrow exemption, offered mainly to churches but not social service and other religious organizations.\n\n\u201cThe interim final rules make no change in the underlying mandate,\u201d the U.S. bishops said. \u201cFor reasons discussed more fully in our earlier comments, we continue to believe that the contraceptive mandate should be rescinded.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike other 'preventive services,' prescription contraceptives do not 'prevent' disease, the bishops said. \u201cInstead, they disrupt the healthy functioning of the human reproductive system, temporarily or permanently creating the condition of infertility commonly seen as a health problem.\u201d\n\nThe USCCB statement also said the rules do not provide for religious freedom.\n\n\u201cFor the overwhelming majority of stakeholders, the interim final rules offer not even a gesture in the direction of conscience protection\u2014neither the exemption, nor even the accommodation,\u201d it said.\n\nThe U.S. Catholic bishops said that the interim final rules\u2019 new alternative way for non-exempt religious groups to comply with the \u201caccommodation\u201d still forces employers to enable contraceptive coverage, by directly supplying the government with \u201call it needs\u201d to authorize and require the employer\u2019s insurer or third-party administrator to provide or arrange for the very payments to which the employer objects.\n\n\u201cThe interim final rules retain a regulatory scheme in which 'preventive' health services are defined to include items that do not prevent disease, but rather are intended to render a woman temporarily or permanently infertile, and may be associated with adverse health outcomes,\u201d the USCCB said.\n\nIn its comments on the proposed rules regarding for-profit companies, the USCCB said the proposal actually \u201cmakes the current situation worse for closely-held for-profit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage,\u201d because these organizations are currently exempt under RFRA, as the U.S. Supreme Court recently held with Hobby Lobby.\n\nThe \u201caccommodation,\u201d as modified by the interim final rules, is insufficient to protect the religious liberty of organizations that are eligible for it,\u201d the bishops said, and, \u201cthe proposed rules do nothing to help other stakeholders with religious or moral objections to the mandate.\u201d\n\nNumerous Catholic institutions and other religious and private entities have brought legal action against the Obama administration for the unconstitutional HHS mandate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "\u201cThe interim final rules make no
