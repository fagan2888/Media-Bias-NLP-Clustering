The bite left Robles, 50, with gashes in his right side and a damaged artery near his thumb, resulting in a loss of sensation.\n\nThe incident happened Saturday morning near the Manhattan Beach pier, where a fisherman had dropped a line into the water no more than 40 minutes earlier. According to KCAL9, the shark had gotten hooked on the line for some time, before turning agitated and lashing out at nearby Robles. The California realtor says he saw the shark swimming straight toward him, his eyeballs locked directly on the animal\u2019s as it struck.\n\n\u201cFor a second, I thought this might be it,\u201d Robles told KCAL9. \u201cI was absolutely terrified. I never thought I would die in the ocean.\u201d\n\nRobles says he had the presence of mind \u2014 how, he doesn\u2019t know \u2014 to grab hold of the shark\u2019s nose and pry its mouth off his torso. Nearby swimmers and paddle boarders noticed Robles struggling and helped carry him to shore, where he received treatment for deep lacerations and a damaged thumb.\n\nOfficials told the news station that while fishing off the pier is not illegal, it is suspended until July 8. Robles says he\u2019s lucky to be alive and only wishes the attack was taken more seriously by onlookers, who filmed the event and laughed at the possibility of a shark attack. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even close to funny,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was me about to lose my life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "california, shark, attack, leaves, swimmer, massive, lacerations, nerve, damaged, thumb", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An unsuspecting swimmer passing through a California pier ended up face-to-face with a great white, leaving him badly injured.", "title": "California Shark Attack Leaves Man With Massive Cuts, Numb Thumb [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/california-shark-attack-leaves-swimmer-massive-lacerations-nerve-damaged-thumb-291654", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/sharkattack.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An unsuspecting swimmer passing through a California pier ended up face-to-face with a great white, leaving him badly injured.", "title": "California Shark Attack Leaves Man With Massive Cuts, Numb Thumb [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/california-shark-attack-leaves-swimmer-massive-lacerations-nerve-damaged-thumb-291654", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/sharkattack.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/sharkattack.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-07T11:58:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-07T11:58:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An unsuspecting swimmer passing through a California pier ended up face-to-face with a great white, leaving him badly injured."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe225d\"", "article_summary": "Long-distance swimmer Steven Robles was passing from the Hermosa Beach pier to the Manhattan Beach pier just south of Santa Monica, California when a seven-foot great white shark started ripping into his side.\nAccording to KCAL9, the shark had gotten hooked on the line for some time, before turning agitated and lashing out at nearby Robles.\nThe incident happened Saturday morning near the Manhattan Beach pier, where a fisherman had dropped a line into the water no more than 40 minutes earlier.\n\u201cFor a second, I thought this might be it,\u201d Robles told KCAL9.\nThe California realtor says he saw the shark swimming straight toward him, his eyeballs locked directly on the animal\u2019s as it struck."}
