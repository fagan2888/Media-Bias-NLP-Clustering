Coverage begins Jan. 1. There is no deadline to enroll.\n\nAntoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, said that while she lamented that hundreds of thousands -- many with chronic illnesses -- had to wait a year to get coverage, she was happy the day had finally arrived.\n\n\"Hardworking Pennsylvanians have been waiting far too long for this day,\" said Ms. Kraus, who was part of a team helping to enroll individuals Monday at a library in Carlisle, west of Harrisburg.\n\nShe said people were \"streaming in all day.\" Among them, she said, was a farmer who had to be turned away last year because his income was too high and whose health insurance premiums went up. He now qualifies for Medicaid. Several other individuals whose unemployment insurance had run out and could not afford private health insurance also enrolled.\n\nHealthy PA, however, is likely not long for this world.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Gov.-elect Tom Wolf takes office, and he has vowed to scrap the Corbett plan - which critics say places limits on coverage for the most vulnerable - and shift immediately to full Medicaid expansion.\n\nWolf spokesman Jeffrey Sheridan said individuals would not lose coverage even though the transition will be cumbersome.\n\nIndividuals seeking insurance under Healthy PA can apply online at www.COMPASS.state.pa.us.
