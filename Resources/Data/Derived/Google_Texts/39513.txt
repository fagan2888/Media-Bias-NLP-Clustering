WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — The U.S. added 113,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate fell to another post-recession low, but the pace of hiring appears to have slowed over the past few months, according to new government figures.

The second straight disappointing employment report suggests that unusually cold and snowy weather in the past two months is not the chief cause of a slowdown in job creation. In December, the economy added just 75,000 jobs, a meager gain that many economists had initially blamed on bad weather.

One worrisome sign is a sudden freeze in hiring in health care, one of the nation’s fastest growing industries over the past two decades. Health-care providers cut jobs for the first time on record, raising questions about whether the rollout of Obamacare is roiling the industry.

Government also eliminated the most jobs in 15 months, with the U.S. Post Office accounting for a large chunk of the decline.

The jobless rate reached the lowest post-recession level in January. See more charts here.

The nation’s unemployment rate, meanwhile, dropped to 6.6% from 6.7% in December, the Labor Department said Friday. That’s the lowest level since October 2008, and in a good sign, the decline occurred because more people found jobs and not because the labor force shrank again.

In another bit of good news, the so-called labor force participation rate edged up to 63.0% after retouching a 35-year low of 62.8% in December.

The participation rate reflects the percentage of people who hold a job or are looking for one. A surprisingly sharp decline in participation over the past few years is largely responsible for the falling unemployment rate.

In U.S. markets, investors shrugged off the lower-than expected increase in employment and stocks SPX, +0.83% advanced. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast an increase of 190,000 jobs.

Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said investors aren’t convinced the economy is slowing, and if it is, investors probably would expect the Federal Reserve to reverse course and pump more stimulus into the economy in a move that would help stocks.

“It will take more than a month or two of weak data to conclude the jobs market is becoming weaker,” she said. “It’s a yellow flag, not a red flag.”

Inside the report

The private sector once again generated all the employment growth, adding 142,000 jobs in January. That’s up sharply from 89,000 in December but well below the norm over the past year.

Hiring rose the fastest in January in professional and business services, construction and manufacturing.

The number of professional jobs created in January jumped by 36,000. The industry has been the fastest growing since the recession ended in mid-2009.

Builders boosted payrolls by 48,000 last month after a 22,000 drop in December, and manufacturers hired 21,000 workers. Both of these industries are prone to weather-related fluctuations in hiring.

Bars, hotels and restaurants also added 24,000 jobs in the first month of 2014.

Employment fell in the retail sector, however, as companies cut 13,000 jobs. In the past month, Macy’s said it would eliminate several thousand positions and discounter Loehmann’s said it would go out of business.

Government jobs fell by 29,000 in January, including a 9,000 decline in Postal workers. It was the biggest drop in government jobs since October 2012.

Average hourly wages of U.S. workers, meanwhile, rose 5 cents, or 0.2%, to $24.21 in January. In the past 12 months hourly wages have risen 1.9% — enough to keep ahead of inflation but too little to give consumers much to cheer about. The average workweek was flat at 34.4 hours.

Employment gains for December and November, meanwhile, were mixed. The number of new jobs created in December was barely changed at 75,000 compared to a preliminary read of 74,000. November’s figure was revised up to 274,000 from 241,000.

The U.S. had added an average of 154,00 jobs a month since November. Yet the pace of hiring has tapered off from the 194,000 average for all of 2013.
