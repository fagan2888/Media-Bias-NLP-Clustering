LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Health Net, Inc. has awarded $81,000 to the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles to help implement the first Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART) in the Los Angeles Police Department’s Topanga division.

Health Net’s corporate grant supports DART advocates – those individuals who respond alongside police officers to domestic abuse situations – and covers training, equipment and other staff support. Earlier this year, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti committed to deploying a DART in each of the city’s 21 police divisions.

“Our partnership boosts the expansion of my administration’s anti-domestic violence support programs – a significant part of my public safety strategy focused on building a safer city and safeguarding the trust between the Los Angeles Police Department and our residents,” said Garcetti. “Together, we are helping families forge a new path toward a safer, more secure and brighter future.”

DART teams provide on-scene crisis intervention and wraparound services intended to break the cycle of violence. In 2014, 3,022 victims were served, and more than 300 trainings were provided to 4,696 law enforcement officials, victim advocates and community members.

“Health Net’s grant is expected to help the lives of hundreds of domestic abuse victims,” said Carol Kim, director of Public Affairs for Health Net. “If we want to stop the cycle of abuse, we have to be able to properly and swiftly take action in these dire situations. DART’s goal is to make sure victims are not led back into abuse simply because they lack resources.”
