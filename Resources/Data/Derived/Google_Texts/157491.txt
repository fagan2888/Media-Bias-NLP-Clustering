A Garden Plain home is likely a total loss after a fire late Sunday morning.

The fire was reported around 11 a.m. in the 200 block of West Garnett.

Crews arrived to find heavy fire and were forced to battle the flames defensively after the roof collapsed , said Kip Hiebert, Sedgwick County Fire Department Division Chief.

No one was home at the time of the fire.

Heibert says the cause is under investigation. A damage estimate was not provided.
