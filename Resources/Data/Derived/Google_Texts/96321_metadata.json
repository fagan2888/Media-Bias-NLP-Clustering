Tell that to John Tankersley, an Indiana stay-at-home dad who has tried for more than two weeks to navigate the system to buy badly-needed coverage for his family, as his wife doesn\u2019t get health insurance from her job. He tried the call center, too \u2014 only to find that they can\u2019t figure out how to enroll people, either:\n\nIn the meantime, John Tankersley tried to sign up by phone. \u201cAnd they were having the same frustrations,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have to go back and edit something they have to start all over again.\u201d\n\nIn part, that may be because no one\u2019s quite sure what anything means. Tankersley tried to register his dependent children on the site, but couldn\u2019t figure out in which category they belonged:\n\nHe soon learned that every time he answered a question it prompted a 10 to 30 second delay. Some of his answers didn\u2019t compute. Some of the questions he didn\u2019t understand, including one about his children. \u201cIs their relationship also any of these relationships?\u201d he said reading from the website. \u201cAnd it has something called collateral dependent. I have never heard that phrase before.\u201d\n\nAll told, Tankersley has spent 25 hours trying to navigate both on-line and call-center systems. His family still doesn\u2019t have health insurance. What took a couple of hours at most before this year has now turned into a journey relatively equivalent to Homer\u2019s Odyssey, thanks to the federal government takeover of what had been a private transaction between consumer and insurers, regulated by the states.\n\nThis is indeed Big Government\u2019s signature moment.\n\nAddendum: Yes, I had some fun with the headline. So sue me.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cCollateral dependents\u201d?", "title": "Video: Hoosier daddy can\u2019t navigate Obamacare site \u2014 or the call center", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/19/video-hoosier-daddy-cant-navigate-obamacare-site-or-the-call-center/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-19T20:01:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-19T15:57:35+00:00"}, "keywords": "exchanges, insurers, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1110\"", "article_summary": "He tried the call center, too \u2014 only to find that they can\u2019t figure out how to enroll people, either:In the meantime, John Tankersley tried to sign up by phone.\nHis family still doesn\u2019t have health insurance.\nI have never heard that phrase before.\u201dAll told, Tankersley has spent 25 hours trying to navigate both on-line and call-center systems.\nVideo: Hoosier daddy can\u2019t navigate Obamacare site \u2014 or the call centerposted at 4:01 pm on October 19, 2013 by Ed MorrisseyYesterday, HHS insisted that consumers who want are forced to buy health insurance through the federal exchange could work around the web site, which hasn\u2019t worked properly since its launch.\nTell that to John Tankersley, an Indiana stay-at-home dad who has tried for more than two weeks to navigate the system to buy badly-needed coverage for his family, as his wife doesn\u2019t get health insurance from her job."}
