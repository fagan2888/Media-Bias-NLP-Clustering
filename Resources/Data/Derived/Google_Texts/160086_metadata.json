Communication with referring physicians, the patient, and each other.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember there are three factors to communication \u2013 the referring physician, the radiologist, and the patient,\u201d said Leonard Berlin, MD, a radiologist with NorthShore University Health System. \u201cCommunication is the link between all three. It\u2019s obviously a real problem when there\u2019s a failure to communicate emergency or acute findings, but it\u2019s significant that there\u2019s a large amount of significant and unexpected findings that don\u2019t get communicated either.\u201d\n\nThe State of Medical Malpractice in Health Care\n\nThe impetus behind medical malpractice cases remains the same, according to Graham Billingham, MD, chief medical officer for Medical Protective Company, the largest U.S. professional liability medical malpractice insurance company.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get sued for a bad outcome \u2013 you get sued for a bad outcome and an upset family,\u201d he said. \u201cA big part of the problem is that people don\u2019t understand the coverage they have, so they\u2019re hit with big deductibles. And, if they have a bad outcome and are also sent to hospital collections, there\u2019s a lot of pressure that comes with that.\u201d\n\nAnd, with 40% to 50% of patients still unable to afford healthcare premiums under the ACA, this is a problem that will grow. It\u2019s possible to defuse patient tension and reduce the risk of lawsuits, he said, by keeping them updated about any clinical findings\n\n\u201cPatients want to be in the game and be told what\u2019s going on, and for years, we\u2019ve put up walls,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of people think that\u2019s wrong and patients get more upset when they get stonewalled. We should probably have these conversations.\u201d\n\nHe also cautioned providers that patients\u2019 attorneys can now subpoena personal, hand-held devices, such as iPads and smartphones, to show whether providers were distracted at a time when the patient experienced a bad outcome. Everything within and outside the electronic health record (EHR) is time-stamped.\n\nMedical Malpractice in Radiology\n\nIn radiology, 75% of lawsuits center around a failure to diagnose or communicate, Billingham said. Most diagnostic misses happen with breast cancer, abdominal and pelvic scans, and fractures, and 56% of errors are subtle. Mammography is mentioned in 43% of cases, and X-rays and CT in 19% and 15%, respectively.\n\nPoor supervision of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and radiology assistants, as well as medication complications in the radiology suites, are also cited in lawsuits.\n\nIn 2014, radiology ranked 6th out of 28 specialties in the frequency of medical malpractice suits filed and 5th in the number of dollars paid out to plaintiffs. Radiologists were named in 13% of law suits against academic medical centers and in 20% of cases filed against community hospitals. In recent years, he said, the average payout has risen from $350,000 to $409,000.\n\nRadiology also faces a new set of trends that could result in more lawsuits, Billingham said. New procedures; patients with larger body mass indexes; pediatric exposure regulations; radiation burns; dose creep; proper training for associated radiology assistants, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners; and the need for sufficient records of communication all present additional risks.\n\nSurvival Strategies\n\nIn some cases, radiologists can shield themselves somewhat by joining large, consolidated health systems or multi-specialty practices. This type of move is an effective way to share the financial burden of medical malpractice insurance, but it can\u2019t protect individual providers from being sued, said Jonathan Berlin, MD, a diagnostic radiologist with NorthShore Medical Group. It\u2019s no longer easy to simply shift responsibility to another provider.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a misconception that if you blame someone else, that you won\u2019t be affected, so responses like \u2018Who\u2019s the idiot who missed this?\u2019 aren\u2019t really appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must be cognizant that responses like that aren\u2019t helpful if you ever end up facing a medical malpractice suit.\u201d\n\nTo truly protect themselves, providers must proactively seek out all information available to them, he said. Compare current tests to previous ones, and remember to search for any previous exams that might have been conducted with a different modality.\n\nReduce cognitive errors by seeking the opinions of others, he said. Don\u2019t hesitate to seek out the input of the technologist who performed an exam.\n\nIn addition, said Leonard Berlin, radiologists must be more proactive about ensuring referring physicians read the radiology reports. Just sending the report isn\u2019t enough. According to a 2011 Radiology study, 37% of referring physicians believe their interpretations are better than a radiologist\u2019s, and 15% admit they don\u2019t read radiology reports at all.\n\nRather than leaving the onus on the referring physician, he said, radiologists must become more comfortable with reaching out. A recent American College of Radiology member survey revealed that while 97% of providers will make a phone call to a referring physician with emergency findings, only 24% will call about the unexpected, significant findings. It\u2019s those often-overlooked findings that can lead to malpractice law suits \u2013 and the radiologist could be held liable for ineffective communication.\n\nUltimately, he said, radiologist must take more responsibility going forward in educating patients about their health findings. The advent of web-based patient portals is a step forward, but they aren\u2019t a guarantee that patients will be kept up-to-date. Direct patient contact is preferable.\n\n\u201cIf the patient doesn\u2019t want to read the report, they won\u2019t go find it,\u201d Leonard Berlin said. \u201cSo, if there\u2019s an accusation of a delay to diagnose, you can\u2019t sit there and blame the patient. The jury won\u2019t buy it. We have to be aggressive and take the active stance. We can\u2019t be passive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dc.date": "2014-12-22", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A majority of malpractice cases in radiology are a result of failure to diagnose or communicate."}, "article_summary": "Medical Malpractice in RadiologyIn radiology, 75% of lawsuits center around a failure to diagnose or communicate, Billingham said.\nIt\u2019s obviously a real problem when there\u2019s a failure to communicate emergency or acute findings, but it\u2019s significant that there\u2019s a large amount of significant and unexpected findings that don\u2019t get communicated either.\u201dThe State of Medical Malpractice in Health CareThe impetus behind medical malpractice cases remains the same, according to Graham Billingham, MD, chief medical officer for Medical Protective Company, the largest U.S. professional liability medical malpractice insurance company.\nIn 2014, radiology ranked 6th out of 28 specialties in the frequency of medical malpractice suits filed and 5th in the number of dollars paid out to plaintiffs.\nIt\u2019s those often-overlooked findings that can lead to malpractice law suits \u2013 and the radiologist could be held liable for ineffective communication.\nIn addition, said Leonard Berlin, radiologists must be more proactive about ensuring referring physicians read the radiology reports."}
