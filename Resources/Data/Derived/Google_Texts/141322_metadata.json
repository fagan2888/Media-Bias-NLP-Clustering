I wonder if it has anything to do with Ferguson?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Paffrath said he was called into his boss\u2019 office and ordered to take the pictures down. He said he deleted the photos and continued working as usual. But Saturday, Mr. Paffrath said he was called in and fired by the hotel chain\u2019s director of security.\n\n\u201cHe called me a terrorist and said I dishonorably served my country for posting those pictures and the short video,\u201d he told the Fox affiliate. \u201cHe gave me a threat that if I were to re-post the pictures that I would be locked up and have DHS knocking on my door and all that other stuff.\u201d\n\nMr. Paffrath said management told him his actions jeopardized a $150,000 contract the hotel supposedly had with Homeland Security. The federal agency would not comment on that either, the Fox affiliate reported. Drury Hotels would only confirm that Mr. Paffrath no longer worked there.\n\n\u201cWe do not publicly discuss confidential personnel matters,\u201d Vice President and General Counsel Joseph Pereles said in a statement. \u201cThe safety and privacy of our guests and our team members has always been and will remain our top priority.\u201d\n\nMr. Paffrath told the station the hotel\u2019s decision was \u201cdefinitely an overreaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like they could have handled it better, I mean given us a security meeting possibly and given us details they were coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no clue they were even arriving here. And then I come and see these vehicles here. Obviously I\u2019m going to take a picture, it\u2019s not the normal thing we have 70-plus Homeland Security vehicles there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Navy veteran who worked at a hotel outside St. Louis said he was fired from his job after posting pictures on Facebook that showed dozens of Homeland Security vehicles parked in the hotel's garage.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Navy veteran who worked at a hotel outside St. Louis said he was fired from his job after posting pictures on Facebook that showed dozens of Homeland Security vehicles parked in the hotel\u2019s garage.", "title": "Ferguson-area Navy veteran says hotel fired him for photos of Homeland Security vehicles", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/st-louis-hotel-worker-says-he-was-fired-for-photos/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/18/mark-paffrath.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/18/mark-paffrath.jpg", "description": "A Navy veteran who worked at a hotel outside St. Louis said he was fired from his job after posting pictures on Facebook that showed dozens of Homeland Security vehicles parked in the hotel's garage.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ferguson-area Navy veteran says hotel fired him for photos of Homeland"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Mark Paffrath, Drury Hotels"}, "article_summary": "Obviously I\u2019m going to take a picture, it\u2019s not the normal thing we have 70-plus Homeland Security vehicles there.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very odd that there was a bunch of Homeland Security cars there,\u201d Mr. Paffrath said.\nA Navy veteran who worked at a hotel outside St. Louis said he was fired from his job after posting pictures on Facebook that showed dozens of Homeland Security vehicles parked in the hotel\u2019s garage.\nBut Saturday, Mr. Paffrath said he was called in and fired by the hotel chain\u2019s director of security.\nDrury Hotels would only confirm that Mr. Paffrath no longer worked there."}
