Kevin Cramer, R-ND, said in an interview. \u201cI guess I would put it at less than 50-50 because it\u2019s just that at every turn them seem to try to find a reason to try and delay it longer.\u201d\n\nTrain derailments, including one in Casselton in December, has led to calls from the National Transportation Safety Board for improved infrastructure and for those trains loaded with crude oil to be rerouted away from populated areas.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Russian Times of data from the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, train derailments in America spilled more oil in 2013 than the previous four decades combined.\n\nOf the 1.5 million gallons of oil spilled by train derailment in 2013, the Casselton derailment accounted for an estimated 400,000 gallons, while a derailment in Alabama accounted for another 750,000 gallons.\n\nFrom 1975 to 2010 there was an estimated total of 800,000 barrels of oil spilled in America by train derailment.\n\nMany observers point to these derailments as evidence of a need for additional energy infrastructure, including pipelines.\n\nCramer said the only possible reason for continued delay is politics.\n\n\u201cAt this point there\u2019s no more possible studying you could do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s by far the most studied and analyzed and environmental impact studied pipeline in the history of the world,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what more you could possibly learn.\u201d\n\nStill, Cramer said there is hope for the beleaguered project\u2019s approval if the political winds in Washington, D.C., shift.\n\n\u201cCould it be approved? I think to be honest with you this is a clear example of the consequences of elections,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the United States Senate switches control to the Republican Party, it\u2019ll be largely over issues like this.\u201d\n\nAll that\u2019s needed for the project to win approval, Cramer said, is for a bill authorizing the project to be brought to the Senate for a vote.\n\nHe said that if the Keystone pipeline could get a vote in the Senate, it would pass easily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s almost a veto-proof bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIf in fact the Senate was to switch parties over things like the Keystone and energy issues, as well as Obamacare issues, I think the president would take pause and ask if (he wants) to spend (his) last two years (in office) fighting and doing nothing or moving our economy forward.\u201d\n\nContact Rob Port at rport@watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "North Dakota Rep.
