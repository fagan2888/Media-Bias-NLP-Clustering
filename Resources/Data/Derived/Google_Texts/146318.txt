Frank Tripucka, the first quarterback in Broncos history, a Ring of Famer and the first player whose number was retired by the team, died Thursday morning after a lengthy illness. He was 85.

Tripucka completed 10-of-15 passes in the Broncos’ first game in 1960, a 13-10 victory over the Boston Patriots.

Broncos general manager Bob Howsam, who later gained prominence in baseball as the architect of Cincinnati’s Big Red Machine in the mid-1970s, retired Tripucka’s No. 18 after the quarterback’s retirement in 1963. Floyd Little (44) and John Elway (7) are the only other Broncos players whose numbers have been retired.

Tripucka gave his blessing to surrender his No. 18 to Peyton Manning after the Broncos signed the star quarterback before last season. The Broncos had been working in the last couple of weeks to set up a meeting between their current quarterback and original quarterback Saturday in northern New Jersey, where Tripucka lived. The Broncos are playing the New York Giants in New Jersey this Sunday.

“It’s perfectly OK for him to go ahead and use it,” Tripucka said on March 14, 2012, six days before Manning signed with the Broncos. “I would be honored to have him wear it. It’s been retired for 50 years. That’s long enough.”

Tripucka, who was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1983, is survived by his wife Randy, six sons (including former Notre Dame and NBA basketball star Kelly) and one daughter.
