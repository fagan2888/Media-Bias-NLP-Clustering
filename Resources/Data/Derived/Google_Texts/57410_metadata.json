For Kaepernick to become a Bronco he must restructure his contract or take a paycut given Denver\u2019s minimal salary cap space. It is considered the biggest hurdle to a deal with a growing belief the teams can reach an accord on draft pick compensation.\n\nSan Francisco gave Kaepernick\u2019s agents permission to seek a trade in February, meaning other teams are allowed to speak with him directly. The San Francisco Chronicle first reported the Thursday meeting, the second in two weeks between Elway and Kaepernick.\n\nThe Broncos traded for veteran Mark Sanchez and have Trevor Siemian, a seventh-round draft pick in 2015, on the roster. But bringing in a third quarterback \u2014 via trade, free agency or the draft \u2014 to create competition for the two has long been the plan.\n\nAcquiring Kaepernick, however, would take some roster maneuvering by the Broncos. Denver has only $1.62 million in salary cap space. For any deal to go through, Kaepernick needs to show elasticity with his money. San Francisco could also absorb some of the contract to improve the draft pick involved.\n\nOutside linebacker DeMarcus Ware provided the Broncos relief by converting part of his guaranteed money to a signing bonus and adding incentives to decrease his base salary. The Broncos could clear additional room by releasing or trading offensive tackle Ryan Clady, who missed all of last season because of a torn ACL and is due $9.5 million in 2016.\n\nThe Broncos have talked with Clady\u2019s agent multiple times since the NFL scouting combine in February to work toward a contract resolution, and they have signed two linemen \u2014 Donald Stephenson and Russell Okung \u2014 in the offseason.\n\nKaepernick has been in Vail this offseason to rehabilitate from three surgeries in the last five months: on his left shoulder, left knee and right thumb. The 49ers\u2019 offseason workout program begins Monday, but it\u2019s not known whether Kaepernick will be cleared to participate. He has bonuses tied to his attendance, and coach Chip Kelly has said he would like a chance to work with the former Nevada star.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos make push to acquire Colin Kaepernick, but contract an issue", "title": "Broncos make push to acquire Colin Kaepernick, but contract an issue", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/02/broncos-make-push-to-acquire-colin-kaepernick-but-contract-an-issue/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160331__fbn-kaepernickp1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160331__fbn-kaepernickp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-02T12:16:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T20:27:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce057\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos made a push to acquire the San Francisco quarterback as general manager John Elway met with Kaepernick at his Denver home Thursday about restructuring his contract, an NFL source confirmed.\nSan Francisco gave Kaepernick\u2019s agents permission to seek a trade in February, meaning other teams are allowed to speak with him directly.\nIt is considered the biggest hurdle to a deal with a growing belief the teams can reach an accord on draft pick compensation.\nThe Broncos traded for veteran Mark Sanchez and have Trevor Siemian, a seventh-round draft pick in 2015, on the roster.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle first reported the Thursday meeting, the second in two weeks between Elway and Kaepernick."}
