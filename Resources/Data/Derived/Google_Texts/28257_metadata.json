Mary Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who is not very popular in Louisiana. But the ad stretches the facts on several points.\n\nThe ad accuses Landrieu of \u201cweakening immigration,\u201d based on her vote to block an amendment aimed at curbing Obama\u2019s use of executive orders to address immigration. But Landrieu also voted to allow consideration of such a bill weeks later, and she has stated her opposition to addressing immigration by executive order.\n\nThe ad accuses Landrieu of \u201craising our taxes,\u201d based on her vote for the Affordable Care Act. The law includes about $1 trillion worth of new taxes \u2014 with the heaviest burden falling on high-income taxpayers \u2014 but it also includes over $1 trillion worth of health care tax credits. So, the law includes both tax increases and tax cuts.\n\nThe ad also accuses her of \u201ctaking away our Second Amendment rights,\u201d based on her support for a bill that would expand background checks to include sales by unlicensed individuals at gun shows and over the Internet. Despite the ad\u2019s sweeping claim, Landrieu has been a staunch protector of a citizen\u2019s right to own guns.\n\nWait, you say, aren\u2019t the midterm elections over? Not in Louisiana, where the top two vote-getters on Nov. 4, Landrieu and Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, will compete in a Dec. 6 runoff.\n\nLandrieu got the most votes in the Nov. 4 election, edging out Cassidy 42.1 percent to 41 percent. But polls suggest Landrieu will have a tougher time in the runoff, as many of the 13.8 percent who voted for tea party Republican Rob Maness are expected to switch their allegiance to Cassidy. One bad sign for Landrieu: the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee recently cancelled $1.8 million worth of TV ad time it had reserved to support Landrieu.\n\nThe NRSC Attack\n\nTwo days after the Nov. 4 election, the NRSC launched its latest ad attacking Landrieu as a rubber stamp for President Obama, whose job approval rating is low in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cDo you agree with your spouse 97 percent of the time? Your kids? The ref at the game?\u201d the narrator in the ad asks. \u201cChances are, no. But amazingly, Mary Landrieu has agreed with Obama 97 percent of the time, including on destroying our health care, raising our taxes, weakening immigration and taking away our Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that, in 2013, Landrieu voted with Obama 97 percent of the time, while Cassidy backed Obama just 8 percent of the time, according to CQ Weekly. But as far as party loyalty, CQ found Landrieu was less likely to back her fellow Democrats in the Senate (which she did 90 percent of the time) than Cassidy was to back his fellow Republicans in the House, which he did 96 percent of the time. Which begs the question: Does Cassidy agree with his spouse and kids 96 percent of the time? But we digress.\n\n\u2018Weakening Immigration\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the weakest of the ad\u2019s claims, that Landrieu agreed with Obama on \u201cweakening immigration.\u201d As backup, the NRSC points to a procedural vote cast on July 31, blocking the Republicans\u2019 ability to add an amendment to an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to respond to a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America being apprehended at the southwest border. The Republicans had hoped to add an amendment from Sens. Jeff Sessions and Ted Cruz that sought to block Obama from carrying out his promise to take executive action to protect many immigrant families from the threat of deportation.\n\nMinutes later, Landrieu also voted against the underlying $2.7 billion emergency supplemental appropriations bill. It was one of the few instances in which Landrieu parted ways with the Obama agenda this year.\n\nLandrieu, July 30: I stand willing to work with members of both parties to craft a solution that addresses the emergency of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border. However, I cannot support spending significant taxpayer money without strong accountability and clear goals to ensure that we get the results we all want. Unfortunately, the proposal before the Senate does not go far enough to ensure that these children are reconnected in the countries of origin with safe and protective families.\n\nBut there\u2019s a gaping hole in the NRSC\u2019s argument. It ignores Landrieu\u2019s vote on Sept. 18 on yet another procedural vote aimed at blocking Republicans from forcing consideration of the Sessions-Cruz amendment to block executive-action protections for immigrants living in the country illegally. The vote this time fell 50-50, and prevented consideration of the Republican amendment. But Landrieu voted for the motion, along with all Senate Republicans.\n\nThe Hill noted that Landrieu, as well as Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kay Hagan \u2014 all of whom were embroiled in tough reelection bids \u2014 broke ranks with their party to back the motion. One could argue that it was a political calculation. Nonetheless, Landrieu can rightly claim to have supported it.\n\nLandrieu also has stated publicly that she opposes the president tackling immigration reform via executive order. At a press conference after a debate on Oct. 14, Landrieu told Breitbart News that she supported the bipartisan Senate immigration bill passed in 2013 that provided a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. \u201cSo, I do not support executive action,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cI support congressional action. I have already voted for that bill.\u201d\n\n\u2018Raising Our Taxes\u2019\n\nThe ad\u2019s claims about Landrieu agreeing with Obama on \u201cdestroying our health care\u201d and \u201craising our taxes\u201d both refer to Landrieu\u2019s vote for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to get into the debate about whether the Affordable Care Act is \u201cdestroying our health care,\u201d as that amounts to political opinion. The ad, does, however, cite a Dec. 30, 2013, story in The Advocate that reported that 92,793 insurance plans in Louisiana were discontinued because they did not meet the law\u2019s minimum coverage standards. However, after Obama allowed insurance companies to continue to offer older plans that didn\u2019t meet ACA standards for one more year, about 31,000 of the original number were able to keep their insurance plans.\n\nAlso worth noting, Landrieu introduced the Keeping the Affordable Care Act Promise Act, which would have gone even farther than Obama did. It sought to require insurance companies to offer renewals of the canceled plans, rather than giving the companies the option to renew them.\n\nThe Hill, Nov. 5, 2013: \u201cWe said to people that if they have insurance they like, they can keep it,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say that if they have insurance they like that doesn\u2019t meet the standards or that meets the minimum standards, they can keep it. \u201cWe said, and the president said over and over, that if people have insurance, and they like the insurance they have, they can keep it. That is my bill. That is the single focus of my bill.\u201d\n\nThe bill did not advance out of committee.\n\nThe claim that Landrieu supported \u201craising our taxes\u201d also relates to her vote for the Affordable Care Act. It is accurate to say that the bill includes $1 trillion worth of new taxes over the 2013-2022 time period, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis of a proposal to repeal the law.\n\nAn analysis from the House Ways and Means Committee provides a rough breakdown of those new taxes. Much of the new tax burden \u2014 $318 billion \u2014 will fall on high-income earners. For example, the ACA includes an additional 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax and a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income \u2014 both for individuals making more than $200,000, and couples making more than $250,000. There is also a tax on so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d high-cost health care plans beginning in 2018; a tax on drug manufacturers; a tax on manufacturers of certain medical devices; a tax on health insurance providers; and, of course, taxes related to the employer and individual mandates.\n\nHowever, the law also will provide more than $1 trillion worth of health care subsidies, over that same period of time, that will come via refundable tax credits. In an Aug. 14, 2013, report, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that \u201cabout half (48%) of people now buying their own insurance would be eligible for a tax credit that would offset their premium.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the law cuts two ways \u2014 increasing taxes for some, but decreasing taxes for others who qualify for health care subsidies. The NRSC ad only refers to one side of the equation.\n\n\u2018Taking Away Our Second Amendment Rights\u2019\n\nSo, how did Landrieu take away people\u2019s Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms?\n\nThe NRSC ad cites her vote in favor of an amendment crafted by Sens. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Republican, in the wake of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that would have expanded background checks to private sales by unlicensed individuals at gun shows and over the Internet.\n\nIn a vote of 54 to 46, the Manchin-Toomey amendment failed to garner the 60 votes needed to move forward \u2014 despite Landrieu\u2019s support.\n\nThe National Rifle Association\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action argues that a vote for the Manchin-Toomey amendment \u201cconstitutes a vote to take away gun rights.\u201d\n\nNRA-ILA, Oct. 3: Currently, gun owners in most states enjoy the right to privately transfer firearms. They often do so by facilitating such transfers at gun shows and by advertising through online and print publications. The private transfer restriction amendment would have outlawed this activity, making firearm transfers more difficult, and therefore less likely to occur.\n\nAs we wrote when the NRA made a similar claim in an earlier ad attacking Landrieu, it\u2019s a long stretch from a debate about the inconvenience of background checks at gun shows to the blanket claim that Landrieu wants to take away people\u2019s Second Amendment right to own a gun.\n\nLandrieu has co-sponsored and voted for legislation to allow people with permits to carry concealed weapons in states other than their own; has repeatedly opposed a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips; and voted to prevent the seizure of firearms during a state of emergency. Landrieu also praised a decision by the Supreme Court to repeal a ban on carrying handguns in Washington D.C.; and voted in 2009 to \u201crestore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia\u201d and to repeal its ban on semi-automatic weapons.\n\nIn other words, she has consistently shown support for protecting Americans\u2019 right to own guns.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But Landrieu voted for the motion, along with all Senate Republicans.\nThe ad accuses Landrieu of \u201craising our taxes,\u201d based on her vote for the Affordable Care Act.\nWait, you say, aren\u2019t the midterm elections over?\n\u2018Taking Away Our Second Amendment Rights\u2019So, how did Landrieu take away people\u2019s Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms?\nThe law includes about $1 trillion worth of new taxes \u2014 with the heaviest burden falling on high-income taxpayers \u2014 but it also includes over $1 trillion worth of health care tax credits."}
