Among the uninsured were immigrant children living in the country unlawfully, who until recently were ineligible for full coverage under Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of the federal Medicaid program for people with low incomes.\n\nOne reason for the increase in coverage of California\u2019s children is that the state embraced the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $33,500 for a family of four). It was likely a spillover effect, as adults signed up and learned that their kids were eligible, too.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, the already robust percentage of eligible California children participating in Medi-Cal, rose 3.4 percentage points, from 88.9 percent to 92.3 percent, according to the study.\n\nMore from this series\n\nNot surprisingly, the Urban Institute researchers showed that the biggest coverage increases across the United States occurred in the states that expanded their Medicaid programs. In addition to California, 30 other states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion so far.\n\nNationwide, 91 percent of children who were eligible for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program were enrolled in 2014, the first full year of the law\u2019s implementation, according to the study. That was up from 88.7 percent in 2013 and only 81.7 percent in 2008.\n\nCHIP, like Medicaid, is a federal-state health coverage program for low-income residents. CHIP provides coverage for kids whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nIn California, almost all children covered by public insurance receive Medi-Cal. The state once had a separate CHIP program for slightly higher-income kids, but officials merged it with Medi-Cal several years ago.\n\nThe national increase in coverage among children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP mirrors changes in the overall uninsurance rate for children, which fell from 7 percent in 2013 to 5.8 percent in 2014, the researchers noted.\n\nThey estimated that 4.5 million children younger than 18 are still uninsured. That population varies significantly among states, according to the report: Fourteen states have an uninsurance rate below 4 percent, while in four \u2014 Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and Texas \u2014 it is above 9 percent.\n\nUse Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nGiven that national coverage rates for children were already high, \u201cI was surprised to see gains to such an extent in 2014, and for that to happen for so many different kinds of kids and in so many different places,\u201d said Genevieve Kenney, co-director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center, who was an author of the study.\n\nIn California, the number of uninsured minors is likely to drop even further after a new state law took effect earlier this week allowing low-income immigrant children who are in the country illegally to sign up for full-Medi-Cal benefits. An estimated 170,000 undocumented children in the state can now apply for full health coverage, and advocates are launching enrollment campaigns to help them do so.\n\nNationwide, children of different ethnic groups, ages and family incomes benefited from coverage gains between 2013 and 2014. But progress has been slower for some groups, including adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18, and Hispanic kids in families with no English-speaking parent.\n\nThe Urban Institute study used data from the American Community Survey, an ongoing tracking study by the U.S. Census Bureau that includes data on more than 700,000 children ages 18 and younger.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the 4.5 million children who were uninsured in 2014 were eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, the study found. Many of them had been enrolled in Medicaid at some point in their lives, Kenney said.\n\n\u201cThat puts the spotlight on renewal and retention,\u201d Kenney said. States have adopted different strategies to encourage continued coverage. Some have policies that, for example, allow kids to stay enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP for the full year even if their parents\u2019 income or other circumstances change. Others determine whether kids are still eligible for the programs by conducting data checks rather than requiring parents to fill out paperwork.\n\nKenney said she expects that uninsurance rates for kids improved again in 2015, as more states expanded Medicaid and families enrolled in subsidized insurance on the state marketplaces. This month, Arizona reinstated its CHIP program, after freezing enrollment in 2009, thus extending coverage to more lower income children.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nPlease contact Kaiser Health News to send comments or ideas for future topics for the Insuring Your Health column.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Up to 170,000 undocumented children in the state can now apply for full Medi-Cal health coverage, which will boost enrollment.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Up to 170,000 undocumented children in the state can now apply for full Medi-Cal health coverage, which will boost enrollment.", "title": "Number Of Low Income Kids Getting Coverage Grows In California, Around Nation", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/number-of-low-income-kids-getting-coverage-grows-in-california-around-nation/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kids-insurance.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/kids-insurance.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-05-20T09:00:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-20T16:20:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This month, Arizona reinstated its CHIP program, after freezing enrollment in 2009, thus extending coverage to more lower income children.\nBolstered by the federal health care reform law, the number of low-income kids getting full health coverage in California continues to grow, as it does in the nation as a whole, a recent study found.\nThe state once had a separate CHIP program for slightly higher-income kids, but officials merged it with Medi-Cal several years ago.\nCHIP, like Medicaid, is a federal-state health coverage program for low-income residents.\nIt was likely a spillover effect, as adults signed up and learned that their kids were eligible, too."}
