Did you know that President Franklin Roosevelt moved Thanksgiving up on the calendar to extend the holiday shopping season in 1939? But since 1942, Thanksgiving has been on the fourth Thursday of November. Here's a history of when America has observed Thanksgiving, beginning with a declaration by President George Washington.\n\n2. Until last week, Cleveland hadn't been hit with a November snowstorm of at least 3 inches on a single day since the year 2000, based on official readings from the airport. But last week, it happened twice - first on Thursday and then again on Friday. Here's a rundown of the November single-day snows of at least 3 inches over the years in Cleveland.\n\n3. Was last week's first snow of the season (at the airport) an early snow for Cleveland? Not really. During the previous 10 years, the first snow came later than Nov. 13 six times and earlier four times. Here's a rundown of the first and last snows each year in Cleveland since 1950.\n\n4.

It's called gerrymandering - the art of drawing districts designed to get certain results, rather than districts that make sense geographically. See our analysis of gerrymandering on Ohio elections over the past several decades.\n\n5. The New York Times has produced a nifty interactive map, showing where federal health exchange insurance rates will be going up, and where they will be going down next year.
