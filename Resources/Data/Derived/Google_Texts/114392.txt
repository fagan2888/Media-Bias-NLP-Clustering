CLEVELAND — The Broncos’ depth at outside linebacker took another hit Sunday.

Shane Ray, the Broncos’ first-round draft pick this year, was carted off the field after spraining the MCL in his right knee on a play in the second quarter against the Browns.

Ray got caught in the fray on a tackle and had to be helped off the field by two trainers. He took a seat on the bench, and was visibly shaken by the injury, holding his head in his hands as teammates tried to console him.

He was taken back to the locker room shortly after and at halftime was ruled out to return.

Afterward, Ray, wearing a brace on the knee and walking with crutches, said he was hopeful the injury wouldn’t keep him out for long.

“I’m being optimistic,” he said. “I’ll be back.”

Ray will undergo further evaluation when the team returns to Denver.

The Broncos played without starting outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, who was ruled out Friday with a back injury. But he is expected back after the bye week for the Broncos’ Nov. 1 home game against the Packers.
