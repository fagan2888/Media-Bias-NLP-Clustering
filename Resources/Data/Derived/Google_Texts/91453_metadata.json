There have been many accidents reported throughout North Texas today, including one fatal crash in Arlington.\n\nDallas police said as of 4 p.m. they had answered 78 minor wrecks, 53 injury wrecks and 50 injury wrecks on freeways. Arlington police said they had responded to 5 major crashes since 10 a.m. and cautioned those on the road to slow down.\n\nHarris said the precipitation should end around 9 p.m., but it will be \u201cbitterly cold.\u201d\n\nAs for the Monday morning commute, Harris said roads should begin to thaw by late morning as temperatures rise and the sun begins to filter in.\n\nUpdate at 3:08 p.m. by Julie Fancher: Arlington police are investigating if poor weather conditions were a factor in a two-vehicle crash that left one person dead Sunday afternoon.\n\nAccording to police, the crash happened around 12:30 p.m. in the northbound lanes of Highway 287 near Interstate 20.\n\nPolice found a pickup that was disabled on the side of the road just past the Highway 287 overpass. Police said the driver was outside the pickup when a second vehicle came off the bridge, lost control and struck the pickup and its driver.\n\nThe victim, who has not yet been identified, died at the scene. The driver of the second vehicle was taken to Medical Center of Arlington with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nPolice said the crash is still under investigation, but cautioned icy conditions may be have been a factor in the incident.\n\nThe northbound lanes of Highway 287 near Little Road are currently closed. Police are asking those on the road to drive slow due to current weather conditions.\n\n\u2014 Arlington Police, TX (@ArlingtonPD) March 2, 2014\n\nUpdate at 2:30 p.m.: As our Roy Appleton reports, the icy weather has forced the cancellation of the Mardi Gras parade in Oak Cliff. Dallas police gently suggested it would be a very bad idea to laissez les bons temps rouler down streets growing increasingly treacherous with each round of thundersleet.\n\nUpdate at 2:20 p.m. by Liz Farmer: The bulk of the bad weather should clear Dallas County between 6 and 7 p.m., said Dennis Cain, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth.\n\nMost precipitation is light with the heaviest appearing to the North and East of Dallas.\n\nScattered thunderstorms are causing the bulk of problems by dropping sleet onto areas all at once so there\u2019s not time for it to melt, Cain said.\n\nTemperatures are expected to drop into the teens tonight, which will make it easier for patches of ice to form around Dallas into the morning.\n\nUpdate at 12:41 p.m. by Liz Farmer: DFW Airport announced that 270 departures have been cancelled today due to freezing drizzle and sleet with temperatures in the upper 20s.\n\nThe cancellations are about 29 percent of today\u2019s flight schedule and the airport advises customers to contact their airline or check dfwairport.com/flights.\n\nThe airport will continue to monitor conditions and has treated runways and roadways throughout the day.\n\nThe Mardi Gras Oak Cliff Parade has just been cancelled due to safety concerns with the weather, according to the Go Oak Cliff Facebook page. McKinney\u2019s Krewe of Barkus has been moved inside the McKinney Performing Arts Center.\n\nUpdate at 11:32 a.m.: With thundersleet having been reported in Denton County, and frozen precipitation beginning to fall throughout much of North Texas, the National Weather Service has just issued Winter Storm Warning for an area that includes Dallas and Fort Worth. It will expire at 9 p.m.\n\nMark Fox, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, says the warning is in effect from an area stretching from Gainesville to Dallas-Fort Worth to Ellis and Johnson counties to Paris.\n\nWe will see \u201cmore of the same\u201d \u2014 freezing drizzle, with some sleet \u2014 until around 3 p.m., when the upper-level system passes through bringing the area a better shot of sleet.\n\nHave fun at that Oak Cliff Mardi Gras parade, which, last I looked, is still a go.\n\nOriginal item posted at 9:03 a.m.: It\u2019s March 2, a day after temperatures climbed into the 80s, and Dallas is yet again under Ice Force Level 1.\n\nTemperatures are already below freezing across North Texas: Dallas Love Field\u2019s at 31 with freezing drizzle; Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is reporting 32 with some rain; Fort Worth Meacham\u2019s at 29 with clouds. And this is as good as it\u2019s going to get today.\n\n\u201cIf you have something to do, do it this morning,\u201d says Dennis Cavanaugh, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s Fort Worth office. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get wetter and colder throughout the day. We\u2019re not expecting roads to become impassable; we\u2019re not under a Winter Weather Warning, only an advisory. But it only takes on accident to shut down a road. Travel will get more dangerous. Play it safe.\u201d\n\nRight now there\u2019s just a little precip out there associated with the passage of the cold front, which, Cavanaugh says, is stronger than models originally predicted, which is why we\u2019re now looking at Monday forecasts barely above freezing. That drizzle-mist is from the Gulf moisture that built up in North Texas during two springlike afternoons fueled by a warm southerly breeze. The front is wringing it out of the clouds.\n\nBut there\u2019s still the upper-level Pacific system well to our west, says Cavanaugh, spinning near the Arizona-New Mexico border.\n\n\u201cOnce that gets closer, we\u2019ll get some stronger lift, which is when we could see things like thunderstorms,\u201d says Cavanaugh \u2014 or, depending on the temperatures at the time of its arrival, thundersleet. That\u2019s due to arrive between noon and 3 p.m. How long it lingers depends on how fast the system moves once it gets here.\n\n\u201cThe ground is still warm, so most of the rain that hits the ground won\u2019t accumulate, but tops of cars and maybe bridges will begin to see ice. And if we\u2019re in the the upper 20s and get thunderstorms, it\u2019s not a big deal. But if its 23, that\u2019s really bad. A lot of that will stick. It depends on the temperatures.\u201d Says Cavanaugh it should be around 27 when the system passes through, but \u2026\n\n\u201cThe problem with the front is it\u2019s been colder than expected by the models so far,\u201d he says.\n\nSo the Texas Department of Transportation and the city of Dallas are leaving nothing to chance, the say: Collin and Denton counties\u2019 roadways will be pre-treated this morning. Meanwhile, says the city of Dallas, \u201cThe Department of Street Services will begin its sanding operations Ice Force Level 1 today at noon to address hazards on the streets due to the forecasted weather conditions. There will be approximately 35 sanding trucks and 100 personnel monitoring bridges, overpasses and inclines throughout the city.\u201d\n\nSome flights are also being impacted at DFW Airport and Dallas Love.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAzL3dpdGgtdGVtcGVyYXR1cmVzLW5vdy1iZWxvdy1mcmVlemluZy1hbmQtcmFpbi1vbi10aGUtd2F5LWRhbGxhcy1zZXQtdG8tZ28tdG8taWNlLWZvcmNlLWxldmVsLTEtYWdhaW4uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 9:48 p.m. by Julie Fancher:\u00a0Several major school districts, including Dallas ISD, Plano ISD, and McKinney ISD have canceled classes Monday due to the icy conditions.
