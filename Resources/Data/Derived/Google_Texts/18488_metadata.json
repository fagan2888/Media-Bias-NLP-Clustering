Marsha Blackburn had difficulty defending her latest objection to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 during a CNN appearance on Friday morning. When anchor Carol Costello asked the congresswoman to substantiate some of her claims against the federal law, Blackburn stammered something about \u201cpeeping toms\u201d and appeared to be at a loss for words.\n\nRepublicans have seized upon the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1994 as their latest cudgel against the ACA, claiming that the privacies granted to consumers under the Act prohibit the sharing of their medical information. Republicans allege that consumers are violating their own privacy by sharing their health information with multiple insurers as they compare insurance policy rates.\n\nThe Act only applies to the sharing of their information between medical providers, though, making current Republican efforts to obstruct the law groundless, as New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. pointed out in a hearing on Thursday.\n\nOn CNN Friday, Costello attempted to ask Blackburn what information is being illegally shared in the Obamacare exchanges, saying, \u201cSo what specifically were you referring to on the website that violates, that could possibly violate HIPAA?\u201d\n\n\u201cCarol, HIPAA requires you to\u2026,\u201d Blackburn began, then changed direction. \u201cIt\u2019s the way you structure your website and the way you transit the information, the transfer rights that are there, and when you look at privacy on these websites, what you have to do is keep all of the application information in one server\u2026and then you have to, whether it is a physical server or a cloud server\u2026\u201d\n\nCostello attempted to stem the flow of words, \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand what kind of information you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat kind of information are you talking about? What specifically does the website ask that I might be afraid might shared with whomever? Specifically. What information?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should be very concerned not only as you navigate the website but as you make a purchase, and then as your information is handled,\u201d Blackburn said, ducking the question. \u201cWhat we want to make certain is that an individual\u2019s medical information, their financial information is all going to be kept in a private manner. What we do not want is a peeping Tom who is going to look through their PII, their personal identifying information\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut HIPAA has to do with medical records,\u201d Costello said. \u201cThe only medical questions it asks is \u2018Do you smoke?'\u201d\n\nThink Progress reported that Washington and Lee University Law Professor Timothy S. Jost said that HIPAA doesn\u2019t apply at all to the Obamacare marketplace. \u201cHIPAA only applies to health care providers, clearinghouses (and this is a narrowly defined term) health plans, and their business associates,\u201d Jost wrote by email.\n\nWatch the video, embedded below via Think Progress:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Marsha-Blackburn-via-screencap-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Rep.
