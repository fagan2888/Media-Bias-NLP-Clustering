Tonsils removed? Broken bone set?\n\nHow much did it cost? And not your out-of-pocket costs\u2014what was the total pricetag for the procedure? If you managed to find out, the number could vary wildly.\n\n\u201cChargemaster\u201d prices\u2014essentially, a hospital\u2019s sticker price for a given procedure\u2014are often hard for patients to unearth, and there are often massive disparities within a single market, as the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found in a 2013 study. In New York City, for instance, a joint replacement ran anywhere from $15,000 to $155,000.\n\nHospital industry groups have pointed out that those list prices are essentially meaningless, and usually don\u2019t reflect the actual cost of procedures; they\u2019re often calculated to include hospital overhead costs and make up for the sometimes sizeable gap between patient costs and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Besides, their argument goes, most patients never pay \u201cretail\u201d price. Their insurers, who usually negotiate a lower price, pick up most of the tab.\n\nBut as the ramp-up to Obamacare has thrust the health care and insurance industries\u2014and their inefficiencies and shortcomings\u2014under the microscope, the issue of price transparency in medicine has come front and center, and an outpatient surgery center set to open this week in Charlottesville is making a radical move to change things locally.\n\nThe Monticello Community Surgery Center (MCSC), an independent outpatient center owned by 22 shareholding physicians, is embarking on a new model centered around price transparency. Need a rotator cuff repair? Check online for the cost. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll be billed.\n\n\u201cWhat the American public is looking for is an opportunity to know what they\u2019re getting and at what cost,\u201d said MCSC board president Dr. William Grant, an orthopedic surgeon with his own Charlottesville practice. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten into a terrible upward spiral of double-digit inflation of insurance prices. People are wondering what is it we\u2019re getting for those increasing premiums today that we weren\u2019t getting last year and the year before?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that these guys are in the vanguard of where medicine has to go,\u201d said Tom Massaro, UVA\u2019s Harrison Foundation Professor of Medicine and Law. A pediatrician, Massaro now lectures on health policy at the University\u2019s law school and the Darden School of Business.\n\nBut it remains to be seen, he said, whether such a radical move away from traditional funding structures will stick in a city like this one, where people have a lot of provider options and tend to be well-insured. \u201cHistorically, not many practice innovations have come from small markets like Charlottesville.\u201d\n\nCOST CONUNDRUM: What does a biopsy cost in Virginia? Depends on where you go. The cost of outpatient medical procedures can vary wildly, thanks to the different charge methods used by hospitals. The above data, from 2011, is from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, which collected the \u201csticker price\u201d for various categories of procedures at hospitals across the U.S. The dollar amounts are the average cost of all procedures billed as \u201cbiopsies or excisions\u201d for that year.\n\nThe MCSC isn\u2019t exactly a newcomer. It launched in August 2003 as the Martha Jefferson Outpatient Surgery Center, owned equally by Martha Jefferson and a group of shareholding surgeons with their own practices in Charlottesville and Albemarle. It was the doctors who managed the day-to-day business of the center.\n\nThat autonomy has been a big part of what has made the center successful over the last decade, said Dianne Simmons, the group\u2019s chief administrator. The layers of committees and rigid hierarchies of a big hospital aren\u2019t there, and the result has been a tight-knit workforce where everybody\u2019s responsible for everybody else, said Simmons.\n\nThat\u2019s made for a cohesive, democratic, and highly efficient outfit. \u201cWe can turn on a dime if we have to,\u201d she said. The staff sees the center\u2019s physician board members every day. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem, you talk to them.\u201d\n\nBut when the corporate nonprofit hospital system Sentara took over Martha Jefferson in 2011, it became clear that there wasn\u2019t a place in the new structure for their independently run operation, said Grant. After an unsuccessful year of negotiations, the physician shareholders bought out the hospital\u2019s stake, and the cord was cut.\n\nOn March 15, the center will see its first patients at a new location on Route 29 south of Polo Grounds Road. On a recent weekday afternoon, staff and doctors in hard hats gathered in what will be the 18,000 square-foot facility\u2019s lobby as dozens of constructions workers made a last minute push to paint walls and lay flooring. As they explained it, their surgery center isn\u2019t just getting a new name and a new home. It\u2019s getting a philosophical makeover as well.\n\nLike a growing number of health care experts, the center\u2019s surgeons believe that a big part of their industry\u2019s problem is that standard economic rules of competition have been warped and skewed by a payment system that isolates patients from the costs of care.\n\n\u201cYou could arguably say the health care market is really different than any other market in this country,\u201d said Dr. Dave Nielsen, another Charlottesville orthopedic surgeon who sits on the MCSC board. Payer insurance companies \u201creally aren\u2019t bound by the normal rules of economics.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s a problem, said Grant. When the list price for medical care is arbitrary and obscured, nobody can make an informed decision, and cost and quality become uncoupled.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with our current system is that nobody understands what the cost of services are that they\u2019re able to obtain through insurance, unfortunately in part by design,\u201d he said.\n\nAs government agencies, nonprofit groups, and companies looking for the best deal for their employee plans dug into the data, \u201cthey started finding that it\u2019s not always the highest cost providers that provide the best care,\u201d said Grant. \u201cA lot of the time, it\u2019s actually an inverse relationship.\u201d\n\nGrant, Nielsen, and their colleagues maintain there\u2019s a very simple fix: advertise prices. MCSC plans to post the cost for its core procedures on its website. Barring major complications\u2014which are rare for outpatient surgical procedures like the ones they offer, Grant pointed out\u2014what you see there is what you\u2019ll pay.\n\nIt\u2019s a big shift. Doctors aren\u2019t used to talking frankly in dollars and cents. But Grant said the model appeals to an increasingly price-sensitive population\u2014and it complements a trend toward higher-deductible insurance plans and health savings accounts, which give patients more responsibility for their up-front costs. Those \u201cvalue shoppers\u201d are going up in number, he said, and they look at care in a whole new way.\n\nSomebody with great insurance might demand an MRI for a bum knee even if he\u2019s told by his doctor a few weeks of rest and observation would be a better and cheaper course of action, simply because he knows his insurance will cover it, said Grant. Somebody shouldering more of the cost or spending an allotted amount on procedures will consider options more carefully.\n\n\u201cIn a way they\u2019re becoming their own insurance entity, and they have to use responsible planning as to how they want to spend those dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nCan a big shift in a small market make a difference on a broad scale?\n\n\u201cToday, in the big medicine world, the innovation has come from the San Franciscos, the New Yorks, the Seattles,\u201d said Massaro, and a price transparency model would likely do better in a place where there are more people with fewer resources seeking care, he said.\n\nBut Massaro said small disruptions in the status quo can and ultimately will have an impact. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take little pilot programs or seed elements like these guys to break established norms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe MCSC docs are confident they can win people over to their model of care. Nielsen said their hope is that it will appeal to the self-insured in Charlottesville or far beyond. It will help that their prices will be highly competitive. Grant said they expect to offer procedures for as low as a third of what other local care providers ultimately charge.\n\n\u201cIt is a cultural shift in how we approach medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s one I think we have to have.\u201d\n\nDr. William Grant is a Charlottesville orthopedic surgeon and chair of the Monticello Community Surgery Center\u2019s board.
