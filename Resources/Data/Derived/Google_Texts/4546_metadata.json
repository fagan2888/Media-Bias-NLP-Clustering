In the three years since Hanoi-based .GEARS released Flappy Bird, Vietnam emerged from relative obscurity to become the Southeast Asian production hub of South Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.\n\nMeanwhile, global tech firms that have long had factories in Vietnam - such as LG Electronics Inc, Panasonic Corp, and Toshiba Corp - have also been expanding into research and development.\n\nPart of Vietnam's appeal is a cheaper workforce than in China, as well as membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade bloc and free trade deals with the European Union, plus incentives aimed at luring investment away from neighbors.\n\nOf particular interest to venture capitalists, however, is Vietnam's tech-savvy population with a median age of just 30.\n\n\"Vietnam has the highest-performing computer science students I've ever encountered,\" said Neil Fraser, a software engineer at Alphabet Inc's Google, who visited local schools.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks Vietnamese 15-year-olds above peers in the U.S., Australia and Britain in science and maths.\n\n\"The exercises I watched them solve ... would be considered challenging problems for a Google hiring interview,\" Fraser said.\n\nE-COMMERCE\n\nData covering Vietnamese startups is scarce, but Singapore-based startup community Tech in Asia - itself a startup with investors including Japan's SoftBank Group Corp - reckons there are about 1,500 in operation. That number, relative to population, represents a higher concentration than the 2,100 in Indonesia, 2,300 in China and 7,500 in India.\n\nStartups in Vietnam, like Indonesia, thrive with little government support beyond legal advice and $10,000 cash under a scheme dubbed Vietnam Silicon Valley. In contrast, China announced a $6.5 billion fund mainly for tech and green energy startups last year, while India pledged $1.5 billion in January.\n\n\"I plan to grow this company for five years then sell it,\" said Beeketing's Quan. \"Then I may become an angel investor myself.\"\n\nMost of Vietnam's startups are in e-commerce, a sector where sales grew around 35 percent last year to $4 billion, and whose 2.7 percent contribution to overall retail sales indicates ample room for growth.\n\nSupporting e-commerce are tech-related logistics startups such as Giaohangnhanh which helped reduce overall logistics costs in Vietnam to a fifth of gross domestic product last year from a fourth just one year earlier.\n\nOther startups include the operator of food-finder app Lozi that received a combined seven-figure investment from DesignOne Japan Inc and Singapore's Golden Gate Ventures.\n\nTran Minh Son, one of four Lozi founders, quit university in Pennsylvania to concentrate on the app.\n\n\"It was like cutting my legs off so I've no way back,\" he said. \"My parents complained quite a lot. They said, 'You're not my son - move out'.\"\n\nLozi, launched in 2012, now boasts 600,000 registered users and 4 million unique visits each month.\n\n(Reporting by Mai Nguyen; Editing by Martin Petty and Christopher Cushing)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's tech startups are emerging as a force to be reckoned with", "title": "Vietnam's young tech talent pulls foreign funds to booming startup scene", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/12/Vietnams-young-tech-talent-pulls-foreign-funds-booming-startup-scene", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/vietnam-tech-startup_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/12/Vietnams-young-tech-talent-pulls-foreign-funds-booming-startup-scene", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/vietnam-tech-startup_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's tech startups are emerging as a force to be reckoned with", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's tech startups are emerging as a force to be reckoned with as foreign private equity funds bet the country's talented young brains will yield more successes like the international hit game Flappy Bird.\nThe startup boom is the latest chapter of Vietnam's growing presence in the global tech industry.\nIn contrast, China announced a $6.5 billion fund mainly for tech and green energy startups last year, while India pledged $1.5 billion in January.\nE-COMMERCEData covering Vietnamese startups is scarce, but Singapore-based startup community Tech in Asia - itself a startup with investors including Japan's SoftBank Group Corp - reckons there are about 1,500 in operation.\nStartups in Vietnam, like Indonesia, thrive with little government support beyond legal advice and $10,000 cash under a scheme dubbed Vietnam Silicon Valley."}
