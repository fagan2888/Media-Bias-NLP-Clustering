Today\u2019s politics \u201cdoesn\u2019t quicken my pulse.\u201d It \u201cdoesn\u2019t shock me into a state of alert indignation.\u201d The \u201cthrill is gone.\u201d\n\nWhen George Packer gets bored, I get worried. It means he\u2019s in the mood for war.\n\nPacker claims he lost his passion for politics sometime between Obama\u2019s first and second term. That\u2019s the moment he confronted \u201cthe stuckness of American politics,\u201d the moment when he realized that not only were \u201cthe same things\u201d happening but that they would \u201ckeep happening.\u201d Money would keep pouring in, filibusterers would keep filibustering, extremists would keep getting more extreme. Now he knows \u201cwe are paralyzed.\u201d There are no more surprises.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Packer\u2019s found himself yawning his way through a campaign. During the 2000 election, he complained that Al Gore was \u201cmore a technician than a leader,\u201d whose \u201ccampaign slogan might as well have been, \u2018First, do no harm.\u2019\u201d It wasn\u2019t just Gore who had lackluster ambitions; there wasn\u2019t \u201cany burning issue galvanizing the electorate\u201d either. Not just in 2000, but pretty much throughout the 1990s. As Packer would write a year later in the New York Times Magazine:\n\nA strange thing happened after the cold war ended: patriotism all but disappeared from American politics. The right and left essentially offered a choice between hedonisms: tax cuts or spending. No one asked for sacrifice; no one spoke to common purpose.\n\nA burning issue, a galvanized electorate, common purpose, sacrifice: that\u2019s what Packer looks for in politics.\n\nAnd on 9/11, he got it.\n\nThat day a policeman tried to help an investment banker who had fled the twin towers and seemed to be in shock. \u201cI\u2019m not in shock,\u201d the banker replied. \u201cI like this state. I\u2019ve never been more cognizant in my life.\u201d\n\nPacker felt the same way. All around him, he saw \u201calertness, grief, resolve, even love.\u201d And he saw that it was good: \u201cI\u2019ve lived through this state, and I like it.\u201d Though he claimed he didn\u2019t \u201cdesire war,\u201d Packer felt something that day and in the days following that \u201cthe bland comforts of peace\u201d could never provide. He felt drama, occasion, moment. He felt\u2026 feeling. And feared the loss of feeling: \u201cWhat I dread now is a return to the normality we\u2019re all supposed to seek: instead of public memorials, private consumption; instead of lines to give blood, restaurant lines.\u201d\n\nWell, we all know how that turned out: a decade and a half of multiple and ongoing wars and interventions, with a possible 1.3 million lives lost. And Packer\u2019s still bored. But tryin\u2019 to get the feeling again.\n\nI mourn my lack of political passion as I would if I were to lose interest in reading fiction, or to stop caring about someone who\u2019d been important to me for most of my life. And I count on getting back the feeling \u2014 the intense mix of love, hatred, anxiety, astonishment, and gratification \u2014 because life, public life, is impoverished without it.\n\nGiven his allergic reaction to all things humdrum and conventional, you might think that Packer would welcome the recent explosion of activism around prisons and police brutality, the national security state, Israel/Palestine and Occupy Wall Street. But Packer\u2019s loathing of the left is stronger than his anxiousness about the eternal recurrence of American politics. So he\u2019s left with a list of recommendations for making politics \u201cmore fun\u201d that includes Hillary Clinton giving \u201cthe boldest speech of her career\u201d and a pact between two candidates, one from each party, that if either wins her party\u2019s nomination, she\u2019ll select the other as her running mate. In other words, the very kind of politics that gives Packer a hankering for sacrifice, heroism, bloodlines and war.\n\nPacker belongs to a special tribe of ideologically ambidextrous scribblers \u2014 call them political romantics \u2014 who are always on the lookout for a certain kind of experience in politics. They don\u2019t want power, they don\u2019t seek justice, they\u2019re not interested in interests. They want a feeling. A feeling of exaltation and elation, unmoored from any specific idea or principle save that of sacrifice, of giving oneself over to the nation and its cause.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Call it Chris Matthews-itis.
