So much of it was a futile, misguided attempt to refute the true ObamaCare guru, Nobel laureate Paul Krugmam.\n\nKrugman got so much right in just these two paragraphs:\n\nYet even as Republican politicians seem ready to go on the offensive, there\u2019s a palpable sense of anxiety, even despair, among conservative pundits and analysts. Better-informed people on the right seem, finally, to be facing up to a horrible truth: Health care reform, President Obama\u2019s signature policy achievement, is probably going to work. And the good news about Obamacare is, I\u2019d argue, what\u2019s driving the Republican Party\u2019s intensified extremism. Successful health reform wouldn\u2019t just be a victory for a president conservatives loathe, it would be an object demonstration of the falseness of right-wing ideology. So Republicans are being driven into a last, desperate effort to head this thing off at the pass.\n\nNow that ObamaCare is, indeed, working, I admit to my anxiety and despair. My conservative ideology has been refuted. As I now see the light, I will no longer be working to head ObamaCare \u201coff at the pass.\u201d\n\nAlthough this post wasn\u2019t about ObamaCare, Krugman still nails it:\n\n\u2026bear in mind that both Koch brothers are numbered among the 10 wealthiest Americans, and so are four Walmart heirs. Great wealth buys great political influence \u2014 and not just through campaign contributions.Many conservatives live inside an intellectual bubble of think tanks and captive media that is ultimately financed by a handful of megadonors. Not surprisingly, those inside the bubble tend to assume, instinctively, that what is good for oligarchs is good for America.\n\nAlas, I am a shill for those oligarchs. But no more! I will today be sending the Koch brothers my letter of resignation. I hope Paul will be pleased.\n\nFinally, Krugman properly quotes Charles Gaba about the 7 million enrollees: \u201cFor the moment, however, none of [the objections] matters. This is an outstanding number any way you slice it.\u201d\n\nSo, I will celebrate today, not only because the ObamaCare exchanges have reached 7 million enrollees, but because I am now officially a disciple of Krugman\n\nAnd before you grind your teeth too hard, be sure to look at the calendar.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/Kruggy3.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1396366672371", "description": "As the Obamacare exchanges have reached 7 million enrollees, it&#8217;s time for me to confess...", "title": "On ObamaCare I Admit It: Paul Krugman Was Right, I Was\u00a0Wrong - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1df\"", "article_summary": "Finally, Krugman properly quotes Charles Gaba about the 7 million enrollees: \u201cFor the moment, however, none of [the objections] matters.\nAs the Obamacare exchanges have reached 7 million enrollees, it\u2019s time for me to confess: so much of what I\u2019ve written about ObamaCare is wrong.\nSo much of it was a futile, misguided attempt to refute the true ObamaCare guru, Nobel laureate Paul Krugmam.\nNow that ObamaCare is, indeed, working, I admit to my anxiety and despair.\nAnd the good news about Obamacare is, I\u2019d argue, what\u2019s driving the Republican Party\u2019s intensified extremism."}
