Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963, Richard Hofstadter was in London, delivering a lecture that a year later would appear in Harper\u2019s as \u201cThe Paranoid Style in American Politics.\u201d\n\nAt 47 years of age, Hofstadter was an American brand. He held an endowed chair at Columbia University\u2014not to mention two Pulitzers. He was considered to be one of the finest historians and public intellectuals of his time.\n\nRight-wing putschists led by Barry Goldwater (and the evidently immortal Phyllis Schlafly) had seized control of the Republican Party, muscling aside Nelson Rockefeller and the moderate wing he represented. Hofstadter was alarmed. \u201cThe Paranoid Style\u201d was his red flag.\n\nIn the introduction to a 2007 Vintage Books collection of Hofstadter\u2019s political writing, Princeton historian Sean Wilentz describes the 1964 essay as \u201ca study of political cranks and zealots\u201d in which the author described \u201ca chronic, rancid syndrome in our political life.\u201d\n\nIndigenous and deeply rooted in American history, the paranoid politics Hofstadter described began with a panic among Federalists, echoed in New England\u2019s pulpits in 1789, when preachers warned of the Bavarian Illuminati plots to undermine the new republic.\n\nIn the 1820s and 1830s the nation was seized with a fear of Masons, who were perceived to be a threat to republican government because Masonry was a secret society with its own system of loyalty and its own jurisdictions. Public hysteria about Masonic plots was followed by an anti-Catholic movement focused on the Society of Jesus, better known as Jesuits. \u201cAnti-Catholicism has always been the pornography of the Puritans,\u201d Hofstadter wrote.\n\nAll of this is understandable in a young nation defining itself and defending itself from external and internal threats. It\u2019s when Hofstadter takes what he describes as the long jump to the contemporary right wing that the paranoid style of politics he describes speaks to our current political moment.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much more of a leap to conclude that the same rancid syndrome, which Hofstadter chronicled as occurring in episodic waves in American political life, is upon us today, and the political cranks and zealots are Republican voters animated by Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio.\n\nIn the sixties, the country hadn\u2019t entirely moved beyond McCarthyism, and the fear that the highest levels of the federal government had been infiltrated by communists who were selling out U.S. national interests. That particular obsession is largely a relic of the past, perhaps with the exception of religious loons such as Pat Robertson, and Rev. Rafael Cruz (father of Ted), who has referred to Barack Obama as a socialist aligned with Cuba\u2019s Castro brothers.\n\nRead \u201cThe Paranoid Style\u201d\u2014eliding the references to the communist menace\u2014and you\u2019ll discover an insightful analysis of the overheated rhetoric and reckless posturing that is the 2016 Republican presidential primary.\n\nHofstadter quoted Harvard professor Daniel Bell\u2019s description of \u201cthe modern right wing\u201d of the 1960s. If Bell\u2019s description weren\u2019t so articulate, it could be passed off as briefing notes for Sarah Palin\u2019s speechwriter.\n\nAmerica has been largely taken away from them and their kind; though they are determined to try and repossess it and to prevent the final destructive act of subversion. The old American virtues have already been eaten away by cosmopolitans and intellectuals; capitalism has been gradually undermined . . . the old national security and independence have been destroyed by treasonous plots, having as their agents not merely outsiders and foreigners but major statesmen at the very centers of American power.\n\nThe \u201cmodern right wing\u201d of 2016? You can find it at a Trump rally in a Birmingham stadium or a Cruz caucus in Iowa\u2014even with Palin on the hustings in New Hampshire\u2014promising to take back our country from the intellectual elites who have dispossessed \u201creal Americans.\u201d\n\nLike today\u2019s Republican presidential candidates, Hofstadter\u2019s paranoids opposed the income tax and worked to repeal it. They were anti-intellectual and anti-cosmopolitan. They had a deep-seated aversion to \u201cthe democracies of Western Europe.\u201d They harbored a \u201cnativist desire to develop in North America a homogeneous civilization.\u201d They envisioned the enemy eroding our values and undermining our national security: \u201cA perfect model of malice, a kind of amoral superman, sinister, ubiquitous, powerful, cruel, sensual, luxury loving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The overheated rhetoric and reckless posturing from the right is a return of a rancid thread of American politics", "title": "Cranks, zealots, extremists: How the paranoid style of Trump, Cruz and Palin took over the GOP and infected America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The overheated rhetoric and reckless posturing from the right is a return of a rancid thread of American politics", "title": "Cranks, zealots, extremists: How the paranoid style of Trump, Cruz and Palin took over the GOP and infected America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/19/cranks_zealots_extremists_how_the_paranoid_style_of_trump_cruz_and_palin_took_over_the_gop_and_infected_america/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/palin_trump_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The overheated rhetoric and reckless posturing from the right is a return of a rancid thread of American politics", "title": "Cranks, zealots, extremists: How the paranoid style of Trump, Cruz and Palin took over the GOP and infected America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/palin_trump_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lou Dubose", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Paranoid style, Richard Hofstadter, Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Paranoid Style\u201d was his red flag.\nRafael Cruz (father of Ted), who has referred to Barack Obama as a socialist aligned with Cuba\u2019s Castro brothers.\nIt\u2019s when Hofstadter takes what he describes as the long jump to the contemporary right wing that the paranoid style of politics he describes speaks to our current political moment.\nHe was considered to be one of the finest historians and public intellectuals of his time.\nPublic hysteria about Masonic plots was followed by an anti-Catholic movement focused on the Society of Jesus, better known as Jesuits."}
