The rebel posturing of Gustave Courbet, Camille Pissarro\u2019s all-or-nothing nerve, the swagger of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as he got down and dirty on the streets of Montmartre, it all attracts our contemporary spirit.\n\nMuseums across the U.S. built their major shows around Impressionism in 2013. The Met in New York, the Philly and the Art Institute of Chicago all made the most of their Monets this summer. St. Louis and Kansas City followed, teaming for a significant exploration of the lasting impact of Renoir, Manet and their peers.\n\nToday, the Denver Art Museum jumps in with \u201cPassport to Paris,\u201d which out-blockbusters those blockbusters by combining three attractive exhibits under one slanty, titanium roof: the traveling \u201cCourt to Cafe,\u201d the locally composed \u201cNature as Muse,\u201d and an intimate assemblage of small works on paper titled \u201cDrawing Room.\u201d\n\nAll the French superheroes, plus their trusty sidekicks, make appearances in each.\n\nThe Denver exhibits play well together, and they take the national obsession with painters from a certain time and place in new directions, adding both historical context and a Western twist. That comes mostly from the extensive presence of work owned by Denver collector Frederic C. Hamilton. His holdings, rarely seen in public, make up the bulk of the most interesting piece, \u201cNature as Muse,\u201d a collection of 36 landscape paintings.\n\nAn important collection of French paintings in Colorado? Oui, mesdames et messieurs, and it is beautiful from start to finish.\n\nThe main attraction in Denver is the much larger \u201cCourt to Cafe,\u201d featuring 50 paintings, all owned and on tour from the Wadsworth Atheneum, one of New England\u2019s sturdiest, old art castles, located in Hartford, Conn. The show traces French painting from its formal Nicolas Poussin and Fran\u00e7ois Boucher days to its more radical era defined by Paul C\u00e9zanne, and (French-ish) Vincent van Gogh.\n\nThis is an easy show to look at and like because it doesn\u2019t do anything beyond knock your socks off. It\u2019s one of these (Poussin\u2019s dark \u201cCrucifixion\u201d from 1646) to one of those (Charles-Antoine Coypel\u2019s 1735 dramatic \u201cThe Fainting of Armida\u201d) to another one of those (Claude-Joseph Vernet\u2019s sweeping \u201cThe Storm,\u201d from 1787).\n\nThe journey eventually makes its way through Henri-Paul Motte and Eugene Boudin, with crowd-pleasing samplings of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Caillebotte and Sisley. There\u2019s a narrative about the breakthrough of Impressionism, though it feels obvious, and the paintings generally speak for themselves.\n\nInterestingly, \u201cNature as Muse,\u201d put together by DAM director Christoph Heinrich, is a more captivating version of the same story with the same characters moving the action forward. Heinrich supplemented Hamilton\u2019s pieces with another batch from DAM\u2019s permanent collection and the chronology is compact and logical.\n\nThis is an old tale, of course. Everyone knows how these painters broke from tradition, rejecting classical subject matter and heavy-handed symbolism, getting out of the studio and presenting nature with all of its gritty imperfections, letting their brush strokes show and their emotions guide their hand.\n\nIt has the familiarity of a Shakespeare play or a Verdi opera and we attend its frequent telling in much the same way, looking for a trueness or a twist that makes this version stand out.\n\nFocus on landscapes\n\n\u201cNature as Muse\u201d does have a unique perspective. By narrowing its subject matter to landscapes, comparisons are easy to track and compare. We watch with a focused eye as those famous lines blur and the paint gets thick and chunky, and a new idea of handsomeness is born.\n\n\u201cPassport to Paris\u201d succeeds in another significant way. Traveling shows, like \u201cCourt to Cafe\u201d are a challenge for museums because they can look like cash grabs. Booking Monet into your venue these days isn\u2019t so different from bringing in Madonna or Britney Spears. You jack up the price and let the people in, just like they do at the lowly arena down the street.\n\nBut DAM has done much to customize the show for its own space and audience and it reminds us that this is high art. The installation is an attraction of its own, complete with hand-painted stencils, period wallpapers and antique furnishings from the collection scattered about. The museum even attached molding along its walls, giving its ultra-modern galleries a few old-school European touches. There is a contemporary sensibility to the setting, overseen by Ben Griswold of Spatial Poetics, that keeps it from being kitsch.\n\nThe addition of \u201cNature As Muse\u201d is credible and ultra-local. No small matter that it hangs in the wing of the museum named, and partly paid for, by one Frederic C. Hamilton.\n\n\u201cDrawing Room\u201d has a regional twist as well. The 39 works on paper come from the collection of Esmond Bradley Martin, who lives elsewhere but houses his holdings at DAM. It\u2019s a small show, well-executed and full of surprises, like the charming, 1859 \u201cCaricature of Grandfather Lebas\u201d by Monet that plays up a different side of the man known for his serious takes on water lilies.\n\nThat a Denver museum should go to such extremes makes sense. The quality of this work, its history and humanity, appeals to viewers in every city. But its subject matter has a particular resonance here.\n\nPlein-air painters\n\nThese painters honed their craft by moving it outdoors, working en plein air, instead of the studios their predecessors confined themselves to. We like to think we do our own best work in the hills and valleys that surround us.\n\nMore than that, these painters were the first to accept nature on its own terms, and revere it above all. They eschewed depictions of Greek gods and their own royals in favor of rocks and creeks and tree stumps. They didn\u2019t frame the countryside through human eyes, they simply explored it, the less tamed, the better.\n\nMaybe it is a reach, but that\u2019s what we do here, albeit with the help of four-wheel-drive vehicles and GPS trackers. More than anyone else on this continent, we consider ourselves subjects of nature, not its masters. These Impressionists, they invented that.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi\n\n\u201cPASSPORT TO PARIS\u201d\n\nThe Denver Art Museum presents three exhibits of pieces by French artists who worked primarily in the 19th century.
