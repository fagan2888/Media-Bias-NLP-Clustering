The regents unanimously disapproved this proposal on Tuesday.\n\nAbout this article This article was produced by The Round Up/Oncore Magazine, New Mexico State University\u2019s student-run news organization. It\u2019s published here as part of a partnership between The Round Up/Oncore Magazine and NMPolitics.net.\n\n\u201cThere is no way around trying to eliminate $10.7 million,\u201d NMSU Provost Dan Howard said at an Employee Benefit Council meeting on Thursday. \u201cAny cut we take at this point is going to hurt. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\nThe most contentious proposed cut seems to be the Employee Health Services center (EHS). EHS is housed within the Student Health Center and staffed by the same personnel. It offers the same free or low-cost medical services to NMSU employees.\n\nHoward said this cut is being considered because EHS services are not \u201ccentral\u201d to NMSU\u2019s instruction and guidance mission \u2014 which is to teach, research and serve.\n\nEHS costs NMSU about $828,000 a year, at about $165 per employee visit, Howard said.\n\nThe services provided by EHS can be made up by employees\u2019 health-care plans, Howard said.\n\nState plan or self-funded?\n\nBut employee health-care plans may also change in order to save money. Right now NMSU employees have medical, dental, and vision coverage under the State of New Mexico\u2019s health-care plan, through which the university pays high yearly premium costs in order for employees to have low copays whenever they visit the doctor. Advertisement\n\nThe alternative to the state\u2019s plan is to go the \u201cself-funded\u201d route, where individual employees design health-care plans that are best for them and their dependents. Through this route, employees can still choose preferred provider organizations (PPO) plans, though at higher individual, rather than collective, costs.\n\nA pro to this plan would be that fixed costs would be reduced \u2014 employees could decide if they want high yearly premiums or high copays.\n\nBut a con to this plan is that the number of employees who get sick each year would likely fluctuate, which would make NMSU\u2019s costs fluctuate as well. Another con that became apparent during the Thursday meeting was that, if NMSU decides to go with self-funded plans, EHS will also be eliminated.\n\nA pro to maintaining the state\u2019s plan at NMSU is that, if EHS were eliminated, NMSU is currently in talks with the State Risk Management agency about establishing a free clinic within Las Cruces, similar to the Stay Well Health Center in Santa Fe, which state-plan-covered employees can visit at no- or low-copay costs and receive no- or low-cost prescriptions.\n\nAnother con is that any money that could be saved by NMSU going the self-funded route, which has the potential to be cheaper than the state\u2019s health plan but puts the university at full liability for any claims filed, might not be saved if the university has a high number of employees who put in claims. If this is the case, it may make more fiscal sense to remain on the state\u2019s health plan, thereby making the state\u2019s health-care provider fully liable for all claims.\n\nNMSU switched from self-funded plans to the state\u2019s plan back in September 2006 after reaching an agreement with the state for reduced costs if EHS saw patients from nearby counties, mostly dealing with workman\u2019s comp issues.\n\nNMSU continued to fund EHS with what\u2019s called I&G funding \u2014 Student Health Services, of course, paid for by students\u2019 tuition and fees.\n\n\u201cWhat should have happened is that (we) should have asked the state to come in and fund (EHS) themselves,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWhich is what we\u2019re now doing.\u201d\n\nDoing so now, Howard said, will save both the state and NMSU money.\n\nHoward said part of the negotiations currently ongoing about maintaining the state\u2019s health-care plan is for the state to utilize the EHS space at the Campus Health Center.\n\n\u201cWe should have asked (the state) to pick (EHS) up a long time ago,\u201d he said.\n\nNot essential to university\u2019s mission?\n\nThe Campus Health Center\u2019s psychiatric nurse practitioner, Vicki Alvarez, said she \u201cfervently\u201d disagrees with Howard\u2019s statement that EHS services are not \u201ccentral\u201d to the I&G mission.\n\n\u201cI do see some faculty and staff,\u201d she said. \u201cMy feeling is that this service that we provide to employees is key and central to our mission. I see employees who are very distraught, there is no way that they are going to be able to provide education to any students in a very effective way.\u201d\n\nAlvarez went on to say that especially the mental health services the Campus Health Center provides are essential, considering difficulty throughout Las Cruces in obtaining help. She says most psychologists/psychiatrists \u2014 who are \u201cbailing out of Las Cruces\u201d \u2014 have three-to-six-month waiting lists even for individuals with health-care plans.\n\n\u201c(EHS) is crucial to what we do here,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t keep our employees healthy in a mental way, then we\u2019re not going to have students who want to come here and be educated.\u201d\n\nJudi Voelz, the Health Center\u2019s medical director, called EHS \u201can investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know if you try to meet with your (health plan\u2019s) doctor for your colds and your coughs and your flus, you\u2019re getting an appointment at the end of the week,\u201d she said. \u201cSo (NMSU) employees are going to be sitting at home for four or five days waiting to see their doctor, and that\u2019s lost time here.\u201d\n\nEHS can see employees immediately, such as those who were stung by bees near Garcia Annex in early March.\n\nIn addition to primary care services, Voelz said, EHS also offers such services as immunizations, physicals for campus police officers and firefighters, and \u2014 perhaps its largest contribution \u2014 workman\u2019s compensation services, all at \u201cseverely reduced cost.\u201d\n\nVoelz also disagreed with what NMSU President Garrey Carruthers wrote in a memo advising the NMSU system of the proposed elimination of EHS \u2014 that \u201cthe Student Health Center services would not change.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of our providers see students and employees,\u201d Voelz said. \u201cThe proposed elimination of Employee Health Services would take out a doctor and a nurse practitioner, who are also involved in seeing students. So whatever we do to Employee Health Services will directly impact our mission of serving the students.\u201d\n\nThe Campus Health Center sees about 29,000 students a year, according to Executive Director Lori McKee.\n\nOther cuts and cost-saving measures\n\nIn addition to considering the elimination of EHS, Carruthers has also placed \u201ca hold on staff and faculty actions with unrestricted funding.\u201d\n\nSuch actions include:\n\nStaff position reclassification or faculty position attribute changes\n\nStaff and faculty new position requests\n\nStaff in-range adjustments\n\nDivision/unit/department reorganizations\n\n\u201cFaculty position attribute changes do not include changes associated with the tenure and promotion process,\u201d Carruthers wrote in a memo. \u201cIt is limited to actions such as changing a vacant position rank from a lower rank to a higher rank.\u201d\n\nOther measures currently under consideration include reducing administrative salaries above $100,000:\n\nSalaries $100,000 to $149,999 would receive 1-percent cuts.\n\nSalaries $150,000 to $199,999 would receive 2-percent cuts.\n\nSalaries above $200,000 would receive 3-percent cuts.\n\n\u201cBecause we have spent the past few years trying to bring our faculty up to market in regard to their salaries, and we would like to avoid undoing this progress, these salary reductions will not include faculty members,\u201d Carruthers wrote in the memo. \u201cAlso, employees who have contracts will be excluded since this would require renegotiating those contracts. However, even though I am a contract employee, I have opted to be included in the reduction because I want to be part of a team solution.\u201d\n\nCarruthers\u2019 contract dictates a yearly salary of $385,000. With a three-percent decrease, he would make about $373,450.\n\nOther proposed measures include eliminating retirement benefits for employees hired after July 1, 2016. Sharon Jones, Carruthers\u2019 chief of staff, said there would be no immediate realization of savings by eliminating this benefit, as employees have to work 10 or more years in order to access it, but when you include accrual \u2014 which is the actual dollar amount NMSU would have to pay to retirees \u2014 \u201cit is definitely a savings for the university.\u201d\n\nSick-leave buyout is also facing elimination, though details are still being discussed.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s meeting, several audience members expressed concern that the elimination of retirement benefits, sick-leave buyout, and EHS would hurt NMSU\u2019s ability to recruit quality employees, as people who come to work at NMSU often see the benefits packages as balancing out the less-than-national-average salaries.\n\nAnd lessening NMSU\u2019s staff and faculty recruitment abilities would harm NMSU\u2019s I&G mission, these audience members said.\n\nJones said she expects these proposals to be either approved or denied by the start of the new fiscal year, July 1.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single cut \u2014 and there\u2019ll be more than this coming \u2014 that is not going to be hard and that is not going to impact people at NMSU,\u201d Howard said.\n\nHoward and Carruthers encourage NMSU employees to submit comments to their offices, at president@nmsu.edu and provost@nmsu.edu.\n\nHuntsman is The Round Up\u2019s managing editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Mexico State University has to eliminate more than $10 million from its budget.", "original-source": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/2016/04/proposed-cuts-to-employee-benefits-stir-controversy-at-nmsu/", "og": {"site_name": "NMPolitics.net", "description": "New Mexico State University has to eliminate more than $10 million from its budget.", "title": "Proposed cuts to employee benefits stir controversy at NMSU", "url": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/2016/04/proposed-cuts-to-employee-benefits-stir-controversy-at-nmsu/", "image": {"width": 1170, "identifier": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CampusHealthCenter-1170x726.jpg", "height": 726}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nmpoliticsnet", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/2016/04/proposed-cuts-to-employee-benefits-stir-controversy-at-nmsu/", "fb": {"app_id": 111489745565143}, "article": {"section": "News and Analysis", "tag": "NMSU", "published_time": "2016-04-08T17:14:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-10T18:56:13+00:00", "author": "http://nmpolitics.net/index/author/heath-haussamen/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News and Analysis, Budget, NMSU"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201dThe most contentious proposed cut seems to be the Employee Health Services center (EHS).\n\u201cThe proposed elimination of Employee Health Services would take out a doctor and a nurse practitioner, who are also involved in seeing students.\nHoward and Carruthers encourage NMSU employees to submit comments to their offices, at president@nmsu.edu and provost@nmsu.edu.\nBut employee health-care plans may also change in order to save money.\nShe says most psychologists/psychiatrists \u2014 who are \u201cbailing out of Las Cruces\u201d \u2014 have three-to-six-month waiting lists even for individuals with health-care plans."}
