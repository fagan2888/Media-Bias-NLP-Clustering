February 14th is not only a day to celebrate love, it's also a day designated to raise awareness about the life-saving gift of organ donation.

More than 123,000 people in the United States are on the waiting list for a lifesaving organ transplant.

Charlaine Andrews was one of those people when her kidneys failed. She says her friend of 16 years, Crystal Riese, decided to giver her a kidney.

"She came over when I was doing dialysis exchange. Apparently I looked like death," Andrews said.

Riese said the visit scared her and she went home and cried. She called her friend to tell her she would donate her kidney.

"We're closer and I tell her she's my angel all the time and she tells me she's not. She just did what anybody would do, but not anyone [sic] would do that," Andrews said.

Another life saved is Sherry Turner's husband Dianne. Dianne's liver failed and his organs started shutting down.

He only had a few days left to live before he received a liver from a 17-year-old who died in a car crash.

"A second chance at life... and it... just makes him re-evaluate life... when you come so close to losing your life... and so he's just very happy," Turner said.

One organ donor can save up to eight lives.

Each year National Organ Donor Day is on February 14th.
