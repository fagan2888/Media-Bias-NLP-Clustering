An 86-year-old Florida widow has chosen to spend the rest of her golden years aboard a opulent cruise ship — and she’s willing to pay upwards of $164,000 a year to do it.

Lee Wachtstetter has been living year-round on a luxury vessel for almost seven years, longer than most of its nearly 700-person crew, according to Asbury Park Press.

The grandmother said she stopped counting cruises after the first 100, and she credits her daughter for encouraging her to sell her Fort Lauderdale 10-acre home to set sail.

“My husband introduced me to cruising,” she told Asbury Park Press. “Mason was a banker and real estate appraiser and taught me to love cruising. During our 50-year marriage we did 89 cruises. I’ve done nearly a hundred more and 15 world cruises.”

Ms. Wachtstetter says she has been to almost every country that has a port, but what she misses most is her family. However, she sees them whenever her cruise ship docks in Miami — which was at least five times last year.

“The day before my husband died of cancer in 1997, he told me, ‘Don’t stop cruising.’ So here I am today living a stress-free, fairy-tale life.”
