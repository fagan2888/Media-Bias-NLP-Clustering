LAS VEGAS (AP) - Prison officials say an inmate serving life at High Desert State Prison northwest of Las Vegas has died after being stabbed by fellow prisoners.

The Nevada Department of Corrections says that Ralph Goodman was pronounced dead Saturday afternoon.

According to officials, a correctional officer was escorting Goodman from the yard to his housing unit when two inmates allegedly charged at him.

Both suspects allegedly knocked Goodman to the ground and stabbed him.

Officials identified the suspect inmates as Jeremy Nuckles and Justin Muncy.

They say both were part of a group being supervised in the yard by two correctional officers.

Director James Dzurenda says an investigation is under way.

Goodman had been imprisoned since May 2004 and was serving two life sentences for first-degree murder and other related charges.
