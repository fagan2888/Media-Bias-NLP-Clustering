Tenet said Bush did not decide to step down because of disagreements with the company.\n\nTenet Healthcare has promoted and supported the Affordable Care Act, but Bush has opposed it since its beginnings, CBS News reported.\n\nBush's ties to different businesses could become a liability for him later on as he considers running for president in 2016.\n\nLast week, a Bush spokesman said Bush will leave his advisory role with the British banking giant Barclays by Dec. 31.\n\nOther business ties Bush could review include Rayonier, Empower Software Solutions and CorMatrix Cardiovascular.\n\nTenet reported that its third quarter revenue increased $4.18 billion in the previous year. The corporation has attributed 40 percent of that to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTenet's CEO, Trevor Fetter, has credited the Affordable Care Act for the growing business, and said he expects every state to embrace the expansion of Medicaid, a core aspect of the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Jeb Bush will resign from the board of a healthcare company that profits from the Affordable Care Act.", "Copyright": "2016 Headlines & Global News", "Author": "Headlines & Global News", "og": {"site_name": "Headlines & Global News", "description": "Jeb Bush will resign from the board of a healthcare company that profits from the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Jeb Bush Resigns From Board of Healthcare Company That Profits From The Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/54957/20141227/jeb-bush-resigns-from-board-of-healthcare-company-that-profits-from-the-affordable-care-act.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/46998/jeb-bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "hngn.com", "description": "Jeb Bush will resign from the board of a healthcare company that profits from the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Jeb Bush Resigns From Board of Healthcare Company That Profits From The Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/54957/20141227/jeb-bush-resigns-from-board-of-healthcare-company-that-profits-from-the-affordable-care-act.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/46998/jeb-bush.jpg", "creator": "@HNGNcom", "site": "@HNGNcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/54957/20141227/jeb-bush-resigns-from-board-of-healthcare-company-that-profits-from-the-affordable-care-act.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Headlines & Global News", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-27"}, "news_keywords": "jeb, bush, resigns, from, board, of, healthcare, company, that, profits, from, the, affordable, care, act", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0;", "Subject": "hngn.com"}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush Resigns From Board of Healthcare Company That Profits From The Affordable Care ActJeb Bush will resign from the board of a healthcare company that profits from the Affordable Care Act.\nTenet's CEO, Trevor Fetter, has credited the Affordable Care Act for the growing business, and said he expects every state to embrace the expansion of Medicaid, a core aspect of the Affordable Care Act.\n(Photo : Creative Commons)Republican Jeb Bush will resign from his board position with a healthcare company that profits from the Affordable Care Act.\nDec 27, 2014 04:34 PM ESTJeb Bush will resign from the board of a healthcare company that profits from the Affordable Care Act.\nTenet Healthcare has promoted and supported the Affordable Care Act, but Bush has opposed it since its beginnings, CBS News reported."}
