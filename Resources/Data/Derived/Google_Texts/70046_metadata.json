A few honked in support.\n\nThe demonstration came after terrorist attacks on Paris prompted Gov. Greg Abbott to declare that Texas will not accept refugees from Syria. Abbott said he didn\u2019t trust the federal vetting process for refugees and feared a few terrorists could slip through and create \u201cunacceptable peril.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republican presidential candidates, including real estate mogul Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have expressed similar opinions.\n\nDallas activist Hadi Jawad said the politicians are \u201cfear-mongering.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are making a political football out of this desperate situation,\u201d he said Saturday.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to do something other than post something on Facebook and say \u2018this is sad,\u2019\u201d said Marty Ruggles, 52. \u201cI\u2019m just standing up for love. If I had space, I\u2019d invite a family to move in with me.\u201d\n\nRuggles and others at the protest said they are Christians and believed turning away refugees was against their values. Some held signs that said \u201cJesus was a refugee.\u201d\n\nLaurel Moran, 38, and her husband brought their two young children to the protest. She said she that she goes to protests sometimes when she believes there has been a \u201cgreat injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that we have a lot of privilege, and we\u2019re very fortunate to live in a safe place. But it\u2019s basically luck,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have good luck, and people who are coming from Syria as refugees are not having very good luck right now. And as human beings, we have to help each other.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL3Byb3Rlc3RlcnMtZ2F0aGVyLWluLWRlYWxleS1wbGF6YS10by1ibGFzdC1uZWdhdGl2ZS1zZW50aW1lbnQtb2Ytc3lyaWFuLXJlZnVnZWVzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tristan Hallman", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "About two dozen protesters\u00a0called the Texas governor and other politicians \"bigoted\" for their desire to keep Syrian refugees away from the U.S. The protesters braved chilly weather and held signs\u2026", "title": "Protesters gather in Dealey Plaza to blast negative sentiment of Syrian refugees", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/11/protesters-gather-in-dealey-plaza-to-blast-negative-sentiment-of-syrian-refugees.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/11/IMG_5183.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-11-21T19:53:38Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have good luck, and people who are coming from Syria as refugees are not having very good luck right now.\nThe protesters braved chilly weather and held signs up to passing motorists.\nAbout two dozen protesters called the Texas governor and other politicians \u201cbigoted\u201d for their desire to keep Syrian refugees away from the U.S.\nSome held signs that said \u201cJesus was a refugee.\u201dLaurel Moran, 38, and her husband brought their two young children to the protest.\nGreg Abbott to declare that Texas will not accept refugees from Syria."}
