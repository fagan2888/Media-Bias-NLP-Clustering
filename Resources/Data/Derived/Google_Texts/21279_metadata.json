(RICHARD LOCKER/NEWS SENTINEL)</p>\n\nBy Richard Locker\n\nNASHVILLE \u2014 The big law-firm conference room was decorated with several pairs of red balloons forming the number \u201c28,\u201d the new number of Republicans in the 33-member Tennessee Senate. The office penthouse atop Nashville\u2019s Fifth Third Center tower gave the Senate Republican Caucus a fabulous view of the city.\n\nCaucus members assembled there Dec. 10 to celebrate the electoral victories of the previous month and lay the groundwork for the 2015 legislative session convening a month later. Gov. Bill Haslam also spoke, about the state budget he was preparing.\n\nThe caucus chairman, Sen. Bill Ketron of Murfreesboro, addressed the crowd about the American Legislative Exchange Council\u2019s annual \u201cpolicy summit\u201d in Washington, D.C., which he and six Senate colleagues had attended the previous week. He said 22 Tennessee legislators in all attended that ALEC conference, which Ketron said was the most from any state.\n\nALEC is a conservative policy research organization promoting \u201climited government, free markets, federalism\u201d and whose membership includes state lawmakers and corporate representatives from across the country. With Republicans now in full control of 30 state legislatures, ALEC now rivals the nonpartisan, centrist National Conference of State Legislatures in influence and attendance at its meetings.\n\nKetron said former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke to the Washington attendees about the Republican victories of 2014 and how to sustain them. \u201cNewt asked us to come back and challenge each and every one of you: we can\u2019t continue doing business the way we\u2019re doing it. Newt said that we\u2019re still conducting and running government the way we did in the 60s and 70s. We can\u2019t continue building brick and mortar and expanding the size of government. We\u2019ve got to be thinking smart and how do we compress it down.\u201d\n\nKetron said Tennesseans were front and center at the ALEC conference. \u201cWe\u2019re doing things right in Tennessee and they\u2019re looking at us. From bills to anything we\u2019re doing in Tennessee, they want to follow us.\u201d\n\nIndeed, ALEC is ingrained in the Tennessee Legislature, particularly among majority Republicans. Eighteen Tennessee lawmakers spent just over $53,000 in taxpayer money to attend ALEC conferences in 2014 (not counting lawmakers who didn\u2019t bill the state for the travel), according to expense records on the Legislature\u2019s website.\n\nKetron, who shepherded the wine-in-grocery-stores legislation to passage in 2014, attended all three of ALEC\u2019S annual meetings last year \u2014 its spring task force in Kansas City, the annual meeting in Dallas last summer, and the policy summit in Washington Dec. 2-6.\n\nBut ALEC is one of several national and regional legislative groups whose meetings Tennessee lawmakers attend. Others include the NCSL, Council of State Governments, Southern Legislative Council and the National Black Caucus of State Legislators.\n\nUnlike other national groups seeking to influence policy from the outside of state legislative chambers through lobbying and political pressure on lawmakers, ALEC is the lawmakers \u2014 and thus far more effective. And it\u2019s not unusual that conservative legislators would flock to its conferences and support its goals.\n\nLegislators bring home ideas, model bills and research from legislators in other states, from ALEC staff, scholars and associate members, and advisers from the corporations and foundations that help support ALEC. One of its four Board of Scholars members is economist-consultant Arthur Laffer of Murfreesboro, who championed tax cuts and supply-side economics as an adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.\n\nIts \u201cprivate enterprise advisory council\u201d includes executives from Koch Companies, Exxon Mobil, State Farm, Pfizer, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the tobacco giant Altria, AT&T, the National Federation of Independent Business, the alcoholic beverage giant Diageo, United Parcel Service, the for-profit online school company K-12 Inc., and the American Bail Coalition, which represents the bail bond industry.\n\nWhen the Tennessee Legislature approved a bill in 2011 allowing for-profit online \u201cvirtual schools\u201d to receive the state\u2019s share of per-pupil public school funding for every Tennessee student an online school enrolled, its legislative sponsors used a model bill from ALEC.\n\nVirginia-based K-12 Inc. lobbied for the bill. Within months of passage, the company contracted with the small, rural Union County school district to open the Tennessee Virtual Academy to students statewide. After four years of low performance by its students on the state\u2019s standardized tests, the State Department of Education has ordered the academy to close in June, but a lawsuit is pending.\n\nDespite K-12 Inc.\u2019s presence on the ALEC advisory council and a phalanx of lobbyists it hired, the company failed to win legislative approval this month of a measure to keep give the academy another year.\n\nBut one of ALEC\u2019s major initiatives has been more successful in Tennessee: opposing implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act at the state level.\n\nALEC produced the \u201cState Legislators Guide to Repealing Obamacare,\u201d which according to ALEC\u2019s website contains \u201c14 specific recommendations to push back against Obamacare (including \u201cDecline to enforce ObamaCare\u2019s \u2018consumer protections\u2019 if such enforcement authority does not already exist in your state\u201d) and 18 ALEC model bills that make health care more secure, affordable and accessible.\u201d\n\nThose include allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines \u2014 and similar bills have been filed in Tennessee.\n\nState Rep. Curry Todd, R-Collierville, the only Tennessee legislator currently on ALEC\u2019S 30-member board of directors, said despite its opposition to Obamacare, \u201cALEC was not involved\u201d in the successful effort to defeat Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan, an alternative Medicaid expansion plan funded through the Affordable Care Act that would have provided coverage for up to 280,000 uninsured working Tennesseans.\n\n\u201cThere were some groups that were involved with ALEC that were active in it but ... as far as ALEC coming down here and lobbying things, they haven\u2019t. They\u2019ve gotten a bad rap from some of the left-wing groups, which is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cOverall, we develop policy up there. Each individual member can take that policy and present it to their Legislature and tailor it to their particular state. I\u2019m not aware of any ALEC legislation per se but some members may have taken some idea\u201d home to present, Todd said.\n\nOne of ALEC\u2019S anti-Obamacare model bills requires legislative approval for expansion of Medicaid, as opposed to unilateral action by the governor. Tennessee lawmakers approved a similar bill in 2014, the precursor to this year\u2019s rejection of Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee.\n\nLegislators in Tennessee this month approved a school voucher program for special-needs children, allowing students with individualized education plans to take the state share of per-pupil funding to help pay for private schools and private service providers.\n\nLarge parts of Senate Bill 27, the Individualized Education Act sponsored by Sen. Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, and Rep. Debra Moody, R-Murfreesboro, resemble word-for-word the ALEC model \u201cSpecial Needs Scholarship Program Act.\u201d\n\nTodd said the IEP bill passed after he asked its supporters to narrow eligibility for the vouchers to the most severe disabilities, reducing the amount of money transferred from local public schools to private schools. \u201cThe IEP bill is a good bill for kids with disabilities. It gives parents the right (to go elsewhere) if their kids are not getting the kinds of services they need.\u201d\n\nState House Democratic Leader Craig Fitzhugh of Ripley said ALEC, as he recalls, \u201cwas the first of the groups that had this sort of model legislation and passed it around to other states.\u201d\n\nWithout citing ALEC specifically, Fitzhugh said national groups are having an impact on the Legislature that \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t have because Tennesseans can make their own decisions without this outside influence that\u2019s sometimes not exactly correct. I don\u2019t know about (their impact) growing but it\u2019s here and it hasn\u2019t been here before.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "ALEC's influence in the Tennessee Legislature", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/state/alecs-influence-in-the-tennessee-legislature-ep-1064576672-361944751.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/outsidemoney_08_17687810_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "NASHVILLE \u2014 The big law-firm conference room was decorated with several pairs of red balloons forming the number \u201c28,\u201d the new number of Republicans in the 33-member Tennessee Senate.
