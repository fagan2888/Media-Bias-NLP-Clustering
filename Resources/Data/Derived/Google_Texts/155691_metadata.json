Figures ranging from Uber drivers to Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber called the health care overhaul crucial in the emergence of the sharing economy, but Uber had remained officially silent on the subject until Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said in response to a question about Uber and Obamacare at a dinner in Manhattan. Kalanick didn\u2019t comment on the specifics of the health care policy, but said he sees little sense in the traditional link between employment and health care; he said he believes all Americans should have access to some health care safety net, without losing the option of paying more money for private care.\n\nAnd he said the success of Obamacare\u2019s core goal \u2014 creating a functioning individual market for health care \u2014 is very much in sync with Uber\u2019s vision of a liberated work force.\n\n\u201cThe democratization of those types of benefits allow people to have more flexible ways to make a living,\u201d Kalanick said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be working for The Man.\u201d\n\nUber is vastly the largest and most successful of a new wave of sharing economy companies, adding 50,000 new independent contractors to its platform nationwide every month, and Kalanick\u2019s endorsement comes as a new Republican Congress feels its way on issues touching both tech and a health care policy many of its leaders have sworn to repeal.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3513970, "userid": 1823255}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Health care frees drivers from \"The Man.\"..", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
