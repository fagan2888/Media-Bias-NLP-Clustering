It reported that party members \u201cfrom a broad ideological spectrum\u201d supported the decision to deploy 300 military advisers as terrorists threatened Baghdad.\n\nReaders who ventured beyond the frothy claim were rewarded with this hidden gem: \u201cSenate Democrats actually did not watch the president\u2019s speech on Thursday, instead talking energy policy over lunch.\u201d\n\nIn other words, anything Obama said was good enough for them. Nothing, not even the possible creation of a new jihadist state, can wake Dems from their hypnotic daze. Their master\u2019s voice turns them into iron filings, obedient to his magnet.\n\nPass the dessert, I vote yes!\n\nWhat, pray tell, is the Obama \u201cpolicy\u201d they are uniting behind? Since he didn\u2019t actually articulate one, the only conclusion is that they support him, period.\n\nThat the leftist media remain a sucker for story lines about Democratic unity, as opposed to those about a Republican \u201ccivil war,\u201d is a disgrace that helps define the age of Obama.\n\nUncurious and unserious journalists are not journalists. They are stenographers at best, shills at worst.\n\nTheir abdication is destructive. The refusal to subject Obama to the same critical standard applied to Republican presidents provides cover for policies that lack public support. And that blackout of skepticism serves to keep potentially wayward Democrats in line. Then and only then is it possible to claim they are \u201cstarting to unite\u201d behind a policy that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nContrast that fable with the results of a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll: It found Obama\u2019s approval rating falling to 41 percent, with only 37 percent approving of his foreign policy.\n\nA staggering 54 percent say they do not believe the president \u201cis able to lead the country and get the job done,\u201d with just 42 percent saying he can. A Gallup poll finds only 31 percent approve of his handling of immigration.\n\nThe dreary view of the president reflects the reality of ordinary Americans who see a weak economy and mounting crises at home and abroad. From the VA and IRS scandals, the ObamaCare mess and the surge of illegal immigrants on the southern border, to slaughters in Syria and Iraq, Russia\u2019s advance on Ukraine and China\u2019s aggression against its neighbors, they see the world turning darker and more chaotic.\n\nThey no longer believe their president is capable of rising to the challenges, making this a watershed moment for Obama and the nation.\n\nIf we lived in a parliamentary system, that sour mood could trigger a no-confidence vote and a collapse of the government.\n\nYet the Dems fall in line. They rouse themselves only to denounce Republicans as obstructionists, and occasionally racists, for daring to criticize Obama. With few exceptions, they show no interest in probing the IRS for playing political enforcer because so many Dems demanded the agency do just that.\n\nThis is wholesale dereliction by an entire party, yet there is no chance of getting to the truth because Eric Holder\u2019s Justice Department is also corrupted by partisanship.\n\nMost of the Washington media are similarly blinkered, defining all GOP complaints as \u201cpolitical,\u201d as if Dems are doing God\u2019s work.\n\nA popular idea among historians is that cataclysmic events, including World War I, happen because major players \u201csleepwalk\u201d into tragic mistakes. Complacency, as well as ambition, cowardice and greed, lead to bad decisions and fatal actions.\n\nThat pattern suggested itself in a stray comment Obama made Thursday. Aiming to do as little as possible about Iraq, he answered a question about Iran that was consistent with his fetish for the Kumbaya moment.\n\n\u201cOur view,\u201d he said, \u201cis that Iran can play a constructive role if it is helping to send the same message to the Iraqi government that we\u2019re sending, which is that Iraq only holds together if it\u2019s inclusive and that \u2014 if the interests of Sunni, Shia and Kurd are all respected.\u201d\n\nInclusive? Ah, yes, that must be it \u2014 a desire for inclusion is why the mad mullahs are sending fighters to Syria and Iraq and financing terror groups Hezbollah and Hamas. Rest assured, once the mullahs get nuclear weapons, we\u2019ll all be included.\n\nMaybe then the president and his party will wake up.\n\nExtraordinarily wrong\n\nMayor de Blasio, celebrating his first budget, reached for the sky \u2014 rhetorically. \u201cI don\u2019t use the word lightly, but it is truly transcendent,\u201d he proclaimed.\n\nHis favorite word, \u201cextraordinary,\u201d made seven appearances by my count. His staff, City Council members, their staff \u2014 everybody was extraordinary. That makes City Hall better than Lake Wobegon, where only the children are above average.\n\nThrow in \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d and you might conclude the mayor pulled off a miracle. Sleight of hand is more like it.\n\nThe total budget of $75 billion includes added spending in many categories, enough that the total is a reported 7 percent increase over last year. That includes higher state aid and costs for the new teachers contract, but not the income-tax hike de Blasio wanted.\n\nStill, with inflation running under 2 percent, the pattern isn\u2019t sustainable, and future deficits are sure to grow. That\u2019s why I believe de Blasio will try again to raise taxes after November\u2019s election.\n\nHe might succeed this time. If Democrats take a clear majority in the state Senate, they\u2019ll have the votes for tax hikes in both houses. Gov. Cuomo, if he\u2019s re-elected, will be eager to repay de Blasio for helping him get the Working Families Party backing and more likely to say yes to a tax hike.\n\nNothing extraordinary about that. Just tax-and-spend politics as usual.\n\nBharara\u2019s big bungle\n\nManhattan federal prosecutor Preet Bharara has had a remarkable run as a gangbuster, but his office was worse than amateurish in screwing up the Malcolm Smith corruption case.\n\nOnly during the trial did prosecutors produce nearly 70 additional hours of tapes they made with a key witness. Defense lawyers and the judge were shocked, and prosecutors conceded they never transcribed the conversations, some of which were in Yiddish.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to go to law school to realize it was daffy to withhold the tapes on that theory that they weren\u2019t relevant. Watching a single episode of \u201cPerry Mason\u201d would have been enough.\n\nFour jurors couldn\u2019t wait for the translations, so the judge declared a mistrial. Smith, a Democrat charged with trying to bribe his way onto the mayoral ballot last year, and a co-defendant, a GOP operative from Queens, will be retried in January. Meanwhile, Smith runs for re-election with the presumption of innocence.\n\nHot on IRS\u2019s e-mail trail\n\nA friend suggests a way to find the \u201clost\u201d emails of Lois Lerner in the IRS case. \u201cIf no one else can figure out how to retrieve them, let\u2019s pardon Edward Snowden. He\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "After President Obama spoke about Iraq, Politico posted a story last week that said Democrats were \u201cstarting to unite\u201d behind his policy.
