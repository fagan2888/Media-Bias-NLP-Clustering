The charges were later dropped.\n\nThe last time there was an interim government in Haiti was after Aristide's ouster and it took two years to hold elections.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Guyler Delva; Editing by Dominic Evans)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Haiti opposition lawmaker chosen as interim president to fill power vacuum - Reuters News:     PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Lawmakers selected an .05/26/2016 17:52:13PM EST.", "author": "Reuters News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Lawmakers selected an opposition senator who served as", "title": "Reuters News - Haiti opposition lawmaker chosen as interim president to fill power vacuum", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/14/haiti-opposition-lawmaker-chosen-as-interim-president-to-fill-power-vacuum-n2119474", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Lawmakers selected an opposition senator who served as", "title": "Reuters News - Haiti opposition lawmaker chosen as interim president to fill power vacuum", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/14/haiti-opposition-lawmaker-chosen-as-interim-president-to-fill-power-vacuum-n2119474", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Haiti opposition lawmaker chosen as interim president to fill power vacuum, Reuters News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe445d\"", "article_summary": "\"I solemnly declare the citizen Jocelerme Privert as provisional president of the Republic of Haiti,\" chamber of deputies president Cholzer Chancer said after the vote.\nSenate chief Jocelerme Privert is due to be sworn in later on Sunday as the provisional president.\nPORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Lawmakers selected an opposition senator who served as interior minister under former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's interim president on Sunday, in a move aimed at filling a power vacuum threatening stability in the Caribbean nation.\nThe last time there was an interim government in Haiti was after Aristide's ouster and it took two years to hold elections.\nHaiti canceled a runoff presidential election in January amid often violent protests over alleged fraud in the first round and after the opposition candidate boycotted the vote."}
