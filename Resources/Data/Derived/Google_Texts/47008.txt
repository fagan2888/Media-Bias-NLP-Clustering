Labor laws are constantly changing. As a small business owner, you’ve already got a lot on your plate--and keeping up with labor laws can be a game of catch-up. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Here are two of the newest small business labor laws you need to know for 2015.

Employers with 50 or More Employees May Have to Pay

If you’re a small business employer with 50 or more employees, you may now be subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility penalty if you do not offer affordable coverage, as a part of the Affordable Care Act. So, what is the Employer Share Responsibility (ESR)? It’s the requirement for larger employers to either offer health insurance to employees, or pay a fee if/when an employee buys subsidized health insurance through the Marketplace.

How is the Fee Calculated?

2015 is the first year that employers are subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility fee. The fee is equal to the number of full-time employees the employer employed for the month (minus 80) multiplied by 1/12 of $2,000, provided that at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax credit/subsidy for that month.

If you are a larger employer and are wondering how to calculate your ESR fee, see our related article “Quick Guide to Calculating Employer Shared Responsibility Fees in 2015”
