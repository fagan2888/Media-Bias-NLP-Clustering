Introduced Monday by Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, and Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., the bill would repeal the health care law\u2019s reinsurance fee, which many expect will be passed on to employers.\n\nAs it stands, the belly button tax will go into effect next year to offset any lost revenue resulting from high-risk customers who buy insurance on the government exchanges. It would provide payments to health insurance carriers who end up paying higher medical bills for the new customers.\n\nThe three-year reinsurance program is expected to affect 190mn Americans and has drawn criticism from some who believe carriers will find a way to pass on the added cost of insuring sick policyholders to businesses and individuals.\n\n\u201cThis covers every health insurance recipient, not just the policyholder,\u201d explained Tiberi. \u201cIt\u2019s a fee faced by everyone that provides health insurance and they will most certainly pass on the cost to their employees and customers when they can.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply outrageous that employers will be forced to pay the tax while they will get nothing in return from the program,\u201d he added.\n\nDan Heffley, regional special master of legislation for the National Association of Health Underwriters and president of a Nevada agent consultancy firm, said the reinsurance program makes sense in theory but will end up harming consumers almost immediately.\n\n\u201cSome insurance companies\u2026may be getting more of the negative risk. If insurance company A has more losses than insurance company B, the reinsurance program will help take some of the sting away,\u201d Heffley said. \u201cThe problem is all the fees and costs are being filtered down to the end user, the insured. About $63 is what it\u2019s coming to per person\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s going toward reinsurance.\u201d\n\nHeffley added that many carriers have already begun to itemize the reinsurance tax, \u201clike on a phone bill.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has recognized some of the negative effects of the reinsurance tax, announcing its intention to provide an exemption from the fee for \u201ccertain self-insured, self-administered plans\u201d for 2015 and 2016. However, many employers feel the exemption is too narrow and Tiberi called the proposal \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cA delay or exemption does not change the fact that the overwhelming majority of employers will still have to pay this tax,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cWe need to provide stability and security, not provide another incentive for employers to discontinue their coverage.\u201d\n\nThe bill has received widespread support from all corners of the workforce, including labor unions and both large and small businesses. The American Benefits Council, the National Retail Federation, the Corporate Health Care Coalition, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers have also voiced support for the bill.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/construction/house-introduces-bill-to-repeal-obamacares-reinsurance-tax-16220.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Congress(300x250).jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "A new House bill would repeal the ACA\u2019s controversial reinsurance fee, which increases consumer healthcare costs.", "title": "House introduces bill to repeal Obamacare\u2019s reinsurance tax"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new House bill would repeal the ACA\u2019s controversial reinsurance fee, which increases consumer healthcare costs.", "title": "House introduces bill to repeal Obamacare\u2019s reinsurance tax", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/construction/house-introduces-bill-to-repeal-obamacares-reinsurance-tax-16220.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Congress(300x250).jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A new House bill would repeal the ACA\u2019s controversial reinsurance fee, which increases consumer healthcare costs.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5bc\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s controversial \u201cbelly button\u201d tax may be no more if a bipartisan House bill becomes law.\nIt would provide payments to health insurance carriers who end up paying higher medical bills for the new customers.\nIf insurance company A has more losses than insurance company B, the reinsurance program will help take some of the sting away,\u201d Heffley said.\nIntroduced Monday by Rep.
