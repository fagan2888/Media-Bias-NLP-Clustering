“Not only does the average medical-school graduate leave campus with roughly $180,000 in debt, but the medical profession has also been undergoing intense transformation in recent years. The Affordable Care Act, the rise of branded hospital networks and the retirement of Baby Boomers are all complicating the lives of doctors and warranting pause from potential whitecoats,” said WalletHub in the analysis.

Most disturbing for Rhode Island doctors may be that the state ranks last — with the highest per capita payout in malpractice awards. RI's is 35 times higher than North Dakota's per capita malpractice paymenrs.
