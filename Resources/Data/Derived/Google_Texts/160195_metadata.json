When a woman reaches the age of 65, according to data cited in the report, her estimated lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's is one in six, considerably higher than a man\u2019s calculated risk of one in 11.\n\nThe report additionally highlights the fact that more than 60 percent of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers are women. Alzheimer\u2019s, which accounts for anywhere from half to 80 percent of all dementia cases, causes problems with memory, thinking, and behavior. Although a risk factor is increasing age, Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging.\n\n\"Well-deserved investments in breast cancer and other leading causes of death such as heart disease, stroke and HIV/AIDS have resulted in substantial decreases in death,\u201d Geiger added in a prepared statement. \u201cComparable investments are now needed to realize the same success with Alzheimer's in preventing and treating the disease.\"\n\nWhat are the direct financial costs? Well, they are staggering, according to Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which refers to the disease as \u201cthe most expensive condition in the nation.\u201d People living with Alzheimer's live an average of eight years after their symptoms become noticeable to others, but survival can range anywhere from four to 20 years. Meanwhile, someone must care for them. In 2014, experts predict the direct costs of caring for those with Alzheimer's will total nearly $214 billion, including a $150 billion price tag attached to Medicare and Medicaid services. In fact, nearly one in every five dollars currently spent by Medicare is on people with Alzheimer's or another dementia.\n\nAdd to that the difficult-to-reckon financial toll paid by families. In 2013, 15.5 million family and friends provided 17.7 billion hours of unpaid care to those with Alzheimer's and other dementias \u2014 care valued at $220.2 billion \u2014 while out-of-pocket spending for last year was estimated at $36 billion. Yet, according to many experts, all of that money is spent on caring for those with dementia with no comparable effort to stop or alleviate the symptoms of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not spending nearly enough on Alzheimer\u2019s research,\u201d David Shenk, creator and executive producer of the Living With Alzheimer\u2019s film project, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a paltry $500 million [a year] compared to billions and billions of dollars spent on other diseases.\u201d\n\nUntold costs of the disease include the burden of caring for someone with Alzheimer\u2019s, which often causes difficulties at work for many partners of those diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s. In fact, nearly 19 percent of women caregivers had to quit their jobs due to the demands of caring for someone with the condition. Naturally, this leads to anxiety and depression and a lower quality of life for the caregiver and those who depend on her or him. In a tough economy, caregiving a person with Alzheimer's might mean the difference between a decent standard of living and poverty for many.\n\nFor this reason, funds properly directed toward research could change countless lives in a meaningful way. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow, or stop the disease, the number of people over the age of 65 with Alzheimer's disease may nearly triple, from five million to as many as 16 million by 2050. \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s is slow and sneaky and will take out more people than most of the pandemics we\u2019ve endured,\u201d said David Hyde Pierce, actor, Alzheimer's advocate, and host of the recent Living With Alzheimer\u2019s screening of short films.
