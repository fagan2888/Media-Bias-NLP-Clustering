As the nation\u2019s largest developer of transitional care properties, Mainstreet specializes in real estate development, value investments and health care. With Mainstreet\u2019s support, SHN brings this on-the-spot reporting from the NIC conference, which draws developers, providers and operators within the post-acute and preventative health care services space.\n\nThe debate over whether senior living is primarily a hospitality or health care industry has been intensifying in recent years. Now, it appears that rather than coming to a consensus one way or the other, leading providers in either camp are holding firm and building strategies around distinct philosophies.\n\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon that could in fact be causing a \u201cbifurcation\u201d of the private-pay senior living sector, one expert proposed at the recent National Investment Center for Senior Housing & Care (NIC) Spring Investment Forum in Dallas.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a group of companies that are very much interested in integrating health care services and offering a very different product for consumers, and I think you\u2019re going to see other companies maintain the housing and hospitality focus,\u201d said David Grabowski, Ph.D., a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, with a particular interest in long-term care.\n\nEach approach presents challenges to providers. In the case of more health care-oriented companies, the issue is how to maintain assisted living\u2019s valuable person-centered focus and high quality of life in non-institutional settings.\n\n\u201cNo one wants a \u2018nursing home light,\u2019\u201d Grabowski said.\n\nFor companies that keep the focus on hospitality, the issue becomes how to enable residents to age in place even as they become frailer.\n\nAlthough it will become a requirement that providers do both well, the market may be able to sustain both more hospitality-focused and more health care-centric operators, Grabowski said. While it remains to be seen whether this comes to pass, partisans on either side of the hospitality-health care debate presented focused cases at the NIC Forum.\n\nBrookdale Seizes an \u2018Advantage\u2019\n\nIt may be too sweeping to say that the nation\u2019s largest senior living provider is going big on a health care model, but certain initiatives are taking Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) in that direction.\n\nAssisted living has the potential to be key provider within the increasingly integrated U.S. health care system, Brookdale\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Kevin O\u2019Neil, M.D., said at NIC. In the six years since the Affordable Care Act passed, health reform efforts have aimed to control costs by incentivizing different types of providers to work more closely on managing the health of their patient populations. Those efforts have been focused on hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other provider types that directly receive a large share of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements\u2014but now more attention is being paid to assisted living and other senior living settings, O\u2019Neil said.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because there\u2019s a growing appreciation that assisted living is in many cases a less expensive option than nursing homes and it provides valuable social supports lacking in home care, he said.\n\nGiven this new focus, assisted living providers would be wise to beef up their health care services to be attractive partners to hospitals, SNFs, and other players. Preventing hospitalizations and rehospitalizations is one way that assisted living companies can be among the increasingly narrow networks of preferred providers in a given community, O\u2019Neil noted. By piloting a checklist-based program to improve transitions between different care settings and flag at-risk residents, Brookdale has succeeded in slashing its hospitalization rate from assisted living by 17%.\n\nAnother facet of the evolving health care system is the rise of Medicare Advantage, in which private insurers contract with the government to manage certain Medicare populations. Medicare Advantage has tripled in patient volume over the last decade, and now more than 17 million beneficiaries are in MA plans, O\u2019Neil said.\n\nBrookdale has taken steps to become a player in MA, notably through a demonstration project launched in Oregon last year. Brookdale Health Options is a collaboration with United Healthcare, in which Brookdale residents voluntarily enroll in a United Assisted Living Medicare-Health Management Organization (HMO). The goal is to reduce Medicare costs while improving residents\u2019 health status. The program rolled out in five communities in Oregon in April 2015 and is expanding to 14 within the next year.\n\nThe enrollment rate so far has been solid, reaching 66% penetration at one community, and it is rapidly increasing, according to O\u2019Neil. One of the main early goals is preventing avoidable hospitalizations for these residents, which should not only improve their health and well-being, but benefit Brookdale\u2019s bottom line as well. That\u2019s because 18% to 20% of residents who are hospitalized also have an additional 30-day SNF stay, and then 50% of these people do not return to the assisted living setting, O\u2019Neil said.\n\nIn addition, hospitalization can account for up to 41% of the total Medicare spend for enrollees, so reducing hospitalizations should significantly help the health plan reduce costs\u2014and Brookdale is being compensated by United Healthcare for meeting quality metrics.\n\nO\u2019Neil is a vocal advocate for these types of programs, believing that assisted living should carve out its niche now to be successful in the health system of tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThis is going to come at you like a freight train,\u201d he said.\n\nBrandywine: No scrubs\n\nNew Jersey-based Brandywine Senior Living is known for offering a premium level of services and amenities at its communities in the Tri-State area, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. Hospitality will continue to be its primary focus, President and CEO Brenda Bacon said in no uncertain terms.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want nurses in scrubs walking through our buildings,\u201d she said during a NIC general session. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with the hospitality services and making sure that that the tap room is fully stocked.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that Bacon and her colleagues have their heads in the sand about the shifting health care system. Brandywine has forged partnerships with four major hospital systems in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, she said. However, Bacon strikes a more conservative tone than O\u2019Neil when discussing how private-pay senior living can become enmeshed with other providers and payors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to be in a liability risk chain for hospitals and nursing homes, because we can\u2019t really control [the care provided] to our resident,\u201d she said. Putting Brandywine too much at the mercy of government reimbursement rates also is something to avoid, she added.\n\nRather than putting too much emphasis on what\u2019s going on outside the senior living community walls, improving quality internally is where Bacon believes the greatest payoff will come. Benchmarking quality both against other providers as well as a company\u2019s own past performance will go a long way toward lowering risk and boosting profits, according to Bacon.\n\n\u201cI think that quality has a direct correlation to your margins and success as a company,\u201d she said.\n\nPart of Bacon\u2019s outlook is informed by Brandywine\u2019s early years, when skilled nursing, home health, and other more health-focused service lines were all part of the company. This model was changed largely because key differences in the business models of these services made it difficult to have them all under the same umbrella, she said. Now, while Brandywine can be laser-focused on its core competency of providing a hospitality-rich resident experience, the company partners with outside providers to meet residents\u2019 health care needs.\n\nIt\u2019s this approach that Bacon believes can address the challenge of allowing assisted living residents to age in place in environments like Brandywine, which also will help achieve the cost savings that is the goal of large-scale health care reform.\n\n\u201cPeople are living in their home or in [an assisted living] community that is their home, and utilizing medical services as they need them,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can bring services to help keep them independent, their life experience is going to be much better, and the taxpayers of this country are going to save a lot of money.\u201d\n\nWritten by Tim Mullaney", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "brandywine senior living, brookdale, niclive, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "This coverage of the 2016 National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care Spring Investment Forum is brought to you by Mainstreet.
