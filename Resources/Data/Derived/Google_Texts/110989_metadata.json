John Katko, R-Camillus, promised he would not always vote the GOP party line in Congress.\n\nTwo weeks into the 114th Congress, Katko appeared to be doing just that. He joined with the Republican majority to reinstall John Boehner as House Speaker, and joined his party again to slash an employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act and to allow the Keystone XL Pipeline project to move forward.\n\nWhat happened to the candidate who said he could work both sides of the aisle to represent Central New York's interests, break gridlock and get the federal government moving forward?\n\nWednesday, Katko broke with his party in a big way. He and 25 other Republicans (including Richard Hanna of Barneveld) joined the Democrats in a key vote against an amendment to roll back President Obama's immigration order that, among other things, stops the deporting of illegal immigrants brought to the United States as young children. The amendment passed anyway, 218 to 209.\n\nAfter the vote, Katko said he disagrees with the president's use of an executive order to set immigration policy but he voted against the amendment because he didn't see any reason to punish the children.\n\nWell done, Congressman, for showing some independence and voting your conscience. We look forward to more of the same over the next two years.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Editorial Board", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Charley Hannagan, Editorial, Rep.
