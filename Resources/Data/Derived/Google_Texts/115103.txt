WASHINGTON (CBS DC/AP) — The Log Cabin Republicans are accusing an LGBT group of promoting gay stereotypes in a video to encourage gay men to enroll in Obamacare.

The video by Out2Enroll – a group promoting President Barack Obama’s signature health care law to the gay community – shows shirtless men in underwear celebrating Christmas to the parody song of “Let It Snow” called “Get Enrolled.”

“Hope you’re stuffed from your Thanksgiving

Now ’tis the season of giving

‘Fore the Doctor brings a lump of coal

Get Enrolled, Get Enrolled, Get Enrolled!”

Log Cabin Executive Director Gregory T. Angelo called the ad “cynical.”

“This cynical ad betrays the depths Obamacare advocates will sink to in order to pad the pathetic enrollment numbers,” Angelo said in a statement. “As a self-proclaimed ‘fierce advocate’ of gay equality, President Obama would do well to distance himself from this nonsense and denounce it immediately.”

Angelo stated that the video portrays gay men as “nothing more than sex-crazed lechers” and even invoked the swirling “Duck Dynasty” controversy.

“At a time when left-wing propagandists are decrying ‘Duck Dynasty’s’ Phil Robertson for equating homosexuality with promiscuity and deviance, Out2Enroll and others should take a look in the mirror and ask if the truth is that they are the ones responsible for promoting such harmful stereotypes.”

Monday is the last day people can purchase a plan through the online insurance marketplace if they want coverage to be in effect on New Year’s Day.

A more significant deadline comes in March. That’s when federal law requires all Americans to get health coverage or face fines.
