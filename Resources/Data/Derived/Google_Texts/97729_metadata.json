Both men were repeat gold medalists for boxing in the Western States Police and Fire Games. Between 2009 and 2011, Dorris accrued a series of stunning victories in Northern California\u2019s Badge vs. Badge amateur boxing league for law enforcement, correctional officers and firefighters. He eventually won the International Amateur Boxing Super Cruiser Weight Championship, followed by decisive win that grabbed him the IBAC champion belt in the standard cruiser weight division. Meanwhile, Johnson, an Oakland police officer, was fighting in the same league. Johnson won the International Amateur Boxing Heavyweight champion in 2011. Both men have been defending champions since.\n\nDorris and Johnson have wanted to fight each other for nearly a decade. An 11-year veteran of the Folsom Police Department, Dorris agreed to bulk-up and take on Johnson in a heavyweight bout hosted by the Battle of the Badges fighting circuit. Their confrontation was the main event on a 14-bout fight card that marked the first boxing tournament in Folsom in nine years.\n\n\u201cThis is a battle between two real champions that no one is going to forget,\u201d Battle of the Badges promoter Israel Montes told the crowd.\n\nDorris received a roaring hometown welcome as he walked to the ring. Making the same walk was boxing trainer Shon Moore, who has been Dorris\u2019s coach since 2009. Dorris hasn\u2019t lost a fight since having Moore in his corner.\n\nJohnson came into the community center looking strong, confident and ready to hit the city of Folsom with an upset.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t to be.\n\nJohnson opened up Round 1 with a direct jab, though he was instantly paid back by a hard counter-jab to his face. From there, Dorris used quick, coordinated footwork to move like a matador, landing a walloping body shot to Johnson\u2019s ribs that echoed to the back of the room. Dorris quickly followed with a left hook to Johnson\u2019s head. The Oakland officer tried to get aggressive: He threw a long double-jab, but Dorris picked off both punches with the inside of his left glove before pivoting inside to deliver two hurting hooks to Johnson\u2019s midsection. Johnson switched to defense for the rest of Round 1. That didn\u2019t stop Dorris from scoring another bitter body shot before the fighters went to their corners.\n\nWhen Round 2 got underway, Johnson tried to go on the hunt, landing a good straight jab to Dorris\u2019s head. Dorris jumped to the side, racking Johnson\u2019s ribs again with a big right hook before going to the face with a stinging double-jab. Johnson came back with a clean, straight punch, though Dorris made him pay for the move with a left hook and then a strong missile to the kidney. With each boxer trying to control the other\u2019s rhythm, Dorris managed to score another jab. Johnson tried a classic one-two combination, but Dorris deftly slipped both punches with some pretty side-to-side shoulder and head movement.\n\nAt the beginning of Round 3, Johnson made a final effort to take command. He charged Dorris, throwing his long jab and a wide hook that partially connected. The next jab Johnson launched costed him, with Dorris using its opening to drill a tight, hammering hook to the other man\u2019s ribs that \u2013 in the fraction of a second \u2013 created enough space for him to deck Johnson with an upper-cut, ala young Mike Tyson. Johnson kept his cool, returning fire with a powerful straight left. Dorris answered by giving Johnson another unprotected body blow. The two men faced each other with the last seconds ticking down. Johnson managed to graze Dorris with an uppercut. Dorris took the initiative at the end as he jumped in to finish with a bold, blistering left hook that echoed over the onlookers.\n\nThe judges\u2019 score cards were unanimous in making Dorris a new triple champion.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know for sure until they announced it,\u201d Dorris acknowledged. \u201cYou just can\u2019t tell when you\u2019re fighting a current champion, because judges want you to go above and beyond what a normal boxer needs to win a fight \u2013 they want you to prove to them that you won without a doubt.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt felt like a thousand pounds lifted off my shoulders.\u201d\n\nDorris explained that it\u2019s hard for him to put into words what it meant to walk into the Folsom Community Center before the fight and see so many members of the Folsom Police Department, Folsom Fire Department and his own afterschool boxing program for Folsom teenagers, all eagerly there to cheer him on.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me to see that support,\u201d Dorris said. \u201cEspecially since this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about what\u2019s been going on in this nation lately with all of the negative outlook on law enforcement. I wanted to represent the Folsom Police Department in a way it could be proud of, not only from the way I was boxing, but from the way I carried myself and showed respect to my opponent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
