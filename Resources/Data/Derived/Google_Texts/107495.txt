TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) - More than 35 unimmunized students at two Traverse City elementary schools will be kept out of the classroom for three weeks after a chickenpox outbreak.

Traverse City Area Public Schools Superintendent Paul Soma says he decided to follow a recommendation from Grand Traverse County Health Department officials and exclude those students from classes at Interlochen Community School and the Montessori program at Glenn Loomis school.

School district spokeswoman Christine Guitar tells the Traverse City Record-Eagle (http://bit.ly/1Sdmk2M ) that chickenpox recently affected eight children between both schools.

She says the recommendation was to exclude the children from classes for 21 days but they could return sooner if theyâ€™re immunized or cleared by a doctor.
