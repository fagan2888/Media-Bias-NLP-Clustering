The government injected almost $50 billion into the company to save it from a bankruptcy process, taking claim to 60 percent of the company\u2019s stock for its troubles. By disposing of the stock over time, it recouped all but $10 billion of that investment.\n\nWhile the controversy over the government takeover having receded, a few have suggested that the government should have held onto its shares longer: If profits keep growing, share prices would have risen too, which might have allowed the government to break even on its investment. But wisely, the government eschewed such thinking and sold its stock as expeditiously as possible.\n\nWhy was this wise? Because having the government own even a portion of a profit-maximizing concern is fraught with inherent conflicts that make life difficult for any CEO and corporate board wanting to do what\u2019s best for their shareholders.\n\nThis is still an ongoing problem: While the government has divested itself of GM stock, it has chosen a completely different path with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Just as with GM, the government essentially took over the two entities, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in 2008. The government placed them into what\u2019s called a conservatorship, which gave the government ownership of just less than 80 percent of common stock, with preferred bondholders retaining the other 20 percent.\n\nThe reason the government chose this arrangement was to avoid adding the cumulative debts of the two (which at the time were in the trillions of dollars) to the federal balance sheet. Running a deficit approaching $1.5 trillion in 2009 frightened the markets enough; adding another few trillion dollars to that might have created an entirely new set of problems in the financial markets.\n\nThe two hemorrhaged money for a couple years after the bailout, but as the economy and the housing market improved, Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability. It soon appeared that their booming profits might allow the government to recoup its investment and extricate itself from the mortgage business altogether.\n\nHowever, the government showed no interest in such a path. In 2012, the U.S. Treasury quietly changed its contract with the two GSEs and changed the financial position of the other shareholders.\n\nInstead of being content with the 10 percent dividend it assigned itself, along with the bulk of any profits from a future stock sale, Treasury takes the entire net worth of Fannie and Freddie each quarter. At the end of 2013, this amounted to a total of $185.2 billion since the peremptory imposition of this policy. That\u2019s roughly $2 billion shy of making up for taxpayers\u2019 entire investment.\n\nAt this pace, the treasury will recoup its investment by sometime in 2014, but there\u2019s no reason to believe that the government will even then exit the mortgage business: Treasury mandarins have opined in the press that the business of home mortgage financing is \u201ctoo important\u201d to be left solely to the markets.\n\nBut the government\u2019s arrogation of the firms has created numerous problems. For starters, it\u2019s crippling the GSEs. Disgorging their net wealth every quarter means they have little money available to improve how they do business, retain key employees, or even attend to the-day-to-day matters of running large, complex enterprises.\n\nSecondly, imperiously changing the terms of its deal with Fannie and Freddie and the other shareholders sets a terrible precedent, one to which the Obama administration\u2019s other behavior has added credence.\n\nPut simply, this government has never seen itself as bound by the rule of law. It showed this contempt in the GM bailout, when it subjugated the bondholders to the claims of the union health-care plan, in clear violation of federal bankruptcy law and a couple of centuries of precedent. It felt free to ignore an insufficiently pliant Congress when it saw the need to make changes to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s altering of the terms of the conservatorship smacks of the government trying to have it both ways: It got the benefits \u2014 keeping the trillion-dollar-plus debts of Fannie and Freddie off the government\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 but then managed to slough off the price of such an arrangement by squeezing out the other shareholders.\n\nThe government\u2019s advocates tell us not to feel sorry for the hedge funds and \u201cspeculators\u201d who own the other 20 percent of Fannie and Freddie, but such a blithe attitude smacks of a class war from another century. If we can ignore contractual obligations because the other party has been deemed to be unfit for some reason, where on earth does that leave us?\n\nThe ranks of Fannie and Freddie stockholders include more than just leviathan hedge funds: The community bank from my hometown in central Illinois held over $1 million of preferred stock in Fannie Mae \u2014 on a government bank examiner\u2019s recommendation.
