While O\u2019Donnell appeared totally healed from his ordeal, he came back a changed man on at least one issue: the Koch brothers.\n\nIn an emotional monologue, O\u2019Donnell opened up about the taxi accident that sent him and his brother to a hospital \u2013 a hospital which he praised profusely. That facility was the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, where David Koch is on the board of trustees. In 2009, he donated $25 million to that medical facility.\n\n\u201cThe first words I saw when I rolled into the hospital was the name David H. Koch. Yes, that David Koch,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cNow brace yourselves please for the first positive words said about David Koch on this program. I agree with Harry Reid\u2019s critique of the Koch brothers\u2019 contributions to American politics, but that is not the only thing they contribute to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be outraged by what the Koch brothers do with their money in politics and you can appreciate what they contribute to hospitals and medical research, and you can do that at the same time and still retain an ability to function,\u201d the MSNBC host continued.\n\nThe host grew emotional as he talked about his recovery and the medical professionals who walked him through that process. \u201cYes, I feel some gratitude to David Koch,\u201d O\u2019Donnell confirmed.\n\nO\u2019Donnell may say that he supports Reid\u2019s attack on the Kochs, but all he seems to agree with is the general distaste for their political spending. He does not seem to agree that the Kochs are \u201cun-American\u201d or a \u201ccult,\u201d though he may still believe they are \u201cone of the main causes\u201d of climate change.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve lost Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, Jon Stewart, and the editorial staff of Mother Jones magazine, perhaps it is time to rethink your grand strategy.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Not so \u201cun-American\u201d anymore.", "title": "After getting treatment in a Koch-funded hospital, MSNBC host has total change of heart", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/25/after-getting-treatment-in-a-koch-funded-hospital-msnbc-host-has-total-change-of-heart/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-25T14:41:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T13:59:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "david koch, harry ried, Koch Brothers, Lawrence O'Donnell,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "That facility was the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, where David Koch is on the board of trustees.\nYes, that David Koch,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\nAfter getting treatment in a Koch-funded hospital, MSNBC host has total change of heartposted at 10:41 am on June 25, 2014 by Noah RothmanOn Monday, MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell returned to the network after spending several weeks recovering from a motor vehicle accident in which he broke his hip in multiple places and sustained a variety of other injuries.\n\u201cYes, I feel some gratitude to David Koch,\u201d O\u2019Donnell confirmed.\n\u201cNow brace yourselves please for the first positive words said about David Koch on this program."}
