Attack a cancer patient. Classy,\" one angered Tweeter wrote in response to his posting, with another adding \"you have to smear a cancer patient for picking the wrong insurance company? Nice touch.\"\n\nEdie Littlefield Sundby\u2019s op-ed caused President Obama's top adviser Dan Pfeiffer to tweet a link to a story that criticized her insurer, not Obamacare. (Facebook)\n\nJournal opinion writer James Taranto also chimed in to slam Obama's \"fast-talking flack,\" for supporting the smear piece against Sundby in the left-leaning publication.\n\nThink Progress writer Igor Volsky claimed in the Obama defense piece, that \"Sundby shouldn't blame reform \u2014 United Healthcare dropped her coverage because they've struggled to compete in California's individual health care market for years and didn't want to pay for sicker patients like Sundby.\"\n\n\"Sundby is losing her coverage and her doctors because of a business decision her insurer made within the competitive dynamics of California's health care market,\" he adds.\n\nBut Taranto fought back, correcting Volksy's point by saying, \"Sundby is losing her coverage and her doctors because of a business decision her insurer made within the competitive dynamics of California's health care market under the regulatory structure established by Obama's comprehensive 'reform.'\"\n\nCalifornia resident Edie Littlefield Sundby wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. (Facebook)\n\nSundby insisted in her article, \"My grievance is not political; all my energies are directed to enjoying life and staying alive, and I have no time for politics.\"\n\n\"For a cancer patient, medical coverage is a matter of life and death. Take away people's ability to control their medical-coverage choices and they may die. I guess that's a highly effective way to control medical costs. Perhaps that's the point,\" she added.\n\nIn Sundby's piece, she explains how once the reform goes into effect on Dec. 31, she will be forced to choose between the state government health exchange - which means certain doctors won't be covered - or try to cover up to 50% of the medical expenses on her own since her insurance company, UnitedHealthcare, will not participate in California's insurance exchange.\n\nThe article went viral online and amassed over 2,500 comments in just a few days.\n\nllarson@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LESLIE LARSON", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama's top adviser Dan Pfeiffer has taken aim at the heartfelt op-ed penned by a terminal cancer patient about the disastrous impact of Obamacare on her treatment.", "title": "Obama advisor sparks outrage for jab at cancer-victim\u2019s insurer", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-advisor-outrages-jab-cancer-victim-insurer-article-1.1507182", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1507179.1383674178!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/irs-political-groups.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, United States, Dan Pfeiffer, California", "parsely-author": "Leslie Larson", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, United States, Dan Pfeiffer, California", "news_keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, United States, Dan Pfeiffer, California", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-advisor-outrages-jab-cancer-victim-insurer-article-1.1507182", "parsely-title": "Obama advisor sparks outrage for jab at cancer-victim\u2019s insurer", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-05T13:00:32-0500", "sailthru.title": "Obama advisor sparks outrage for jab at cancer-victim\u2019s insurer", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-11-05T18:00:32", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1507179.1383674178!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/irs-political-groups.jpg", "description": "President Obama's top adviser Dan Pfeiffer has taken aim at the heartfelt op-ed penned by a terminal cancer patient about the disastrous impact of Obamacare on her treatment.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "President Obama's top adviser Dan Pfeiffer has taken aim at the heartfelt op-ed penned by a terminal cancer patient about the disastrous impact of Obamacare on her treatment.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "President Obama's top adviser Dan Pfeiffer has taken aim at the heartfelt op-ed penned by a terminal cancer patient about the disastrous impact of Obamacare on her treatment.", "title": "Obama advisor sparks outrage for jab at cancer-victim\u2019s insurer", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-advisor-outrages-jab-cancer-victim-insurer-article-1.1507182", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1507179.1383674178!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/irs-political-groups.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1507179.1383674178!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/irs-political-groups.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "LESLIE LARSON", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b2b\"", "article_summary": "Attack a cancer patient.\nClassy,\" one angered Tweeter wrote in response to his posting, with another adding \"you have to smear a cancer patient for picking the wrong insurance company?\n\"For a cancer patient, medical coverage is a matter of life and death.\nPresident Obama's top adviser Dan Pfeiffer has taken aim at the heartfelt op-ed penned by a terminal cancer patient about the disastrous impact of Obamacare on her treatment.\nEdie Littlefield Sundby\u2019s op-ed caused President Obama's top adviser Dan Pfeiffer to tweet a link to a story that criticized her insurer, not Obamacare."}
