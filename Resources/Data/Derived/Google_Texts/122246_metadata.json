As CGI worked on healthcare.gov, government officials were frustrated with the company for missing deadlines, and Michelle Snyder, CMS\u2019s chief operating officer, told colleagues, \u201cIf we could fire them, we would,\u201d according to The New York Times. Both Marilyn Tavenner, CMS administrator, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, testified in congressional hearings that CGI didn\u2019t meet expectations. A CGI spokesperson says, \u201cas a matter of policy, we do not discuss the specifics of our ongoing client projects.\u201d\n\nCGI has been a big stock-market success. According to the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail, CGI\u2019s stock has risen an average of 25 percent annually for the last 25 years. At its peak in November, the stock was up almost 70 percent in 2013, and the problems of healthcare.gov seemed to be having no discernible impact. Slate said that that\u2019s because healthcare.gov is such a small part of its business. At any rate, CGI just reported revenues of $10.1 billion in its fiscal year ended in September 2013, up more than 100 percent from a year ago.\n\nCGI is short for Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique, or Consultants to Government and Industry. It was founded back in 1976 by two Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Serge Godin and Andre Imbeau. The publicity-shy Godin, now 63 and still active as the company\u2019s chairman, became a billionaire this year, according to Slate, which called him a \u201cclassic tortoise\u201d who had built his fortune with a \u201creliable, and more patient, business strategy than stumbling on the right tech at the right time.\u201d He\u2019s received numerous awards and honorary titles, including being inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, and he is a major owner of harness-racing horses. His daughter, Julie Godin, is the company\u2019s executive in charge of human relations, and her father\u2019s presumptive heir.\n\nCGI\u2019s lack of visibility before healthcare.gov wasn\u2019t a reflection of the size of the company or how much work it does. With a market value of roughly $11.6 billion, CGI, after the decline of BlackBerry maker RIM, boasts of being Canada\u2019s biggest technology company. (All figures in this story are in Canadian dollars; one U.S. dollar is worth about 1.07 Canadian dollars at the present time.) In truth, companies like CGI are more body shops than true technology companies, and the projects they take on require a lot of grunt work by a lot of low-level employees. CGI employs almost 70,000 people, who are embedded in businesses and governments around the globe. Its U.S. clients have included the military, the F.B.I., Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid Medical Assistance program, and at least 40 state governments.\n\nIn this context, the selection of CGI, which has had a long relationship with the U.S. government through the companies it has acquired\u2014among other projects, CGI also ran recovery.gov, the Website for all data related to the Recovery Act\u2014doesn\u2019t seem so odd. Back in 2007, CGI was one of 16 companies given an umbrella contract to do unspecified systems work for CMS. These so-called indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts exist throughout the federal government. Companies compete to be on the list, and then when a specific task arises, they compete again to be awarded that task; but because the list of competitors is predetermined, the process is shorter. When the Obama administration selected a main contractor for healthcare.gov, they decided to use the prequalified contractors, rather than starting afresh, in order to save time, according to Bloomberg. CGI was chosen as the lead contractor for the Website over three other bidders: IBM, QSSI, and Computer Sciences Corporation. According to congressional testimony, CGI stands to be paid $292 million for its work on healthcare.gov.\n\nThat lack of expertise explains why in building healthcare.gov, the government turned to industry contractors; in particular, to CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, a Canadian company. To those uninitiated in the dark art of government contracting, it seems scandalous that CGI, a company most Americans had never heard of, a company that is not located in Silicon Valley (where President Obama has plenty of Internet superstar friends who could have formed a dazzling brain trust to implement his signature legislation) but rather in Montreal, could be chosen as the lead contractor for the administration\u2019s most important initiative. While right-wing news outlets have focused on the possible relationship between Toni Townes-Whitley, senior vice president for civilian-agency programs at CGI Federal, and Michelle Obama, both of whom were 1985 Princeton graduates, CGI\u2019s selection is probably more an example of a dysfunctional system than it is a scandal. \u201cA lot of the companies in Silicon Valley don\u2019t do business with the government at that level [the level required for federal contracting],\u201d explains Soloway. \u201cIt is very burdensome, and the rules make it very unattractive.\u201d Indeed, government contractors have to meet a whole host of requirements contained in a foot-thick book, including cost accounting and excessive auditing, to prove that they are not profiting too much off the American taxpayer. Hence, there tends to be a relatively small, specialized group of companies that compete for this work, even on such critical matters as healthcare.gov.\n\nThe story of how the Obama administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agencies tasked with implementing the Affordable Care Act got it so wrong is still unfolding. Much of the blame has to fall on an insular White House that didn\u2019t want to hear about problems, and another chunk has to land on CMS, which instead of hiring a systems integrator, whose job it would have been to ensure that all the processes feeding into healthcare.gov worked together, kept that role for itself. As anyone who has worked with the federal government on such projects knows, it is utterly inept when it comes to technology. \u201cThe government continues to struggle with how best to acquire the expertise to integrate technology,\u201d says Stan Soloway, the C.E.O. of the Professional Services Council, which represents contractors who work with the government. Soloway has a scary stat, which is that of the 80,000 information-technology workers in the federal government, for every one person under 30, there are 10 people over 50.\n\nAs we all now know, the bug-infested Website healthcare.gov turned out to be anything but \u201creal simple.\u201d After the site\u2019s disastrous October 1 launch, the administration organized a frantic rescue effort shepherded by Jeffrey Zients, who is to become Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser in January, and on December 17, the administration tapped Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene to lead the effort to build out the rest of the Website. The site is working better (but as of this writing still not perfectly) for consumers, though the complications it has unleashed for President Obama will be even harder to fix. The New York Times called the broken Website a \u201ccrisis that suddenly threatened his presidency,\u201d and according to a CBS News poll, Obama\u2019s job-approval rating has plunged to an all-time low. Americans\u2019 approval of the Affordable Care Act has also dropped to its lowest level since CBS News began polling support for the law.\n\n\u201cNow, this is real simple,\u201d President Obama told a crowd at Prince George\u2019s Community College, in Maryland, in late September. \u201cIt\u2019s a Website where you can compare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak \u2026 same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on, and you start looking, and here are all the options.\u201d\n\nOn Wall Street, there\u2019s an entirely different sort of controversy brewing about CGI. Several smart investors\u2014including well-known short-seller Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates\u2014are betting against CGI, or shorting its shares, not because of the quality of its work but because of questions about its earnings. In September, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane downgraded CGI to a rare \u201csell\u201d rating, citing quality-of-earnings questions. What he and others point out is that a number of questionable accounting tactics could be creating the illusion that CGI\u2019s business is far more successful than it actually is. After the news broke in Newsweek that Chanos was shorting CGI, its stock fell more than 12 percent, although it\u2019s begun to climb again.\n\nCGI is what\u2019s known as a \u201croll-up,\u201d meaning that it was built by acquiring other businesses, or rolling them up. Indeed, since its founding in 1976, CGI has acquired more than 70 businesses. (\u201cPlease stand up if you\u2019ve ever been acquired,\u201d Godin asked a crowd at a company gathering last February, according to the Globe and Mail. Almost everyone in the room stood up.) In the U.S., CGI built its business with the 2004 purchase of American Management Systems, based in Arlington, Virginia, and the $1.1 billion 2010 purchase of Stanley Inc., another Arlington, Virginia\u2013based company. Stanley\u2019s biggest customer was the U.S. Army, and the Stanley deal, according to Cormark Securities analyst Richard Tse, was instrumental in entrenching CGI with the government. \u201cThey are quite embedded,\u201d he told the Globe and Mail. \u201cStanley was an entity that was really effectively managing many of the back-office systems for government and military.\u201d Most recently, CGI bought Logica, a management-consultancy company headquartered in the United Kingdom.\n\nOne way in which roll-ups can be problematic is if the growth from acquisitions masks underlying deterioration in the business. This seems to be the case with CGI and Logica. The combined revenue of CGI and Stanley was $4.7 billion in the 12 months ending in March 2010. In the 12 months ending in June 2012, revenue fell to $4.2 billion. That\u2019s right when CGI bought Logica, thereby effectively doubling its revenue. But the combined CGI/Logica business is now shrinking again. (Revenues in the fiscal year that just ended declined 1.4 percent, based on CGI\u2019s own calculation of what it and Logica would have produced in the previous year.) Competitors, on the other hand, are growing. In a review on glassdoor.com from November 2010, one former CGI employee wrote, \u201cThe CGI business model suffers from a lack of enterprise-wide investments in technology solutions \u2026 an authentic commitment to revenue growth must be made at the CEO and SVP level so that the business model challenges are acknowledged, faced and solved.\u201d In written responses to Vanity Fair\u2019s questions, CGI says that \u201cit is wrong to say we lack organic growth,\u201d and that drawing any conclusions from Logica\u2019s performance to date does not reflect CGI\u2019s \u201cbusiness model of shedding low or no margin revenue immediately after an acquisition.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the way acquisitions can mask underlying decay, roll-ups sometimes draw suspicion because the accounting can be manipulated to make newly combined businesses look stronger than they actually are. The most famous example of this sort of manipulation is Tyco, the giant conglomerate that ran into trouble in the early 2000s. In a 2002 piece in Fortune, Chanos explained how it works. During what\u2019s known as the \u201cstub\u201d period (the weeks before an acquisition closes), the buyer tries to make the purchased company look worse than it is. This generally involves writing down the value of the assets on the balance sheet, and possibly increasing the liabilities. The write-downs are offset by an increase in a balance-sheet category called goodwill, which is basically the difference between the price the acquirer paid and the value of the business. By doing this, the acquirer is able to re-record revenues that had already flowed through the income statement, but without the costs that originally accompanied those revenues. The acquirer might also play games to delay the receipt of cash during the stub period. Or as Chanos puts it, the result is that after the merger, the combined businesses\u2019 \u201cgrowth, profitability, and cash flow are stronger than would otherwise be the case.\u201d Chanos calls it \u201cspring-loading.\u201d Investors also call this a \u201ccookie jar,\u201d in which money disappears into a reserve and miraculously reappears later. To find this sort of practice, skeptical investors look for \u201ctells,\u201d like big increases in goodwill, big negative movements in reported profits in the stub period, and big moves in balance-sheet accounts.\n\nAlthough the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to eliminate this practice, it isn\u2019t necessarily against the rules, because figuring out the fair value of assets and liabilities, particularly in businesses that operate on long-term contracts (like CGI) is mostly a matter of judgment. An acquirer has a fair amount of latitude to make changes to an acquired company\u2019s accounts as it learns more about the business it just bought. But it\u2019s problematic if the accounting artifice is masking the underlying reality of the business. Questions about Tyco\u2019s tactics eventually sent its stock price sliding, and increased the scrutiny on the company. Ultimately, its former C.E.O. Dennis Kozlowski was convicted on separate charges.\n\nThe way CGI has accounted for its most recent and biggest acquisition\u2014Logica\u2014has some suspicious elements. In May 2012, just before the deal was announced, Logica told investors in a report that was opined on by its auditors that its business was on track to earn a solid 6.5 percent profit margin despite \u201ctough market conditions.\u201d But then, in a filing in November, CGI told investors how Logica\u2019s business had performed during the first half of the year; the report, which was unaudited (and which said it was prepared in a manner that was consistent with how Logica had previously prepared its financials, meaning there were not any big changes in accounting methodology) showed that Logica\u2019s operations had lost \u00a3190 million (before any onetime items), or more than $300 million, in those six months.\n\nPart of the reason for the loss is that Logica reported a charge of \u00a3173 million (roughly $270 million at the exchange rate at the time) due to \u201ccontract-related losses.\u201d Michael Yerashotis, an analyst at Canada\u2019s Veritas Investment Research who is also skeptical of CGI\u2019s accounting for Logica, says that one of his concerns about the charge is that Logica\u2019s management had done its own review of contracts at the end of 2011, which resulted in a small loss at that time. It\u2019s odd that the problems would mushroom in such a short time.\n\nCGI says that this interpretation is wrong, that Logica\u2019s forecasted 6.5 percent profit excluded \u201ca number of items, including corporate costs,\u201d and that the comparison is not \u201capples to apples.\u201d But the written documentation in both filings seems to indicate that the numbers are comparable.\n\nThe big loss, one investor says, was the first indication he had that CGI might be creating a \u201ccookie jar\u201d\u2014or reducing Logica\u2019s reported profits in order to be able to boost them later. But it was not the last. At that same time in November, CGI filed another set of Logica financials. This set was also supposed to represent Logica\u2019s finances as of June 30, 2012, but it was adjusted by CGI for the acquisition, which they are allowed to do. The adjustments were big, and they all could have the effect of increasing CGI\u2019s revenues and profits in subsequent periods. \u201cSome of the revenue originally reported by Logica was written off, with CGI planning to recognize that revenue again, essentially double counting revenues,\u201d is how Deutsche Bank described this. Over the course of the year, CGI continued to adjust Logica\u2019s accounts retrospectively. In total, CGI has written down Logica\u2019s current assets by more than $730 million, and increased Logica\u2019s liabilities by almost $300 million The amount of goodwill on Logica\u2019s balance sheet has increased by more than $600 million. In summary, say skeptics, CGI might be able to not only re-recognize revenues but also effectively boost its margins, because it has already written off the costs associated with some contracts. \u201cWe believe [the adjustments] will significantly increase CGI\u2019s earnings on a go-forward basis,\u201d wrote Yerashotis.\n\nThere is no way for outsiders to know with certainty if CGI\u2019s adjustments to Logica\u2019s financials are reasonable or not. But the swings are big. Remember the loss at Logica in the first half of 2012 that seemingly came out of nowhere? In the quarter ended in June 2013, CGI\u2019s European operations, which mostly consisted of Logica\u2019s former business, posted a profit margin of more than 8 percent. In other words, according to CGI, in the space of roughly a year, they improved Logica\u2019s operating margins by about 18 percent, from negative 10 percent to positive 8 percent. Since this is a business that relies on long-term contracts, it\u2019s hard to make such quick changes. That helps explain why Deutsche Bank wrote, \u201cWe believe accounting changes have driven much of the reported margin improvement.\u201d\n\nCGI says, \u201cThese improvements were not the result of accounting adjustments but the implementation of our standard, publicly disclosed business restructuring model,\u201d which it uses to improve the performance of businesses it acquires. CGI also says that the Deutsche Bank analyst was \u201crequired to take the exceptional step of amending his initial report after admitting that many of his accounting claims, which were a key element of his conclusions, were wrong.\u201d Deutsche Bank did make changes in one of its reports, but the firm still writes that CGI\u2019s \u201caccounting [is] inflating margins,\u201d and they maintain a \u201csell\u201d rating.\n\nThere are some other oddities in CGI\u2019s financials. Its reported profit margins seem high, given the businesses it is in. In its U.S. business, CGI reported an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization) margin of 15 percent in its last fiscal year. But in the past year, 55 percent of CGI\u2019s business in the U.S. came from contracts with the federal government and its agencies. Government contracts often operate on a cost-plus basis, meaning that contractors are allowed to earn their costs, plus a little profit. Stanley, which was acquired by CGI in 2010 and which greatly increased the size of CGI\u2019s business in the U.S., had an EBITDA margin of 10 percent in the last fiscal year before the acquisition. Since then, there has been pressure on margins, and now, in general, large federal contractors have EBITDA margins below 10 percent. Assume that CGI is more efficient than its peers and has kept a 10 percent margin in the business it does with the U.S. government. Even then, to get to the blended margin of 15 percent that it reports, its nongovernment business would have to have had a 22 percent EBITDA margin, which is sky-high for an information-technology contractor. CGI says that the assumption that its margin on its government work is 10 percent is \u201cincorrect,\u201d as is the idea that its government work is predominantly on a cost-plus basis.\n\nCGI\u2019s margins in its Canadian business are even higher: 25 percent. At least a partial explanation seems to be that the Quebec government pays CGI a subsidy. CGI gets tax credits of up to 30 percent of the salaries of I.T. workers working in Quebec, capped at $20,000 per employee, per year. CGI\u2019s accounts show that it received total tax credits of $99 million in 2012 and $96 million in 2013. It is unclear how the subsidy affects CGI\u2019s income statement, or whether or not it affects reporting segments like the U.S. But for perspective, CGI\u2019s total earnings in 2013 before taxes were $966 million. CGI says that its \u201cCanadian and United States EBITDA includes Canadian and United States tax credits, respectively, related to job creation and available to all companies.\u201d\n\nIn the past, CGI has dismissed complaints by saying that its accounting is more conservative than Logica\u2019s; hence the need for write-downs. According to its filings, CGI has had some correspondence with the Securities and Exchange Commission about accounting issues, including the amount of goodwill on its books from the Logica acquisition. In May, the S.E.C. sent CGI a letter saying that it had \u201ccompleted our review of your filing.\u201d And, to some degree, CGI\u2019s explanations make sense. Anyone who looks at businesses with longer-dated contracts knows there is a tremendous amount of discretion in revenue-recognition policies. Most of the analysts who cover CGI\u2019s stock rate it a \u201cbuy,\u201d and are very bullish about its future. Canadian financial firm Desjardins just upgraded CGI\u2019s stock, citing the company\u2019s \u201cproven and successful build-and-buy strategy\u201d and \u201cample opportunities\u201d for it to continue making acquisitions.\n\nBut neither the S.E.C. nor sell-side analysts are renowned for catching accounting issues. CGI\u2019s explanations still don\u2019t make sense of the big losses at Logica in the first half of 2012, which came before CGI says it changed Logica\u2019s accounting. One way the big balance-sheet changes do make sense, given the sheer magnitude of the changes at Logica, is if Logica\u2019s business was troubled. But if Logica\u2019s business was far less profitable than it appeared, it\u2019s somewhat surprising CGI would be telling investors that it expects the Logica deal to increase its earnings power by 25 to 30 percent. (\u201cNo sell-side analyst has questioned Logica\u2019s accounting,\u201d says CGI.)\n\nBut due to the problems with healthcare.gov, all eyes are on CGI in a way they never were before.
