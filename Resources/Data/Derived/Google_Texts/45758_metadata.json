Yes, the nation will spend more on education if more students enroll in colleges and universities, but the \u201ctypical\u201d student already attending college won\u2019t; she or he will continuing paying tuition at more or less the same rate, while the newly-enrolled student will presumably benefit from some sort of subsidized tuition rate.\n\nThe same is true here. The so-called \u201ctypical\u201d family that Conover describes already receives health care insurance through their employer. The existence of 30 million newly-insured people \u2014 many of whom will receive tax credits if they purchase insurance in the law\u2019s exchanges \u2014 won\u2019t do much to move their premiums in one way or another. (Health advocates hope that the law will slow the rate of growth in health care spending, but that\u2019s a long-term proposition.)\n\nIn fact, if anything, the CMS report that Conover links to shows that Obamacare is a good financial proposition. In 2022, total health care spending will increase by 1.5 percent, while the number of non-elderly adults with health care coverage will increase by 9 percent. That\u2019s a pretty good deal any way you slice it.\n\nConover produces \u201can average that doesn\u2019t mean anything for anyone,\u201d Van de Water told ThinkProgress. \u201cHe understates the value of the coverage that uninsured will be getting, but greatly overstates and mis-states the cost that the typical family will experience. Typical is employer-sponsored insurance and that is not being affected to any significant extent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a typically misleading use of data by opponents of Obamacare,\u201d MIT\u2019s Jonathan Gruber added. \u201cThe bottom line is that the government has consistently reported that Obamacare will raise national health spending by about 1 to 2 percent.\u201d \u201cThis is a small fraction of the typical 5 to 7 percent annual growth rate in health care \u2013 and is a small price to pay for insuring 30 million or more Americans.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "One economist interviewed by ThinkProgress described this calculation as one of the stupidest things he's read in a long time.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "One economist interviewed by ThinkProgress described this calculation as one of the stupidest things he's read in a long time.", "title": "Sorry, The Latest Anti-Obamacare Article To Go Viral Is Totally Wrong", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/23/2666391/anti-obamacare-article/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rtx13g4j-e1379597244881.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One economist interviewed by ThinkProgress described this calculation as one of the stupidest things he's read in a long time.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rtx13g4j-e1379597244881-321x214.jpg", "title": "Sorry, The Latest Anti-Obamacare Article To Go Viral Is Totally Wrong", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rtx13g4j-e1379597244881.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rtx13g4j-e1379597244881.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-23T16:02:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d15\"", "article_summary": "(Health advocates hope that the law will slow the rate of growth in health care spending, but that\u2019s a long-term proposition.)\nIn 2022, total health care spending will increase by 1.5 percent, while the number of non-elderly adults with health care coverage will increase by 9 percent.\nHealth Sorry, The Latest Anti-Obamacare Article To Go Viral Is Totally Wrong CREDIT: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersCREDIT: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersAn article published by Forbes claiming that Obamacare will increase health care costs by $7,450 for a typical family of four is spreading like wildfire across the internet, but causing eye rolls from economists across the country.\nThe so-called \u201ctypical\u201d family that Conover describes already receives health care insurance through their employer.\n\u201cHe understates the value of the coverage that uninsured will be getting, but greatly overstates and mis-states the cost that the typical family will experience."}
