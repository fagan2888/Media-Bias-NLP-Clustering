Commissioner Roger Goodell will preside over the appeal of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, the NFL confirmed to the Los Angeles Times.

Brady, through the NFL Players Assn., on Thursday filed the appeal regarding his four-game suspension for his part in the deflating of footballs during the AFC championship game.

The union asked for a neutral arbitrator to hear the case.

"Commissioner Goodell will hear the appeal of Tom Brady's suspension in accordance with the process agreed upon with the NFL Players Association in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an email.

Brady’s punishment was announced Monday, days after a report by independent investigator Ted Wells stated the Patriots quarterback was "at least generally aware" that locker room staff were deflating balls for the 2014 AFC championship game.

During his one public appearance since the report was released, Brady said he had no reaction to the findings and was still “digesting” the information. Before that, he maintained his innocence.

The team and fans have Brady’s back.

“Tom Brady has our unconditional support,” said team owner Robert Kraft in a statement released Monday following the Wells report. “Our belief in him has not wavered.” The team then changed social media profile photos to pictures of Brady’s jersey.

Fans have vehemently defended Brady, and some even started an online crowdfunding page to pay the $1-million fine the team was slapped with, in addition to being docked two draft picks, in relation to the scandal.
