In recent years, much attention has been given to increasing the transparency of the prices charged to patients by hospitals, physicians, and medical laboratories. But now the transparency trend is about to drive change in the provider directories that health insurance plans make available to their beneficiaries and consumers.\n\nWhen choosing a health plan, many people look for insurance that includes their own physician, or at least a doctor close to home. That is why an accurate and up-to-date provider list is essential to consumer choice and access.\n\nBut many health insurers fall short in this regard. California recently released chastising reports on two of its major health plans, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield (ABCBS) (NYSE:WLP) and Blue Shield of California, (BSCA) for publishing inaccurate provider lists on the state\u2019s California Covered insurance exchange.\n\nSurvey Finds Major Errors in Provider Directories of \u2018Blue\u2019 Health Plans\n\nThe California Department of Managed Health Care (CDMHC) found that 12.5% of physicians listed in the Anthem exchange plan\u2019s provider directory had inaccurate locations. A survey of physicians listed as \u201cin network,\u201d revealed that thousands of them, nearly 13%, did not accept Covered California patients.\n\nLikewise, the state reported that 18.2% of locations for physicians listed as providers for Blue Shield\u2019s California Covered plan were inaccurate. Moreover, 9% of doctors listed as \u201cin network\u201d did not accept patients covered by this health plan.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have health reform that\u2019s based on insurance markets that are selling standard products and not have this information available to consumers and purchased,\u201d stated Gerald Kominski, Ph.D., Director of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research in a report published by Modern Healthcare.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of open enrollment if you can\u2019t be an informed decision maker?\u201d added Kominski. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial states follow up on this and hold insurers accountable.\u201d\n\nState regulators referred the findings to the California Office of Enforcement. They also warned that the CDMHC would conduct a follow-up survey in six months. While there were no immediate consequences for insurers failing to provide consumers accurate information, the reports focused on stricter oversight of insurers participating in Obamacare insurance exchanges. Such oversight not only included the state of California, but also the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), noted another Modern Healthcare report.\n\nGeorgetown University Researchers Cite Consumer Complaints Nationwide\n\nCalifornia is not the only state where insurers are failing to provide health plan shoppers accurate provider information. A recent study by Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms found that consumers nationwide complain about inaccurate or obsolete provider directories. Few states, however, are doing anything to improve the situation, the authors said.\n\nThis problem is significant enough on a nationwide scale that the NAIC has revised its \u201cmodel law\u201d for states\u2019 health plans to require insurers to update their provider directories monthly. HHS has also proposed a new rule that would require insurers in Obamacare exchanges to let consumers know which providers are accepting new patients.\n\nAdditionally, HSS has proposed a rule that would require health plans to post provider directories in a \u201cmachine-readable\u201d file format. This would enable third parties, such as states and consumer advocacy organizations, to create tools that help consumers make more informed decisions.\n\nMaryland, for example, launched a search tool that allows consumers to search for doctors and compare health plans on its insurance exchange. Centralizing provider information for all plans on the health insurance exchange in one online location allows providers to rapidly find errors in network directories and make corrections, noted Joshua Sharfstein, M.D., the state\u2019s former Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nHealth Plans Blame Inaccuracies on Software, Doctors, and Size of Networks\n\nCalifornia\u2019s two Blues blamed the inaccuracies on several factors. These included software glitches, providers failing to update their information, and difficulty tracking constant changes by the enormous number of providers in their networks.\n\nAnthem, Inc., the parent company of ABCBS, for example, has 38,000 physicians in its California network. Accurate provider directories are a \u201cshared responsibility\u201d of providers, pointed out Clare Krusing, spokesperson for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), and they \u201cjust aren\u2019t providing information in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nInsurers also say software limitations may exacerbate inaccuracies. Josh Nelson, Vice President of Provider Network Development at the Utah co-op Arches Health Plan, explained that some physicians accept Arches patients at one location, but not another. Since the company\u2019s software identifies physicians by tax IDs across their various practices, a doctor may be \u201cin network\u201d at one location, but not at another.\n\nIndustry Experts, Consumer Advocates \u2018Call Out\u2019 Health Plans for Errors\n\nCalling insurers\u2019 explanations \u201coutrageous,\u201d healthcare consultant Robert Laszewski, President of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, observed in a Modern Healthcare report, \u201cNot having accurate consumer-level information about just who is in their provider network\u2014particularly when they are using narrow networks as such a major part of their Obamacare offerings\u2014is inexcusable!\u201d\n\nLynn Quincy, Associate Director of Health Reform Policy at Consumers Union, noted this problem won\u2019t be fixed by competition, since it\u2019s invisible to consumers shopping for health insurance.\n\nWhy Provider\u2019s Should Check Their Directory Listings\n\nHospitals, physicians, clinical laboratories, pathology groups, imaging facilities, and other providers need to know if their patients are covered by health insurance, so they all have a stake in the accuracy of information provided to consumers. The fact that state and federal agencies consider inaccurate provider directories a significant problem should be a wake-up call for all healthcare providers to check their own directory listings for errors and correct them.\n\nRelated Information:\n\nWhy Can\u2019t Insurers Publish Accurate Provider Directories?\n\nInaccurate Provider Directories Blamed on Weak Tech, Network Churn\n\nInsurers Draw Heat for Error-Riddled Provider Directories\n\n2014\u2019s Healthcare Price Transparency Report Card Reveals Few States Are Making It Easy and Fast for Consumers to See the Prices Charged by Hospitals, Physicians, and Medical Laboratories\n\nInnovative California NPR Project Takes on Healthcare Pricing Transparency\n\nStudy at Johns Hopkins Shows Price Transparency Works: Physicians Order Fewer Clinical Pathology Laboratory Tests When They Know the Cost\n\nPublic Hospital in Phoenix Slashes Patient Self-Pay Prices by 50% to Increase Hospital Price Transparency", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, anthem blue cross, covered california, california department of managed health care, cdmhc, gerald kominski, ph.d., university of california los angeles, ucla, ucla center for health policy research, obamacare, national association of insurance commissioners, naic, u.s. department of health & human services, hhs, georgetown university's center on health insurance reforms, america's health insurance plans, ahip, clare krusing, arches health plan, josh nelson, lynn quincy, consumers union, robert laszewski, health policy and strategy associates, health plan, america\u2019s health insurance plans,ahip,america\u2019s health insurance plans,anthem blue cross,arches health plan,california department of managed health care,cdmhc,clare krusing,clinical laboratory,consumers union,covered california,georgetown university's center on health insurance reforms,gerald kominski,health plan,health policy and strategy associates,hhs,josh nelson,lynn quincy,medical laboratory,naic,national association of insurance commissioners,obamacare,ph.d.,robert laszewski,u.s. department of health & human services,ucla,ucla center for health policy research,university of california los angeles,coding, billing, and collections,compliance, legal, and malpractice,laboratory management and operations,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology,management & operations", "description": "When choosing a health plan, many people look for insurance that includes their own physician or at least a doctor close to home, so an accurate provider list is essential to consumer choice and access.
