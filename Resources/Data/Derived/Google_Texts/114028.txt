LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26 (UPI) -- Fox is allegedly considering airing a revival of the singing competition "The X Factor" featuring the series creator Simon Cowell as a judge.

TV guide reported the news Monday based on an article published by British newspaper The Mirror. The original story, however, is no longer available. If the reports a true, Cowell would be abandoning his role as a judge in the U.K. version of the series to lead the judge panel in the American version of the show.

The X Factor USA premiered on September 2011, but was cancelled in February after three unsuccessful seasons. Cowell returned to the U.K. series after the fact.

According to the Mirror the show would premiere on 2015 and would also feature former Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger as judge. Scherzinger has been on the judge panel for both the British and the American version of the series.

While Cowell has yet to address the revival reports, he hinted that he missed the show when a fan tweeted about it earlier this year.
