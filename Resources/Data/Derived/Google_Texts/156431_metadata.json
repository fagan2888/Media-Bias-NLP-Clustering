Tom Wolf kept a major campaign promise this week and has started the process of repealing Healthy PA and instead accepting federally\u2013funded Medicaid expansion in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealthy PA was former Gov. Tom Corbett\u2019s healthcare reform plan, one in which many critics derided for causing clients to lose coverage and for installing certain asset checks and other obstacles.\n\nWold said the state will now transition to a simpler Medicaid expansion plan, and labeled the efforts as \u201cthe first step toward\u201d simplifying a complicated process.\n\n\u201cOur approach will alleviate confusion, remove unnecessary red tape, and streamline the system,\u201d Wolf said,\u201d so that people can see a doctor when they are sick and health care professionals will have more time to concentrate on providing quality care.\u201d\n\nPart of that first step was the Wolf request to the Department of Human Services to withdraw the portion of Corbett\u2019s package known as the \u201cHealthy\u201d option.\n\nHuman services acting secretary Ted Dallas said the department was committed to ensuring an \u201corderly and efficient\u201d transition for every Pennsylvanian who receives coverage through the state.\n\n\u201cWe are already at work making changed to our eligibility systems that will take effect this spring,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cThis will enable us to transition individuals participating in the General Assistance and SelectPlan programs to the new health plan.\u201d\n\nAside from those Pennsylvanians who already qualify for overage, Wolf\u2019s plan will allow residents age 19 to 64 who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level to obtain coverage, once the transition is complete. The expansion will also allow eligible adults to be placed into a more streamlined package, one in which the Wolf Administration says will increase contonuity of care while reducing unnecessary and redundant processes.\n\nRegarding the fate of Healthy PA, the Wolf Administration said it is now working with the federal government to develop a single benefit package for adults, and once complete, adults enrolled in the Healthy and Healthy Plus plans will then be transitioned to the new, single package.\n\nThe federal government will pay for 100 percent of the costs of Medicaid expansion through 2016, then will fund it at 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019 and 90 percent in 2020 and all years thereafter.\n\nThose already enrolled in either the Healthy or Healthy Plus plans are advised to do nothing now, as human services department will contact those clients when their transition nears; for those who are not yet covered, they can obtain health insurance through the state at www.compass.state.pa.us.\n\nAdministrations officials said that transition should be complete by the end of the year.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Medical Society voiced support of Wolf\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by its potential to positively impact Pennsylvania\u2019s patients and the care they receive,\u201d said Pennsylvania Medical Society President Dr. Karen Rizzo. \u201cAs part of our eight principles of health system reform, the Pennsylvania Medical Society has long supported the principle that health care coverage should be available and affordable to all Pennsylvanians, and that it should reduce administrative costs and improve efficiency.\n\n\u201cWhile most of the attention from the recent announcement certainly will focus on the elimination of Healthy PA and the politics involved, let\u2019s not forget what ultimately counts the most \u2014 patients getting the care they need.\u201d\n\nExpectedly, the Pennsylvania Republican Committee was unimpressed by Wolf\u2019s plan, while Democratic officials within the General Assembly hailed the move.\n\nPA GOP spokeswoman Megan Sweeney blasted wolf\u2019s decision, said Wolf has been \u201cvocal in his support for Obamacare as a step on the road to a complete government takeover of our health care system,\u201d and instead of focusing on improving the lives of Pennsylvania families, Wolf is imposing a \u201cdisastrous, fa\u2013-left agenda\u201d item on the state.\n\n\u201cIf Gov. Wolf was serious about improving our health care system, he wouldn't have chosen to bring one of the key architects of Maryland\u2019s Obamacare disastrous rollout to Pennsylvania,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cGov. Wolf\u2019s choice for Health and Human Services Secretary, Ted Dallas, botched Maryland\u2019s Obamacare efforts in one of the worst government fiascoes in the state\u2019s history, so why is Governor Wolf trying to reward his disastrous efforts with a Cabinet position? Gov. Wolf needs to stop serving liberal special interests and start serving the needs of Pennsylvanians.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Vincent Hughes, who has wages a years'\u2013long battle with the assembly over accepting ACA-backed Medicaid expansion, disagreed with Sweeney\u2019s assesment, saying Wolf\u2019s action instead instantly reverses the harm caused by Healthy PA.\n\n\u201cInstead of simply accepting more than $4 billion in federal funds to offer more than 500,000 people health insurance in our proven Health Choices system, the former administration chose to create a complicated web of obstacles creating barriers for Pennsylvanians in need of critical health services,\u201d said Hughes, D\u20137th. \u201cThis is simply not fair and clean, straightforward Medicaid expansion fixes this injustice.\n\n\u201cWe also know that this decision makes fiscal sense for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\u201d Hughes added. \u201cOperating a complicated, layered system chips away at the estimated $400 million in annual savings Medicaid Expansion brings for the state budget. These savings are desperately needed given the structural deficit grown over the past four years.\u201d\n\nDemocratic State Sens. Joy Costa and Shirley Kitchen have backed Wolf\u2019s plan, as did State Reps. Michelle Brownlee, Madeleine Dean, Pamela DeLissio, Stephen Kinsey, Steve McCarter and Philadelphia House Delegation Chair Cherelle Parker all backed Wolf\u2019s proposal.\n\nAlso backing Wolf\u2019s proposal is Sen. Bob Brady, who hailed Wolf for taking a \u201ccommonsense step to help hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians more easily access\u201d healthcare coverage.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Philadelphia Tribune", "description": "Gov.
