Regional Hospital of Scranton posted a negative 9.72 percent operating margin in fiscal 2013 , while Moses Taylor Hospital \u2014 another Commonwealth Health facility located just blocks away \u2014 ended with a negative 0.87 percent margin, a report by an independent state agency found. Geisinger Community Medical Center , the city\u2019s third general acute care hospital, posted a negative 2.31 percent operating loss.\n\nThe data, released Wednesday in Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council\u2019s annual financial analysis, reveal a troubling trend among the state\u2019s general acute care hospitals, as 35 percent of the 169 studied operated at a loss. The operating margin, an indicator of a hospital\u2019s financial health, reflects the percent of operating revenue remaining after operating expenses, such as patient care and cafeteria services, are paid.\n\nHalf the state\u2019s acute care hospitals had total margins below the 4 percent threshold, considered the minimum needed for long-term financial stability.\n\n\u201cIn too many communities, hospitals are struggling financially,\u201d said Andy Carter, president and CEO of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Carter pointed to rising uncompensated care costs, which jumped 35 percent during the last five years, and federal payment cuts as two reasons for the $400 million decline in statewide operating income from fiscal 2012 to 2013.\n\nGCMC Chief Financial Officer Edward Chabalowski said the biggest challenge is the payment reductions stemming from the Affordable Care Act or sequestration. In fiscal 2013, it cost the hospital $2.1 million in revenues \u2014 a number that will jump to $3.5 million in fiscal 2015, he said.\n\nOver 10 years, the cuts will equate to about a $52 million reduction in payments to GCMC, he said. The hospital\u2019s annual total operating revenues is about $175 million.\n\nWith GCMC investing millions in capitol projects, including its $97.1 million expansion, officials also recruited 10 new physicians to expand services, which boosted expenses, Mr. Chabalowski said.\n\n\u201cThose investments pay dividends in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually operating in the black right now.\u201d\n\nAmong the six Commonwealth Health hospitals included in the report, only Berwick Hospital Center and Wilkes-Barre General Hospital landed in positive territory, posting 11.89 percent and 6.04 percent operating margins, respectively.\n\nMid-Valley Hospital, which will stop its inpatient and emergency department services in July, had a 7.47 percent operating loss. Although Regional Hospital remains in the red, its 2013 operating margin improved from fiscal 2012\u2019s negative 15.92 percent.\n\n\u201cEach hospital\u2019s financial performance can be affected by a number of factors, including the kind of services offered, patient acuity, payor contracts and physician availability,\u201d said Renita Fennick, director of communications for Commonwealth Health in a statement. \u201c... We are making significant investments in facilities to recruit new physicians and to expand services in both markets.\u201d\n\nContact the writer:\n\nmiorfino@timesshamrock.com, @miorfinoTT on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"title": "Scranton's three hospitals seeing red", "author": "By Michael Iorfino", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Michael Iorfino", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1691322"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "bitly-verification": "68008dbe9586", "DC.title": "Scranton's three hospitals seeing red"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb07c\"", "article_summary": "For the first time in nine years , all three Scranton hospitals ended the fiscal year in the red.\nHalf the state\u2019s acute care hospitals had total margins below the 4 percent threshold, considered the minimum needed for long-term financial stability.\nGeisinger Community Medical Center , the city\u2019s third general acute care hospital, posted a negative 2.31 percent operating loss.\nThe operating margin, an indicator of a hospital\u2019s financial health, reflects the percent of operating revenue remaining after operating expenses, such as patient care and cafeteria services, are paid.\nAlthough Regional Hospital remains in the red, its 2013 operating margin improved from fiscal 2012\u2019s negative 15.92 percent."}
