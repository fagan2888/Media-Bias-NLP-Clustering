Gary Herbert appointed six Republican lawmakers, the so-called \u201cGang of Six,\u201d to come up with a compromise of his rejected Healthy Utah plan.\n\nThey promised to roll out a proposal July 31, but it looks like that won\u2019t happen--according to one of the members, Rep. Jim Dunnigan, who is the House Majority Leader and a Republican representing District 39\n\n\u201cI definitely feel a sense of urgency to solve this and come up with a sustainable solution that respects the taxpayers,\" Dunnigan said. \"It will require work beyond July 31st. Maybe we'll come up with a concept by then, I'm not sure.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not good enough for advocates. They said lawmakers are making excuses about high costs and fears the federal government won\u2019t provide funding.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply troubled that our state can manage to earmark millions of dollars each year for transportation to repair our roads, but we can't find the money to, can't find a way to provide healthcare for 53,000 people under the poverty level,\u201d said Bill Tibbets, Director of the Coalition of Religious Communities.\n\nIrvine added: \u201cI think it's a false argument, and kind of a rhetorical cruel trick, to suggest that people who need help really would rather wait to make sure that it's going to be there six months, two years, rather than getting it when they need it.\"\n\nAdvocates said 80 percent of Utahns support the Governor\u2019s Healthy Utah plan that will provide some type of coverage for those in the gap. They said it\u2019s another incentive for lawmakers to work quickly on finding a solution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY, Utah \u2013 The debate over providing health care access to tens of thousands of Utahns who fall under the so-called \u201cgap\u201d created by the Affordable Care Act took center stage on the steps of the Utah State Capitol Wednesday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "a9bc8fabb9f6cda780dcd354edb426e8"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox13now.com", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY, Utah \u2013 The debate over providing health care access to tens of thousands of Utahns who fall under the so-called \u201cgap\u201d created by the Affordable Care Act took center stage on the ste\u2026", "title": "Non-profit groups call on Utah lawmakers to make decision on Medicare coverage gap", "url": "http://fox13now.com/2015/07/15/non-profit-groups-call-on-utah-lawmakers-to-make-decision-on-medicare-coverage-gap/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/promo261273929.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/promo261273929.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox13now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox13now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News for Salt Lake City, Ogden, Provo and beyond", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324152525", "fb": {"pages": 75831650585}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox13now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/98a0a4875aa0281a51f538da86df31aa?s=16", "application-name": "fox13now.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/", "published_time": "2015-07-16T00:45:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-16T13:43:31+00:00", "author": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/"}, "keywords": "news, politics, affordable care act, gov. gary herbert, health care, health insurance, healthy utah, medicare gap, obamacare, rep. jim dunnigan", "google-site-verification": "avVLxvtHokA_r9gaDC1cvuQNhoxzcJHtFAJItW79fPI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "healthy utah, health care coverage in utah, medicare gap, medicare gap in utah, medicare expansion in utah, affordable care act, obamacare, gov. gary herbert, rep. jim dunnigan,"}, "article_summary": "Community leaders represented several non-profit groups, including Alliance for a Better Utah, LDS Democrats, Utah Health Policy Project, HEAL Utah, Lawyers for a Better Utah, Crossroads Urban Center, Equality Utah, League of Women Voters, Hispanic Caucus, Coalition of Religious Communities and Utahns Against Hunger.\nDavid Irvine, a member of the Alliance for a Better Utah, voiced his frustration with lawmakers.\nThey said lawmakers are making excuses about high costs and fears the federal government won\u2019t provide funding.\nAdvocates said 80 percent of Utahns support the Governor\u2019s Healthy Utah plan that will provide some type of coverage for those in the gap.\nAdvocates wrote their message on their T-shirts: \"#STILLWAITING\u2026\" As in, still waiting for lawmakers to cover 53,000 people who fall under the coverage gap."}
