Michele Bachmann wrongly claims that we\u2019re seeing \u201chuge increases\u201d in employer-sponsored plans, while President Obama touts historically low health care inflation, which experts say is mainly due to the slow economy, not the health care law.\n\nBoth Bachmann and Obama were making competing arguments about the success of the Affordable Care Act, specifically on costs to consumers.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Bachmann, who made her comments on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOn the Record\u201d on Nov. 17.\n\nBachmann: We are seeing huge increases in these premiums, not only in the Obamacare exchanges, but in the private market. Because remember, a lot of times it\u2019s the private market where we are getting health care through our employers. It\u2019s the private market that has to offset government programs, whether its Medicaid or whatever government program. So the costs are going through the roof.\n\nHer comment that there have been \u201chuge increases\u201d in the private market \u201cwhere we are getting health care through our employers\u201d is low-hanging fruit for fact-checkers. Employer-sponsored insurance premiums have been growing at low rates for the past several years. The average annual family-plan premium went up 3 percent from 2013 to 2014, according to the latest annual employer survey from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust.\n\nAs the press release on the survey says: \u201cPremiums increased more slowly over the past five years than the preceding five years (26 percent vs. 34 percent) and well below the annual double-digit increases recorded in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This year\u2019s increase also is similar to the year-to-year rise in worker\u2019s wages (2.3 percent) and general inflation (2 percent).\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve explained before that a small increase in employer-sponsored premiums from 2010 to 2011 was linked to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s elimination of preexisting condition exclusions for children, coverage of dependents on their parents\u2019 plans up to age 26, free coverage of preventive care, and an increase in caps on annual coverage. At the time, experts estimated premiums had increased 1 percent to 3 percent due to those requirements.\n\nDespite that, there has been a slow rate of growth for premiums for the 48 percent of Americans on employer plans recently.\n\nWhile premiums have gone up slowly, deductibles also have increased. The percentage of covered workers on plans with a deductible was 63 percent in 2009 and had increased to 80 percent in 2014.\n\nAs we\u2019ll explain, it\u2019s unclear how much the Affordable Care Act has affected this slow growth of premiums. But, at any rate, it\u2019s clear Bachmann is wrong when she says there have been \u201chuge increases\u201d and \u201ccosts are going through the roof.\u201d\n\nThe president, meanwhile, talked about the growth of health care costs in a press conference on Nov. 16 in Brisbane, Australia, site of the G20 summit.\n\nObama: And contrary to some of the predictions of the naysayers, not only is the program working, but we\u2019ve actually seen health care inflation lower than it\u2019s been in 50 years, which is contributing to us reducing the deficit, and has the effect of making premiums for families lower that they otherwise would have been if they have health insurance.\n\nObama is right about health care inflation, or health care costs, and it\u2019s a statistic the administration has cited several times. From 2009 to 2012, total health care expenditures for the U.S. have grown at rates under 4 percent per year (see Table 23). The journal Health Affairs noted that such rates are the lowest since the National Health Expenditure Accounts data was first compiled in 1960 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The NHEA estimates total health care spending in the country.\n\nBut Obama implies that the ACA caused that slow growth, and experts say it\u2019s mainly due to the slow economy. A 2013 statistical analysis of health spending by the Kaiser Family Foundation determined that \u201cmuch of the decline in health spending growth in recent years was fully expected given what was happening more broadly in the economy.\u201d The analysis estimated that \u201cabout three-quarters (77%) of the recent decline in health spending growth can be explained by changes in the broader economy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, experts at CMS said in a January article in Health Affairs that the health care law had a \u201cminimal impact\u201d on the slowdown. They wrote that the major reasons were the economy and its slow recovery, increased use of lower-cost generic prescription drugs, and a reduction in Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities.\n\nThe ACA may have had some influence. Drew Altman, CEO of KFF, explained in a September 2013 column that the law may be having an indirect effect, though it\u2019s difficult to prove. Altman wrote: \u201cHistorically, we have always seen the health-care marketplace respond by lowering costs when there is the threat of impending health reform legislation or government action on costs. Now we have not only the threat but the reality.\u201d\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers also issued a report in November 2013 saying the ACA is a \u201cmeaningful\u201d contributor to the slowdown in spending, even if it\u2019s not the sole or most important factor. The CEA said that the law\u2019s reductions in Medicare spending would not only have an impact on slowing growth in Medicare but would have a \u201cspillover effect\u201d on overall health care spending.\n\nSo, the ACA may be a factor in the historically low growth in health care spending in recent years, but it\u2019s certainly not the sole reason. CMS projects continued slow growth in total spending in 2013 \u201cdue to the modest economic recovery, the impacts of sequestration and continued slow growth in the utilization of Medicare services, and continued increases in cost-sharing requirements for the privately insured.\u201d\n\nBut after that, the rate of growth is expected to increase, partly due to an increase in the number of insured individuals under the ACA. CMS projects average growth of 6 percent per year for 2015 through 2023, \u201clargely as a result of the continued implementation of the ACA coverage expansions, faster projected economic growth, and the aging of the population.\u201d\n\nObamacare Premiums\n\nBachmann also mentioned \u201chuge increases\u201d in premiums on the \u201cObamacare exchanges.\u201d Are premiums on the state and federal marketplaces going up significantly? Overall, no, but some individuals face substantial increases unless they are willing to switch plans.\n\nThe New York Times analyzed the recent premium rate data on the marketplace plans released by the federal government and found that many with existing marketplace plans could see increases, as high as 20 percent, on their current plans. But it pays to shop around. \u201cIn a typical county, the price will rise 5 percent for the cheapest silver plan and 4 percent for the second cheapest,\u201d the Times wrote.\n\nThe Times also looked at data from the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform and found that the premium for the cheapest Silver plan is 3.4 percent higher for 2015, compared with last year. But if consumers stayed put in the cheapest plan from 2014, they would see an average increase of 9.7 percent. In other words, the cheapest plan from 2014 is, in many cases, not the cheapest in 2015.\n\nAn interactive map created by the Times shows how the increases \u2014 and even decreases \u2014 in premiums vary widely across the country. Those renewing the cheapest Silver plan would see a drop in premiums in Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and most of Mississippi, as well as a few other areas across the country. But a much greater proportion of the country would see a decrease in premiums if consumers switched plans.\n\nSimilarly, the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s analysis of HealthCare.gov data and state insurance rate filings found low overall increases in premiums on average \u2014 but geographic variation. For all U.S. counties, the second-cheapest Silver plan is up by 2 percent on average and the cheapest Bronze plan is up by 4 percent, KFF found.\n\nThe nonprofit also looked at rates in 51 cities in the U.S., and the change in the second-cheapest Silver plan for a 40-year-old nonsmoker. Premiums for those plans are going up by just 2.5 percent in Birmingham, Alabama, but up by 28.4 percent in Anchorage, Alaska, and down by 10 percent in Phoenix, Arizona. The biggest discrepancy is between those Anchorage rates and a 25.5 percent drop in premiums in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nIt remains to be seen to what extent consumers will shop around for lower-cost plans. In the past, the individual market has experienced a lot of turnover, with some of those purchasing their own insurance doing so for only short periods of time. It also was a market that saw substantial premium increases. In 2010, the last year KFF surveyed people in the individual market about premiums, it found that more than three-quarters of consumers reported that their insurers had requested a premium increase of 20 percent on average.\n\nMost who faced a premium increase elected to stay with the plan anyway. But 16 percent of all those on the individual market switched plans and ended up paying 3 percent less on average than they had before. That group also may have been motivated by more substantial price increases \u2014 KFF\u2019s survey found the plan-switchers had faced an average premium increase of 31 percent.\n\nThat market was also one in which consumers could be denied coverage, or charged higher rates, for preexisting health conditions. Insurers are no longer allowed to deny coverage or base premiums on health status, so there\u2019s no longer that risk in shopping around.\n\nAn FAQ on the KFF website explains that it\u2019s important to at least update one\u2019s application for tax credit purposes; those subsidies are based on family income and also the cost of benchmark exchange plans. In most cases if an application isn\u2019t updated by Dec. 15, the tax credit will automatically continue and the plan will be renewed.\n\nOne last thing: Bachmann went on to say that \u201cPresident Obama promised us that our health insurance premiums would reduce $2,500 a year. Put your hand up if your health care premiums reduced $2,500 a year. No one\u2019s did.\u201d We\u2019ve long questioned this old claim from Obama, calling it \u201coverly optimistic\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d when he first posited on the campaign trail in 2008 that a shift to electronic medical records would lead to such savings.\n\nThough he didn\u2019t make it clear, Obama was talking about a reduction in spending compared with what would have happened in the absence of the law \u2014 or a slower growth. And he was counting trickle-down savings in the form of lower taxes and higher wages.\n\nIn the years since, we\u2019ve shot down other White House versions of the $2,500 claim.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0dca\"", "article_summary": "Obama is right about health care inflation, or health care costs, and it\u2019s a statistic the administration has cited several times.\nPut your hand up if your health care premiums reduced $2,500 a year.\nThe NHEA estimates total health care spending in the country.\nFrom 2009 to 2012, total health care expenditures for the U.S. have grown at rates under 4 percent per year (see Table 23).\nBecause remember, a lot of times it\u2019s the private market where we are getting health care through our employers."}
