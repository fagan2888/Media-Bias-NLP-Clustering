Twitter hashtags took on a new purpose after terrorist attacks that killed more than 120 people in Paris this weekend.

There, Parisians used “#PorteOuverte,” which means “open door” in French, to invite strangers to stay with them until the streets were deemed safe to return home.

I have a home in 18th, I speak english and french #PorteOuverte #PortesOuvertes — Sarah (@lemaldelinfini) November 14, 2015

Americans, including many in North Texas, are tweeting messages with the phrase “#strandedinUS” to connect with people affected by the Paris attacks.

People are volunteering to hang out with travelers at the airport, find them a hotel or let them crash in a guest bedroom.

If ur near Dallas and cant get home to Paris, I can provide you with a ride, meal, friendly face &will set you up in a hotel #StrandedInUS — Texan Redhead (@texan_redhead) November 14, 2015

I know 1 flight in Dallas specifically was cancelled, it’s a long drive to Austin, but just know you’ll have a place to stay. #strandedinUS — ♔ Katie ♔ (@ridingondallas7) November 14, 2015

The would-be hosts aren’t sure anyone will take up the offers — American Airlines and Air France said flights to Paris will take off as scheduled, though Air France warned of delays upon arrival because of tightened security.

One Dallas resident, however, made this point:

It seems the least we can do is open our doors. We have space in #Dallas if needed. #strandedinUS #PrayforParis — Staci Salazar (@7onashoestring) November 14, 2015

There’s also one caveat: The people of Twitter ask that only those who need a place to stay and those wishing to host someone use the hashtag.
