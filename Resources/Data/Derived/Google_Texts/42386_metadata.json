(MIKE SEGAR / REUTERS)\n\nYou are managing a new innovation, with billions at stake and a deadline looming. But people with their noses in the details are telling you that you can forget about getting it done on time.\n\nYour gut tells you to push past the naysayers, rally the troops and do the impossible. But what if the naysayers are right?\n\nThe recent troubles with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which has put Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and others on the hot seat, have brought this classic management dilemma into focus.\n\nLeadership and management experts seem to agree that success in this situation \u2013 the ability to know when problems are real and deadlines and quality are in jeopardy \u2013 depends on a culture that expects results but demands the truth.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a management team that\u2019s comfortable with exposing problems as soon as they become aware of them,\u201d said Patrick Magoon, CEO and president of the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago.\n\nMagoon knows big projects. He oversaw the construction of the hospital\u2019s $855 million new home, completed on time and under budget last year.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows there are going to be problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be issues. It all comes out in the wash sooner or later. How you handle that first problem is important, because it sets the tone.\u201d\n\nLeonard Gingerella, clinical professor of entrepreneurship at Loyola University Chicago\u2019s Quinlan School of Business, said it\u2019s important to establish expectations and benchmarks ahead of time.\n\n\"If you start with a lie, you're going to end with a lie,\" he said. \"You have to insist on really strong performance criteria.\"\n\nWalter Scott, professor of management at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said managing private contractors, who are doing much of the work on the Affordable Care Act rollout, also demands clear benchmarks and expectations.\n\n\u201cYou are going to get what you ask for.\u201d he said.\n\nLet workers speak frankly, he added.\n\n\u201cMost organizations don\u2019t do enough to protect naysayers, because naysayers make people uncomfortable,\u201d Scott said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to protect them, to honor them. You thank them for their input even if you don\u2019t agree with them.\u201d\n\nJames B. Schein, clinical professor of management and strategy at Kellogg and author of \u201cReversing the Slide: A Strategic Guide to Turnarounds and Corporate Renewal,\u201d said managers must be aware of naysayers who are impediments rather than contributors. They\u2019re easy to spot, he said. They \u201cjust keep bad-mouthing the strategy itself.\u201d\n\nMagoon said leaders can counter this by \u201csetting expectations that people will work with facts of what they know, and not innuendo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdentifying the problem is step one,\u201d he said. \u201cHelping develop a solution is step two. That\u2019s the fun part of any job.\u201d\n\nSchein said leaders must also be ready to step away from preset deadlines and objectives, focusing on the long-term goal of quality and success.\n\n\u201cYou may say: \u2018Take that hill,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be willing to step back as you\u2019re headed there and say, \u2018Oops. Wrong hill!\u2019\u201d\n\nMagoon said that while the Lurie Children\u2019s project was finished on time, he always emphasized quality over punctuality.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to remember if you\u2019re not on time, as long as you get it right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you get it wrong, everybody will remember.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "You are managing a new innovation, with billions at stake and a deadline looming.
