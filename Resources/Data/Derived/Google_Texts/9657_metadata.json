Specifically, narrow networks, offered by many of the exchange\u2019s health plans, are increasing pressure on providers to reduce costs and provide high-quality care.\n\nIn last week\u2019s \u201cRoad to Reform,\u201d we examined what two states were doing to address consumers\u2019 concerns about limited provider networks. This week, \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d looks at how narrow networks are affecting the behavior of providers themselves.\n\nHow Consumer Choice Is Putting Pressure on Providers\n\nAt the 2014 Digital Health Conference in New York City, keynote speaker Ezekiel Emanuel noted that during the first open enrollment period about 85% of exchange enrollees selected either a bronze or silver tier plan. More recent data indicate the trend is continuing in the second open enrollment period. According to Emanuel, that \u201cshows that when people are spending their own money, even with subsidies, and choosing a health insurance product for themselves, that premium is a primary determinant of their choices.\u201d\n\nWhat that means for providers, specifically, is that they have to figure out a way to be included in the networks of the ACA\u2019s silver and bronze plans. Emanuel noted that \u201cWillie Sutton, the famous bank robber, said, when asked why he robbed banks, \u2018That\u2019s where the money is.\u2019 So the question is, \u2018Where is the money in health care?'\u201d\n\nA number of high-profile hospitals \u2014 such as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital \u2014 sought to ensure they were included in exchange plans\u2019 networks, Emanuel noted. Further, he said he believes that the narrow-network plans featured in the exchanges will \u201cset the standard across the industry\u201d and start showing up more frequently in employer-sponsored coverage and in private exchange offerings.\n\nThat could mean major changes for the way hospitals and physician groups run their businesses. Emanuel argued that the question for providers will become, \u201c\u2018How you can you demonstrate you have higher quality, lower cost to get into the silver tier?\u2019 And to get people to select you and be loyal to you?\u201d\n\nProviders Dealt With Narrow Networks Even Before the ACA\n\nAlthough there is plenty of data to indicate that prevalence of narrow networks came about well before the ACA took effect, the exchanges seem to be rife with limited-access plans and the law certainly contributed to their continuing popularity among insurers. With the ACA prohibiting insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and limiting insurers from setting premiums based on an applicants\u2019 age, restraining networks became the best way to control costs, and thus limit premiums. And as Dan Mendelson, CEO and founder of Avalere Health, notes, insurers are offering such plans \u201cbecause that\u2019s what enrollees want, because people want lower premiums.\u201d\n\nNearly all of the attention surrounding narrow networks tended to be on how patients would experience them, particularly on whether they would be angry about not having access to their doctors or hospitals. Even as concerns about narrow networks continued into the second open enrollment period, the focus remained on the effect on enrollees rather than providers.\n\nAlthough some researchers have examined how narrow networks affect providers \u2014 McKinsey, for example, looked at \u201c[w]inning strategies for participating in narrow-network exchange offerings\u201d \u2014 several experts and health policy research groups told California Healthline the issue wasn\u2019t on their radar yet.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Future for Providers and Narrow Networks?\n\nNarrow-network plans still make up a relatively small portion of the market, and it might be too soon to tell the specific effects on providers.\n\nAccording to Mendelson, although narrow network plans make up the fastest-growing portion of the individual market, they represent a \u201ctiny\u201d portion of the overall market. Further, such plans are being featured across all tiers of exchange coverage, not just in the bronze and silver plans, he pointed out.\n\nThere may also be a reason why many high-profile providers have been left out of certain plans\u2019 networks. Mendelson noted that \u201cthe premier cancer centers \u2014 like Sloan Kettering \u2014 are virtually all excluded from these networks.\u201d He said such providers are costly and so high profile that if insurers were to include them in their networks, they \u201cwould run the risk of attracting a high number of people with cancer\u201d to their plans.\n\nMendelson also said the focus should be less on the networks and more on other facets of the plans. \u201cPayers and providers are putting together all sorts of novel relationships,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHowever, it\u2019s more about pay for quality than it is about narrow networks. There\u2019s a lot of contracting change going on, but it\u2019s more about quality, and making sure people aren\u2019t getting readmitted.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, research indicates that the trend of narrow networks is not likely to end anytime soon. According to a McKinsey analysis, narrow network plans made up 48% of all exchange plans in 2014. Further, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation last fall found that insurers were expected to further limit networks in their 2015 exchange offerings. With exchange enrollment meeting or exceeding federal officials\u2019 goals, experts see no reason why that trend won\u2019t continue.\n\nToo Soon To Tell?\n\nFor his part, Emanuel acknowledged that it might be too early to truly tell the effects of narrow networks on providers.\n\nOne thing Mendelson pointed out might be indicative of what\u2019s to come. When asked about the effect on providers of these types of plans, he said, \u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t matter much now that they\u2019re excluded.\u201d That \u201cnow\u201d could be significant. When pressed, he acknowledged that it is tough to predict the future.\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s tax \u2018headache.\u2019 The Washington Post\u2018s \u201cWonkblog\u201d examines how this year\u2019s tax season could become a problem for ACA supporters.\n\nFine for me, thanks. Many U.S. residents are deciding to forgo health care coverage and instead face fines under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. Indiana\u2019s WANE.com looks at how many people will do so and some of their reasons.\n\nSuccess means failure. The not-for-profit cooperative insurer CoOpportunity Health was a great success, enrolling more than 120,000 consumers in Iowa and Nebraska. However, with these enrollees came higher-than-anticipated medical costs, which ultimately led to the insurer calling it quits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While most of the focus on narrow networks in the Affordable Care Act's exchange plans has been on how they affect consumers, some health policy insiders have begun considering the impact of such plans on providers.
