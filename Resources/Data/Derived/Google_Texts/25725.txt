The potential impact is difficult to overstate. High-risk groups include children, senior citizens and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, as well as people undergoing complex surgeries, dialysis and certain transplants. The concern has become so acute that The American Academy of Pediatrics is now advising doctors to avoid prescribing antibiotics as a first-round treatment for infants and young children suffering from ear infections.

The more frequently antibiotics are used, the more rapidly bacteria mutate to develop immunity. Virtually all – 97% of doctors -- expressed concern about these “superbugs,” according to a new Consumer Reports National Research Center survey of 500 family practice and internal medicine physicians in the U.S. who regularly prescribe antibiotics.

Most of the physicians surveyed (85%) reported that one or more of their patients had been diagnosed with a presumed or confirmed case of a multi-drug resistant bacterial infection in the past twelve months. More than one-third of those (35%) reported that a patient had suffered significant complications from the illness – or died.
