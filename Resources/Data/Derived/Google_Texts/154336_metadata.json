When #OneLuckyGuy Tommy Chong failed to go along with the script, co-host Kennedy came up with a novel pretext to malign Obama: He knows too much about the threats against our country.\n\nChong had earlier nicely foiled the co-hosts efforts to get him to go along with their Gruber-gate attacks on ObamaCare. He thwarted their efforts again in this segment.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of the hosts trying.\n\nCo-host Harris Faulkner \u201casked\u201d Chong about the freedom study, \u201cI\u2019m wondering, is there anything that you sense in the last 4-6 years that are changing?\u201d and when Chong said things have gotten worse, Faulkner pressed: \u201cIf you could talk to the president, what would you tell him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him he\u2019s doing as good (a) job\u2026 as he could do,\u201d Chong replied.\n\nOops, not what they wanted to hear. Faulkner pressed again: \u201cBut on this particular issue you think?\u201d\n\nAgain, Chong scotched their plans: \u201cWell, you know it\u2019s tough to second guess \u2013 they know more than we do. The national security advisors and everything else. We just get third-hand information. \u2026And so we don\u2019t know what threats and everything else\u2026\u201d\n\nSo Kennedy interrupted: \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s the problem, is they know too much. And you know, we sort of allow them to limit our freedom in order to feel more safe but it doesn\u2019t necessarily make us more safe.\u201d\n\nNow I agree that it\u2019s possible there has been an over-reaction to threats (though Fox is a prime suspect in the over-reaction department) but accusing our president of knowing too much?\n\nI can just imagine what she and her Fox co-hosts would say if, God forbid, a terror attack should occur and President Obama said, \u201cOh, I only spend a certain amount of time learning about threats. Otherwise, I might overreact and over-limit our freedoms.\u201d\n\nBy the way, this is far from the first preposterous thing Kennedy has said on Outnumbered. We also noted how she previously accused Obama of \u201cstrategizing on behalf of\u201d ISIS. She has also plumbed the depths of her music and talk radio resum\u00e9 to diagnose Obama as having as-yet undiagnosed mental problems.\n\nWatch it below, from yesterday\u2019s Outnumbered.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "u3O6Oq8DA/psDUrQuusP+i9L3UdNt/e1Eo+yFhRIH2k=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_s_kennedy_attacks_president_obama_for_knowing_too_much_about_national_security_threats_11202014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox\u2019s Kennedy Attacks President Obama For Knowing Too Much About National Security Threats"}, "Title": "Fox\u2019s Kennedy Attacks President Obama For Knowing Too Much About National Security Threats"}, "article_summary": "Yesterday, Fox\u2019s Outnumbered co-hosts actively worked to blame President Obama for the results of a study showing that Americans feel less free and safe than those living in other countries.\n\u2026And so we don\u2019t know what threats and everything else\u2026\u201dSo Kennedy interrupted: \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s the problem, is they know too much.\nChong had earlier nicely foiled the co-hosts efforts to get him to go along with their Gruber-gate attacks on ObamaCare.\nWhen #OneLuckyGuy Tommy Chong failed to go along with the script, co-host Kennedy came up with a novel pretext to malign Obama: He knows too much about the threats against our country.\nShe has also plumbed the depths of her music and talk radio resum\u00e9 to diagnose Obama as having as-yet undiagnosed mental problems."}
