Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, stated in the release. \u201cIt is a shame that the Community has had to file a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in order to make sure that veteran care is fully reimbursed under the law. Through this lawsuit we hope that we can secure the ability to provide more services for veterans who choose to receive their care through Gila River Health Care. Every veteran deserves quality health care. They risked their lives for us, and providing quality health care is the least we can do for them.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became law and included \u201cspecific provisions designed to improve health care access, delivery and choice for veterans, by requiring the VA to reimburse Indian tribes for Veterans who choose to receive service at a tribal health care facility,\u201d the release stated.\n\n\u201cThe ACA is clear that if an eligible veteran chooses to receive health care services through an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the VA must reimburse the cost of the services provided. This requirement is a key to ensuring that eligible veterans will have the health care choices they are entitled to. Despite the plain and mandatory language of the ACA, the VA has refused to provide reimbursements called for under the ACA, unless Indian tribes and tribal organizations agree to conditions and limitations that are not prescribed by law.\n\n\u201cBecause of the VA\u2019s refusal to follow the law and their insistence that tribes waive their legal rights in writing, the Gila River Indian Community has decided to seek enforcement of these legal rights in federal court,\u201d tribal officials said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Gila River Indian Community and Gila River Health Care filed suit this week in the Federal District Court of Arizona on behalf of veterans who are eligible for health care services through the Veterans Administration and through Community health care programs.", "og": {"site_name": "East Valley Tribune", "description": "The Gila River Indian Community and Gila River Health Care filed suit this week in the Federal District Court of Arizona on behalf of veterans who are eligible for health care services through the Veterans Administration and through Community health care programs.", "title": "Gila River Indian Community files lawsuit against VA", "url": "http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/article_fb2b3a10-f37c-11e5-8a3f-2b811e9d3f4c.html", "image": {"width": 202, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eastvalleytribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/3a/63a82eb8-f37d-11e5-ba86-9f38e3bde5fe/56f6cfe38b9ff.image.jpg?resize=202%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@evtnow", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,100006692256060,1527006887", "app_id": 148566918492476}, "keywords": "top_story", "news_keywords": "top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e86\"", "article_summary": "The Gila River Indian Community and Gila River Health Care filed suit this week in the Federal District Court of Arizona on behalf of veterans who are eligible for health care services through the Veterans Administration and through Community health care programs.\n\u201cAccess to quality health care is critical for every veteran who has served our country,\u201d Stephen R.
