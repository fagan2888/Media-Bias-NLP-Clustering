Around 200 people lined up for hours outside Best Buy in west Wichita on Thanksgiving to score the best deals on home entertainment, appliances, phones and computers.

"We came at 7:30 last night then we went home because it was too cold," said friends Trai, Jonah and Casey. "There was nobody here either. So we were like, we're going to go home, come back in the morning. We got here, we were 16, 17, 18 and we're fine with that."

Once doors opened at 5 p.m., things remained calm inside. WPD officers were on hand to keep the crowds under control, and employees handed out tickets for the most in-demand items while people were still in line.

"We come in, we stagger everybody, get them lined up and move them right along," said Jim Forest, the store's assistant manager of sales.

"I thought it was going to be more crazy," said Donovan Baughman. "But maybe because they're opening earlier, it's not as crazy. But I thought it was going to be more. I was kinda disappointed actually."

This is the earliest the store has ever opened for Black Friday. Some shoppers are happy about the change, others say the Black Friday hours are becoming a bit ridiculous.

"It's probably going to be at 2 next year, then noon, then Wednesday, then it's going to be the weekend," said Trai, Jonah and Casey.

"It kinda takes away from Thanksgiving I think," Baughman said.

"I don't know that I'd want to do anything else," Forest said. "You kinda get used to it after awhile and like the excitement."

"I like it because I don't want to get up early [on Friday]," Jennifer Prewitt said.

The hottest item Thursday was the 50 in. Panasonic TV on sale for $200. It sold out before doors even opened because of the ticket system. Best Buy will remain open until 1 a.m. Then it will open again at 8 a.m. Friday for more deals.
