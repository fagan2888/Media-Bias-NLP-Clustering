I didn't make it fail, so I don't think they should have any reasons to hate me.\"\n\nIn fact, Adriana has no personal opinion about Obamacare one way or another, and has no immediate intentions to sign up for it.\n\nThe photo has since been taken down, but the Department of Health and Human Services told ABC News it wasn't because Adriana asked to have it removed.\n\n\"Healthcare.gov is a dynamic website,\" a spokesperson is quoted as saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDynamic maybe, but certainly dysfunctional, and definitely disappointing.\n\nFor her part, Adriana is just happy the focus is back on the site itself rather than the \"vaguely ethnic smiling woman\" (per Stephen Colbert) on its homepage.\n\n\"Now I laugh about it,\" she says. Thanks, Obamacare!\n\n[screengrabs via ACA, ABC News]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "HealthCare.Gov, Obamacare, Health care, Glitch Girl, Mystery, Stock Photography, Gawker", "author": "Neetzan Zimmerman", "og": {"site_name": "Gawker", "description": "Since the October 1st launch of the Affordable Care Act website there has been no Frequently Asked Question more frequently asked than &quot;who is that girl?&quot;", "title": "Revealed: Obamacare Website's 'Mystery Girl' Is Not a US Citizen", "url": "http://gawker.com/revealed-obamacare-websites-mystery-girl-is-not-a-us-c-1463580967", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--abcuaWRp--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/196897vsvdh8jpng.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since the October 1st launch of the Affordable Care Act website there has been no Frequently Asked Question more frequently asked than &quot;who is that girl?&quot;", "title": "Revealed: Obamacare Website's 'Mystery Girl' Is Not a US Citizen", "url": "http://gawker.com/revealed-obamacare-websites-mystery-girl-is-not-a-us-c-1463580967", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--abcuaWRp--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/196897vsvdh8jpng.png", "site": "@gawker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Di2kTRut--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/my2vnuuejg3jt9yqbx3z.png", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"app_id": 447084078690870}, "dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-621051396171a9ade757cbbd77315ea6.css", "keywords": "HealthCare.Gov, Obamacare, Health care, Glitch Girl, Mystery, Stock Photography, Gawker", "google-site-verification": "PMODv5fOfI_I6GRn06P6uDSnTPLgipc_fgkmh7EgXyw", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--GHGgxH7j--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/my2vnuuejg3jt9yqbx3z.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "description": "Since the October 1st launch of the Affordable Care Act website there has been no Frequently Asked Question more frequently asked than &quot;who is that girl?&quot;"}, "article_summary": "Since the October 1st launch of the Affordable Care Act website there has been no Frequently Asked Question more frequently asked than \"who is that girl?\"\nThe photo has since been taken down, but the Department of Health and Human Services told ABC News it wasn't because Adriana asked to have it removed.\nSponsored\"I mean, I don't know why people should hate me because it's just a photo,\" she told ABC.\nAdvertisementAfter reaching out to a \"contact\" at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Adriana was told the photoshoot would be arranged if she agreed to let the resulting portraits be used to promote Obamacare.\nIn fact, Adriana has no personal opinion about Obamacare one way or another, and has no immediate intentions to sign up for it."}
