They love to rob gringos there, you know.\u201d I guess they pictured \u201cbanditos\u201d crouched in the bushes ready for ambush around every bend in the road. It\u2019s worth mentioning this seemed to be their view of all of Latin America, Asia, and most of Europe.\n\nThe 24-hour media machine fuels this \u201cfear of elsewhere.\u201d Footage of revolutions in the streets and masked gunmen stalking the jungle makes for good TV. Footage of people peacefully and cheerfully going to the market, relaxing on their porch of an evening, and doing the sorts of things normal daily life brings, well, that\u2019s not going to attract the TV news crews, is it?\n\nYes, bad things are happening in the world right now\u2014some of them maybe down the street from you\u2014but they\u2019re certainly not happening in most places.\n\nI felt safe from the moment I stepped off the plane in Costa Rica. It\u2019s not that back home in Florida I felt unsafe exactly. I lived in a nice neighborhood. And I take the view that most people are decent human beings\u2014 not criminals. They\u2019re just going about their lives, working, spending time with family, and all that.\n\nBut when I lived in Florida I long stopped being surprised to read in my local paper that the gas station I stopped by for coffee in the mornings had been robbed and a clerk shot for the few bucks in the register\u2026or that a dispute over party noise led to a shooting a few blocks away.\n\nThat culture of violence gave the whole place an air of menace somewhat. I certainly never honked at anyone in traffic for fear of an armed road rager taking a shot at me\u2014an all too common occurrence. It\u2019s worth mentioning that many people I\u2019ve spoken with in my overseas travels are actually a bit afraid of traveling to the U.S. They\u2019ve seen the news. And it\u2019s no surprise that in their view school shootings are an everyday occurrence and every argument is settled with a weapon.\n\nThe fear the media manufactures adds to our very natural human fear of the unknown\u2014something every expat has overcome. To take the step of moving overseas is an act of bravery. There are the niggling doubts, the questions over \u201cwhat if\u2026\u201d but I can tell you this much: You\u2019re far more likely to meet expats whose biggest regret is not having made the move sooner than those who regret having gone in the first place.\n\nI feel very safe in Costa Rica. And from my conversations with my fellow International Living editors and correspondents in Malaysia, Mexico, Spain, and other far-flung corners of the globe, I know they feel safe, too. They wouldn\u2019t live there otherwise. In rural areas, especially, you\u2019ll find that the fabled 1950s sense of community, respect for the older generation, and civil way of interacting with each other is alive and well in most of the country\u2019s we cover. In the semi-rural Central Valley where I live all my neighbors families have lived there for generations. Everybody knows everybody. No criminal outsider could penetrate this tight-knit community.\n\nViolent crime is rare. When it exists it is primarily violence among bad people: gang members and drug cartels\u2026people who have chosen that life. Most local people and foreign residents aren\u2019t affected.\n\nWhat you have to concern yourself with primarily is \u201cpetty\u201d crime: pickpockets, home break-ins while you\u2019re away, somebody walking away with a bag left on the beach or the backseat of your car. And usually this is focused in the big cities and heavy tourist areas with transient populations. The \u201cbad guys\u201d know the foreigners have laptops, smartphones, and fancy cameras and lots of cash.\n\nThis is a tiny fraction of the population. The vast majority are hard-working, good people, and would never do anything illegal. But you do take precautions. I\u2019m wary of the scruffy gentleman offering to \u201chelp\u201d me carry my bag at the downtown bus station. I don\u2019t leave my laptop visible in my car, ever. I don\u2019t leave my iPhone on the table when I go to the bathroom in a beachfront restaurant. I don\u2019t dangle my big camera around my neck in big cities\u2014it stays in the bag until I\u2019m ready to snap a photo. Basically thieves are looking for crimes of opportunity. Just as they are in the U.S. And the best way to prevent being a victim is take away that opportunity. Doing so is usually pretty easy.\n\nWhen you visit Latin America you might see bars on the windows, tall fences, and safes used for valuables. The purpose is simple: take away the opportunity.\n\nKeep in mind that police departments in the developing world are usually underfunded and not well-equipped. Banks, supermarkets, malls, parking lots often have security guards. It\u2019s all about prevention. And it works.\n\nNo place is crime-free. But I\u2019m more than willing to take my chances in most of the world. Sure, I keep my wits about me. In Costa Rica you won\u2019t only find a great quality of life with a lower-cost of living, nice weather and beautiful scenery\u2026you\u2019ll find safe places, friendly people, and a secure life overseas.\n\nGet Your Free Costa Rica Report Here:\n\nLearn more about Costa Rica and other countries in our daily postcard e-letter.
