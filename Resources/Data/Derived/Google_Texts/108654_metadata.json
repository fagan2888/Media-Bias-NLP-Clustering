As one YouTube commenter put it, \u201cPrior to this Obamacare-style coffee, the coffee shops weren\u2019t bankrupting you with coffee bill copays and/or declining your coffee coverage due to preexisting caffeine conditions.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s essential health benefits aren\u2019t causing insurance to jump from $5 a month to more than $700. Also, the minimum penalty to not carry insurance in 2014 is $95 \u2014 not $500 as the video states.\n\nThe video, produced by the conservative website The Federalist Papers, may not raise the level of debate on the ACA. But for more information on health insurance under the ACA, feel free to visit Healthcare.gov, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the American Medical Association, or a number of other sources.\n\nHere is some MedPage Today coverage on the ACA\u2019s essential health benefits and expected out-of-pocket costs because of the law.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable care act,buying coffee,obamacare,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/coffee-care.jpeg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Space Coast Daily is Brevard's own social community news platform with the latest in news, articles, events, obituaries and more.
