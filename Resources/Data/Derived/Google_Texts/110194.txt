Cavey sets school record in the high jump, BHS girls sweep the 100 hurdles

BERTHOUD — There's no place like home, especially in the world of sports.

A familiar setting is always an advantage, and gone are those uncomfortable bus rides before the heat of competition.

But not all track and field athletes get the privilege of hosting their own meet. So perhaps that's why Berthoud always seems to excel at the Max Marr Spartan Classic.

The BHS girls came up just 1.5 points short of Eaton in the final team standings at its annual home meet Saturday — a painfully close margin for sure (114.5-113). But other than that, the Spartans played the role of hosts quite well, winning four individual events and breaking some records along the way.

The Berthoud boys showed off some of their immense potential with plenty of podium finishes to place fourth with 53 points, just short of third-place Eaton (59) and behind runner-up Broomfield (63) and first-place Greeley Central (84).

And as usual, the meet ran smoothly, even ahead of schedule at times, a product of all the hard work of those involved, BHS coach Colby Schultz said.

"This is always a really neat meet for us because we get to see our kids perform at home, and they always enjoy that," Schultz said. "We also get to see how involved the community is. We couldn't do it without all the parent help and the community help. That's fun to see them want to be that involved."

Senior Kiah Leonard won two events, breezing her way to the 1,600 title in 5:27.85 before turning around and winning the 800 in 2:30.11, passing Broomfield's Melissa Kelly down the final stretch to win by just .53 seconds.

The BHS girls also racked up a ton of points early by dominating the 100 hurdles. Junior Alyssa Strong led a 1-2-3 Spartans' finish in the event that also included teammates Emily Voll and Kelly Chamberlain.

And for the second straight Spartan Classic, Josie Spitz won the girls pole vault, topping Poudre's Mia Moret in a jumpoff by clearing 10-9 to set a meet record.

Spitz didn't quite match her personal- and school-record of 11-1 that she set a month ago at the Windsor Invitational, a mark that ranks third in 4A. However, the junior has struggled a bit since, so Saturday's performance was important in that she feels it got her headed in the right direction again.

"I felt really good because lately I've been kind of low, just kind of plateauing and going downhill instead of going up," Spitz said. "So it's good to get some higher jumps in and get some attempts at 11-3. I got super lucky that we went to a jumpoff and I got to go up to 11-3."

Another record fell in the girls high jump, where BHS junior Kristina Cavey cleared 5-3. That placed her second at the meet behind Lauren Russell of Evergreen, but it set Cavey alone atop the school's all-time list after she was tied with two others at 5-2.

Cavey suffered a knee sprain during basketball, so her track season started a little slow. But based on Saturday she appears to be rounding into form at just the right time with conference and state not too far ahead.

"I'm probably stronger now that I was before just from lot of physical therapy and a lot of rebuilding all the muscles," said Cavey, who cleared 5-3 on her first try. "It was pretty awesome (to set the school record). It was definitely one of my goals. It's just been a great season so far, and I really want to get 5-4."

Senior Luke Spitz led the BHS boys individual performances with a second-place finish in the 3,200 at 10:26.76, a couple weeks after setting the school record in the event at the Longmont Invite.

In the discus, junior Max Bump set a personal best with a toss of 131-4 to place third, behind runner-up Reese Moellenhoff of Loveland and top performer Garrett Coalson of Eaton.

Competing a home was a nice advantage for Bump, who's still getting back in the swing of things after missing last season because of surgery.

"It's all technique for us. A lot of it is just posture and confidence," said Bump, who also finished sixth in the shot put. "I'm so much more comfortable (at home). I know what to expect here. I know what I've hit in these rings, so it's nice to be able to actually throw in those rings and see those marks catch up."

A pair of freshmen also showed their immense potential for the BHS boys, as Wyatt Woodrick finished third in the long jump with a leap of 20-4 and Cally Castles scored in both the triple jump (sixth) and high jump (eighth).
