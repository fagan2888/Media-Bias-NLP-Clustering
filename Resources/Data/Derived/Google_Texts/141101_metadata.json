Baldwin wondered about whether or not they had a double standard since Behar had disapprovingly asked Donald Trump why he talked about Fiorina\u2019s face instead of her brains, in reference to comments he made about her for Rolling Stone when he appeared on the show.\n\nAfter some initial discussion about the campaign and what Fiorina is focusing on, Goldberg turned to the issue of humor and the comments that were made on the October 29 show.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be lots of comics saying lots of different things and I wondered, because we saw that you were a little upset about us, about a comic comment that was made,\u201d said Goldberg, \u201cand so how will you steel your skin \u2026 Do you know what I mean? How will you get a thicker skin to accept some of the humorous things that will be said about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you meant your comment about my face being demented and a Halloween mask as humorous, so be it,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cI guess you misinterpreted Donald Trump\u2019s comments about my face and thought those were not humorous, you sort of took him to task. But the point is, I have a real thick skin.\u201d\n\nFiorina\u2019s response didn\u2019t sit well with Behar who jumped in and tried to defend herself by saying that she has made plenty of jokes about Hillary Clinton\u2019s pantsuits and Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life, and therefore didn\u2019t understand \u201cwhy any politician should be exempt from my comedic jokes.\u201d\n\nMaking fun of Hillary\u2019s pantsuits isn\u2019t exactly the same as cracking jokes about Fiorina\u2019s face, so I fail to see the logic there.\n\nFiorina got the last laugh, though, when Paula Faris said that she was making money off of her feud with The View, calling it \u201cmaking lemonade out of lemons.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so you guys are telling me that you guys are lemons?\u201d Fiorina said, earning applause from the hosts for her witty response.\n\nThe attacks on Fiorina\u2019s looks weren\u2019t comedy, but rather an attempt by Behar and company to take her down just in case she does win the Republican nomination, because they know that she would indeed be Hillary\u2019s worst nightmare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina extracted a little revenge Friday\u00a0on The View after her looks were criticized following\u00a0the last GOP debate.\r\n\r\nOn October 29, the hosts on The View said that Fiorina looked \u201cdemented\u201d and that her face was like a \u201cHalloween mask.\u201d\r\n\r\nThose comment", "title": "\u201cDemented\u201d Carly Fiorina Strikes Back at The View [Video]", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-11-13T05:28:38+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/don-irvine-blog/demented-carly-fiorina-strikes-back-at-the-view-video/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "Bias Watch", "published_time": "2015-11-07T18:21:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T05:28:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.aim.org/don-irvine-blog/demented-carly-fiorina-strikes-back-at-the-view-video/", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina extracted a little revenge Friday\u00a0on The View after her looks were criticized following\u00a0the last GOP debate.\r\n\r\nOn October 29, the hosts on The View said that Fiorina looked \u201cdemented\u201d and that her face was like a \u201cHalloween mask.\u201d\r\n\r\nThose comment", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u201cDemented\u201d Carly Fiorina Strikes Back at The View [Video]"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina extracted a little revenge Friday on The View after her looks were criticized following the last GOP debate.\nOn October 29, the hosts on The View said that Fiorina looked \u201cdemented\u201d and that her face was like a \u201cHalloween mask.\u201dThose comments not only enraged conservatives, but also CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin, who chastised The View for focusing on Fiorina\u2019s looks.\n\u201cI guess you misinterpreted Donald Trump\u2019s comments about my face and thought those were not humorous, you sort of took him to task.\nHow will you get a thicker skin to accept some of the humorous things that will be said about you?\u201d\u201cIf you meant your comment about my face being demented and a Halloween mask as humorous, so be it,\u201d Fiorina said.\nAfter some initial discussion about the campaign and what Fiorina is focusing on, Goldberg turned to the issue of humor and the comments that were made on the October 29 show."}
