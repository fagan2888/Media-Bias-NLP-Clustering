But, are the accusations true?\n\nOne thing about politics in Prescott is that most of the candidates try to run cordial campaigns. They present their own qualifications and strengths, shake lots of hands, knock on many doors, attend endless community events, answer hundreds of questions at forums and debates. While they might disagree on certain issues, they attempt to do so respectfully, without personal attacks.\n\nBut not always.\n\nEvery once in a while, a candidate comes along, and resorts to personal attacks. As Steve Laffey writes in his book, Primary Mistake,\n\n\"Outlandish personal attacks on the campaign trail are usually the hallmarks of desperation. If a candidate is leading by ten points, he doesn't run commercials attacking his opponent's hat size. But when a candidate is behind, clinging to his political career by a thread, the aim of the game is to throw as much mud as he can dig up and hope more falls on his opponent than on himself.\"\n\nAt this time in the election cycle, candidates start sending out mailers telling voters why people should vote for them. For example, Linda Gray, who is running for State Representative, District 1, sent out a foldover pamplet filled with endorsements, testimonials, and her legislative record. Although she's in a primary vying for two seats with three other opponents, her campaign pamplet didn't mention any of the other candidates at all. She spoke of herself, her record and her supporters.\n\nNoel Campbell is one of Gray's challengers. This week, his advertising material arrived in the mail. Unlike Gray's mailer, much of the space on his was dedicated to attacking Gray.\n\nGray has put a response to Campbell's accusations on her website, LindaGray.net. According to Gray, most of what Campbell has said falls into the category of \"Half Truths and Innuendos.\"\n\nWhat to believe?\n\nSometimes it helps to take issues point by point. Below is a summary of what Campbell says in his mailer, and Gray's response.\n\n1. Campbell: Would have voted NO on the ObamaCare Expansion and will work to repeal it Campbell says Gray: Would have voted YES on the ObamaCare Expansion Gray responds: She did vote to cut all adults without minor children off Medicaid. She would have supported Medicaid expansion in order to preserve rural hospitals. However, she is opposed to the Affordable Care Act. 2. Campbell: Supports 8-year term limits Campbell says Gray: Has already spent 16 years in the Legislature - running for another term. Gray does not respond specifically to this point. In her campaign materials, however, she describes herself as a proven and experienced leader.\n\n3. Campbell: Moved to Prescott 15 years ago, owns a small hotel business. Campbell says Gray: Spent 16 years representing Maricopa County while living in Glendale. Moved to Prescott full-time last year. Gray responds: a) Purchased Prescott property in 1997, moved into the home July 16, paid all property taxes. b) Grew up in a rural community c) Supports local control, received the LEGISLATIVE HERO 2012 AWARD for Dedication to Strong, Effective Local Government by the League of Arizona Cities and Towns; d) Voted NO on consolidated elections 4. Campbell: Opposes Amnesty, wants enforcement of laws, secure borders Campbell says Gray: Joined with Democrats to block a \"slew of good immigration bills\", voted to allow illegalaliens to drive in AZ, to obtain a vehicle title and registration; to gain community college and university admission, and to receive other taxpayer-funded public benefits. Gray responds: a) Voted against SB2611 - Omnibus bill because it contained class 1-misdemeanor penalties for school and hospital employees who gave services to an illegal immigrant. This was against Federal law, would have been an expensive court battle, which AZ would have lost. \"I did not want teachers, doctors and nurses... to be in prison for up to 6 months.\" b) It has been against the law for an illegal to get their drivers' license . c) Voted in support of Prop 300, which prohibited illegals from receiving in-state tuition (passed with 71.4% approval). d) Requested an Attorney General Opinion when Maricopa Community College Board was going to allow in-state tuition for illegals. 5. Campbell: Opposed to any tax increases, supports lower taxes Campbell says Gray: Voted to put $1 Billion annual tax increase on ballot; voted against Taxpayer Bill of Rights; voted with Democrats to allow \"the creation of a new transportation tax for Yavapai County\" Gray responds: Did vote to allow voters to decide on temporary, 3 year tax for education; Opposed initiative to make tax permanent; Never voted against TABOR, because it never came up for a vote; Voted to allow residents of any county to place on the ballot a limited transportation tax. Tax cannot be decided by supervisors, it must be voted on by the people. 6. Campbell: Supports limiting the growth of government Campbell says Gray: Was the deciding vote against a bill to limit the growth of government in 2009 and 2011. Gray responds: I voted against the bills because there was not a provision to be able to pay off debts and eliminate interest payments, thus saving the taxpayer those annual costs. We have become a slave to the lender. 7. Campbell: Supports limited government, pro-taxpayer groups Campbell says Gray: Rated \"Friend of Big Government\" or \"Big Spender\" multiple times during 16-year legislative career. Gray responds: I have been recognized as a Champion of the Taxpayer and Friend of the Taxpayer by Americans for Prosperity. Go to http://americansforprosperity.org/arizona/ to find their website. It is difficult to understand their scoring process. 2008: Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, \"Senator Gray stood up for the taxpayers of Maricopa County by heading off the governor's attempt to shift millions o dollars onto our local budget by sending thousands of state prisoners to county jails. We need more leaders like her who are willing to do the right thing, not the easy thing,\" said supervisor Chairman Andy Kunasek. Linda's supervisor Max Wilson said, \"We applaud Senator Gray for her fiscally conservative approach to addressing the state budget crisis.\" National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) 2010 (last year to run for office).\"Every legislator claims to be a friend of small business, but when it comes time to vote on issues vital to Main Street, mom-and-pop enterprises, Sen. Gray has been a woman of her word time and again. We are honored to have her as an ally and thank her for her stellar 100-percent, pro-small business record in over the last three sessions of the legislature.\" 8. Campbell: Opposes red light cameras Campbell says Gray: \"Pushed for red light cameras\" when she was Chairwoman of the Senate Transportation Committe. Gray responds: \"I was NEVER on the Transportation Committee, much less chair and never sponsored a red light camera bill.\" \"Is this the type of due diligence we can expect from Mr. Campbell if he is not willing to accurately examine the facts?\" 9. Campbell: Lifelong conservative Republican, Veteran, Law Enforcement Officer Campbell says Gray: Supported by liberal Republicans, supporters of \"boondoggles like the the ObamaCare Expansion and Common Core.\" Gray Responds: I believe this community would strongly disagree with Mr. Campbell calling my endorsers and supporters liberal Republicans. To name a few: Congressman Trent Franks\n\nMayor Harvey Skoog\n\nSecretary of State Ken Bennett\n\nSheriff Scott Mascher\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery\n\nJim Waring, former Arizona State Senator\n\nPamela Gorman, former Arizona State Senator\n\nRowle Simmons, Yavapai County Supervisor\n\nJack Smith, Yavapai County Supervisor OR SUPPORTERS: Marlin Kuykendall\n\nCharlie Arnold\n\nSteve Blair\n\nJim Lamerson\n\nBillie Orr\n\nCampbell's Endorsements\n\nRegarding those that have endorsed Campbell, he writes in his mailer, \"Find out why Noel Campbell has been endorsed by conservative leaders, groups and voters...\"\n\nYet, Campbell doesn't name any man or woman specifically. In the mailer, he claims to be, \"Endorsed by the author of SB1070.\" But, he doesn't name that person. Who is he talking about? And on his website, there's a big box on the home page titled, \"Endorsements:\" But it's empty.\n\nThe only entity he publicly names on his mailer as endorsing him is the well-known leader of conservative values, the Prescott Daily Courier. For the record, their columnist, Toni Denis, who is also Chairwoman of the Democratic Women of the Prescott Area, supports Common Core.\n\nA Power Trip?\n\nThis isn't the first time Campbell has attacked Gray. During the debates and forums, many of his criticisms have been based on the fact that Gray has served in the legislature for 16 years.\n\nDuring a forum held at Yavapai College on July 10, Campbell not only attacked Gray on the issue of serving for 16 years in the Legislature, he accused her of being addicted to power.\n\n\"Outlandish personal attacks on the campaign trail are usually the hallmarks of desperation.\"\n\n- Steve Laffey\n\nIt was the end of the debate, and each candidate was given four minutes to speak on whatever they wanted. When Gray spoke, she explained how she decided to run.\n\nLinda Gray said that after she obtained support from local leaders in the community, she replied, \"Okay I will serve, but I don't have any intention of serving another 16 years. Mr. Campbell, I really appreciate your vote of confidence that I could do that, but I really don't want to do that. I will serve. I will go back down and serve you, as constituents, and the legislature.\"\n\nGray then spoke about other issues she would like to address if she is elected.\n\nNoel Campbell, who spoke directly after Gray, started his 4 minutes out by saying, \"Well, I want to address that, Linda. You could have run in your district again, you could have run gone from the Senate to the House. That's a loophole in the law. The term limit law was written by the legislature, but there are loopholes in it. If you serve eight years in the House and eight years in the Senate, you can double back to the House again. You chose not to do that. You chose to come up here to this district because you probably think that there is nobody up here who are a bunch of local yokels and that's just how it's going to be. But I don't believe you. I think you're addicted to power. I really do. For you to say, I'm only coming up here because people asked me. You served 16 years, you got used to people catering to you and doing the things that you want to get done it's hard to give that up. Maybe I shouldn't say that...\"\n\nWatch the video of Gray and Campbell's last comments:\n\nAfterwards, when asked if he meant to accuse Gray of being addicted to power, Campbell didn't back down. \"Linda wants to come across as Little Bo Peep, and say that she was asked to run up here. Listen this is all a calculated thing with Linda. Listen she wants to run because of the power trip. That's my opinion. I could be wrong. I like Linda Gray personally. It's an issue about term limits.\"\n\nCampbell admits he has no record or information that Gray ever promised to run for a limited amount of time. \"...I don't know. I really don't care. I'm just opposed to the fact that she served 16 years. She's a wonderful person, probably a great legislator. I don't deny any of that.\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Campbell replied, when asked if he stands behind his comments. \"I wouldn't make them if I didn't stand behind them. I don't think that what I said is out of line. I think she's a wonderful person. She's a good Christian. And if she wins the election, I'm going to support her as a Republican. But on face value, I really believe it's a power struggle.\"\n\nCampbell has held several jobs in his career, but any for more than 16 years? \"Yes. I had 27 years in Federal Law Enforcement.\"\n\nSo, was that a power stroke for him? Campbell grinned widely. \"Of course it was. I'd still be doing it if I could.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Linda Gray's record and years of service are under attack by opponent Noel Campbell.
