And Related California\u2019s proposal to build a hotel-office complex is stalled primarily because of environmental concerns. The project is slated to be built on a landfill.\n\nThrough 2019, the city expects to be operating in a budget deficit. But because of the Super Bowl, Santa Clara has the opportunity to generate major revenue from the revitalization of an area that hasn\u2019t been tended to in decades.\n\n\u201cThese are critical projects not only for us as a city and identity, but also to bring in the needed revenues to ensure that we continue the quality of life that everyone demands and expects,\u201d Santa Clara Mayor Jamie Matthews said in an interview.\n\nThe delays are frustrating some local officials who acknowledge that Santa Clara needs more hotels. \u201cI don\u2019t want people who are coming to the stadium for an event to look towards another city,\u201d Councilwoman Patricia Mahan said at a recent council meeting. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone coming to town for some major event who wouldn\u2019t want to stay right across from the stadium.\u201d\n\nOther cities who have hosted the Super Bowl reaped the financial benefits. In 2012, Super Bowl XLVI brought in $27 million to Indianapolis purely in entertainment spending, according to research company Rockport Analytics.\n\nOfficials estimate the $400 million, two-hotel complex proposed by the property group led by 49ers legend Joe Montana would earn the city $3.5 million in tax revenue \u2014 more than half coming from hotel occupancy taxes \u2014 and create 600 jobs.\n\nCity Councilwoman Teresa O\u2019Neill said the potential economic benefit of the Montana Group deal would not be enough to fast track the project. \u201cJoe Montana has star power,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he has to present the right business deal. We are not going to be entering into any kind of deal that\u2019s not good for the city.\u201d\n\nThe other development group that is working out terms with the city, Related California, could be even more lucrative. The development company has proposed a $4 billion project that includes a 200-room hotel with office space, restaurants and retail stores. Matthews estimates this project will generate 12,400 jobs and about $11.2 million dollars annually in taxes.\n\nMatthews said this development wouldn\u2019t be ready by the Super Bowl. \u201cWhen the next (Super Bowl) rolls around, we\u2019ll be able to capture more of the dollars within our city.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there are only two major hotels within a mile of Levi\u2019s Stadium \u2013 a Hilton and a Hyatt with 280 and 500 rooms respectively.\n\nJon Gray, vice-president of Research & Insight at Rockport Analytics, said if there are no hotels in the surrounding area, \u201ca lot of tourism expenditures will flow into San Jose and out of the county to San Francisco and San Mateo.\u201d\n\nThe Montana/Lowe Group is hopeful a deal can be reached and for construction to start soon.\n\n\u201cWe have the ability to create a new downtown for Santa Clara, one that is vibrant, dynamic and full of the same energy and innovation that helps define Silicon Valley,\u201d said Jann Diehl, a spokesperson from Lowe Enterprises. She said she hopes the project will have all its final approvals by November 2014.\n\nBoth of these projects are critical to Santa Clara\u2019s future.\n\nUnlike other towns that dot the Peninsula between San Francisco and San Jose, Santa Clara lacks a downtown. The city, sandwiched between Route 237 and Highway 280, is more characterized by modern sprawl.\n\nIn the 1960s, Santa Clara planned to redevelop what little downtown there was but financial troubles stalled the effort. Residents are hoping that construction around the stadium could be the start of a new Santa Clara.\n\n\u201cWe lost our downtown, our sense of identity and our opportunity over time to recreate and reclaim that for the citizens,\u201d said Matthews.\n\nFred Santillan, a resident of Santa Clara for over 50 years, described his hometown as being empty and deserted on weekends with restaurants frequently closed but acknowledges that the future is bright.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the changes coming to this area. I have heard more people talking about the city of Santa Clara now than ever before,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "49ers stadium,development,football stadium,Levi\u2019s Stadium,NFL stadium,Santa Clara,stadium,Stephanie L.
