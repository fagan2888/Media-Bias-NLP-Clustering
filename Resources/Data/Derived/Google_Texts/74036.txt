ALBUQUERQUE — After Colorado State’s 28-21 victory over New Mexico on Saturday, each team’s top receiver — the Rams’ Rashard Higgins and the Lobos’ Dameon Gamblin — posed for a photo together.

There was a good reason.

The juniors were high school teammates for the Mesquite Skeeters in the Dallas area. In their 2012 senior season, the Skeeters were 11-1 before losing to Allen in the second round of the Texas state playoffs. That season, Higgins had 69 receptions for 1,136 yards and 10 touchdowns, while Gamblin had 49 catches for 716 yards and six touchdowns. The Skeeters’ quarterback, Alex Cooper, is a junior guard on the basketball team at Arkansas-Fort Smith.

“He was just texting my phone,” Higgins said of Cooper about an hour after the Rams improved to 6-5. “He was just saying how good of a game that I had and he wished Dameon Gamblin would get the ball more at New Mexico. He was our quarterback and he knows what both of our talents are.”

The option-oriented Lobos threw the ball only 10 times Saturday, completing four, and Gamblin had two receptions for 17 yards. Higgins had eight catches for CSU, for 140 yards.

Pivotal period. A key sequence in the Rams’ victory came when New Mexico was leading 21-20, had first-and-goal from the 10-yard line and had to settle for Zack Rogers’ field-goal attempt of 23 yards, which was blocked by CSU’s DeAndre Elliott. From there, the Rams went on the 87-yard drive for their game-winning touchdown.

Down on the farm. The site of Saturday’s game, University Stadium, is adjacent to Isotopes Park — the home of the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Rockies’ Triple-A affiliate. The strange part is that while the Lobos have a baseball team (unlike Colorado State and Colorado), it plays at another smaller stadium in the same South Campus complex that also includes The Pit, the famous basketball arena.
