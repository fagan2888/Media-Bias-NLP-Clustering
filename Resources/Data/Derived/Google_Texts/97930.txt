In State of Reform’s annual survey of California health care leaders, we asked for honest feedback on how they feel about the future of the health care industry in 2016.

447 market leaders provided us with anonymous feedback on topics ranging from the performance of hospital systems to their opinion on the 1115 waiver.

Surprisingly, 54.4% responded negatively when asked about the increase in consolidation among health care organizations. The recent Providence and St. Joseph’s merger as well as the partnership between Aetna/Humana and Anthem/Cigna were given as examples. Of that number, almost 20% were “very negative.”

Generally speaking, optimism is up. 51% of leaders reported that they feel “somewhat positive” or “very positive” heading into 2016.

When we dug deeper, asking respondents to choose from a list of adjectives to best describe their outlook “challenged” was the top choice (55.8%), followed by “engaged” (33.9%), and “frustrated” (31.6%).

Previously, Peter Long, President and CEO of Blue Shield of California Foundation commented on the mentality of health care leaders during an executive keynote in Los Angeles.

“The thing that I’ve been struck by, in a good way, is the tension between where we’ve come from and where we want to go and managing that tension to determine what is the right path in terms of building incrementally on the investments of the Affordable Care Act and the framework of bringing people into the system,” said Long. “People don’t seem exhausted after five years of the Affordable Care Act, they actually seem energized and ready for what is next.”

One very important development that will cut across work in multiple silos in 2016 is CMS’s $6 billion in funding for the state’s 1115 waiver. We asked leaders to provide honest reactions to the direction of funds. Ultimately, 33.6% reported that they are supportive of investments in community health and the safety nets as a pathway to transformation.

• Kaiser Permanente
