Bob Rankin, R-Carbondale.\n\nRankin\u2019s not sure of his chances of getting the bill through the Democratic-controlled legislature, which convenes Wednesday, but he said he has talked informally with some colleagues across the aisle who share his opinion.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a long way from getting their vote on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect the people who created the logo will put pressure on people to vote against my bill. I don\u2019t look at this as a partisan issue, but, of course, it may become one.\u201d\n\nAaron Kennedy, the state\u2019s chief marketing officer, agreed with Rankin that the issue shouldn\u2019t be partisan.\n\nKennedy, who is part of Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s administration, led a group of prominent business leaders, marketing experts and graphic designers who collaborated to create the logo as part of an effort to brand Colorado.\n\n\u201cI am not a member of the Democratic Party, so this was definitely not a partisan project,\u201d Kennedy said Friday.\n\nState officials in August unveiled the logo and an accompanying slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s our nature.\u201d The logo is a green-and-white triangle with a snow-capped peak sitting atop the letters CO. The state said the peak logo would be incorporated into every aspect of state government \u2014 signs, letterheads, tourism promotion, vehicle emblems, business cards and dozens of other uses.\n\nThe state currently is in the process of transitioning to the new logo, Hickenlooper spokesman Eric Brown said. When departments reorder envelopes, uniforms and such, the materials will come with the logo.\n\nRankin\u2019s bill calls for the state to immediately halt implementation of the branding effort. It also requires the secretary of state to put the issue on the November ballot so voters have a say.\n\nKennedy said the branding effort is intended to save time and money. For example, he said, the Colorado Department of Transportation does about 100 big highway projects each year and used to have a brand associated with each one. That meant meetings to come up with a brand and choose one.\n\n\u201cNow that goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy system.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said 200 Colorado companies have applied to use the \u201cColorado Company\u201d peak badge on its products to show they are based in the state.\n\nWhen the peak logo was unveiled, there were plenty of dissenters, including those who thought it looked like a hazardous sign and those who wanted to use a flag-like logo with the capital \u201cC.\u201d\n\nThe problem with the flag-style logo, Kennedy said, is that in a nationwide survey where people were shown the flag with no other identifying information, more respondents said it represented Chicago than Colorado.\n\nLynn Bartels: 303-954-5327, lbartels@denverpost.com or twitter.com/lynn_bartels", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lawmaker wants voters to get chance to reject Colorado\u2019s new logo", "title": "Lawmaker wants voters to get chance to reject Colorado\u2019s new logo", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/04/lawmaker-wants-voters-to-get-chance-to-reject-colorados-new-logo/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__BN20140103_Z00_BNCD05PCOLOGOp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__BN20140103_Z00_BNCD05PCOLOGOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-04T15:14:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:29:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A Colorado lawmaker who is no fan of the state\u2019s new peak logo wants voters to decide in November whether to keep it.\nThe state said the peak logo would be incorporated into every aspect of state government \u2014 signs, letterheads, tourism promotion, vehicle emblems, business cards and dozens of other uses.\nIt also requires the secretary of state to put the issue on the November ballot so voters have a say.\nJohn Hickenlooper\u2019s administration, led a group of prominent business leaders, marketing experts and graphic designers who collaborated to create the logo as part of an effort to brand Colorado.\n\u201cI suspect the people who created the logo will put pressure on people to vote against my bill."}
