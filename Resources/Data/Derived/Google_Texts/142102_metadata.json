That broke Atlantic City\u2019s previous mark of 63 degrees, set in 2011, and bested Philadelphia\u2019s previous high of 66 degrees, set in 1895.\n\nIn Newark, a high of 64 degrees was recorded, besting the previous mark of 62, set in 2011, and Central Park in Manhattan reached 62 degrees tying previous records set in 2011 and 1923.\n\nNormal high temperatures hover in the low- to mid-40s this time of year, meaning Sunday's burst of warmth could push the mercury more than 30 degrees above what\u2019s typical for late December.\n\nIt would take an exceptional bit of warming to set the record for warmest day on record in New Jersey, according to David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University. The highest temperature in the state recorded in December was taken in Belleplain State Forest in Cape May County on Dec. 7 1998, when the high was 78 degrees.\n\nStill, considering parts of the state reached 70 today, it's not out of the question with a warmer day expected tomorrow, that individual weather stations could hit all-month marks.\n\nDon\u2019t get comfortable with the unseasonable conditions. A cold front is expected to push through the state Monday, and by Christmas Eve and Christmas Day temperatures could fall to normal or even below normal levels.\n\n\u201cIt will just be back to reality,\u201d Iovino said.\n\nModerate to heavy rains could affect New Jersey Monday as the cold front approaches, slowing holiday travel, but significant flooding is not expected.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "nj-weather, weather, news", "title": "Record warmth grips N.J.; all-time December marks could be challenged on anticipated balmy Sunday", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Temperatures could crack 70 degrees Sunday.", "title": "Record warmth grips N.J.; all-time December marks could be challenged on anticipated balmy Sunday", "url": "http://www.nj.com/weather-guy/index.ssf/2013/12/record_warmth_grips_nj_all-tim.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-rainsjpg-f29af48173b60864.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Temperatures could crack 70 degrees Sunday.", "creator": "@sstirling", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-rainsjpg-f29af48173b60864.jpg", "title": "Record warmth grips N.J.; all-time December marks could be challenged on anticipated balmy Sunday", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, December 21, 2013,  7:43 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/StephenDStirling"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 21, 2013,  5:23 PM", "article_author": "Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Temperatures could crack 70 degrees Sunday."}, "article_summary": "That broke Atlantic City\u2019s previous mark of 63 degrees, set in 2011, and bested Philadelphia\u2019s previous high of 66 degrees, set in 1895.\nIn fact, in some places, the all-time record high temperature for the month could be challenged as temperatures could surge into the 70s a day into winter.\nSeveral record high temperatures were set today as unseasonably warm air moved into New Jersey, and on Sunday, virtually every temperature record in the state is likely to fall, according to forecasters.\nA cold front is expected to push through the state Monday, and by Christmas Eve and Christmas Day temperatures could fall to normal or even below normal levels.\nIt would take an exceptional bit of warming to set the record for warmest day on record in New Jersey, according to David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University."}
