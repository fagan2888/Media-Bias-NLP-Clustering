That will include publicly sharing the key elements that make up the pricing of products, seeking input from stakeholders on what would make a reasonable return for the company. The company also said it would not arbitrarily increase the prices of products and will limit increases at no more than the rate of inflation or the consumer price index no more than once annually, if at all.\n\n\u201cOur new pricing model is a commitment to define and develop transparent, responsible pricing for the products we hope to bring to patients in the future,\u201d Cameron Durrant, KaloBios\u2019 chairman and CEO, said in a release.\n\nKaloBios said it would make its profit margin \u201creasonable and transparent.\u201d The company noted that it recently acquired Benznidazole, a drug used to treat Chagas disease, and it would not include research and development costs when it determines the drug\u2019s price.\n\nShkreli resigned from KaloBios after he was arrested late last year on securities fraud charges unrelated to either of the pharmaceutical companies he led at the time. The company filed for bankruptcy in December.\n\nDrug pricing is the top health care concern among voters this election cycle. Drug costs have come under signifiant political scrutiny both on the campaign trail and in Congress. Companies like Turing, also formerly owned by Shkreli, and Valeant have been vilified for drastically increasing the prices of rare drugs that are generally taken by small populations.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in general has tried to separate itself from companies like Turing and Valeant over the last several months, arguing that their actions don\u2019t represent the majority of drug makers.\n\n\u201cDrug pricing is a big concern for all stakeholders in healthcare,\u201d Durrant said. \u201cWe believe that our approach balances the needs of key stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, payers, NGOs, investors, policy makers and advocacy groups.\u201d\n\nCorrection\n\nAn earlier version of this report misspelled Cameron Durrant\u2019s name.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "A lesser-known company formerly led by \u201cpharma-bro\u201d Martin Shkreli on Monday pledged more transparency around drug pricing.
