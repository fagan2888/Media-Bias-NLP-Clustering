In reality, it\u2019s just enhanced screening, routed through five airports:\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that all travelers from Ebola outbreak countries in West Africa will be funneled through one of five U.S. airports with enhanced screening. Customs and Border Protection within the department began enhanced screening \u2013 checking the traveler\u2019s temperature and asking about possible exposure to Ebola \u2013 at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport on Oct. 11. Enhanced sceening for travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea was expanded Oct. 16 to Washington\u2019s Dulles, Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare, New Jersey\u2019s Newark and Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson airports.\n\nThis may be a way to try to achieve something along the path toward a travel ban, which everyone\u2019s embracing, without actually doing so. Two thirds of Americans favor a travel ban, and Democratic Senate candidates are touting the idea despite the opposition of the White House.\n\nAnd about that opposition: Jonathan Last\u2019s basic theory is that the White House\u2019s real reason for not embracing a travel ban is that it would cut against the administration\u2019s immigration policy rationale. If we can stop people from Africa from coming, we can stop people from Central America. Closing the border for any reason undermines their position on traffic across the southern border.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the case. This White House has always been one which solidly viewed every issue \u2013 even foreign policy and public health issues \u2013 through the lens of domestic political priorities. Of course, the logistics and ramifications of the two cases have little to compare themselves. It is far more feasible to stop incoming travel from west Africa than from Central America. Because they can\u2019t leave politics behind, they\u2019re seeing this through a nonexistent frame of racial politics, because only racists would stop potentially infected people from traveling.\n\nA travel ban is not a ridiculous idea, and it shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as such. But is it really necessary or desirable?\n\nIn my view, a travel ban is of debatable merit. Nigeria and Senegal have eradicated Ebola with strategies that included shutting down travel. But there will be a domino effect if the United States takes this action: if we shut down travel, then Europe shuts them down, China shuts them down, and then you have a massive economic problem on top of the health risks. The problem is that there really is no way to enforce a 100% travel ban without enforcing a commercial ban as well \u2013 otherwise you still have human transit.\n\nRight now, people are staying where they are. Despite how terrible things are in Liberia and Guinea in particular, we have not seen mass flight from either country. The normal organic movement of goods and people (which isn\u2019t all that significant to begin with) mostly continues. The average Liberian knows the Americans are there. It seems like things will be okay, so they\u2019re staying in place.\n\nNow consider the psychology of this same average Liberian who awakes one day to the news that he\u2019s living in a global-quarantine zone. What\u2019s a good way to spur mass movements of people? Tell them they can\u2019t go anywhere. People tend to get panicky when they hear that. Whoa, I\u2019m in a global death trap! We\u2019ve been left to die! I don\u2019t feel taken care of any longer!\n\nWhat a travel ban may do is persuade a few hundred thousand west Africans that they need to GTFO, pronto. Where do they go? Abidjan is 200 miles away. Accra is 400 miles away. Lagos is 600 miles away. If they think they\u2019re in a giant quarantine zone, they don\u2019t beeline for America, but they do whatever humans do when they think they\u2019re locked in a dangerous area with a deadly plague. They move. Congratulations, now you\u2019re in circulation.\n\nThat being said, the fears of Ebola\u2019s spread here are different than they are in Africa. There are no epidemiological implications \u2013 we don\u2019t live in a jungle or a tropical shantytown, after all, and we\u2019re talking about a disease that is an unshielded strand of RNA \u2013 it is not airborne and can\u2019t survive sunlight. Once the disease burns out, unless we import African monkeys and take up eating bushmeat and sharing cups with the dead, there\u2019s no disease well and no animal-to-human vector (which is how this whole thing started).\n\nOn the other hand, you could make the argument that the United States, what with its speed of travel and urbanized communities, is actually more conducive to Ebola\u2019s spread than west Africa, which is dotted with small communities that die in place. If they travel at all, they don\u2019t get far before the disease incubates. Americans, on the other hand, can easily fly with symptoms from Dallas to Cleveland and back.\n\nIn our favor, we have sunlight, a non-tropical climate, sloppy RNA transmission, no indicium of airborne virulence, weak primary and secondary virulence, and a high burn rate in our favor. Acting against us: a government health arm with decades of dealing with this bug who have no idea how to deal with it now; a modern healthcare system with enough common sense to quarantine workers; and a bunch of people who were never taught how to use bleach. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the geniuses at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cThis crucial process of learning lessons has been hampered so far by a peculiar attitude that often emerges in our politics in times of crisis and imbues our debates with the wrong approach to learning from failure. The attitude is premised on the bizarre assumption that large institutions are hyper-competent by default, so that when they fail we should seek for nefarious causes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 21 Oct 2014 12:15:53 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Ebola travel ban debate reminds us that the fatal conceit of technocracy is the assumption that dynamic systems like human society are controllable.", "title": "The Pros And Cons Of A Travel Ban To Fight Ebola", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jehjohnsen.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/10/21/the-pros-and-cons-of-a-travel-ban-to-fight-ebola/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The Ebola travel ban debate reminds us that the fatal conceit of technocracy is the assumption that dynamic systems like human society are controllable.", "title": "The Pros And Cons Of A Travel Ban To Fight Ebola", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jehjohnsen.jpg"}, "creator": "@bdomenech", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "airports,Department of Homeland Security,DHS,Ebola,Jeh Johnson,Liberia,Nigeria,pathogens,Senegal,Travel Ban", "published_time": "2014-10-21T12:15:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Ebola travel ban debate reminds us that the fatal conceit of technocracy is the assumption that dynamic systems like human society are controllable."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea5e\"", "article_summary": "Jeh Johnson and The Department of Homeland Security has announced a sort-of travel ban to deal with the Ebola outbreak, or at least a policy they\u2019d like branded as a travel ban.\nTwo thirds of Americans favor a travel ban, and Democratic Senate candidates are touting the idea despite the opposition of the White House.\nThe problem is that there really is no way to enforce a 100% travel ban without enforcing a commercial ban as well \u2013 otherwise you still have human transit.\nThis may be a way to try to achieve something along the path toward a travel ban, which everyone\u2019s embracing, without actually doing so.\nA travel ban is not a ridiculous idea, and it shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as such."}
