Hey Mickey.\n\nChances are you\u2019ve heard that song before \u2014 Mickey, by Toni Basil. And there\u2019s also a pretty good chance that sometime today, that song will pop up in your head when you least expect it. That\u2019s just the way it is with catchy tunes; they get stuck in our heads. Commonly called \u201cearworms,\u201d scientists still aren\u2019t exactly sure why our brains hold onto these songs, but a new study suggests it could relate to the size and shape of a person\u2019s brain.\n\nPublished in the journal Consciousness and Cognition , the study found that the frequency in which people heard earworms, which are commonly called involuntary musical imagery in the medical community, was associated with varying thicknesses in different parts of the brain. Specifically, those who experienced them the most had thicker Heschl\u2019s gyri and right inferior frontal gyri. The former is an area involved in auditory perception and musical memory, while the latter plays a role in pitch memory, CBS News reported.\n\nThey also found that participants\u2019 brain structures were different depending on whether they perceived the music as annoying or helpful toward going about their daily routines. Among those who found it helpful, the right parahippocampal area of the brain larger \u2014 this part of the brain is involved in memory encoding and retreival. The researchers also found these people were better able to suppress the earworms. On the other hand, those who found the earworms annoying tended to have more grey matter in the temporal lobe, where emotions are regulated.\n\n\u201cAreas in the auditory cortex that we know are active when you actually listen to music seem to be physically different in people who are experiencing music that\u2019s not even there,\u201d study co-author Lauren Stewart, of Goldsmith\u2019s, University of London, told New Scientist.\n\nThe study was small, only involving 44 participants. Each of them filled out two surveys: the Involuntary Musical Imagery Scale and the Goldsmith\u2019s Musical Sophistication Index. The first asked them how often they experienced the earworms, how much they moved to them, and how helpful they were throughout the day. The second survey asked about the participants\u2019 music listening habits \u2014 how much they listened to music or wrote it and how often they attended concerts, for example. They then underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans so researchers could see how their answers correlated with their brains\u2019 structures.\n\nThe researchers stressed their study didn\u2019t prove having certain brain shapes caused earworms or their subsequent emotions. Of course, these emotions could arise from a combination of factors, such as the situation a person is in when they experience an earworm \u2014 if they\u2019re in a bad mood, chances are they won\u2019t perceive the earworm positively, and vice versa.\n\nOther studies have also shown a link between a higher frequency of earworms and neuroticism and non-clinical levels of obsessive compulsion. \u201cThese people tend to have more repeated thought processes in general, so it\u2019s perhaps not a surprise that these are reflected in their experiences of mental music as well,\u201d Victoria Williamson, a researcher who has studied the types of music that become catchy, told Science Friday. Perhaps these people\u2019s brain structures affect how they perceive earworms. Further research will determine these answers as well as what exactly causes earworms in the first place. As for how to stop them, just chew some gum .\n\nSource: Farrugia N, Jakubowski K, Cusack R, Stewart L.
