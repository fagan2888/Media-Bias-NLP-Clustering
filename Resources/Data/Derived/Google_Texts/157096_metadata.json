That\u2019s to make room for the pretzel shop, which will open April 26, which just happens to be National Pretzel Day.\n\nIt\u2019s a quick build time, but it \u201cwill open if it kills me,\u201d Tressler jokes of the deadline. And to top things off, all Ben\u2019s Soft Pretzels locations will give away a free pretzel with a minimum $1 donation to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund to mark National Pretzel Day.\n\nThe charity was picked because Ben\u2019s wanted a fund for veterans and because every dollar goes to the families that need it, says Jillian Koeneman, vice president of marketing for Ben\u2019s.\n\nLast year, the Elkhart-based pretzel company raised more than $30,000 for the charity, she says.\n\nAlthough construction on the new franchise location just started, the Chocolate Company has been in discussions with Ben\u2019s for about a year, Tressler says.\n\nBut Mark Tarner, president of the chocolate company, has been a fan of Ben\u2019s for a while. He remembers when the pretzels first came to the South Bend Farmer\u2019s Market, and he\u2019s been eating the pretzels ever since.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better pretzel in the market,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd by buying the rights to open a Ben\u2019s Soft Pretzel franchise, Tarner says he hopes to reach a broader demographic. Currently, the cafe\u2019s biggest customers are families and professionals, but he\u2019s hoping to attract younger customers with the new offering.\n\n\u201cWe would like to make the cafe a little more youthful,\u201d he says.\n\nBut as a franchise business, Ben\u2019s has strict guidelines on how its stores should look, though South Bend Chocolate was granted some leniency in the design for the new store.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a lot, Tressler says, but it\u2019s enough to keep with the cafe\u2019s \u201cold school gourmet chocolate shop\u201d feel.\n\nAlthough the new Ben\u2019s location is owned by the chocolate company, it still means good things for the pretzel company. Currently in South Bend, you can find Ben\u2019s products in vendor stalls at Four Winds Field, the South Bend Farmer\u2019s Market and the football stadium.\n\nNow the company will have a more constant presence in the city.\n\n\u201cThis is our first brick and mortar store in South Bend, we are really excited,\u201d Koeneman says. They also have a location at the University Park Mall in Mishawaka.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning of what we will see from the South Bend Chocolate Company and Ben\u2019s Soft Pretzels partnership. If the Chocolate Cafe location is a success, South Bend Chocolate will explore opening more franchise locations.\n\nThere are also set plans for a joint venture in another part of the state. Market Basket will have more on that in the future.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies\u2019 personalities don\u2019t mix, but this works,\u201d Tarner says.\n\nLaSalle Grill celebrates 25th anniversary\n\nMonday marks LaSalle Grill\u2019s 25th anniversary. The downtown South Bend business will celebrate with a ceremony from 4:30 to 5 p.m. at the northeast corner of the building located at 115 W. Colfax Ave.\n\nLaSalle Grill will also celebrate its 20th Four Diamond Award. Every year, AAA releases four and five star diamond ratings for approved restaurants. Only 2.3 percent of the nearly 28,000 approved restaurants obtain a four diamond rating, according to AAA. LaSalle is one of only five restaurants in Indiana to obtain the rating for 2016, and no Indiana restaurant received the five diamond rating.\n\nThe Carriage House Dining Room & Gardens in South Bend and Artisan in Elkhart were also on the four diamond list.\n\nIn celebration of its achievements, LaSalle will roll back prices on many items on Monday to what they were when the restaurant opened in 1991.\n\nLincoln Wright\u2019s column runs on Wednesdays and Sundays.
