But we all do it. So the question is: Why?\u201d says Paul Breslin, a professor of nutritional sciences who researches sodium appetite at New Jersey\u2019s Rutgers University.\n\nPeople tend to consume about the same amount of sodium no matter where they live, and this amount hasn\u2019t changed much in decades. Those facts hint at the biological basis of our sodium appetite.\n\n\u201cIn biology, if something is attractive and we invest in gaining it, it must be beneficial, adaptive in evolutionary terms,\u201d says Micah Leshem, a professor of psychology at Haifa University in Israel, who spent decades researching salt\u2019s unique appeal.\n\nA 2014 analysis of data that spanned 50 years and dozens of countries (including the United States) found that the quantity of sodium most people consume falls into a historically narrow range of 2.6 to 4.8 grams per day.\n\nAnd then there are extremes: In 16th-century Sweden, for example, people ate 100 grams a day, mostly from fish that had been salted to preserve it.\n\n\u201cOver the last five decades\u201d in the United States, Leshem says, \u201csalt content of commercial food has gone up. But if you look at people\u2019s 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, you see that the amounts of salt people consume have been constant.\u201d\n\nIrrespective of age, sex or race, between 1957 and 2003 Americans have been eating on average 3.5 grams of salt a day.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that we are somehow regulating the amount of salt we are eating,\u201d Breslin says.\n\nAnd, in fact, salt is good for us. Sodium is necessary for preventing dehydration, for proper transmission of nerve impulses and for normal functioning of cells. If we ate no sodium at all, we would die. When they become sodium-deficient, many animals go out of their way to find the mineral. That\u2019s why, for example, sweaty clothes of alpinists tend to attract mountain goats.\n\nSodium depletion can develop after severe sweating, diarrhea or vomiting or, if you are a lab rat, after it is induced by a scientist.\n\nPharmacology professor Alan Kim Johnson and colleagues from the University of Iowa gave rats diuretics and found that sodium-depleted rodents acquired a strong attraction for salted chips. In other experiments, sodium-deficient animals hungrily drank ultra-salty solutions that they would otherwise find disgusting.\n\nEARLY CRAVINGS\n\nOnce sodium deficiency is experienced, salt cravings can last a lifetime. That happens with humans, too \u2014 but only if the deficiency strikes in very early childhood, or even before birth.\n\nIf your mother suffered frequent vomiting in pregnancy or if you lost significant amounts of sodium as a baby (due to vomiting or diarrhea, for example), chances are good that you eat more salt than other people do, even by as much as 50 percent, as one of Leshem\u2019s studies has shown. This is probably because sodium depletion alters our central nervous system so that we develop long-lasting preference for the mineral, Johnson says.\n\nIn one of Leshem\u2019s studies, babies who had low concentrations of sodium in their blood in the first weeks of their lives grew up to be teenagers with a penchant for salt, even salt that is seemingly hidden in processed foods.\n\n\u201cEven if you can\u2019t taste the salt, apparently your body does. It\u2019s working on an unconscious level to condition a preference for sodium,\u201d Leshem explains.\n\nThis makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, says Daniel Fessler, a UCLA anthropologist: If a mother or her infant experiences sodium hunger, it could mean that salt is hard to come by in their environment \u2014 and so it is better to be on a constant lookout for it.\n\nThat is also how humans may have evolved their general liking of salt, Johnson says: \u201cMankind spent a lot of evolutionary history on the hot African savanna where salt was very scarce and readily lost from the body. Since severe sodium depletion can cause circulatory collapse, there was a selection for mechanisms to save sodium and to drive us to consume more of it.\u201d\n\nEating salt may also help calm us, or reduce our stress. In animal studies, the effects are pretty clear. An experiment published in 1995 showed, for example, that when rats are put in stressful situations, they choose to drink salty water rather than unsalted water. In another study, when wild rabbits were stressed, their sodium intake shot up.\n\nThe possibly stress-reducing, or mood-enhancing, effects of salt in humans are not as well documented, but there is some evidence. In a 2014 study involving about 10,000 Americans, Leshem and his colleagues found a relationship between salt intake and depression: Women whose diets were high in sodium were less depressed than other women.\n\n\u201cMaybe people are self-medicating with salt,\u201d he reasons. \u201cBut that\u2019s a small effect; salt is not going to cure anyone of depression.\u201d\n\nBreslin believes there may be another evolution-based reason why we love salt: \u201cSalt accelerates sexual maturation in animal models, resulting in more offspring,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, women from the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, famed for their low salt intake (23 milligrams per day \u2014 less than 1 percent of what the average American consumes), have fewer children than could be expected, and they often miscarry. Yet according to Tilman Dr\u00fceke, a nephrologist at the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, this observation should be taken \u201cwith a grain of salt\u201d because \u201cthe relatively low fertility and high rate of pregnancy loss in Yanomami women clearly cannot be attributed to their very low salt intake alone. This is only one hypothesis among several others, including the higher prevalence of infectious diseases.\u201d\n\nA BODY BUILDER?\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that sodium aids growth. As scientists from New Jersey Medical School found out, if you put rats on low-salt diets, their bones and muscles fail to grow as fast as they normally would.\n\nIn one of his experiments, Leshem found that children in general reach for more salt than adults do \u2014 independent of calorie intake \u2014 which may be explained by the needs of their growing bodies.\n\nFinally, there are a few diseases that can turn a few of us into salt gluttons. About 15 percent of people with adrenal insufficiency (Addison\u2019s disease) \u2014 which can cause weakness, anemia and low blood pressure \u2014 experience acute salt cravings.\n\nIn 1940 the case of a little boy was described in the Journal of the American Medical Association. From the time he was a year old, the boy would go out of his way to eat massive amounts of salt. When he started speaking, one of his first words was \u201csalt.\u201d\n\nDuring a hospital stay (unrelated to his dietary habits), he was put on a low-sodium diet. To prevent him from sneaking around the hospital and stealing salt, he was strapped to his bed. He soon died.\n\nThe reason? Due to severe and undiagnosed cortico-adrenal insufficiency, his kidneys were unable to retain sodium. Only eating huge amounts of salt had kept the boy alive.\n\nYet most of us do not need huge amounts of salt to survive. Just the opposite: About half of humans are what is called salt-sensitive: If they consume lots of sodium, their blood pressure will go up.\n\nBut if we do have internal regulatory mechanisms that tell us to load up on salt when our bodies need it (for growth, for mood improvement or to simply prevent dehydration), does it even make sense to encourage people to try to reduce their dietary sodium?\n\nIt does, Breslin says, but only to a point.\n\n\u201cIf people are regulating their sodium intakes, they are not going to be able to reduce it a lot \u2014 say, by 50 percent or more. It would be like putting someone in a room and cutting the amount of oxygen by half: Your body will try to maintain the level of oxygen in your blood and will make you breathe faster.\u201d\n\nAnd so, as Johnson suggests, when it comes to salt intake, \u201cmoderation is probably ideal.\u201d\n\nCut your sodium intake if your health condition requires it and your doctor recommends it \u2014 but don\u2019t look at salt as an evil that should be banned from your plate completely: There may be valid reasons why your body craves it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/iStock_000050740978_Large.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ba7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut that\u2019s a small effect; salt is not going to cure anyone of depression.\u201dBreslin believes there may be another evolution-based reason why we love salt: \u201cSalt accelerates sexual maturation in animal models, resulting in more offspring,\u201d he says.\nIn medieval times, salt was prescribed to treat a multitude of conditions, including toothaches, stomachaches and \u201cheaviness of mind.\u201dScientists suggest that sodium intake may have physiological benefits that make salt particularly tempting \u2014 and ditching the salt shaker difficult.\nYet most of us do not need huge amounts of salt to survive.\n\u201cOver the last five decades\u201d in the United States, Leshem says, \u201csalt content of commercial food has gone up.\nThe possibly stress-reducing, or mood-enhancing, effects of salt in humans are not as well documented, but there is some evidence."}
