In a word: Obamacare. That\u2019s the answer given by many tax professionals.\n\nPeople who overcame the challenges of Healthcare.gov and succeeded in buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act last year now face a new set of hurdles in the form of daunting tax forms. So do business owners who offer coverage to employees under the law\u2019s Small Business Health Options Program. But the good news for both is that they may receive a tax credit that reduces taxes dollar for dollar.\n\nBarbara Weltman, a lawyer in Vero Beach, Fla., and the author of \u201cJ.K. Lasser\u2019s 1001 Deductions & Tax Breaks 2015,\u201d said it could be a big credit if you qualify for it, but warned, \u201cIt is not that easy to qualify.\u201d\n\nFor qualifying business owners the credit for 2014 is 50 percent, up from 35 percent in 2013. Individuals who bought insurance through an exchange and had household income between $11,490 and $45,960 last year may be able to claim a tax credit on the new Form 8962.\n\nMost people estimated their income when they bought their coverage and received an advance on the credit in the form of payments directly to their insurance company. Now that the income numbers are real, taxpayers may get a refund \u2014 or may owe the government more money.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is extremely complicated,\u201d Ms. Weltman said, referring to the form and the instructions for filling it out. She recommended using tax software with interview questions rather than trying to fill out the form by hand based on the official instructions.\n\nPeople with incomes below $60,000 qualify for the \u201cFree File\u201d program, in which the Internal Revenue Service teams up with various software providers. Information is available at irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, Intuit, the maker of TurboTax software, offers free assistance at TurboTaxHealth.com to help people determine if they are eligible for low-cost health insurance and what the tax penalty will be if they have not bought it.\n\nMost taxpayers \u2014 those with employer-provided health insurance or Medicare or Medicaid \u2014 do not have to fill out any complicated forms. All they have to do is check a box on the Form 1040. A third group of people qualify for exemption from coverage, and they need to fill out Form 8965. More information is available at irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5201.pdf.\n\nLarge employers are required to report health insurance coverage on employee W-2 forms for 2014, but that shouldn\u2019t cause any problems. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Ms. Weltman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not taxable\u201d to employees.\n\nIdentity Theft\n\nIdentity theft is not limited to stealing credit card data.\n\nThieves also use stolen Social Security numbers to file returns and claim refunds, generally early in the filing season. And the I.R.S. said last month that trying to stop this kind of theft is a top priority. It opened 1,063 identity theft investigations last year, it said, and that led to 748 sentences imposed in criminal cases.\n\nPhoto\n\nJulian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., said taxpayers could protect themselves from identity thieves by filing a new Form W-4 with employers and keeping close tabs on quarterly payments of estimated taxes so that they have a balance due, not a refund, when they file their tax returns.\n\n\u201cIf you file a return claiming a refund and the I.R.S. says, \u2018We\u2019ve already received a return claiming a refund and paid it,\u2019 they will investigate,\u201d Mr. Block said. \u201cEventually you\u2019ll get your refund, but it could be a considerable time. If you have a balance due and send in a check, if the I.R.S. has already sent a refund, they\u2019ll have to sort that out, but you won\u2019t have a problem.\u201d\n\nTax professionals have long recommended that taxpayers limit withholding to avoid big refunds simply because too much withholding amounts to giving the Treasury an interest-free loan.\n\nThe Job Hunt\n\nJob search expenses may provide a tax deduction for some people. After all, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent at the end of last year from 9.9 percent five years earlier, and that surely reflects a lot of job searches.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven so, many searchers may not qualify for a deduction, said Greg Rosica, a contributing author to the \u201cEY Tax Guide 2015,\u201d published by Wiley, and a tax partner at Ernst & Young. Mr. Rosica, who leads the firm\u2019s southeast area private client services practice in Tampa, Fla., gave three reasons that would bar many job seekers from claiming a deduction:\n\n\u25a0 These expenses are classified as \u201cmiscellaneous itemized deductions,\u201d which can be taken only if the total exceeds 2 percent of adjusted gross income.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u25a0 Online job searches these days do not generate all of the travel and printing expenses that seekers used to rack up.\n\n\u25a0 The new job must be in the same field as one\u2019s previous employment. Many people change fields to land a new job.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150214100349, "twitter": {"description": "How to handle new forms related to the Affordable Care Act, thwart identity theft, claim deductions for job searches, and other advice.", "title": "Tips for Navigating a Changing Tax Landscape", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/yourtaxes/tips-for-filing-taxes.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003491928"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/business/15-TIPS1/15-TIPS1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/yourtaxes/tips-for-filing-taxes.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003491928", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/yourtaxes/tips-for-filing-taxes.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/yourtaxes", "hdl_p": "Tips for Navigating a Changing Tax Landscape", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 14, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Tax Preparers and Preparation,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Tax Credits  Deductions and Exemptions,Income Tax,Inheritance and Estate Taxes,Health Insurance and Managed Care", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jan M.
