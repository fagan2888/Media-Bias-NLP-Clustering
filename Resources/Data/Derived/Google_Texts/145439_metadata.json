Moocher states.

He also used the opportunity to take a swipe at former Republican standard-bearer Mitt Romney for saying that uninsured people do get treated for medical problems when they visit emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cYou can always go to the emergency room when you\u2019re having a heart attack,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd apparently they think that\u2019s the fiscally responsible option rather than expanding Medicaid, because unlike Obamacare, we all know ER visits are free.\u201d\n\nBut of course the cost of treating uninsured customers gets passed on to paying customers, which raises health insurance rates and makes it more difficult for people to get coverage, Stewart noted.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jon1-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Brent Lang", "description": "Calls the states who are refusing Medicaid expansion, burdens on the system", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "Calls the states who are refusing Medicaid expansion, burdens on the system", "title": "Jon Stewart on Evil Obamacare: Poor People Can Always Go to the ER!", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 614, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jon1.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T20:45:19+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-evil-obamacare-poor-people-can-always-go-er/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Calls the states who are refusing Medicaid expansion, burdens on the system", "creator": "@brentalang", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-evil-obamacare-poor-people-can-always-go-er/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jon1-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jon1-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "Jon Stewart on Evil Obamacare: Poor People Can Always Go to the ER!", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-11T12:03:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Jon Stewart on Evil Obamacare: Poor People Can Always Go to the ER!", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "jon stewart", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Dailies", "tag": "Jon Stewart", "published_time": "2013-10-11T05:03:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T20:45:19+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Jon Stewart on Evil Obamacare: Poor People Can Always Go to the ER!\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/jon-stewart-evil-obamacare-poor-people-can-always-go-er\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/jon1-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"167452\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-11T12:03:00Z\",\"section\":\"Dailies\",\"author\":\"Brent Lang\",\"tags\":[\"jon stewart\"]}", "sailthru.category": "videos,tv,dailies", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jon1.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey are already burdens on the system,\u201d Stewart said.\nWith a sardonic tone, Stewart than took viewers through a tour of the intricacies and insanities of the modern healthcare system.\nAs evidence, he noted that all but three of those states take more money from the federal government than they contribute in tax dollars.\n\u201cYou can always go to the emergency room when you\u2019re having a heart attack,\u201d Stewart said.\nCalls the states who are refusing Medicaid expansion, burdens on the systemJon Stewart slammed the 26 states refusing to accept Medicaid expansion to millions of low income Americans over their opposition to the Affordable Care Act on Thursday\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d calling them moochers."}
