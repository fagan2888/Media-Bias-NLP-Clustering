Win or lose, Broncos fans can expect sunny skies over the Front Range on Super Bowl Sunday.

Temperatures are expected to climb in the metro area to the high 30s and mid-40 degrees, said Kyle Frieden, National Weather Service meteorologist.

The wind is expected to kick up in the afternoon with gusts from 10- to 15-mph.

The northeast plains could see gusts of 30- to 40-mph.

Snow showers are possible in Weld County and northeast portions of the state.

The high country will have high temperatures in the 20s, Frieden said.

“It will be windy all day, and pretty much until Tuesday” with gusts of 50 miles-per-hour above 10,000 feet.
