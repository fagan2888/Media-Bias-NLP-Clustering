Cauthron) [Order this photo] Businessman and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump received strong support from more than 1,500 people who turned out to listen to him speak for more than an hour at the Clay County Regional Events Center Saturday morning.\n\nBusinessman, television personality, author and most importantly -- GOP presidential frontrunner, Donald Trump packed the arena at the Clay County Regional Events Center Saturday before noon, seeking to make his case for why he is the best choice among the Republican field of 15.\n\n\"You're going to be so well represented,\" Trump promised the receptive group if he's elected. \"... Were going to win so much. We'll win and win and win. We're going to win on trade. We're going to do so well with ISIS. We're going to blow them off the face of the earth. We're going to win so much. We're going to win on health care. We're going to get rid of Obamacare and we're going to replace it with something so much better. ... But I say we're going to win so much, in so many different ways, that you're going to get tired of winning. Then I say, I'm only kidding, we never get tired of winning. We win.\"\n\nHe reminded everyone he has family and corporate leaders to run his companies and business dealings while he takes care of the nation's business. And more important, according to Trump, he isn't beholden to any donors. \"Me, self-funding, the only one I'm working for is you folks. I'm the only one. ... Nobody is going to control me except you people. ... This is the big potato. I love this. It's going to be so much fun. And it's going to be easier than you think.\"\n\nThe line for people waiting to get inside the building started forming long before the doors to the events center opened at 9 a.m. By that time, it was hundreds deep. More than 2 \u00bd hours later, after about a 30-minute delay from the scheduled start time to allow the majority of the crowd to work its way through the security check, Trump took the stage before an enthusiastic group following an introduction from former Iowa gubernatorial candidate Sam Clovis. Clovis cited former President Ronald Reagan's 1964 speech supporting then presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. The theme of the talk was \"a time for choosing.\"\n\n\"We're at a crossroads in this country and it's time to choose,\" Clovis said. \"We can continue down the path we've been on for the last 40 years by sending to Washington the same people to do the same stuff and with the same results and you -- the people that have to pay for it and carry the burden.\"\n\nClovis continued, \"It's time for a change. I have chosen to follow an individual who has the will, the courage and most importantly the leadership to go to Washington, D.C., dispense with the special interest, and represent the only special interest not represented there, that's you the American people.\"\n\n\"Who do you trust to get the economy back on track?\" Clovis asked. \"Who do you trust to fix immigration? Who do you trust to get the Untied States back in the forefront of all things in the world so that we lead the way and not from behind?\"\n\nWhen Trump took the stage to Twisted Sister's classic \"We're Not Going to Take It,\" he cited a new CNN poll, suggesting, \"We are killing it. ... But like Sam said before, we can't get complacent.\"\n\nRight away Trump began talking about the Islamic State group, but his conversation covered a broad scope, tackling issues where he feels he has some authority.\n\nAfter addressing the Spencer crowd, Donald Trump spent another 20 minutes working his way around the front of the stage posing for photos and signing autographs for a large crowd.

We've got an enemy that's very vicious, very violent, very sick. And we're going to take them out and we've got to take them out in a strong way.... We don't need people that are politicians that complain about my tone. Jeb Bush said, 'Oh his tone is a little bit tough.' Tough?,\" he said shaking his head.\n\n\"Take Paris. If a few people had guns on their belt, or their shin, in their jacket -- instead of being slaughtered, you might have lost some, you definitely would have lost the bad guys, but it wouldn't have been hundreds of people with many more expected to die, they're in the hospital dying,\" Trump said, calling himself a second amendment guy. \"Then you got to the tragedy we just had in California. Nobody has a gun except the bad guys. The scum. Their scum. Nobody has a gun. Nobody can protect themselves.\"\n\nSpeaking about the couple involved in the San Bernardino shooting, Trump said, \"They got lucky they left. They left because they didn't want to die. There's a whole big hoax. They don't want to die. ... They're chickens**t believe me. They left early because they didn't want to get caught. ... You know what a gun-free zone is? That's like the meat for these killers.\"\n\nTrump said before coming down the escalator at Trump Towers to sign his papers to run for president, he was still deciding whether to make the commitment. \"I just took a deep breath and said, 'Let's do it. We've got to straighten out the country.' It's so bad what's happened. It's so incompetent. We're run by stupid people. They're stupid people.\"\n\nHe cited deals ranging from economic to foreign policy as being blunders in his eyes.\n\n\"So here's our deals, and these are the same deals we make with Iran, we make economically with China, Japan, Mexico. We get Bergdahl, a dirty rotten traitor who's no good and they get five of the biggest, worst killers they have in that part of the world. And those guys are all back in the battlefield trying to kill everybody and us. And that's what we get. That's the way we negotiate. ... I don't know what's the matter. We don't want these people.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We don't run our country actually with love. We're not treating our country right. We're not treating the people of our country right. When you do things like that, you're running it not with love, you're running it with stupidity. You're running it with almost a certain hatred. You're just doing the wrong thing. We don't know how to make deals.\"\n\nTrump cited our import versus export issues -- specifically the devaluation of currency -- with Japan, China and Mexico.\n\n\"We have tremendous power over China economically, but Obama doesn't know that. He has no idea. If we stopped allowing China to do business with us, there wouldn't be a China. There would be a revolution over there. They have sucked the money out of our country -- and out of Iowa by the way ... It's probably the single greatest theft in the history of the world, what China has done to us,\" Trump suggested. \"And you know what, I like China. It's nice ... I have a lot of friends from China and they can't believe they get away with what they get away with.\"\n\nHe noted the world has been using the devaluation of currency to manipulate the United States.\n\n\"Countries are devaluing their currency. China has played it better than anybody in the history of the world. We owe right now China $1.5 trillion dollars. Think of it. We owe them money. They rob us blind and we owe them money. That's like a magic act,\" the GOP candidate said. \"We owe Japan the same thing, $1.5 trillion. ... And what people don't understand, we have all the strength. If we say, 'Look, you're not treating us right. We can't have these imbalances. It's gotta be fair. We don't have to make, but it's got to be fair.'\"\n\nHe explained, \"They see we're all screwed. We have a president that's a rank amateur, doesn't know what he's doing and he's got so many other problems that they can do these things and nobody is going to do anything about it. They're doing things they never thought they could do against us. They're taking our jobs. They're taking our banks. They're taking our money. They're taking our businesses. ... We allow it to happen. Nobody even talks about it.\"\n\nTrump said he has the solution to put America in a position of power at the negotiating table.\n\n\"We want our great, great negotiators,\" he insisted. \"I know them. I know the good ones, I know the bad ones, I know the ones that are overrated. I know ones you haven't even heard of that are better than all of them. ... We have the greatest business people in the world. ... They all want to be involved. ... They all want to help because they see what I'm doing.\"\n\nTrump explained, \"I built a great company, tremendous cash flow, everybody is shocked. I have some of the greatest assets in the world. Unbelievable values, almost no debt -- very, little, little debt -- and I'm not saying that in a braggadocios way because I don't care about that. It's the kind of thinking we need in our country now. We have to have it. ... We don't have a choice.\"\n\nHe called the recently reached budget deal \"horrible\" and made it clear that he doesn't believe Hillary Clinton is the one to fix it.\n\n\"We know where the Democrats are coming from. Hillary Clinton will be a disaster by the way. She'll be a disaster. She doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. You need someone with tremendous strength, tremendous stamina.\"\n\nThe businessman got the crowd laughing as he had a little fun at the former first lady's expense.\n\n\"You ever notice she'll do an event, then you don't see her for like a week. You know what happens? She goes home and goes to sleep. It's true. Then she'll do another event. You don't see. ... Then after three days of negotiating with these guys (the press), she'll ask questions. But it's all scripted. That's not what we want.\"\n\nInstead, he suggested, \"We want strong, quick, we need brutal. ... We're going to have the toughest, the smartest, the sharpest, people you will be so proud of -- you may not like them personally, but who cares? Right?\"\n\nTrump outlined changes the public can expect under his presidency.\n\n\"We're going to end a lot. We're going to end sanctuary cities really fast. The nice part is you don't have to worry too much about sanctuary cities in Spencer. It's almost like a free zone, you kill people but it's OK because you're in a sanctuary city,\" Trump suggested.\n\n\"I'm totally against Common Core, I'm going to end Obamacare, we're going to repeal it,\" he continued. \"Think about Common Core. How stupid is it? You have the greatest parents in the world right here in Iowa. They love their kids. They want to be involved with their kids, with their schools and with their principals; and we're running their schools from Washington, D.C., by bureaucrats.\"\n\nHe began challenging Bush who he claimed is a supporter of Common Core, as well as the others who remain in the GOP race.\n\n\"We have a number of these candidates, like Bush likes it. I don't want to mention Bush because he's gone. He's gone. ... When I started Bush was expected to win. Then (Gov. Scott) Walker was expected to win. Then it was another one that was expected to win. I just went through them like 'bong, bong.' I have plenty of ammunition left for the ones who haven't quit yet. Actually, they just wrote a story about it, everyone that has come against me has gone down like a rock. That should happen for our country.\"\n\nHe chided Sen. Marco Rubio's voting record as Rubio showed a jump in the polls.\n\n\"I'm going to have such an easy time beating him in Florida. To be honest, Bush is doing badly in Florida and so is Rubio. I'm winning by so much, people are surprised.\"\n\nTrump said he was questioned by a liberal journalist he respects regarding the impact he's had even if he eventually loses the race. \"... Unless I win it's just a waste of time. Because I won't be able to do anything.\"\n\nHe claimed that Mitt Romney should have won the last election but failed because he disappeared the last week and failed to inspire the voter base. He doesn't want the same problem and he feels the support he's been getting from strong event attendance show's support.\n\n\"Last night (Friday), we had 10,000 people in Raleigh, North Carolina. The other day in Sarasota, Florida, we had 12,000 people on a very hot day. The people I meet are so incredible. That's what gives me faith in our country. ... We have by far the biggest crowds. And I'll tell you it's love. It's like a love fest. ... The one thing, the enthusiasm that everybody has to make America great again is unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nHe feels part of his appeal is his willingness to speak directly about what's on his mind. That means no teleprompter and speech writers.\n\n\"I'd love to do it, it's so easy. But it doesn't come from the heart and then you can't talk about what happened in California two hours ago or what happened here or there because you've got to get your speech writer to write. You've got to get your consultants to check every thing is perfect. It's not the same. ... This is the way we have to do it. ... We know what we're doing. We know what we're talking about. I can speak from the heart. I know the subject. It's easy because there's such love in all of these places I go. We're all on the same team.\"\n\nTrump continued to list the items on his change list.\n\nLocal supporters started lining up at 8 a.m. outside the Clay County Regional Events Center for a chance to get in and see Donald Trump who was scheduled to speak at 11 a.m. His actual comments didn't begin until after 11:30 as the crowd continued to roll in.\n\n(Photo by Randy M.

We're going to make our military so, so powerful, that we're not going to have to use it. People are taunting us right now because they know we have generals that don't know what they're doing. We have generals on television. I don't want my general on television,\" Trump said. \"We have Obama say, 'I'm sending 50 men to Iraq.' Why? Why does he say that. ... These people have a target on their back. They're being hunted, they're being looked for. If he didn't say it, they wouldn't know.\"\n\nCalling himself the most militaristic added, \"We're lead by stupidity. It's a stupid group of people. I used to say 'incompetent' because it's a nicer word.\"\n\nTrump echoed Clovis' comments from earlier in the day. \"We're at a crossroads. This country has a great chance to be more amazing than ever before. I really believe that. We're going to get rid of the regulations that are driving the farmers out of business. We're going to get rid of the estate taxes that are making a lot of the farmers sell their farms, I understand that. ... It is killing people in Iowa. I know that for a fact.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We're going to cut taxes way down, especially for the middle class and for businesses. We're right now, we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world. We're going to be one of the lowest taxed nations in the world. And the middle class is a big recipient and so is business. And we're going to do things that are going to keep our companies from leaving this land. We're going to keep our companies here.\"\n\nRegarding illegal immigration, Trump repeated his intention to place a substantial obstacle in the way.\n\n\"We're going to build a wall. It's going to be a real wall. It's going to be a great wall. ... And people aren't going to come through that wall unless they come in legally. And if they come in legally, I love it. We'll take as much as we can.\"\n\nHe went on, \"They've wanted to build a wall for years. ... They couldn't pass the environmental test to build the wall. Can you believe this? It was probably a snail, or a turtle or a frog. It's out of control.\"\n\nTrump said the polls show the people believe he is the best man for the job.\n\n\"Every poll says I'm going to be the greatest jobs president. ... In the one that just came out, I lead by massive numbers on the military, on the border, on the economy -- the only thing I don't think I do well on is personality. I think I have a good personality. But who cares? ... It's about the economy, it's about the military, it's about making us great again. We have some nice people. I don't care. We need smart, tough, sharp people because we are being destroyed,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I'm doing it,\" he explained, \"because we can do something that's so unique. We can do something that's going to be so amazing. We can do something that when you remember this meeting in a couple of years from now, you're going to say, 'That was the start of something great.' We're not gong to take this nonsense anymore from these totally incompetent politicians that don't know what they're doing.\"\n\nHe continued, \"You're in the White House. There's so much work to be done. You're there for a period of time. You've got to work really, really hard. ... We're going to work hard. And more importantly we're going to work smart. I'm going to get the most incredible people you've ever seen to straighten out our problems ... And we are going to bring this country to a level that may be higher than it's ever seen before. And we can do it because the people are so amazing. ... We're going to work hard. We're going to work smart.
