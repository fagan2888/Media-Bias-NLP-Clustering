Four of them were high school students on a sightseeing trip to the volcano on the western island of Sumatra, he added.\n\n\u201cThe bodies were in a state where, even though their skin did not peel, their faces were swollen and the tongues were sticking out,\u201d an AFP reporter on the ground said.\n\nThree other people \u2014 a father and his son who wanted to pay respects at the graves of their relatives, and a man who came to the village to check his long-abandoned house \u2014 were also trapped and injured by the deadly clouds, Karo district official Johnson Tarigan told AFP.\n\nHe said the three were in the intensive care unit of a local hospital.\n\nThirty thousand people have been evacuated from the area since the volcano started erupting in September.\n\nBut some residents had returned home on Friday following advice from the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation that houses outside the five-kilometre radius from the mountain were safe.\n\nThe volcano erupted again on Saturday morning, sending hot rocks and ash up 16,000 feet into the air, blanketing the surrounding countryside with grey dust, said volcanologist Kristianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.\n\nSukameriah village is located in the red zone, where human activities are strictly banned, but locals often trespassed the restricted area to check on their houses and belongings as well as their crops, officials said.\n\nNugroho said the evacuation will resume on Sunday.\n\nMount Sinabung is one of 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia that straddle major tectonic fault lines, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nIt had been quiet for around 400 years until it rumbled back to life in 2010, and again in September last year.\n\nIn August 2013, five people were killed and hundreds evacuated when a volcano on a small island in East Nusa Tenggara province erupted.\n\nThe country\u2019s most active volcano, Mount Merapi in central Java, killed more than 350 people in a series of eruptions in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Indonesian volcano kills 14, including 4 schoolchildren", "title": "Indonesian volcano kills 14, including 4 schoolchildren", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/01/indonesian-volcano-kills-14-including-4-schoolchildren/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__p_b05bd325-9fab-4ba3-be0e-c70c15d4c403lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__p_b05bd325-9fab-4ba3-be0e-c70c15d4c403lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-01T07:46:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:43:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The country\u2019s most active volcano, Mount Merapi in central Java, killed more than 350 people in a series of eruptions in 2010.\nKARO, Indonesia \u2014 Fourteen people, including four schoolchildren, were killed Saturday after they were engulfed in scorching ash clouds spat out by Indonesia\u2019s Mount Sinabung in its biggest eruption in recent days, officials said.\nIn August 2013, five people were killed and hundreds evacuated when a volcano on a small island in East Nusa Tenggara province erupted.\nFour of them were high school students on a sightseeing trip to the volcano on the western island of Sumatra, he added.\nThirty thousand people have been evacuated from the area since the volcano started erupting in September."}
