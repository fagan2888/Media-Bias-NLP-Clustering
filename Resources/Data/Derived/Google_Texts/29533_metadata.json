The current contract doesn\u0092t expire for another 22 years \u0096 in 2035.\n\nBut that contract could be the legal key to getting customers of the Central Coast Water Authority to ante up a portion of the cost of the tunnels.\n\nThe Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors has questions about the Bay Delta Conservation Plan and the plan\u0092s proposed twin tunnels, so heavily touted by the governor, and which could cost as much as $54 billion, once interest on bonds needed to get the construction money is added in.\n\nThe Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors held an information session Nov. 5th on whether or not to extend the Central Coast Water Authority\u0092s contract with the state and they also got some input on the pros and cons of the BDCP twin tunnel project.\n\nAfter CCWA Executive Director Ray Stokes explained how the state\u0092s Department of Water Resources wants them to extend their contract 40 more years beyond their current expiration date of 2035, there were a lot of questions as to why. And that\u0092s where it becomes educational to all citizens in California on how local water districts can feel they have a gun to their head with limited choices if they want water.\n\nOne elegantly dressed woman during the audience participation session said she and her husband came to be informed. \u0093I know more now than I ever wanted to know,\u0094 Kay Peterson said, \u0093and I still don\u0092t know anything about it.\u0094 But she thanked the supervisors for \u0093taking the time to inform yourselves. I appreciate that as a citizen,\u0094 she said. \u0093I wish you a lot of luck.\u0094\n\nBoard of Supervisors Chairman Salud Carbajal at one point asked if the DWR contract being able to continue even if they did not renew it bordered on extortion. Another Supervisor, Peter Adam, a farmer relatively new to politics, representing the Lompoc and Santa Maria areas, asked Mr. Stokes point blank, \u0093Are we stuck?\u0094\n\nSupervisors seemed nervous that the renewal of the contract so far in advance might be tied to the twin tunnels. Supervisor Doreen Farr, representing Santa Ynez and Isla Vista (UCSB area), asked Mr. Stokes how he calculated the estimated cost of the BDCP twin tunnel project.\n\n\u0093The current estimate of cost is about $25 billion,\u0094 said Mr. Stokes. \u0093Of that about $17 billion would be paid by the state and federal contractors. Of that $17 billion allocated between the state and federal contractors, that percentage is currently being negotiated. Right now it looks like it will b e a 60/40 split with 60 percent by state water contractors and 40 percent by federal contractors. So out of the $17 billion to be paid by state and federal contractors, approximately $10 billion would be paid by the state contractors. The negotiations, as far as how those costs will be allocated amongst state contractors, is not fully decided, but it is anticipated that those costs would be allocated in proportions to the contractor\u0092s percentage amount (of water used). We would be liable for about $100 million or one percent of the state contractors construction costs.\u0094\n\nMr. Stokes told the Supervisors that his CCWA agency in Buellton is trying to negotiate a 75-year extension to 2110 to avoid \u0093not having to go through another amendment in 40 years.\u0094\n\nSupervisor Farr asked Mr. Stokes, \u0093If the BDCP twin tunnels was not being discussed, would we still be talking bout a contract extension 20 years ahead of time?\u0094\n\n\u0093Yes, because the DWR is going to incur large capital expenditures even without the BDCP (twin tunnels) between now and 2035,\u0094 said Mr. Stokes.\n\nSupervisor Peter Adams asked why the interest rates would be higher if they signed up later?\n\n\u0093Under the existing contract, we, as a contractor, don\u0092t actually pay debt service that DWR issues. We repay the costs at a different rate of 4.61 percent, regardless of what DWR\u0092s bond costs are. So if the DWR would issue revenue bonds at, say 3 percent, we would still be paying the higher interest rate and not enjoy the benefits.\n\nSupervisor Farr jumped in to ask, \u0093If the state would issue bonds that were above the 4.61 percent, would we have to pay the higher rate, or are we protected?\u0094\n\n\u0093True, we would pay the same rate as now,\u0094 Mr. Stokes replied. \u0093We don\u0092t understand all the details of the \u0091evergreen clause\u0092 and how it will operate, but we believe that\u0092s the way those costs work.\u0094\n\nWhen Supervisor Adam asked if they were stuck in the deal, Mr. Stokes said, \u0093You could choose to say we choose not to execute the evergreen clause. However, if DWR exercises to issue revenue bonds, it is an automatic extension to the contract,\u0094 he repeated. \u0093That is a provision of the contract. It is there no matter what.\u0094\n\nMr. Stokes closed by saying \u0093The Central Valley Water Authority Board of Directors is in favor of the extension and feel it is important.\u0094 The County\u0092s Assistant County Counselor Michael Ghizzoni added his opinion that, \u0093We are talking hypothetically of what you\u0092re stuck with\u0094 and hinted there are protections in the state\u0092s 1963 water code that would have to be looked at more closely.\n\nAudience participation\n\nThe first speaker spoke remotely and was broadcast from a TV screen on the wall. He said they are not exactly excited about how much money is being spent on Delta restoration and all the experts.\n\n\u0093We\u0092re not as big an entity as Los Angeles County but the flip side is we don\u0092t have any other supplemental choices for water here. We believe that South Santa Barbara County is even more vulnerable \u0097 the north county especially. Santa Ynez has a huge aquifer. We think they have been wise to use state water. It\u0092s the South County that is more dependent. The final point is we think this has much to do about nothing financially. As staff indicated, it spent a billion dollars on these projects to date. This thing will raise the costs by $5-$10 million a year which is really a pittance literally and figuratively a drop in the bucket compared to how much you have spent. Secondly, once these costs go away, we will see a reduction to about $10-$20 million a year. You shouldn\u0092t think the sticker shock should be a stumbling point.\n\nA CCWA Board of Directors member said it is a class act and working well. \u0093If it ain\u0092t broke, don\u0092t fix it.\u0094\n\nThe next speaker told the Board, \u0093Any time you have a long term contract, that provides reliability and stability in our water supply, it\u0092s very important to look out to future years, not for our generation, but for our children\u0092s children.\u0094\n\nAnother speaker representing Goleta said he felt any action by the Board about BDCP would be premature at this time.\n\nRobert Field, a resident of Santa Ynez, said it is clear there are risks in the BDCP proposal. \u0093I think the one thing missing from all this is to sort out the County versus the purveyors. Who takes the risks and who gets the rewards? The County (of Santa Barbara) has a few check marks on the risk side and none on the benefit side. I don\u0092t represent everyone here, but I\u0092m a resident of the unincorporated county and you are exposing me to risks from individual purveyors who are receiving the benefits. It\u0092s not just me. There are 150,000 of us who will not receive any of the benefits.\u0094\n\nMike Jackson, a Northern California water attorney, said he was there representing the farmers in the Delta, fishermen offshore and a large portion of the environmental movement. \u0093The BDCP doesn\u0092t fix it,\u0094 Mr. Jackson began. \u0093The restoration they are talking about \u0097 the $8 billion was imposed by the environmental movement was green washing \u0097 does not fix the problem. It\u0092s clear that there is no new water. I had the opportunity to sit on a panel with the Los Angeles Metropolitan and Westlands water districts last week. There will be no additional water. The BDCP program sets up a water supply that does not come when you\u0092re in a draught. It has water in it when it is wet but you don\u0092t need it in those years so it doesn\u0092t solve the problems for south of the Delta people.\u0094\n\nMr. Jackson told the Supervisors that Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District water sales are plunging downward. He said the people are finding other sources of water. \u0093You should read the Urban Water Management Plan for the Department of Water and Power for the City of Los Angeles. Take a look at what San Diego is trying to do. They expect to be off State water within the time we are talking about in terms of extending your contract. So the numbers we are hearing now will not be true for a long period of time. The biggest thrust is the taxing authority.\u0094\n\nCarolee Krieger, a resident of Montecito and executive director of the California Water Impact Network (C-Win), is one of the area\u0092s strongest lobbyists against the BDCP twin tunnels. She thanked the Board for previous one-on-one meetings with her and studying her twin tunnels information.\n\n\u0093The mountain of material is an indication of the thorough study C-Win has done to review the complex twin tunnels proposal,\u0094 Ms. Krieger said. \u0093It also explains the profound flaws in this project. This county should be wary of any claims of DWR on the costs of construction for these tunnels.\u0094\n\nMs. Krieger cited a previous local case where they were told the cost for a DWR project would be $271 million, and then skyrocketed to $1.76 billion. \u0093We ask the Board of Supervisors and City Council to stop this boondoggle. Do not renegotiate the existing contract now that are set to 2035. Don\u0092t let DWR snooker us again. Water will always be an issue in Santa Barbara County but here are ways to deal with our water problems like conservation, recycling, ground water, desalinization, and green water harvest. These will all cost money, but not nearly as much as the tunnel scheme.\u0094\n\nNick Di Croce, co-facilitator for the Environmental Water Caucus, said his organization is comprised of 30 grassroots environmental organizations all with common features around California water issues.\n\n\u0093We have intensely studied all the Delta plans,\u0094 he said. \u0093We have gone on public record as opposing the BDCP for two main reasons: The fiction of the benefits they claim [and] the fiction of the recovery of 140,000 acres in the Delta, which is costly and probably not effective or practical.\n\n\u0093I am a Solvang resident. We have some experience of being snookered in the DWR contracts. Please don\u0092t let that happen again,\u0094 he said\n\nJack Boysen, a member of the Santa Maria City Council, told how important the State Water Project is to Santa Maria and Santa Barbara County. \u0093Water is responsible for allowing a much higher quality recharge for the groundwater basin,\u0094 he said. \u0093More important, it improves the quality of our ground water.\u0094\n\nMr. Boysen ended by saying, \u0093The city of Santa Maria begs you to consider the catastrophic economic and environmental impacts by not renewing the State Water contract that we have.\u0094\n\nJoan Wells, a former member of the Santa Barbara Planning Commission for 12 years and a member of the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, said she came to ask the Supervisors to \u0093please put off any contract negotiations that will tie the BDCP tunnels into what you do. I cannot believe there is not some way to continue our current water system supply and our current input into this county without having to tie ourselves going along with the tunnels. Every day I read blogs how the DWR is changing where these tunnels are going to be built and what the problems will be. Get us out of the twin tunnels.\u0094\n\nA representative of the Central Coast Water District said she realizes they are at the end of the pipeline and need State Water. \u0093It has this huge system around the state that allows us to bank water. They give it back and sell it to Guadalupe. So without the system, you can\u0092t do that.\u0094\n\nThomas Mosby, general manager of the Montecito Water District, gave a quick summary of the history of water in his area. He said the Cachuma Lake project was built in 1958. In 1973 there was a water emergency. 1987 brought the next drought years until 14\u0094 of rain fell in 1990. Today, he said they haven\u0092t had water shortages for 22 years. He recognized the importance of State Water as a supplemental source because he was sending out a letter this week saying they are possibly going into another water shortage this year. \u0093Look at new supplies, as well as the State Water,\u0094 advised Mr. Mosby.\n\nDarlene Bierig, a member of the Montecito Water District Board of Directors, said people should adopt a more regional concept. \u0093It\u0092s a shame that a county that sits next to the ocean with the resources we have has all their eggs in one basket. I\u0092m asking you to be visionary.\u0094\n\nSupervisors\u0092 concluding remarks:\n\nDoreen Farr: \u0093It is clear to me that the BDCP project is extremely controversial. There is a lot of opposition to it in Northern California and with their counties\u0092 Boards of Supervisors. \u0093I approve of decoupling BDCP discussions from the State Water contract. I think we need to undertake this long term forecast and analysis.\u0094\n\nJanet Wolf: \u0093There\u0092s been some discussion of decoupling the BDCP, but it looks like in this contract that it is inherent that any capital costs, whatever it is, becomes a part of the contract. When this ultimately comes back to us, I would assure that we are going to have some decision on the twin tunnels. Otherwise how would we deal with the contract that talks about capital expenditures?\u0094\n\nAssistant County Counsel Ghizzoni said the definitions in the water code \u0093are pretty broad. A lot of activities are included in it, but it does not take off the county\u0092s ability to disagree that the project is not within the state water contract you\u0092re in. We will have to take a hard look at it.\u0094\n\nMs. Wolf concluded by asking, \u0093Where do we come in on this train moving down the track?\u0094 referring to the 40 years or 75 year contract.\n\nAttorney Ghizzoni said the \u0093real elephant in the room is keeping track of the BDCP.\u0094\n\n\u0093That\u0092s something staff has to keep an eye on. Everything is negotiable. If I had a crystal ball, I\u0092d say decision on the extending the 1963 agreement is several months down the road and heavily impacted by the BDCP EIS [environmental impact statement] draft. You have some time to bring it back to the Board.\n\nPeter Adam: \u0093We need to terminate the ability of the state to stick us with bond sales or capital improvements. That provision is pretty onerous, open ended, and offensive. Maybe we have to go on with State Water but maybe we can get some concessions, too.\"\n\nClick here to watch video from the meeting:\n\nSanta Barbara Board of Supervisors Approaches Renewal of DWR Contract & Twin Tunnels with Skepticism from Gene Beley on Vimeo.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California, Central Valley, business, San Joaquin Valley, Great Central Valley, news, urban sprawl, rural, real estate, housing, farming, dairy, agribusiness, cotton, oil, gasoline, ethanol, biodiesel, alternative fuels, prices, Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Visalia, Portervile, Bakersfield, Schwarzenegger", "distribution": "global", "description": "Central Valley Business Times.
