Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Barack Obama are holding the American people hostage as they try to force their big government agenda on our great country ("Obama and Republicans struggle to break fiscal impasse," Oct. 11). We conservatives must now stand up for the Republicans in Congress as they face these daily vicious attacks from the left

We need the help of every conservative we can reach right away in any way we can.

Now that the federal government has shut down, the Washington establishment has rolled out a ruthless "fear campaign" to try to scare tea party senators and representatives into submission. These Obamacare defenders are absolutely shameless in their gutless gutter tactics. President Obama claimed only last week that anyone in favor of doing away with Obamacare is shutting down our economy.

Senator Reid has claimed over and over again that stopping Obamacare would be the same as denying health care coverage to millions of Americans, which is nothing but a bogus left wing lie.
