I would rather be a rebel than a slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be a rebel than a slave\u201d: Meryl Streep\u2019s Suffragette slogan stirs racist outcry \u2013 http://t.co/iDtU0o1XgP pic.twitter.com/iPJx5tDcJj \u2014 Irish Times Culture (@IrishTimesCultr) October 8, 2015\n\nIt\u2019s a nice sentiment \u201cin a bubble,\u201d as Ira Madison III wrote over at Vulture. But neither Britain nor America exists outside of a bubble when it comes to things like rebels and slaves, and Streep or Mulligan or their publicists or someone in marketing ought to have thought of that before these women donned these shirts and posed with smiling faces.\n\n\u201cThe message that Streep and company are co-signing,\u201d writes Kirsten West Savali at The Root, \u201cis that one cannot be both enslaved and a rebel; and tucked between those lines lies the erasure of a dual existence that black women have been forced to navigate in one form or another throughout history.\u201d\n\nWhite feminism in the West has a long history of erasure of women of color. When Pankhurst spoke the words she did, she was most likely pretty ignorant of what it meant to be a black woman in England. That mindset still plagues feminism to this day, so that the white women who too often grab the megaphones are unaware of or unwilling to listen to their sisters of color.\n\nAll of us \u2014 especially those of us who consider ourselves religious \u2014 have a duty to listen when we would rather speak, and to cede power where we would grab it. A slave can be a rebel, and a feminist can be aware of her shortcomings \u2014 but we have a long way to go.\n\n(Laura Turner is a writer and editor living in San Francisco.
