And he\u2019ll outline a vision for what he hopes will be a second term, including ensuring that Denver\u2019s prosperity doesn\u2019t leave some residents behind.\n\n\u201cThis is not a speech with a lot of big announcements,\u201d Hancock said last week during a meeting with journalists at The Denver Post. \u201cIt really is a speech about reflecting what we\u2019ve accomplished and looking forward to the next four years of things we\u2019ve got to focus on.\u201d\n\nBut so far, with the May 5 municipal election less than 10 months away, Hancock\u2019s likely re-election bid is missing just one thing: an opponent.\n\nCandidacies are piling up\n\nfor City Council and other offices, but nobody else has filed initial paperwork to run for mayor.\n\nPolitical observers and insiders say most potentially serious challengers, including his competitors from the 2011 election, have bowed out.\n\n\u201cSomeone will run. I believe that,\u201d Hancock said.\n\nIn the meantime, his campaign has geared up in a bare-bones way, with an emphasis on fundraising.\n\nHancock\u2019s campaign raised nearly $374,000 last year, his most active since taking office in 2011, and started this year with $258,180 in the bank.\n\nMore fundraisers are planned, including a 45th birthday bash on July 30\n\n.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s speech, Hancock said to expect a renewal of focus on several dominant issues: affordable housing, investments in neighborhoods, help for the homeless, reform of the police and sheriff\u2019s departments, and the restoration of services during the economic recovery.\n\nHe also will make a pitch for an expected ballot measure in November to renew Denver\u2019s tax-supported preschool-assistance program, including an increase in the 0.12 percent tax by 0.03 percentage points to pay for an expansion.\n\nOne planned announcement, Hancock said, is aimed at building on recent efforts in west Denver, which have included directing federal money to a new park and an early-childhood education center. In coming months, the city will help support nonprofit developer Revision International\u2019s plans for a community-owned \u201cfood hub,\u201d including a neighborhood grocery store, along Morrison Road in the Westwood neighborhood.\n\nPlans call for a commercial kitchen and other businesses that would provide fresh food to residents in the neighborhood, considered a food desert.\n\nDerek Woodbury, the spokesman for the city\u2019s Office of Economic Development, said it will seek council approval to direct federal community development grant money, likely between $500,000 and $2 million, to the project.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray\n\nIf you go\n\nDenver Mayor Michael Hancock\u2019s State of the City address is set to begin at 11 a.m. in the Denver Art Museum\u2019s Ponti Hall, 100 W. 14th Ave. It is open to the public.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "State of the City: Denver Mayor Michael Hancock looks to reelection", "title": "State of the City: Denver Mayor Michael Hancock looks to reelection", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/13/state-of-the-city-denver-mayor-michael-hancock-looks-to-reelection/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713__20140714_A4_CD14PDENSOCp1.jpg", "height": 483}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713__20140714_A4_CD14PDENSOCp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-13T19:31:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:37:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae33\"", "article_summary": "Denver Mayor Michael Hancock will be looking beyond the next year when he takes the stage Monday in the Denver Art Museum\u2019s Ponti Hall.\n\u201cThis is not a speech with a lot of big announcements,\u201d Hancock said last week during a meeting with journalists at The Denver Post.\nCandidacies are piling upfor City Council and other offices, but nobody else has filed initial paperwork to run for mayor.\nPlans call for a commercial kitchen and other businesses that would provide fresh food to residents in the neighborhood, considered a food desert.\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurrayIf you goDenver Mayor Michael Hancock\u2019s State of the City address is set to begin at 11 a.m. in the Denver Art Museum\u2019s Ponti Hall, 100 W. 14th Ave."}
