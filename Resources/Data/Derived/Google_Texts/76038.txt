This morning on ABC's "This Week," George Stephanopoulos asked the Powerhouse Roundtable if a deal would be struck on the debt ceiling before Thursday's deadline:

David Plouffe: I think it's no better than 50/50. And so I think the country needs to prepare that this could go on for a while.

Peggy Noonan: I think the House is nervous, the Senate is nervous, and the White House is nervous, nobody knows how this ends or exactly when, but there will be great pressure to clean this up, especially if damning polls continue to come out.

Paul Krugman: I think it's no better than 50/50. And the positive 50 comes entirely from the likelihood that the markets are going to say something really very loud when they open tomorrow.

Dan Senor: I think that they will get through it. Republicans should get through this and move as quickly as possible to a debate on Obamacare to prove that Paul's prediction is actually not correct.

Do you think a deal can be made before Thursday's debt ceiling deadline? Post your comments below.
