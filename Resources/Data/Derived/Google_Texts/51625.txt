Brian Stelter, CNN's media reporter, said Thursday the mainstream media should be giving more coverage to the comments from Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber noting the "stupidity" of voters in allowing the passage of the law.Appearing on CNN's "Newsroom," Stelter said the lack of coverage isn't likely part of a mainstream media conspiracy, but probably due to the fact that the videos uncovered of Gruber are more than a year old and that the issue has been debated for years."But, that said, the quote, the word 'stupid,' that is news â€“ and the way it's being used by conservatives is also news. And that's why it should be covered by the nightly newscasts and should be covered by CNN," Stelter told host Brooke Baldwin."This is one of those stories that begins in the conservative media and now is beginning to percolate out elsewhere," Stelter said, but he added that conservative critics have a point that the nightly newscasts on ABC, NBC and CBS have ignored it. And of the morning news shows, only CBS gave it a mention."The CBS Evening News" did cover the story Thursday night, three days after the videos began being released by a man who found them online after he said his own family's health insurance doubled under Obamacare."I asked NBC News and ABC why they haven't taken it on, they declined to comment," Stelter said. "CBS said, look we are covering it, look at our morning show, but it is an example of one of these stories that becomes very politicized on the right, but is barely heard about in the middle and on the left.
