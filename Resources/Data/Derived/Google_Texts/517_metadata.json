A Phoenix television station reported that fellow Republican Ken Bennett \u2013 a former gubernatorial candidate and ex-Secretary of State \u2013 announced Thursday he is running.\n\nLast year\u2019s GOP nominee for the seat \u2013 former state Speaker of the House Andy Tobin \u2013 said Sunday in a statement that he would not pursue the seat again in 2016.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Barbara McGuire of Kearny may also toss her hat in the ring. She represents Legislative District 8, which includes most of Pinal County. She announced last month she is exploring a possible run for Kirkpatrick\u2019s seat.\n\nKiehne doesn\u2019t expect the GOP primary to be a crowded race following the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision preventing the state Legislature from redrawing Arizona\u2019s congressional districts.\n\nIt\u2019s speculated the district would have been reconfigured to be more favorable for Republican candidates.\n\nThough CD1 will remain intact, Kiehne said it won\u2019t alter his grassroots style of campaigning.\n\nHitting the road across eastern Arizona, he operates on the simple strategy of shaking hands and meeting voters one-on-one.\n\nHis message has upheld the same conservative themes from the last election: reducing government spending, repealing the Affordable Care Act and reining in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nHe\u2019s critical of politicians with little life experience in the private sector \u2013 or as he calls it, \u201cno dirt under their fingernails.\u201d\n\nKiehne thinks he\u2019s the right candidate to represent CD1 due to his activity in multiple industries found throughout eastern Arizona, such as agriculture, tourism and energy production.\n\n\u201cYou name the sector of business throughout our entire district, and I\u2019ve been in each and every one of them,\u201d he said.\n\nKiehne grew up learning the ins and outs of business through his family\u2019s cattle ranch and hardware store. He paid his way through New Mexico State University by selling cars in the summer and would eventually spend 30 years in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said he has experienced the highs and lows of business prosperity. The sharp drop in oil prices in the 1980s put him in a crunch, but he said he\u2019s learned to navigate the curveballs of a sporadic economy.\n\nUnlike some of his Republican contemporaries, Kiehne argues the key to greater job creation is not through cutting taxes. He said expanding access to financing allows more entrepreneurs to generate jobs through start-up businesses.\n\nHe said U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick has an unusual way of convincing voters she\u2019s capable of creating jobs. He pointed out her support of the Affordable Care Act and lack of action against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as areas where they strongly differ.\n\nAt the end of the day, Kiehne said what distinguishes him from other candidates is that he doesn\u2019t think of himself as a \u201ccareer politician.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing this cause I need a job,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty to do win, lose or draw.\u201d\n\nKiehne\u2019s campaign reported having $500,000 on hand at the end of last quarter. CD1 is considered one of the most expensive congressional races in the country \u2013 over $4 million was raised between Kirkpatrick and Tobin for the 2014 general election.\n\nKiehne said the high demand for cash doesn\u2019t worry him going into the race.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "description": "Businessman Gary Kiehne doesn\u2019t like to lose.", "title": "Election 2016: Close in \u201814, Kiehne back for another shot in CD1", "url": "http://www.trivalleycentral.com/eloy_enterprise/news/election-close-in-kiehne-back-for-another-shot-in-cd/article_ce39f186-2b45-11e5-8405-13ab2eb81e64.html", "image": {"width": 380, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/trivalleycentral.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/b2/eb243bae-2b49-11e5-9bcf-337fbb48aa8b/55a6edecb9474.image.jpg?resize=380%2C315", "height": 315}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "<266179467961>", "app_id": 266179467961}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "pnob7A_ZlKDY1isdeDLyU6W1kqaqdp1JUZJ3eDCa61w", "description": "Businessman Gary Kiehne doesn\u2019t like to lose."}, "article_summary": "Kiehne declared his candidacy for the 2016 election in January \u2013 giving him as much time as possible to cover the congressional district that stretches from Flagstaff to northern Tucson.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any relevance.\u201dHe was the first person to officially declare his candidacy for the CD1 seat.\nBusinessman Gary Kiehne doesn\u2019t like to lose.\nUnlike some of his Republican contemporaries, Kiehne argues the key to greater job creation is not through cutting taxes.\nKiehne doesn\u2019t expect the GOP primary to be a crowded race following the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision preventing the state Legislature from redrawing Arizona\u2019s congressional districts."}
