Emerging technologies such as telehealth, smartphone health apps, and social media may provide new approaches to improving outcomes while reducing costs.\n\nNew diagnostic criteria, based on the recently revised DSM-5. These include the new diagnosis of hoarding disorder; a newly defined category of neurocognitive disorders that includes major neurocognitive disorder (replacing the term dementia), mild neurocognitive disorder, (replacing mild cognitive impairment), and delirium; and other diagnostic criteria changes that will increase the accuracy of assessment of common mood disorders.\n\nAge-related differences in the prevalence and characteristics of anxiety disorders. These symptom differences\u2014along with the effects of accompanying medical disorders\u2014may contribute to the challenges of assessing anxiety in older adults.\n\nNew approaches to the problem of depression in later life. A palliative care approach has gained increasing support among caregivers who treat terminal disorders in the elderly. Instead of emphasizing the aggressive search for curative treatments, palliative care prioritizes quality of life, a change in focus that often leads to longer survival as well as greater comfort.\n\nThe many and varied causes of psychosis\u2014often related to underlying medical or neurological conditions. New evidence on the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications in older patients with neurocognitive, psychotic, or mood disorders is summarized as well.\n\nAn in-depth focus on the new DSM-5 category of mild neurocognitive disorder. While more research is needed to clarify this new diagnostic category, it reflects the growing emphasis on early recognition and treatment of cognitive impairment.\n\nManagement of behavior changes and neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other neurocognitive disorders. Alternatives to antipsychotic medications, including nondrug approaches, may provide urgently needed new treatments.\n\nIn an introduction to September/October 2015 issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, James Ellison, MD, MPH, the Swank Foundation Endowed Chair in Memory Care and Geriatrics at Christiana Care Health Systems and Brent Forester, MD, MSc, Chief of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry and Director of the Geriatric Mood Disorders Research Program at McLean Hospital, write that changes in mental health care are being driven by the increasingly aging United States population, new diagnostic criteria, and novel healthcare policy initiatives, among other factors.\u201cBoth workforce shortages and fiscal pressures have presented obstacles to caring for the behavioral needs of our elderly,\u201d wrote Drs. Ellison and Forester, in the special issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, which provides an update on the trends and developments that are leading to new directions in mental healthcare for older patients.With older adults now making up 13% of the US population, geriatric psychiatry has transformed drastically as a field in recent years. The Affordable Care Act has also affected the field, with the introduction of measures meant to integrate behavioral health treatment into primary care settings in the hopes of increasing the availability and effectiveness of mental healthcare.Seven papers makes up the special September/October issue of the journal, written by noted experts who discuss these policy changes, new diagnostic classifications, and the latest research behind recent changes in the mental healthcare of the elderly.
