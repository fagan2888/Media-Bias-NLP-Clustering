With 468 Democrats voting, Palacio received 248 votes to Sabados\u2019 182 votes. Former congressional candidate Vic Meyers received 38 votes. In other words, Palacio received 53 percent of the vote, Sabados 39 percent and Meyers 8 percent.\n\nThere was plenty of talk afterward about uniting to win in 2016.\n\n\u201cI look forward to leading a united and forward looking Democratic Party and vow to work with Democrats in all corners of our state as we reelect Sen. Michael Bennet and regain our majority in the state Senate,\u201d Palacio said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of moving the conversation forward and giving a voice to many activists who have felt ignored,\u201d Sabados said. \u201cThese conversations are healthy for the party and have helped us take a serious look at what needs to be done for 2015 and 2016. I believe our party will have a renewed focus on building county party infrastructure and working with local candidates.\u201d\n\nThe race received national attention after Palacio announced Thursday night that the make-up of the committee that was going to do the voting did not meet party requirements for gender equality and he needed to appoint 46 more men. Sabados accused him of trying to stack the deck, but Palacio pointed out the rule has been in place since the 1970s. He also appointed Sabados and Meyers to the committee.\n\n\u201cI also hope we will reform party rules that have been ambiguous so we can more forward and focus on winning elections again,\u201d Sabados said Sunday.\n\nRepublicans, who have their own testy race for party chair, were delighted to see the other guys in the news for once. Their election is March 14.\n\n@AlanSalazarCO I'm just glad you guys are the ones fighting for once. :) @lynn_bartels @RickPalacio \u2014 Kelly Maher (@okmaher) February 28, 2015\n\nPalacio acknowledged his opponents during the party\u2019s annual Jefferson Jackson dinner later that Saturday, which featured awards, a keynote speech from U.S. Al Franken of Minnesota and plenty of lawmakers, lobbyists, Denver City Council candidates and other elected officials.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Democratic Party,Dave Sabados,Kelly Maher,Rick Palacio,Vic Meyers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Rick Palacio held off a challenge to be elected chairman of Colorado Democrats for the third time.", "title": "Rick Palacio will lead Colorado Democratic Party again", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/03/01/rick-palacio-wins-third-term-democratic-party-chair/117542/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/03/IMG_7069.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Rick Palacio held off a challenge to be elected chairman of Colorado Democrats for the third time.", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/03/01/rick-palacio-wins-third-term-democratic-party-chair/117542/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/03/IMG_7069.jpg", "title": "Rick Palacio wins third term as Colorado Democratic Party chair", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rick Palacio held off a challenge to be elected chairman of Colorado Democrats for the third time."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf649\"", "article_summary": "Rick Palacio beat back a challenge from campaign consultant Dave Sabados to win a third term as Colorado Democratic Party chairman in a race that attracted national attention.\nWith 468 Democrats voting, Palacio received 248 votes to Sabados\u2019 182 votes.\nIn other words, Palacio received 53 percent of the vote, Sabados 39 percent and Meyers 8 percent.\nFormer congressional candidate Vic Meyers received 38 votes.\nPalacio won after one round of balloting during the Democrats\u2019 reorganizational meeting Saturday at the downtown Denver Marriott."}
