â€” A former employee of the Wake City-County Bureau of Identification faces charges of sexual exploitation of a minor and resisting arrest after month-long online sting operation in which he shared his fantasies about young girls with an undercover officer.

According to the warrant issued for a search of his house and vehicles, at 2133 Castle Pines Drive in Raleigh, Brian Robert Hotchkiss exchanged a series of messages with the officer in which he claimed to have a teen daughter and stepdaughter to whom he was attracted.

Officers identified a suspect in their ongoing search for online child sexual exploitation by responding to an ad on Craigslist that offered girls panties.

The exchanges took place using Craigslist's anonymous email messaging system, but the Craigslist account was later traced to an account registered to Hotchkiss at 330 S. Salisbury St. in Raleigh, home of the CCBI, and to his use of Time Warner Cable internet at his home.

According to the warrant, Hotchkiss had been dismissed from his job with the law enforcement agency.
