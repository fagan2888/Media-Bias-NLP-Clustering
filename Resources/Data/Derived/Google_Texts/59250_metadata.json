Cory Gardner\u2019s, R-Colo., campaign got some more bad news this weekend. A new NBC News/Marist poll showed Gardner trailing Democratic Colorado Sen. Mark Udall by six points, 47 percent to 42 percent. A similar NBC poll in July showed Udall leading by seven points.\n\nWith mail-in ballots dropping on October 14, Gardner\u2019s window of opportunity has closed and he has no discernible path to victory. Polls have consistently shown Udall leading with the key voter demographics here. The same questions that were asked when Gardner announced six months ago \u2013 how does he win Colorado Latinos and suburban women \u2013 have been answered: He can\u2019t.\n\nWorse yet for Gardner, the NBC poll showed his favorable/unfavorable rating in bad shape, at 40/38. This says the Udall strategy of hammering Gardner on his support for birth control and abortion bans in a pro-choice state like Colorado is paying off.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nThis also explains the panicked move by the Gardner campaign, which ran an ad on birth control and Gardner\u2019s denying the existence of a federal birth control and abortion ban bill, the Life Begins at Conception Act, that the congressman co-sponsors. When asked about his co-sponsorship of the federal \u201cPersonhood\u201d bill by Denver\u2019s KUSA/NBC political reporter Brandon Rittiman, Gardner said this:\n\nRittiman: How do you square your recent change on personhood at the state level with the bill that you still are on in Congress. The life begins at conception act?\n\nGardner: Well, there is no federal personhood bill. They\u2019re two different pieces of legislation, two different things.\n\nRittiman then noted that other co-sponsors of the bill say it is federal personhood legislation. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a piece of legislation that says abortion ought to be illegal, no?\u201d Gardner responded, \u201cNo. It says life begins at conception.\u201d\n\nThis is Twilight Zone material, a clear indication that Gardner is losing because of the issue. And props to Rittiman for asking the follow-up and making Gardner answer the question about what his legislation actually does.\n\n[READ: Face It: The Abortion Battle Is Just About Sex]\n\nAccording to factcheck.org, these are identical bills:\n\nWe don\u2019t see how the Colorado initiative and the federal bill, which supporters in Congress describe as a \u201cpersonhood\u201d measure, are different on this point. And neither does one of the groups supporting the state initiative. Jennifer Mason, a spokeswoman for the Yes on Amendment 67 Campaign, which supports the ballot measure, told Colorado public radio station KUNC: \u201cObviously [Gardner's] a victim of some bad political advice, there\u2019s no reason for him to pull local support while he\u2019s still 100 percent behind the federal amendment. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nWe agree. And we didn\u2019t receive any further explanation from the Gardner campaign on the contradiction. We asked Nash at the Guttmacher Institute if there was something in the federal bill that would preclude the concerns over birth control, but Nash agreed that the \u201cmoment of fertilization\u201d language was the reason these types of proposals had the potential to prohibit access to hormonal forms of birth control. ...voters in Colorado should know Gardner still supports a federal bill that would prompt the same concerns over birth control as the state measure he says he rejects on the same grounds.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "laura-chapin/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Cory Gardner's Twilight Zone Answers on Birth Control, Abortion and Personhood", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The congressman's hedging on personhood, birth control and abortion laws has already cost him.", "title": "Next Stop: Twilight Zone, Colo.", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/laura-chapin/2014/09/08/cory-gardners-twilight-zone-answers-on-birth-control-abortion-and-personhood", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/93/39/dd320860482989a7ab1889534185/140908-corygardner-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The congressman's hedging on personhood, birth control and abortion laws has already cost him.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Cory Gardner's Twilight Zone Answers on Birth Control, Abortion and Personhood"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Laura Chapin,Colorado,elections,2014 Congressional elections,Gardner, Cory,birth control,abortion,politics,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The congressman's hedging on personhood, birth control and abortion laws has already cost him."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc5a\"", "article_summary": "Rittiman then noted that other co-sponsors of the bill say it is federal personhood legislation.\nGardner: Well, there is no federal personhood bill.\nThis says the Udall strategy of hammering Gardner on his support for birth control and abortion bans in a pro-choice state like Colorado is paying off.\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]This also explains the panicked move by the Gardner campaign, which ran an ad on birth control and Gardner\u2019s denying the existence of a federal birth control and abortion ban bill, the Life Begins at Conception Act, that the congressman co-sponsors.\n...voters in Colorado should know Gardner still supports a federal bill that would prompt the same concerns over birth control as the state measure he says he rejects on the same grounds."}
