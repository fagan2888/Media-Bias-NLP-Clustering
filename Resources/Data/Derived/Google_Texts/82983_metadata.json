A member of the European Commission recently warned that:\n\n\u201cTax increases imposed by the Socialist-led government in France have reached a \u201cfatal level\u201d\u2026[and] that a series of tax hikes since the Socialists took power 14 months ago \u2013 including \u20ac33bn in new taxes this year \u2013 threatens to \u201cdestroy growth and handicap the creation of jobs\u201d.\n\nGiven the pervasive statism of the European Commission, that was a remarkable admission.\n\nBut the Commissioner who issued that warning, Olli Rehn, is Finnish, so French politicians presumably don\u2019t listen to his advice any more than they listen to the thoughtful, well-meaning, and generous suggestions I make.\n\nIndeed, based on the actions of the current President and the former President, we can say with great confidence that French politicians compete over who can pursue the most misguided policies.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, there are some people inside France who realize the house of cards is in danger of collapse.\n\nHere are some excerpts from a story I never thought I would read. At least one senior official in France has woken up to the dangers of ever-rising taxes and an always-growing burden of government spending.\n\nFrance\u2019s state auditor urged the government Tuesday to redouble efforts to limit spending rather than increases taxes\u2026 The head of the state auditor, Didier Migaud, said the interruption in deficit reduction stemmed primarily from lower-than-expected tax revenue, due to the weak economy. Yet, he said \u201cthe spiraling welfare debt was particularly abnormal and particularly dangerous.\u201d During his first year in power, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande relied on large tax increases to plug holes in public finances, including social programs such as pensions, unemployment benefits and health care. But economic stagnation in 2012, coupled with a mild recession at the start of 2013, has waylaid the plan, while both companies and households are crying foul over what some have called \u201ca tax overdose.\u201d Mr. Migaud added his voice, saying: \u201cThe strategy of fixing the system by collecting new revenue is reaching its limits.\u201d\n\nBefore any further analysis, I have to make one correction to the story. Hollande\u2019s plan was not \u201cwaylaid\u201d by a recession. Instead, his policies doubtlessly helped cause a recession. You don\u2019t impose huge tax hikes on productive behavior without some sort of negative impact on economic performance.\n\nSo the \u201choles in public finances\u201d are at least partially a result of the Laffer Curve. As I\u2019ve repeatedly warned, higher tax rates rarely - if ever - collect as much money as politicians expect.\n\nReturning to the specific case of France, the fiscal variable that should set off the most alarm bells is that the burden of government spending has soared to 57 percent of GDP. And based on projections from the BIS, OECD, and IMF, that number is going to get even worse in the future.\n\nThis is the data that presumably has convinced Monsieur Migaud that France is approaching the point of no return on taxes and spending.\n\nInterestingly, the French people may be ahead of their politicians. Polling data from 2010 and 2013 show that ordinary people very much understand the need to limit the size and scope of government.\n\nHeck, a majority of French people have said they would be interested in escaping to the United States if they had the opportunity. And successful people already have been leaving the country because of punitive tax rates.\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure I believe the aforementioned polls. If the French people genuinely have sound views, why do they keep electing bad politicians? Of course, the same thing could be said about the United States, so perhaps I shouldn\u2019t throw stones in my glass house.\n\nP.S. My favorite example of government running amok in France is the law threatening three years in jail if you say your husband is a fat slob or if you accuse your wife of being a nag.\n\nP.P.S. The most vile French official may be the current Prime Minister, who actually had the gall to complain that some of his intended victims weren\u2019t quietly entering the slaughterhouse.\n\nP.P.P.S. Just in case you think I\u2019m exaggerating about France being a fiscal hellhole, more than 8,000 households last year were subjected to a tax burden of more than 100 percent .
