(Photo: Provided)\n\nAchievement: John Steenrod scored a composite 36 on the April ACT, the highest score possible on the college entrance exam. He scored 36 on the individual tests in science, math, and reading, and a 35 on English.\n\nThe facts: On average, fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of students score a 36 on a given testing date, according to ACT. In 2014, 38 Kentucky students, including 16 Louisville-area students, made that score. As of the September testing, in 2015, 33 Kentucky students, including 13 Louisville-area students, have scored 36.\n\nOn the test: John said he found the questions easy enough, but he found himself trying hard to finish all of them in the time allowed. He said he thought the questions on the SAT varied more in their difficulty. He said he took a preparation class last summer for the SAT, and he thought a lot of what he learned there applied also to the ACT.\n\nAcknowledgements: \u201cMy parents have done a good job, not put too much pressure on me, and have supported my education my entire life,\u201d he said. He said his school deserved some credit as well, for helping him \u201clearn relevant stuff and make sure we have the skills\u201d to apply their knowledge.\n\nBesides the 36: John spends a lot of time on athletics. Basketball \u2013 both playing and following - is his favorite sport. He says he cares a lot about his health and he learns as much about it as he can. He enjoys working out and trying different kinds of exercise. \u201cI\u2019m learning how to watch my calories. I like food, and I don\u2019t diet too carefully, but I make sure I\u2019m eating enough to maintain my level of exercise, and to get enough protein.\u201d\n\nJohn\u2019s hobbies: basketball, weight-lifting, reading, hanging out with friends\n\nJohn\u2019s home life: John lives in Glenview Hills with his parents Sarah and Wright Steenrod. He has two younger sisters, both students at Louisville Collegiate School.\n\nTeacher Quote: \u201cJohn is just about as fine a young person as one could hope to meet,\u201d said teacher Clay Gahan. \u201cHe is, of course, quite bright, ambitious and disciplined but without being selfish or self-centered: a combination of attributes one does not often find. He listens well and, in my experience, is as caring as he is smart. Our school community will miss him next year.\u201d\n\nFuture plans: John has narrowed his list of colleges to five, and he is in the process of visiting schools and making his choice. He intends to pursue studies in the social sciences.\n\nMeet the Achiever\n\nAchiever: John Steenrod\n\nAge: 17\n\nGrade: 12\n\nSchool: Louisville Collegiate School\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1jnD2Ao", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "John Steenrod is one of 13 area students who scored a composite 36", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "John Steenrod is one of 13 area students who scored a composite 36", "title": "Achiever: Collegiate student scores 36 on ACT", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/neighborhoods/2015/11/27/achiever-collegiate-student-scores-36-act/76444034/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Steenrod is one of 13 area students who scored a composite 36", "title": "Achiever: Collegiate student scores 36 on ACT", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52b166f7a386d592bf38fac3280438d22ffdfec2/c=0-80-640-720&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/27/Louisville/Louisville/635842146978388239-John-Steenrod.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Achiever: Collegiate student scores 36 on ACT", "author": "Elaine Rooker Jack", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/neighborhoods", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ee92809a698ee97fd31241d63a782431d58f362/c=20-0-620-800/local/-/media/2015/11/27/Louisville/Louisville/635842146978388239-John-Steenrod.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2f301d8782b1d35270b240301fa7f18d147de67/c=0-80-640-720/local/-/media/2015/11/27/Louisville/Louisville/635842146978388239-John-Steenrod.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7534fe898b9deebbf31ac57cd394d3c46a0ec25c/c=0-159-640-640/local/-/media/2015/11/27/Louisville/Louisville/635842146978388239-John-Steenrod.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7269cf970a6f63db2c2a560c583b9dfcf5c7cc61/c=0-219-640-581&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/27/Louisville/Louisville/635842146978388239-John-Steenrod.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-27T10:06:12.597000-05:00", "shorthed": "Achiever: Collegiate student scores 36 on ACT", "articleid": 76444034, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04c3c2cc925dd2bad57c1e988fffb62defba947e/c=0-219-640-581/local/-/media/2015/11/27/Louisville/Louisville/635842146978388239-John-Steenrod.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/295468178c1d482f55bf3f76991a8b2bdb456229/c=96-0-544-800/local/-/media/2015/11/27/Louisville/Louisville/635842146978388239-John-Steenrod.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "ACT, Collegiate school, louisville collegiate school,  John Steenrod"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36e6\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Provided)Achievement: John Steenrod scored a composite 36 on the April ACT, the highest score possible on the college entrance exam.\nThe facts: On average, fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of students score a 36 on a given testing date, according to ACT.\nJohn Steenrod scored 36 on the individual tests in science, math, and reading, and a 35 on English.\nAs of the September testing, in 2015, 33 Kentucky students, including 13 Louisville-area students, have scored 36.\nHe scored 36 on the individual tests in science, math, and reading, and a 35 on English."}
