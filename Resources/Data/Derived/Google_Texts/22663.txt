More than 500 tenants of public housing have admitted rorting the system

One man called “Mr H” declared $470,000 in cash to the amnesty hotline

The state government has put tenants on notice, giving them until May 31 to dob themselves in for undeclared income and assets.

SOME public housing tenants have declared they have assets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars while happily enjoying cut-price rent at the expense of more needy recipients.

More than 500 tenants of public housing have admitted rorting the system. Of those, 141 declared combined assets worth more than $11 million while 456 declared extra income worth a combined $10 million a year.

One man had $450,000 cash and 20 others declared land and property ownership.

The state government put tenants on notice last month, giving them until May 31 to dob themselves in for undeclared income and assets.

The move will bring more than $250,000 in extra rent into the state’s coffers each year.

Community Services Minister Gabrielle Upton said 77 more people were reported by the public.

“As a result, their rents have been increased, leading to additional revenue which can be allocated to funding vitally needed public housing,” she said.

There are more than 58,000 people in NSW on the waiting list for public housing. A man called “Mr H” in public housing on the Central Coast declared $470,000 in cash to the amnesty hotline: a $310,000 term deposit, a $100,000 compensation payout and a $60,000 inheritance.

“Mr S”, 80, of Leichhardt, told the hotline about $60,000 in savings — $20,000 of which came from a casino visit after his wife banned him from gambling. “Mr N” was reported by a member of the public who said he owned a property in Penrith from which he earned rental income. The man had illegally taken over a public housing property from a friend who had died but now must pay an extra $100 a week in rent until the lease runs out and he is evicted.

While the amnesty is in place, tenants doing the wrong thing can report themselves without being pursued for prosecution or back rent.

“Once the amnesty is over, quite substantial penalties can apply, including rent increases and eviction,” Ms Upton said.

The government’s previous amnesty held last year — on undeclared occupants in public housing properties — raised $8.9 million a year in rent, following more than 4000 reports from tenants and members of the public
