But after his younger brother had an emotional coming out as a gay man, Rattray decided to switch career paths and focus on social change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that money doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d states Rattray. \u201cIt\u2019s that it\u2019s in service of something much bigger. And I think people are happiest when they are part of a meaningful organization where they feel like they are making an impact.\u201d\n\nSo why are companies in the tech sector leading the way in the social empowerment movement? Rattray believes it is due in part of the very nature of tech platforms that are inherently designed to empower their contributors, thus making them more responsive to their needs\u2014a movement he says that will revive capitalism by making businesses more beholden to their consumers\u2019 demands.\n\nRattray cites the massive online consumer mobilization trend as an indicator of this and states that it is the reason why so many companies are now focused on including social changes goals within their organizational structures.\n\nOne of the ways businesses are demonstrating this is through attaining benefit corporation status. Benefit corporations\u2014also known as b corporations\u2014are a new class of for-profit corporations that voluntarily meet higher standards or corporate purpose, accountability, and transparency. Since Maryland became the first state in 2010 to pass benefit corporation legislation, 22 states have signed similar legislation into law and there are nearly 1,000 certified b corporations worldwide.\n\nRattray, who was one of the early adopters of b corporation status, believes more companies will follow suit. \u201cIt\u2019s a real opportunity from a brand perspective to gain trust in the community. And the people that are not doing it don\u2019t feel so much pain, however, once you hit a critical mass and it starts gaining momentum, companies that are not b corporations will look more suspect.\u201d\n\nApproximately 6 minutes.\n\nProduced by Alexis Garcia.
