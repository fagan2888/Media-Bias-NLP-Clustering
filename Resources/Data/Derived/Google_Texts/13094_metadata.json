While it appeared a second child in Italy had been cured as well, doctors now say that levels of the virus are still detectable and the baby has suffered a relapse.\n\nSo far, only one person has apparently been cured of HIV/AIDS \u2014 the Berlin Patient, or Timothy Ray Brown \u2014 due to a successful bone marrow transplant. The babies that received large doses of three antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after being born were also initially assumed to be cured, since their viral levels had been pushed to such a low. But it turned out this wasn\u2019t the case, and the relapses were quite a blow to the medical community.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a punch to the gut,\u201d Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, told CNN. \u201cIt was extremely disappointing from both the scientific standpoint \u2026 but mainly for the sake of the child who is back on medicine and expected to stay on medicine for a very long time.\u201d\n\nEarly Treatment Won\u2019t Necessarily Work To Cure Children\n\nThe Italian baby was born to an HIV-infected mother who didn\u2019t receive prenatal care and didn\u2019t even know she was infected with HIV until just before giving birth. Doctors believed that early treatment right after birth could help prevent HIV from taking over the infant\u2019s system, but the recent relapse is just another reminder that early treatment might not be the best way to find a cure for children born to HIV-infected mothers.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned here is if you have an HIV-infected child who started treatment early, the fact that you have negative tests does not signify that the child has been cured or that they can be taken off treatment,\u201d Dr. Deborah Persaud, professor of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center in Baltimore, said. The Mississippi baby was taken off antiretroviral medication and lived for two years with undetectable levels of the virus, assumed to be cured. But at age 4, latent viruses were discovered hiding in her system.\n\nThe Italian boy, meanwhile \u2014 known as the \u201cMilan baby\u201d \u2014 had a similar situation. After being pumped with antiretroviral therapy for six months, his HIV levels dropped significantly and by age 3 it appeared that the virus had been eradicated completely.\n\nHowever, tests later showed that dormant viruses hiding in his immune system had resurfaced. Both children will now need to be placed on antiretroviral medication for the rest of their lives.\n\nThough this is a setback for the HIV/AIDS medical community, doctors are moving forward with trials to examine the best ways to treat babies born to HIV-infected mothers. There have been instances where mothers given HIV therapy before childbirth have prevented the transmission of the virus to her infant. \u201cBecause of that, I think it\u2019s possible there may be some potential to prevent HIV infection in the first place after exposure with early therapies,\u201d Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an infectious diseases specialist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., told WebMD.\n\nThough disappointing, it's not all in vain; researchers will use the experience of early treatment as a springboard to better target latent viruses and provide infants with immediate therapy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hiv cure, mississippi baby, milan baby, hiv", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Also known as the \u201cMilan baby,\u201d an Italian child initially assumed to be cured of HIV has relapsed after dormant viruses resurfaced.", "title": "2nd Baby Believed To Be 'Cured' Of HIV Relapses, Disappoints Doctors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/second-baby-believed-be-cured-hiv-relapses-disappoints-doctors-it-felt-punch-gut-306184", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/baby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Also known as the \u201cMilan baby,\u201d an Italian child initially assumed to be cured of HIV has relapsed after dormant viruses resurfaced.", "title": "2nd Baby Believed To Be 'Cured' Of HIV Relapses, Disappoints Doctors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/second-baby-believed-be-cured-hiv-relapses-disappoints-doctors-it-felt-punch-gut-306184", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/baby.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/baby.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-03T12:04:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T12:04:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Also known as the \u201cMilan baby,\u201d an Italian child initially assumed to be cured of HIV has relapsed after dormant viruses resurfaced."}, "article_summary": "Both the Mississippi baby and the Milan baby, who were initially thought to be cured of HIV, relapsed when doctors discovered latent viruses in their immune systems.\nThe Mississippi baby was taken off antiretroviral medication and lived for two years with undetectable levels of the virus, assumed to be cured.\nWhile it appeared a second child in Italy had been cured as well, doctors now say that levels of the virus are still detectable and the baby has suffered a relapse.\nEarlier this summer, the infamous Mississippi baby, who was believed to be cured of HIV due to aggressive treatment right after birth, was unfortunately found to still have levels of the virus in her system.\nAfter being pumped with antiretroviral therapy for six months, his HIV levels dropped significantly and by age 3 it appeared that the virus had been eradicated completely."}
