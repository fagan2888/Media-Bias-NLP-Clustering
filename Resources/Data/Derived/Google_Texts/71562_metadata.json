Ridgley and Andrew Steed spend their evening at the Islander Caribbean Restaurant and Lounge before its closure on U Street. (Wilborn P. Nobles III/The Washington Post)\n\nBonita Billups surrounded herself with lifelong friends at a white-cloth-covered table packed with bottles of champagne on ice.\n\nIt was the first Thursday of July at the corner of 12th and U streets NW. Club music filled the air as patrons packed the lounge\u2019s bar and patio, embracing each other like family members. Adeletha \u201cAddie\u201d Green, Billups\u2019s friend and matriarch of the establishment, greeted customers the way a mother embraces her children.\n\n\u201cEverybody in here knows everybody,\u201d Billups, 72, said. \u201cMs. Addie took care of us.\u201d\n\nEven though there were smiles and stories and drinks and laughs to go around that night, the occasion was a somber one. It was the last official night of the Islander Caribbean Restaurant and Lounge, an eatery that, over the years, had become a beloved institution on U Street NW.\n\nGreen said that after decades of serving up pineapple chicken, Caribbean kicker cocktails and Green\u2019s Calypso Chicken, she is closing the Islander, eager to leave the stresses of running a restaurant in a changing neighborhood to someone else.\n\n\u201cI thought it the appropriate time to unload myself of the emotional stress and distress in our community and move on,\u201d Green said, adding that she wants to spend time with her ailing husband, Ernest, who has retired from the D.C. fire department. \u201cIt really has taken a toll on my husband more so than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor many longtime patrons, who crowded into the corner restaurant that night, it was more than just a familiar eatery moving on. It was yet another harbinger of an evolving city, where old-time restaurants are closing or moving to different neighborhoods.\n\nThe Islander arrived in the District in the late 1960s at Sherman Avenue near Howard University. It moved to a second-floor space on Columbia Road in 1984, and then found a permanent home on U Street in 1994. It became a mainstay of black-owned restaurants on U Street, continuing the strip\u2019s history as \u201cThe Black Broadway.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a move that seemed unthinkable back then. When Green saw the U Street building and said she wanted to move there, her son Darryl said they probably had \u201cthe biggest argument of our lives.\u201d\n\nDarryl Green said he was nervous about the area, which hadn\u2019t recovered from urban blight sparked by the 1968 riots. \u201cBeing a person in the city and knowing what was going on in this area and especially on this corner,\u201d he said, \u201cthis wasn\u2019t a building I could ever perceive being\u201d what it is today.\n\nThe Islander was among the first businesses to reintroduce jazz to U Street in the late 1990s. Green\u2019s son Brian scheduled jazz musicians at the restaurant, where live music began to thrive.\n\nIn the two decades since, customers and local politicians said, Green became an \u201cicon\u201d in the community, as the weekly jazz sets and Caribbean music nights attracted visitors from across the region.\n\nAt a retirement service for Green last month, Jerry Paris, the interim general manager of WPFW-FM, gave her an award for her support of the community radio station. Paris said the restaurant \u201cstands alone\u201d as a place that brought disparate parts of the community to U Street around \u201cauthentic\u201d Caribbean food when so many other businesses abandoned the area in the late 1960s.\n\nBut in recent years, newer residents surrounding the Islander complained about the restaurant\u2019s late-night noisiness. The tension reached a critical stage in 2013, when a group of residents protested the restaurant\u2019s efforts for a liquor license renewal. That the restaurant is black-owned and the committee was largely white was not lost on the committee and community.\n\nMichelle Busch, 37, was one of many who fiercely defended the restaurant. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to deal with night life, then why\u2019d you move here?\u201d asked Busch, adding that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to see the lounge close after years of employing and feeding \u201ceverybody.\u201d\n\nFor Green, it was these battles that ultimately wore her out.\n\n\u201cOur community is going to experience a great difference with us not being there, because there aren\u2019t many other businesses like ours,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of change I believe Washington wants.\u201d\n\nThe loss of the Islander on U Street highlights changes on the strip for many of its regulars. Johnny Bilheimer of Silver Spring, Md., said the Islander has treated him like family for years. Bilheimer said his daughter compared the atmosphere to the fictional bar on the television show \u201cCheers.\u201d\n\nBilheimer, who is white, recalls how African American musicians such as Duke Ellington frequented U Street in the early to mid-20th century. Although musicians still play there, Bilheimer said, \u201cthe black culture here has been diminished.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of black heritage that\u2019s been lost,\u201d said Bilheimer, 70.\n\nOlder mom-and-pop businesses catered to black natives of the District for years, but property rent has increased as the community around U Street diversifies. Local businesses are being replaced with chain stores that older residents say cater to a younger demographic.\n\n\u201cWithin the last six or seven years, property taxes around here have gone up more than 300 percent,\u201d Darryl Green, 50, said. \u201cA lot of people really just can\u2019t afford to stay here and are not bringing in the type of revenue they need to maintain.\u201d\n\nBut there is a glimmer of hope that the spirit of the Islander may live on. As manager of the lounge, Darryl Green said he plans to take over and relocate the business to a more affordable place in the District.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for so long, and everyone is like family,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, old-timers could only mourn the ending of their corner lounge and its memories.\n\n\u201cShe has always been a fine lady to me,\u201d said Grace Ridgley, who has known Green for 21 years. \u201cI\u2019m hurting because she\u2019s leaving me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Caribbean eatery, which opened near Howard in the 1960s, had been a fixture on U Street since 1994.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/perseus.nobles", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Caribbean eatery, which opened near Howard in the 1960s, had been a fixture on U Street since 1994.", "title": "After decades in D.C., the Islander closes its doors", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/after-decades-in-dc-the-islander-closes-its-doors/2015/07/19/059832da-2675-11e5-b77f-eb13a215f593_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/19/Local/Images/islander-0011437342970.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WilNobles"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/perseus.nobles"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "059832da-2675-11e5-b77f-eb13a215f593"}, "article_summary": "Longtime friends Grace W.
