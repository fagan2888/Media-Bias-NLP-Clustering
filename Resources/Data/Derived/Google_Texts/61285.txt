A moment of testimony and expressing a concern for others.

The fourth testimony outreach program was going on it Frank Berry Courts Saturday. There was free food, fun for the kids and gift cards given away. Elder Frankie Haynes says they want people going through a hard time to know there's hope. He says having a community outreach like this one is a way for others to hear their message and the struggles others have gone through.

"We have men and woman from various churches in the community that have gone through a lot of different things in life. Some have made bad choices, but they're here to tell people that might be presently in those type situations that there's still hope," Haynes says.

Organizers call this the Testimonial Interview Outreach Day.
