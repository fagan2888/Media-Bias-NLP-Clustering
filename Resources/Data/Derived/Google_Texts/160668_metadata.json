J. Paul Brown (R-Ignacio) assured a crowd of about 35 supporters of one thing if he retains his seat in the upcoming November election: He holds the Western Slope near and dear.\n\nA long day of campaigning lay before Brown on Saturday. The itinerary included a stop in each of the six counties within his district, beginning bright and early in Durango and ending at the Brown Bear Cafe in Silverton on Saturday evening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to run again, and we\u2019re going to run hard,\u201d Brown said at the Sorrel Sky Gallery on Main Avenue. \u201cI know water and I know agriculture. I\u2019ve been a county commissioner and school board member. We need the Western Slope voice.\u201d\n\nIn a previous interview with The Durango Herald, Brown said he anticipates more dirty tricks this year after mud flew in 2014 when he took back the district seat from Mike McLachlan, who unseated Brown in the 2012 election. This year, McLachlan\u2019s wife, Barbara McLachlan, will be Brown\u2019s challenger.\n\nBrown said Democrats, who barely hold the House majority today, have stood in the way of the passage of his bills, but that he will continue to push for road infrastructure, improved health care and water storage.\n\n\u201cWe have to come up with alternative solutions with water,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere were 2 million acre feet on the southern plat that went out of the state. We need to store that water.\u201d\n\nBrown also vowed to take a hard stance against ColoradoCare, which he called \u201cObamacare on steroids.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was supposed to take care of us, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do something about that, and I don\u2019t know exactly what, but it affects the Western Slope more than any other area in Colorado.\u201d\n\nLa Plata County Commissioner Brad Blake came out to support Brown and commended the legislator for his \u201cconservative values.\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160116/NEWS01/160119676/", "site_name": "The Durango Herald", "image": "http://durangoherald.com/storyimage/DU/20160116/NEWS01/160119676/AR/0/AR-160119676.jpg?maxw=1000&imageversion=16by9", "type": "article", "title": "Rep.
