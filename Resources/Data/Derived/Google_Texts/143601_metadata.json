A tornado watch has been issued for 14 counties in the metro area and on the Eastern Plains, according to the National Weather Service. Those counties included Douglas, Adams, Logan and Weld.\n\nThat watch was downgraded to a warning at about 3:15 p.m., although Arapahoe and Elbert counties had a warning in effect until 3:45 p.m.\n\nThe Adams 12 Five Star Schools system delayed the release of children after classes until the severe weather subsided.\n\nA severe thunderstorm warning is also in effect for most of the metro area and northeastern Colorado.\n\nSeveral thunderstorms are expected to form over the state and slowly move to the northeast Monday evening.\n\nThere is an 80 percent chance of precipitation in Denver and wind gust could be as strong as 23 mph overnight.\n\nLarge hail and gusty winds are possible in the eastern metro area and Eastern Plains.
