The Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) has posted a guide states can use to fine-tune the population data health insurers use to come up with rates for residents.

CCIIO — the arm of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in charge of managing the parts of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that affect the commercial health insurance market — published this guide for states that want to replace the data in the standard federal Actuarial Value Calculator with state-specific data.
