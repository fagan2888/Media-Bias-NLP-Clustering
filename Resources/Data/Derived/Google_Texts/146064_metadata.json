Pixabay, public domain\n\nThe world faces a huge problem in antibiotic resistance, with recent reports estimating that millions of people will be killed by resistant infections in the coming decades \u2014 potentially even more than the number who die from cancer. It\u2019s been considered a public health crisis for some time now, and unless researchers are able to develop powerful new drugs, it is only going to get worse.\n\nNew research out of the University of East Anglia (UEA) attempts to better understand how resistant bacteria build up their defenses to antibiotics in the hopes of paving the way for developing new drugs that can dismantle a superbug\u2019s defenses, rather than killing the bacteria directly. In other words, the research focuses on how to attack bacteria\u2019s defense walls so they\u2019re unable to build resistance in the first place.\n\nThe study, published in Nature, focused on a type of bacteria known as Gram-negative bacteria. Gram staining is a method researchers use to classify bacterial species and involves a stain that defines bacteria as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative based on the type of cell wall they have. Gram-negative bacteria don\u2019t retain the Gram stain, meaning they have a thinner peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall. This group of bacteria is considered especially difficult to defeat, as they build stronger resistance in their outer membrane, which prevents human antibodies and antibiotic drugs from entering. If this barrier were removed, the bacteria would become far more vulnerable to drugs and the immune system.\n\n\u201cMany current antibiotics are becoming useless, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year,\u201d Professor Changjiang Dong of UEA\u2019s Norwich Medical School, lead author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cThe number of superbugs is increasing at an unexpected rate. Gram-negative bacteria is one of the most difficult ones to control because it is so resistant to antibiotics.\u201d\n\nGram-negative bacteria have a defensive cell wall comprised of beta-barrel proteins, and the researchers found that if they could prevent the beta-barrel assembly machine (BAM) from building defenses in the cell wall, they could prompt the bacteria to die. They focused on the BAMs of E.coli, a Gram-negative bacteria, learning how proteins were built into the outer membrane.\n\n\u201cOur work is the first to show the entire BAM complex,\u201d Dong said in the press release. \u201cIt paves the way for developing new-generation drugs. The beta-barrel assembly machined is absolutely essential for Gram-negative bacteria to survive.\u201d\n\nSince no new antibiotics have been developed since the 1970s, it has been especially difficult for scientists to find new ways to attack resistant bacteria. Last year, the NIH spend $4.8 million to begin a new five-year study that would look into ways to make an old antibiotic \u201clearn new tricks.\u201d And in 2014, researchers from Queen\u2019s University in Northern Ireland developed a gel that could target resistant bacteria that are so rampant in hospitals.\n\nBut until researchers are able to find that drug that can take down Gram-negative bacteria walls, or reinvigorate old antibiotics, the best way to protect yourself from superbugs is to avoid eating foods with antibiotics and taking antibiotics when you don\u2019t need to. In addition, doctors have suggested that maintaining personal cleanliness (washing your hands, staying away from other sick people), and washing and cooking your food properly before eating will help prevent the spread of superbugs.\n\nSource: Gu Y, Li H, Dong H, Zhang Z, Zeng Y, Paterson N.
