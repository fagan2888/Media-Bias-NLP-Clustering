The checklist includes medical criteria, such as minimum oxygen saturation levels and stable oral medication regimens, and patient education, such as counseling to avoid tobacco products, written instructions for salt restriction and plans for follow-up care.\n\nThe average heart failure readmission rate in the U.S. is about 23 percent. That means 23 percent of heart failure patients are readmitted to hospitals within 30 days.\n\nIn the 18 months prior to implementing the checklist, Legacy\u2019s heart failure readmission rate was 19.1 percent. In the first 18 months using the checklist, the hospital\u2019s rate dropped to 15.6 percent.\n\nAnd the rate continues to drop. As of March, heart failure readmissions were down to 12.17 percent, said Dr. Hoa Ly, the medical director for Legacy Inpatient Medicine Service who led the effort.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no going back,\u201d Ly said. \u201cThe early impact is amazing.\u201d\n\nMedicine, in general, is physician-driven, Ly said. Physicians rely on their training and experience when treating patients. But since each physician has a different background, treatment is full of variations, Ly said. That includes when evaluating a patient for discharge from the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis checklist helps us to focus our efforts and standardize what we do,\u201d Ly said.\n\nImproving patient outcomes\n\nHeart failure readmissions usually mean an increase in patient morbidity (rate of incidence of disease) and extra costs for the entire health care system, Ly said. Heart failure patients who are readmitted have typically not fully recovered from their previous stay. That means they arrive sicker and are likely to stay longer, he said.\n\nReducing readmissions provides a better outcome for patients, Ly said.\n\n\u201cThe hospital is never a good place to be, unless you have to,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the checklist, hospital staff have implemented other changes to help reduce readmissions.\n\nFor example, they created simpler take-home packets for patients. In the past, patients were given a thick packet with somewhat complicated information. Now, each heart failure patient gets a straightforward, three-page packet with bullet points and a daily symptom checklist.\n\nA nurse or physician goes over the information in the packet with every patient before they leave and a case manager follows up with them after they leave the hospital, said Susan Frederick, a Legacy registered nurse case manager on the checklist development team.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t change their age, their gender, their ethnicity. I can\u2019t change that they have heart failure,\u201d Frederick said.\n\nShe can, however, give them the information they need to keep themselves out of the hospital in a way they can understand, Frederick said.\n\nHealth reform spurs changes\n\nThe efforts to reduce readmission rates were prompted by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA program under the Affordable Care Act requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to reduce payments to hospitals with too many readmissions for three conditions: heart failure, heart attack and pneumonia.\n\nLegacy Salmon Creek had its checklist in place well before the reductions began in January 2013 and will not be penalized for its readmission rates, Frederick said.\n\nLy and Frederick hope the hospital\u2019s success will encourage other hospitals to adopt similar practices.\n\nThe next step is to implement the checklist throughout the entire Legacy Health system. Frederick and Ly have also met with the leadership at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente and have presented their results at medical conferences.\n\nBut Ly and Frederick aren\u2019t the only ones encouraged. The rest of Legacy\u2019s staff has been pleased by the success of the checklist.\n\n\u201cThe staff know the patients,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal relationship with patients, and they\u2019re happy to see benefits.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Providers at Legacy Salmon Creek Medical Center enjoy helping people feel better, but they'd rather not see their patients again.", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "Providers at Legacy Salmon Creek Medical Center enjoy helping people feel better, but they'd rather not see their patients again.", "title": "Legacy Salmon Creek program reduces return of heart failure patients", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/jun/13/legacy-salmon-creek-program-heart-patients/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "creator": "MarissaHarshman", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "Legacy Salmon Creek program reduces return of heart failure patients"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Carousel,Health,Latest News,Life,Local News,News", "published_time": "2014-06-13 17:00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Since implementing a new discharge checklist in April 2012, Legacy Salmon Creek has reduced its heart failure readmissions by 36 percent.\nThat means 23 percent of heart failure patients are readmitted to hospitals within 30 days.\nHeart failure patients who are readmitted have typically not fully recovered from their previous stay.\nA program under the Affordable Care Act requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to reduce payments to hospitals with too many readmissions for three conditions: heart failure, heart attack and pneumonia.\nI can\u2019t change that they have heart failure,\u201d Frederick said."}
