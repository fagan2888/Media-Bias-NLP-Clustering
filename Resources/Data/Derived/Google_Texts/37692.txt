Is Senator Chuck Schumer really suggesting Obamacare for pets?

Not exactly, but he’s pushing a bill that plants the government’s nose firmly into the veterinarian health care industry.

The unpopular New York senator and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., are announcing legislation that would mandate veterinarians write prescriptions to pet owners instead of forcing the owners to purchase from the doctors themselves, often at a higher cost than pharmacies.

It’s not like there is anything really important going on in the world right now, so let’s find out how well the announcement tweet went for the “clueless” liberal senator:

Fairness to Pet Owners Act will open up the pet meds market, allow owners to shop around & drive exorbitant costs down. W/ @SenBlumenthal — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 20, 2014

@SenSchumer Glad you have time to screw around with this rather than dealing with the collapse of border security. — Gregory Hood (@gregnhood) July 20, 2014

@SenSchumer phew! If the Constitution teaches anything, it’s that the Fed needs to step in when pet meds get too expensive! #standwithpets — John Scaduto (@scadutomoney) July 20, 2014
