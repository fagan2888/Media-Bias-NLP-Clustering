David Ige\u2019s administration decided earlier this month to abandon the troubled Connector, which has struggled since its launch in October 2013 to meet enrollment targets.\n\n(TNS) -- The Hawaii Health Connector began winding down operations on Friday, laying off 29 temporary staff, including outreach workers.\n\n\u201cThere are dozens of charitable organizations that have hired people on the federal grant,\u201d said Jeff Kissel, the Connector\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe impact of the closing of the Connector operations is going to be a lot broader than the 70 people \u2014 which includes temporary and full-time staff \u2014 that are just working through the office.\u201d\n\nClose to 200 people, including those hired by outreach groups, will be affected as the state\u2019s health insurance exchange shuts down, Kissel said.\n\nThrough June 30, the Connector said it has awarded $11.9 million in contracts to 36 marketplace assister organizations for help with outreach and enrollment.\n\nThe state is walking away from a $130 million investment in the Hawaii Health Connector and permanently moving technology functions to the federal Obamacare program.\n\nGov. David Ige\u2019s administration decided earlier this month to abandon the troubled Connector, which has struggled since its launch in October 2013 to meet enrollment targets, provide satisfactory service and raise enough money to be self-sustaining.\n\nThe Connector has burned through $130 million of $204 million in federal money granted to the state to build the exchange.\n\nIge originally thought he could temporarily move Hawaii\u2019s online marketplace to the federal exchange for one year while the state worked on getting the Connector into compliance with the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\nIn recent weeks Ige has decided the best path is to permanently move Hawaii to the federal exchange.\n\nThe governor acknowledged last month that Hawaii is out of compliance with the ACA and is at risk of losing $1 billion in Medicaid funds if Washington does not accept the state\u2019s plan to remedy the ailing Connector.\n\n\u00a92015 The Honolulu Star-Advertiser.
