The social media giant has been in discussions to acquire drone manufacturer Titan Aerospace as a part of the Internet.org initiative to spread Web access to parts of the world underserved by broadband.\n\nThe incentive for tech leviathans like Facebook are obvious. With untapped markets rendered accessible through drone technology, capital dictates: Make it so. Solar-powered satellite drones, which can stay in place for five years, would expand the Web to large areas Africa and other areas currently lacking the infrastructure to join technocapitalism\u2019s networked world.\n\nThe project is couched in the dialect of NGO-speak: using technological advancements to fulfill a social need in less developed countries. Drones in particular serve as smooth vectors for neoliberal expansion. Local infrastructure development is not even required; unmanned satellites can do the job. Just as drone technology has enabled a reshaping of war and military lines, Facebook drones suggest ways in which U.S. corporate interests can find new terrains across which to gain global footholds. The sky is literally the limit.\n\nAnd while it was the fits and starts of Cold War-era market that propelled the West to bring technologies like the building of dams to less developed economies (a vector of liberal-minded capitalism that has been controversial, to say the least), nowadays a pretext of \u201cneed\u201d is enough. As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented on the drones proposal, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to take for granted that most people have access to the Internet, but only one-third of the world, 2.7 billion people, currently have access to the Internet \u2026 We\u2019re not on a path to connect everyone right now, unless something dramatic changes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Couched in NGO-speak of providing for need, satellite drones mean the sky's the limit for technocapital", "title": "Facebook drones: The new vectors of empire", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Couched in NGO-speak of providing for need, satellite drones mean the sky's the limit for technocapital", "title": "Facebook drones: The new vectors of empire", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/04/facebook_drones_the_new_vectors_of_empire/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/zuckerberg_likes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Couched in NGO-speak of providing for need, satellite drones mean the sky's the limit for technocapital", "title": "Facebook drones: The new vectors of empire", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/zuckerberg_likes.jpg", "creator": "@natashalennard", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Natasha Lennard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, development, Drones, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, need, Neo-liberalism, Social Media, titan aerospace", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11c0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: development, Drones, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, need, Neo-liberalism, Social Media, titan aerospace, Technology News, NewsFacebook is reportedly venturing into the drone market.\nJust as drone technology has enabled a reshaping of war and military lines, Facebook drones suggest ways in which U.S. corporate interests can find new terrains across which to gain global footholds.\nThe project is couched in the dialect of NGO-speak: using technological advancements to fulfill a social need in less developed countries.\nWith untapped markets rendered accessible through drone technology, capital dictates: Make it so.\nDrones in particular serve as smooth vectors for neoliberal expansion."}
