Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) has joined a House resolution to sue the executive branch for taking action on the health care law, immigration and other matters contrary to what was passed by Congress.\n\nReferring to the Obama administration\u2019s executive action to unilaterally allow younger illegal immigrants brought to the United States by their parents to be exempt from enforcement laws after Congress rejected the DREAM Act, Gowdy said Obama was \u201csubstitut[ing]\u201d his judgement for Congress\u2019s.\n\n\u201cCongress had a chance to provide a path to citizenship for children and they refused to do so,\u201d Gowdy said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cSo Congress refused to act and the president substitutes his judgment for Congress\u2019s and does by executive fiat what the legislative branch refused to do.\u201d\n\nFurther, Gowdy pointed out, the president has delayed or provided waivers and extensions on complying with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWith the Affordable Care Act, he went to the Supreme Court to get a finding that it was constitutional. It\u2019s been appropriately funded and yet he\u2019s still turning off certain provisions,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cSo even if he likes the law and Congress doesn\u2019t, he does it by executive fiat. If Congress suggests, as we did during the shutdown a remedy to the employer mandate or the individual mandate, he threatens to veto our action and then goes and does it himself.\u201d\n\nAs a co-equal branch of government, Congress must assert itself, Gowdy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like running to the court. I\u2019d like to use any other remedy other than going to the court,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cBut our other remedies have not worked. And the judicial branch is there for a reason and it certain circumstances, Congress ought to be able to assert its standing, and I just think the pervasiveness of his ignoring Congress is reaches the point, we don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, then Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration over the military action in Libya that was done without congressional authorization. The courts ruled that Kucinich as a member of Congress did not have standing.\n\nHowever, Gowdy, a former prosecutor, said that judicial decisions have said that Congress as an institution would have standing. If the House passes the resolution introduced by Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.), it would be up to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to take the action to court.\n\nGowdy wondered which other laws the president can ignore.\n\n\u201cIf you can turn off immigration laws, if you can turn off mandatory minimums in our drug statutes, if you can turn off the so called Affordable Care Act, why not election laws?\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cAssume that a statute said you had to provide two forms of ID to vote. Can the president require three forms of ID? Can the president require one form of ID? Can he suspend all requirements that you show ID? And if not, why not. If you can turn off certain categories of law, do you also not have the power to turn off all categories of the law?\u201d\n\n(H/T: Gateway Pundit)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Taking on what he says is an \u201cunprecedented level\u201d of nullifying the will of Congress by the executive branch,\u00a0Rep.
