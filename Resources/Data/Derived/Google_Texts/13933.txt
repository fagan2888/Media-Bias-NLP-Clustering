It may not be perfect, but Obamacare is helping millions of people every day. Here's just one more indicator of that from the National Health Interview Survey:

In the first half of 2011 through the first half of 2014, approximately one in five persons under age 65 was in a family that had problems paying medical bills in the past 12 months. The number of persons who were in families having problems paying medical bills decreased from 56.5 million in 2011 to 47.7 million in the first 6 months of 2014.

That includes families with children; 23.2 percent had problems paying bills in 2011 versus 18.1 percent in the first half of 2015.

Now, 47.7 million people not being able to pay medical bills is way too high, and that includes the nearly 30 percent who were uninsured. There's a partial solution to thatâ€”Medicaid expansion, which 16 states are still stubbornly refusing.
