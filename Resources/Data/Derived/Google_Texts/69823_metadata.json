They are all in a different state,\" said Carter.\n\nLove's Kitchen and Meals on Wheels in Meridian came together to meet a need in the community. They partnered to serve people in the kitchen along with delivering gifts and meals to the elderly.\n\n\"It means a lot that somebody else cares like they do. I couldn't be at home without Meals on Wheels because I can't stand up to cook. My bones are out of my knee completely,\" said Carter.\n\nFannie Johnson oversees Love's Kitchen.\n\n\"We want everybody to remember the reason for the season is to love and give back. We do this all the time be we were about to make this a little special today,\" said Johnson.\n\nAs Meals on Wheels made their rounds, volunteers in the kitchen fixed dinner plates. Mayor Bland and his family were among those who helped.\n\n\"It's more about giving than receiving, as a family we believe in giving back to others and giving back to the community. We enjoy doing this every Christmas,\" said Bland.\n\nMember of the community Paul Anderson said he has been looking forward to this dinner.\n\n\"It was delicious. I had a good meal. I don't have a family anymore. This is my family,\" said Anderson.\n\nJohnson says she hopes Love's Kitchen will continue to be a safe haven for all to come.\n\n\"We are still trying to reach out and help that working core population to make sure they don't end up homeless, to get them through that hump, to know they have some place to get a meal. They can save their money and keep a roof over their head. They can try to go back to school and come here and eat,\" said Anderson.\n\nBut as for today, Carter says their mission was complete.\n\n\"This is such a surprise. I don't have much to say expect thank you,\" said Carter.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Love's Kitchen and Meals on Wheels in Meridian partnered together to serve dinner and give presents to the community.", "language": "english", "author": "Amicia Ramsey", "og": {"description": "Love's Kitchen and Meals on Wheels in Meridian partnered together to serve dinner and give presents to the community.", "title": "Surprise Visitors Give Elderly Woman Christmas Dinner and Gifts", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Surprise-Visitors-Give-Elderly-Woman-Christmas-Dinner-and-Gifts-363536701.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/390/9D2/3909D2A1C0B3462EB079E425B255EAFF", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/2C4/333/2C4333BEC8BA4E31AFF0732E24705091.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Love's Kitchen and Meals on Wheels in Meridian partnered together to serve dinner and give presents to the community.", "title": "Surprise Visitors Give Elderly Woman Christmas Dinner and Gifts", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Surprise-Visitors-Give-Elderly-Woman-Christmas-Dinner-and-Gifts-363536701.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/agnes.PNG", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Surprise Visitors Give Elderly Woman Christmas Dinner and Gifts", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Surprise Visitors Give Elderly Woman"}, "article_summary": "But as for today, Carter says their mission was complete.\nThey partnered to serve people in the kitchen along with delivering gifts and meals to the elderly.\nLove's Kitchen and Meals on Wheels in Meridian came together to meet a need in the community.\nAs Meals on Wheels made their rounds, volunteers in the kitchen fixed dinner plates.\nI couldn't be at home without Meals on Wheels because I can't stand up to cook."}
