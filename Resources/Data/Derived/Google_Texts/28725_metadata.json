You\u2019re already trying to comply with Obamacare. Then, you\u2019ll have to deal with the DOL\u2019s new overtime exemption rule changes. What\u2019s next?\n\nA wave of workers\u2019 compensation claims, according to one insider.\n\nOur good friends over at SafetyNewsAlert.com recently attended the annual conference for the Association of Occupational Health Professionals in Healthcare and came back with some concerning info for HR pros.\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll double\u2019\n\nWhile presenting at the conference, Phil Walker, the founder of the Phil Walker Work Comp Savings Company and a national trial counsel for employers in California workers\u2019 comp cases, said workers\u2019 compensation claims will double over the next 10 years.\n\nAccording to Fred Hosier, SafetyNewsAlert\u2019s editor-in-chief, Walker said there are three reasons for this:\n\nTechnology will eliminate low-paying jobs. We\u2019re already seeing this at places like Amazon, which is using robots to eliminate warehouse jobs, and Wendy\u2019s, which is starting to use order kiosks in place of warm-blooded order-takers, Walker said. And what happens when low-paying jobs are eliminated? People who occupied those positions file workers\u2019 comp claims. Municipal bankruptcies. It\u2019s no secret cities are having financial problems. As a result, retiree benefits are getting cut, which is already leading to a spike in workers\u2019 comp claims. Walker said when United Airlines filed for bankruptcy, 100% of the people who \u201cretired\u201d filed a workers\u2019 comp claim. And when United tried to enter negotiations to settle these claims, not one person did. Doctors are money-hungry. As a result, Walker said doctors are looking for excuses to perform surgery, are referring more patients to specialists and pain management providers, and billing above cost knowing they\u2019ll settle with insurance companies for far less. Walker said docs are doing this because they\u2019re finding it hard to survive on what Obamacare and Medicare plans are paying them.\n\nWhat can employers do?\n\nIs there a way to avoid the coming workers\u2019 comp avalanche? Walker says there may be.\n\nHe said companies will start requiring their retiring or terminated employees to submit to pre-termination physicals. This will allow employers to screen for any employment-related health problems and, if none are found, provide employers with the ammo needed to refute bogus workers\u2019 comp claims.\n\nThis may be an avenue worth exploring if you start to notice a spike in fishy workers\u2019 comp claims.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "It never ends.
