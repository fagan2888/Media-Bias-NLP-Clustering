Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has issued 103 subpoenas since taking control of the House Oversight Committee in 2011, according to a review by The Hill.\n\nWith the California Republican entering the final months of his chairmanship, his legacy has become a matter of fierce debate, with Democrats arguing he has abused the power of his gavel in a partisan crusade against President Obama.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing politics with these subpoenas. ... He\u2019s pursuing headlines,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the panel and Issa\u2019s frequent sparring partner. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that some of the investigations aren\u2019t warranted, but we could\u2019ve done so much more with the power we have.\u201d\n\nIssa\u2019s supporters say the pace of subpoenas is in line with the 46 that Democrats issued in two years under President George W. Bush, and argue the aggressive oversight has helped root out corruption and mismanagement in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cRanking member Cummings\u2019s criticisms about subpoena numbers were completely absent when a Democratic majority was issuing subpoenas on the same pace during the Bush administration,\u201d said Issa spokesman Frederick Hill.\n\nIssa has become a political lightning rod after years of battle over investigations into the Fast and Furious scandal, the IRS, ObamaCare, and, most recently, the operations of a political office at the White House.\n\nDemocrats have accused Issa of cherry picking testimony, evidence and witnesses to smear the White House, and say he has destroyed any chance for bipartisanship with his management of the committee.\n\nRepublicans, in turn, accuse Democrats of trying to cover up for the president, and say they have shirked their oversight duties by refusing to participate in legitimate investigations.\n\nIssa spokesman Hill said Cummings \u201chas never given the committee cause to see his opposition to individual subpoenas as anything other than a continuing effort to delay and obstruct any oversight that goes beyond the limited and highly selective facts this administration is willing to produce on a voluntary basis.\u201d\n\nRepublicans heavily criticized Cummings last summer when he urged Issa to back off his investigation into whether officials at the Internal Revenue Service unfairly targeted Tea Party groups.\n\n\u201cIf it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on, to be frank with you,\u201d Cummings said in a June 2013 interview on CNN.\n\nThe spokesman noted that only after Issa subpoenaed IRS officials \u201cdid it come clean about destroying critical emails from Lois Lerner,\u201d the former IRS official held in contempt by the House for refusing to testify about her role in the targeting controversy.\n\nIssa is hardly the first Oversight chairman to come under criticism. The panel has long been a magnet for media attention, given its stature as the only House committee with the power to compel testimony and documents from the executive branch.\n\nHistorically, Issa\u2019s subpoena total comes nowhere close to the more than 1,000 subpoenas that former Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) issued in the 1990s during investigations of the Clinton administration.\n\nOne of Burton\u2019s probes famously centered on whether former Clinton aide Vince Foster had been murdered, or if he had committed suicide, which Democrats at the time mocked as a wild conspiracy theory.\n\nRep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), meanwhile, issued 46 subpoenas against the Bush White House when he had the oversight gavel, from 2007 to 2009, four more than Issa issued during his first two years as chairman.\n\nSince January 2013, Issa has issued 61 subpoenas.\n\nCummings said the subpoenas under Waxman were different because the ranking member had input on the process. Issa, he charged, provides little warning or consultation with him or his staff before issuing a subpoena.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to support a subpoena that you don\u2019t even know about,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cWhen there is consultation, that consultation is to tell me when they\u2019re going to issue them.\u201d\n\nIssa\u2019s spokesman rejected that criticism, saying that subpoenas to the administration only happen \u201cwhen the administration tries to stonewall.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Cummings] has never offered his support for the issuance of any subpoena,\u201d he said.\n\nCummings took particular issue with a subpoena Issa issued to David Simas, the director of the administration\u2019s office of political strategy. Issa is investigating the administration\u2019s political office to determine if it complies with federal regulations.\n\nA senior Cummings staffer said Issa\u2019s staff called at 11 a.m. on July 11 alerting them of the action against Simas. Cummings\u2019s office sent a letter at 1:20 p.m. objecting, the staffer said, but by 2:14 p.m., Issa had subpoenaed Simas.\n\nA senior Issa staffer argued that Cummings shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Simas was subpoenaed since he had refused to testify voluntarily before the committee.\n\nIssa\u2019s subpoenas have spanned several investigations, from the IRS to the rollout of ObamaCare to the administration\u2019s response to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nDue to term limits for chairmen, Issa might not have time to finish all his open investigations. Unless GOP leaders grant him a waiver, which is unlikely, Issa will have to hand over the oversight gavel in the next Congress.\n\nBoth Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Michael Turner (R-Ohio) have expressed interest in the position. Cummings said he hopes to have a better working relationship with whoever succeeds Issa.\n\nAnd as for whether Issa will issue any more subpoenas this year?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a better question for the Obama administration,\u201d Hill said.\n\n\u201cSubpoenas are used when voluntary cooperation is not forthcoming. The issuance of subpoenas says more about this administration than the Oversight Committee, Chairman Issa or ranking member Cummings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The House Oversight Committee chairman has issued 103 subpoenas since 2011.", "description": "The House Oversight Committee chairman has issued 103 subpoenas since 2011.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kevin Cirilli", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The House Oversight Committee chairman has issued 103 subpoenas since 2011.", "title": "Subpoenas under Rep.
