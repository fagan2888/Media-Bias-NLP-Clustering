The place was Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, where a new type of aircraft, the Boeing Model 299, was taking the air.\n\nBoeing was about to lock up a critical deal with the U.S. Army Air Corps for the planes, and this flight was part of final evaluations. But after a smooth takeoff, disaster struck quickly. The aircraft stalled and crashed.\n\nPilot error was identified as the cause, spurring talk that the 299 was \u201ctoo much plane for one man to fly.\u201d The future of Boeing was uncertain if the 299 was not viable. How did the company overcome the plane\u2019s dangerous reputation?\n\nChecklists.\n\nBy implementing checklists for takeoff, flight, pre-landing and landing, crews were able to safely fly the 299, which went on to be a huge success under a more familiar name: the B-17.\n\nPrior to the B-17, airplanes were simple enough to fly without rigorous checklists to ensure safety. The plane\u2019s history demonstrates the enormous power that checklists can have when it comes to executing complex tasks successfully, and yet other industries, including health care, took a long time to take a page out of aviation\u2019s book. It wasn\u2019t until Atul Gawande\u2019s bestselling 2009 book The Checklist Manifesto that the idea of checklists in operating rooms became commonplace.\n\nAnd now, checklists are becoming more common in another realm that is becoming more complex: senior housing and care.\n\nBrookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD), by far the nation\u2019s largest owner and operator, has managed to significantly cut costs and reduce hospitalizations from assisted living centers by utilizing a checklist tool known as INTERACT. While the results of the pilot project will not officially be published until 2016, some of the primary findings recently were announced at The Gerontological Society of America\u2019s annual conference in Orlando.\n\nBrookdale\u2019s chief medical officer, Kevin O\u2019Neil, M.D., spoke with Senior Housing News, providing more detail on what made the pilot project successful and why he believes that the checklist approach could catch on industry-wide.\n\nAn Innovation Challenge\n\nShortly after the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Innovation Center. Its goal was to test various new payment and delivery models, and as part of that, the Center made Health Innovations Challenge Grants available. Brookdale wasted no time in applying, with the goal of building up a care transitions program that it already had started to test on a small scale, at facilities in Cleveland, Kansas City and Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nThe core of that program was the INTERACT (Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers) tool. Relying largely on checklists, INTERACT was developed by Joseph Ouslander, M.D., and his colleagues as a way for skilled nursing facilities to keep closer tabs on residents\u2019 conditions and have fewer and more effective transfers into and out of facilities. Initial research showed how well it worked, helping nursing homes achieve a 24% reduction in 30-day readmissions.\n\nO\u2019Neil, who describes Ouslander as a colleague and friend, saw that INTERACT could be the backbone for a similar tool in assisted living, but it needed modification. The $7.3 million Innovations Challenge grant that Brookdale received would support the process of bringing the INTERACT checklists into assisted living.\n\n\u201cIt was a competitive process,\u201d O\u2019Neil says of getting the grant. \u201cCMS received thousands of letters of intent, critically reviewed about 3,000 and made 107 awards.\u201d\n\nWith the money in hand, Brookdale enacted plans to pilot a modified version of INTERACT in close to 45 assisted living buildings. The provider, which operates about 1,100 facilities nationwide, conducted the pilot with researchers from the University of North Texas Health Science Center, the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic (where Ouslander now is a faculty member).\n\nSealing the Cracks\n\nThe goals of the project were ambitious and multi-faceted, and the stakes were high.\n\nJust as in the aviation industry, assisted living providers are dealing with life-or-death situations. O\u2019Neil relates the story of his own mother. When she was transferred to an assisted living center from a hospital stay, there was a miscommunication about her medications. The assisted living staff did not know that she was on the blood thinner Warfarin, and it was only thanks to the vigilance of O\u2019Neil\u2019s sister that the error was caught before a health crisis, such as a stroke, occurred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in checklists,\u201d O\u2019Neil says, of how programs like INTERACT could help prevent situations like this in the future. \u201cPreflight checklists have helped dramatically reduce the instances of plane accidents and errors in that industry. What we wanted to do was improve and provide tools and resources to mitigate the risk of communication gaps, because important information can fall through the cracks.\u201d\n\nWith the increasing complexity of the senior care ecosystem, there\u2019s more potential for communication mis-cues.\n\nAs a practicing geriatrician, O\u2019Neil used to do hospital rounds and also keep track of his patients as they moved into home or hospice care. Now, it\u2019s rare for a physician to be so involved in every level of care, he says. Hospitalists will take the lead when a person is in the acute-care setting, while so-called \u201cSNFists\u201d fill that role more frequently in the skilled nursing facility. Add in pharmacy, primary care and other providers, and it\u2019s easy to see how communication could become complicated.\n\nAnd while saving a person\u2019s life is the ultimate benefit, the potential upside of a system like INTERACT includes stronger referral and revenue streams. Now that hospitals are seeing Medicare dollars tied to their readmission rates, they are being more selective about post-acute referrals.\n\nNot to mention the steep costs related to events like falls, which may become more common as acuity rises in assisted living.\n\nA program at one Brookdale community tracked 12 resident falls in a month. While none was a crisis situation, the estimated cost for each instance ran to $3,000. Being able to reduce these sorts of adverse events through a checklist protocol that flags at-risk residents could be enormously impactful.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s $36,000 a month, and then look company-wide,\u201d O\u2019Neil says. \u201cYou can extrapolate the cost savings.\u201d\n\nLiftoff\n\nAdapting INTERACT for assisted living involved selecting the pieces of the existing SNF program that O\u2019Neil, Ouslander and the other project leaders believed were most relevant.\n\nOne was the STOP AND WATCH Early Learning Tool. \u201cSTOP AND WATCH\u201d is an acronym-based checklist to help assisted living staff keep tabs on resident condition. The \u201cS\u201d stands for \u201cseems different than usual,\u201d for example, while the \u201cT\u201d for \u201ctalks or communicates less, and the \u201cC\u201d for \u201cchange in skin color or condition.\u201d\n\nThe SBAR was another checklist tool that was brought into assisted living. Going through this checklist\u2014which covers situation, background, appearance, and review/notify protocols\u2014helps ensure that when an assisted living staff member contacts a physician, nurse practitioner or other professional, all the essential resident information is at hand.\n\n\u201cI can tell you from prior experience, if I got call from AL, they often didn\u2019t have specific info,\u201d O\u2019Neil says. \u201cThe reflex then is to the send [the resident] to the ER. There are not many office based physicians who are going to have someone urgently transported to their office. Unfortunately, the ER now is being used as a triage point.\u201d\n\nBut just bringing these and other tools into the assisted living setting was not enough. A key element of the pilot was to train every staff member on how to use the resources.\n\n\u201cWe trained everyone,\u201d O\u2019Neil emphasizes. \u201cNot just the CNAs, but the housekeepers, the bus drivers, the dining services, the admin folks, because they\u2019re living and working with these residents day-in and day-out.\u201d\n\nHe relates the story of a housekeeper who noticed a resident seemed not quite herself, and reported it. The resident turned out to have an infection that could have put her quickly into septic shock; the housekeeper\u2019s vigilance and communication likely saved the woman\u2019s life.\n\nBrookdale also looked beyond its own walls for this project. Through the National Center for Assisted Living, it enlisted about 40 other providers to give feedback on the usability of the assisted living tools. They reported that communication tools, decision-support tools and advance care planning tools were particularly effective.\n\n\u201cThe advance care planning piece is really important because what we found, and we weren\u2019t the only one of the awardees to find this, is that many of the folks who are bouncing back to the hospital are at the end of the disease trajectory,\u201d O\u2019Neil says. \u201cIf someone had a better discussion around advance care planning, what their wishes were, we\u2019d see a lot fewer being subjected to burdensome and intrusive interventions.\u201d\n\nThe tool selection, staff training, and industry input seem to have paid off, as reflected in the results shared in Orlando by lead researcher Thomas J. Fairchild, Ph.D., a professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.\n\nParticipating assisted living centers achieved reductions in the mean number of hospitalizations, 30-day readmissions and emergency department trips, and also saw the average total cost for each resident reduced by nearly $30 per day while the experiment was occurring.\n\nA New Standard\n\nWhile the Innovation Grant program has demonstrated the benefits of a checklist approach in assisted living, making the practice standard across the industry certainly is not a given. But already, Brookdale is planning for a wider implementation.\n\nPart of the challenge will be in training. Up until now, specialists with the INTERACT initiative have been able to go on-site and do hands-on training personally. But this will not be possible given the scale of Brookdale. The company is developing a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d approach, to increase the number of people with the expertise to teach the INTERACT protocols in communities, O\u2019Neil says. This might involve a remote training program.\n\nAnother effort underway is to continue to refine the pieces of INTERACT that have been trickier to bring into assisted living, but are needed.\n\n\u201cOne tool that people thought was not as helpful was the medication reconciliation tool. That kind of floored me,\u201d O\u2019Neil says. \u201cI think part of it is the work [the tool] required. But nothing is more important.\u201d\n\nThe challenges may be real, but for those who believe in the checklist approach, there\u2019s reason to be optimistic that it could gain traction quickly. Not only because of the positive initial results, but because the costs to implement do not appear to be prohibitive.\n\nPaper-based INTERACT tools are freely available through the Florida Atlantic University (FAU) website. Digital versions require a licensing fee, which providers can obtain through FAU or vendors that integrate INTERACT in their electronic platforms.\n\nAnd even if it\u2019s not INTERACT, more formalized systems to prevent hospital readmissions may be on the way to assisted living. One such tool, STRAIGHT LINE, was developed by an Idaho physician and entrepreneur and recently hit the market.\n\nLast but certainly not least, there\u2019s the influence that Brookdale wields in the industry due to its scale. Likely, if the company were implementing assisted living checklist tools on its own, this would cause other providers to pay attention and perhaps follow suit. But Brookdale is not keeping its methods and results closely guarded. The priority, according to O\u2019Neil, is to encourage large-scale change.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to lead the charge, but it\u2019s about improving the health, safety wellness of older adults in assisted living for the entire country,\u201d O\u2019Neil says. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to share what we\u2019re learning.\u201d\n\nWritten by Tim Mullaney", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "Through the National Center for Assisted Living, it enlisted about 40 other providers to give feedback on the usability of the assisted living tools.\nThe $7.3 million Innovations Challenge grant that Brookdale received would support the process of bringing the INTERACT checklists into assisted living.\nLikely, if the company were implementing assisted living checklist tools on its own, this would cause other providers to pay attention and perhaps follow suit.\nWhen she was transferred to an assisted living center from a hospital stay, there was a miscommunication about her medications.\nBrookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD), by far the nation\u2019s largest owner and operator, has managed to significantly cut costs and reduce hospitalizations from assisted living centers by utilizing a checklist tool known as INTERACT."}
