And according to a new study, published Friday in the journal Environmental Research Letters, drugs prescribed to treat humans may also be helping out fish.\n\nResearchers at Ume\u00e5 University in Sweden brought wild Eurasian perch from a local lake into the lab and exposed them to Oxazepam, a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and insomnia in humans that\u2019s known to be contaminating the surface water in high concentrations. It\u2019s hard out there for the perch \u2014 they don\u2019t, in general, tend to live very long (only eight percent typically make it to adulthood). But among newly hatched fry and two-year-old fish, a funny thing happened when they were dosed with the drugs.\n\nThey stopped dying:\n\nTurns out, what slows brain activity in humans makes perch bolder, less social and hyperactive (a \u201cparadoxical reaction\u201d also documented in young children). In a previous study, the researchers showed how this leads them to eat more quickly \u2014 which could be causing their increased longevity.\n\nWhen we study the effects environmental toxicants can have on marine life, the researchers argue, this kind of thing is going unnoticed. \u201cEcotoxicological tests were designed with traditional toxic contaminants in mind, such as heavy metals and dioxins, which have historically been the major apparent threat against aquatic organisms in surface waters,\u201d lead author Jonatan Klaminder explained in a press release.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The unexpected \"benefits\" of wastewater pollution", "title": "Your flushed anti-anxiety meds could be increasing the lifespan of fish", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The unexpected \"benefits\" of wastewater pollution", "title": "Your flushed anti-anxiety meds could be increasing the lifespan of fish", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/your_flushed_anti_anxiety_meds_could_be_increasing_the_lifespan_of_fish/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_128341916.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The unexpected \"benefits\" of wastewater pollution", "title": "Your flushed anti-anxiety meds could be increasing the lifespan of fish", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_128341916.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, fish, Pharmaceuticals, Sewage, Wastewater, water pollution", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And according to a new study, published Friday in the journal Environmental Research Letters, drugs prescribed to treat humans may also be helping out fish.\nTopics: fish, Pharmaceuticals, Sewage, Wastewater, water pollution, Sustainability News, NewsWe all know by now that the meds we flush down drains don\u2019t just disappear: lake and river creatures are the unwitting recipients of pharmaceuticals that enter their ecosystem via our sewage.\nBut among newly hatched fry and two-year-old fish, a funny thing happened when they were dosed with the drugs.\nIn a previous study, the researchers showed how this leads them to eat more quickly \u2014 which could be causing their increased longevity.\nThey stopped dying:Turns out, what slows brain activity in humans makes perch bolder, less social and hyperactive (a \u201cparadoxical reaction\u201d also documented in young children)."}
