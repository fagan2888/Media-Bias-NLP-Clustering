He suggested that \u201cineptitude\u201d by the Saudi authorities involved in organizing the hajj was to blame for the two accidents this month that have resulted in at least 830 deaths.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned a Saudi envoy for the second time in as many days to hear protests over the incident, a vice president blamed Saudi \u201cmismanagement,\u201d and thousands marched in the streets and denounced the Saudi royal family.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars and undertaken massive construction projects to make the annual hajj safer for the world\u2019s Muslims, and the last serious loss of life had occurred nine years ago.\n\nIn the worst hajj disaster in a quarter century, two huge waves of pilgrims converged Thursday on a street near a religious site in Mina, and 719 people were crushed or trampled to death, while 863 were injured. That followed an accident Sept. 11 in which a storm toppled a crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca that killed 111 people.\n\nWhile Saudi authorities are still investigating Thursday\u2019s accident, Health Minister Khalid al-Falih has blamed it on the masses themselves, telling a Saudi broadcaster that \u201csome pilgrims had moved in the wrong direction amid the crowds.\u201d\n\nBut a survivor who spoke to The Associated Press said some Saudi guards only exacerbated the stampede at Mina by refusing to open nearby gates that could have relieved the crush.\n\nThe street where the incident took place is about 12 meters (36 feet) wide and lined with barricades, behind which are tents of hajj tour groups. Pilgrims move in one direction to and from a religious complex, where they throw stones at pillars representing the devil. On Thursday, the crowds apparently collided with each other at an intersection, the Interior Ministry said.\n\nSurvivor Mahfouz el-Taweel of Egypt told the AP he was in the crowd packed shoulder to shoulder that collided on the same street with another mass of people coming from a different direction. Those in the back were unaware of this and pressed forward, causing a crush of bodies, trampling and a stampede, the 52-year-old el-Taweel said.\n\n\u201cIf they had barred people from coming the other way, this would not have happened,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to perform the hajj, not to die,\u201d el-Taweel added. \u201cThese people deserve compensation. It\u2019s not just enough to say God\u2019s will and call them martyrs.\u201d\n\nHe said Saudi Arabia should share responsibility for the hajj with a multinational force from some of the countries that send large numbers of pilgrims, such as Egypt.\n\nAbout 2 million pilgrims from more than 180 countries took part in this year\u2019s hajj, which ends Saturday.\n\nPakistan said eight of its pilgrims were killed in the accident, but 150 were still missing. Reports said at least 30 people were killed from Mali, 14 each from Egypt and India, five from Senegal, four from Turkey, and three each from Indonesia and Kenya.\n\nThe deaths of the Iranians ignited long-simmering anger Iran holds for Saudi Arabia over the authority the kingdom exerts over the hajj, especially after allegations in April that Saudi airport officials abused two male pilgrims from Iran.\n\nAlthough hundreds of thousands of Iranians make religious trips to Saudi Arabia each year, Iran for a time stopped sending pilgrims. That came after Saudi security forces killed more than 400 people, mostly Iranians, in a 1987 clash sparked by protesting Iranian pilgrims.\n\nSaudi Arabia fears the growth of Iranian political influence in the Middle East on the back of the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers. In Yemen\u2019s civil war, a Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition supporting the country\u2019s exiled president is bombing Shiite rebels there with links to Iran.\n\nHours after the hajj disaster, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Saudi authorities to accept responsibility for the tragedy, saying it was caused by \u201cmismanagement.\u201d Iranian state-run media and government officials repeated that allegation Friday.\n\nRouhani, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, told a group of editors that both accidents suggested \u201cineptitude\u201d on the part of Saudi authorities. He speculated that more experienced military officials had been diverted to Saudi Arabia\u2019s military intervention in Yemen, leaving less-experienced personnel in charge of the organizing the hajj.\n\n\u201cThese incidents, they do not conform to the normal parameters\u201d of religious pilgrimages or rites, Rouhani said, and the authorities could be viewed as \u201cnot sufficiently responsible to be hosting\u201d such large groups of people.\n\n\u201cWe do not accept and have completely opposed\u201d Saudi policy in Yemen, he said, rejecting Saudi Arabia\u2019s right to \u201cinterfere in Yemen\u2019s internal conflict.\u201d However he said Iran would not hesitate to engage in dialogue with Saudi Arabia \u201cif we see a framework\u201d for such discussions.\n\nIran\u2019s Cabinet held an emergency meeting, and First Vice President Ishaq Jahangiri said it was clear \u201cthe Saudi government is responsible for this disaster \u2026 and has to provide answers.\u201d He added that \u201cmismanagement is definitely the cause\u201d of the tragedy.\n\nThousands of demonstrators in Tehran chanted, \u201cDeath to the al-Saud family,\u201d and Iranian state TV showed similar protests in other Iranian cities.\n\nAyatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani, a senior cleric in Tehran, called for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world\u2019s largest body of Muslim nations, to take over administering the hajj.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi government and authorities involved in hajj should appear before court and be held accountable,\u201d Kashani said. \u201cThey should not lie and say, \u2018It was because this or that, the weather was hot, it was the pilgrims\u2019 faults.'\u201d\n\nSaudi King Salman, who is overseeing his first hajj as ruler, holds the title of \u201ccustodian of the two holy mosques,\u201d which gives the monarchy great religious clout and prestige.\n\nIyad Madani, the secretary-general of the 57-nation OIC, backed Saudi Arabia. He previously served as the kingdom\u2019s hajj minister.\n\nMadani \u201cexpressed hope that no party would seek to take advantage of the pilgrimage and pilgrims, and the incidents that might happen when these crowds of millions perform the same rituals at the same time, in a controversial context that would divide rather than unite,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon\u2019s Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, said the Saudi government bears the responsibility for the accident and called for those countries that lost many victims to join the investigation to ensure there is no cover-up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Huge numbers of pilgrims alone do not explain recurrence of fatal accidents \u2013 state must take blame for poor planning and incompetence., disaster, Hajj, neglect, Saudi Arabia,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Huge numbers of pilgrims alone do not explain recurrence of fatal accidents \u2013 state must take blame for poor planning and incompetence., disaster, Hajj, neglect, Saudi Arabia,", "title": "Saudi Arabia Accused Of Neglect Over Deadly Disaster At Hajj", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-arabia-accused-of-neglect-over-deadly-disaster-at-hajj/209868/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2381.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-25T20:14:05-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huge numbers of pilgrims alone do not explain recurrence of fatal accidents \u2013 state must take blame for poor planning and incompetence., disaster, Hajj, neglect, Saudi Arabia,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2381.jpg", "title": "Saudi Arabia Accused Of Neglect Over Deadly Disaster At Hajj", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Saudi Arabia", "published_time": "2015-09-26T05:00:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T20:14:05-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1def\"", "article_summary": "MINA, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 Saudi Arabia faced new accusations of neglect Friday in the hajj disaster that killed over 700 people, the second tragedy at this year\u2019s pilgrimage overseen by the kingdom\u2019s rulers who base their legitimacy in part on protecting Islam\u2019s holiest sites.\nSaudi Arabia Accused Of Neglect Over Deadly Disaster At HajjHuge numbers of pilgrims alone do not explain recurrence of fatal accidents \u2013 state must take blame for poor planning and incompetence.\nIyad Madani, the secretary-general of the 57-nation OIC, backed Saudi Arabia.\nAlthough hundreds of thousands of Iranians make religious trips to Saudi Arabia each year, Iran for a time stopped sending pilgrims.\nSaudi Arabia fears the growth of Iranian political influence in the Middle East on the back of the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers."}
