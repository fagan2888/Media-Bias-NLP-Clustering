PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - A nonprofit group is working with the Providence VA Medical Center to give away winter clothing to homeless and low-income veterans.

Operation Stand Down Rhode Island helps homeless veterans, and veterans who are at risk of becoming homeless.

The group says it’s holding its second-annual coat giveaway for veterans at the medical center on Chalkstone Avenue in Providence on Monday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

The nonprofit says it’s giving away coats, gloves, hats, blankets and toiletries to help keep veterans warm this winter.

More than 100 coats were donated for the giveaway.
