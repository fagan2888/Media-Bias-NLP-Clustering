(Photo: Coloradoan library)Buy Photo\n\nLiberty Common High School has posted the state\u2019s highest average composite ACT score for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nThough the Fort Collins charter school came up short of its state-record 28.6 composite average set last year, the 27.08 composite average for the school\u2019s 54 seniors is still the state\u2019s best, narrowly edging out the 27.05 compiled by Thomas MacLaren State Charter School of Colorado Springs.\n\nLiberty Common Principal Bob Schaffer, in an e-mail, said the fourth-straight top ranking, \u201cis a function of a solid, coordinated, well-designed, classical curriculum, active and engaged parents, and the best instructors on earth. Clearly, Liberty\u2019s instructional contributions to this extraordinary achievement started in kindergarten.\u201d\n\nLiberty Common was recently ranked Colorado\u2019s best high school by U.S. News and World Report.\n\nAnother Fort Collins charter, Ridgeview Classical, ranked 11th in the state with a 24.6 average, while Fossil Ridge High School was 12th at 24.5.\n\nThe American College Test is a curriculum- and standards-based educational and career planning tool that assesses students\u2019 academic readiness for college.\n\nPoudre High School\u2019s average was 21.8 and Fort Collins High School\u2019s average was 21.7.\n\nThe Poudre School District average was 22.5, 10th-best among Colorado\u2019s 178 school districts, and an improvement from last year\u2019s average of 22.3.\n\nThe state average was 20.1, down from 20.3 in 2014.\n\nApproximately 55,379 students, up from 54,512 in 2014, took the exam in Colorado, according to the Colorado Department of Education.\n\nThe ACT consists of multiple-choice tests in English, math, reading and science. Statewide, all subject areas were down slightly in 2015, with the exception of science, which increased from 20.4 in 2014 to 20.5 in 2015.\n\nHowever, PSD\u2019s average in all subject areas either met or exceeded last year\u2019s averages, highlighted by a 0.6 percent increase, to 22.6, in science.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1F2SeNr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Liberty Common Charter School in Fort Collins posts Colorado top ACT scores", "og": {"site_name": "Coloradoan", "description": "Liberty Common Charter School in Fort Collins posts Colorado top ACT scores", "title": "Liberty Common again posts state\u2019s top ACT scores", "url": "http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2015/09/11/liberty-common-high-school-act-score/72097910/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/coloradoan.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liberty Common Charter School in Fort Collins posts Colorado top ACT scores", "title": "Liberty Common posts state's top ACT scores", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/11/FortCollins/B9318813758Z.1_20150911182853_000_GO0BT5S14.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@coloradoan", "site": "@coloradoan", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743847167", "fb": {"app_id": 140942715960163}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Liberty Common Charter School, Fort Collins, Fort Collins public schools, Colorado ACT scores, Colorado school testing"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2587\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Liberty Common High School posted the state\u2019s highest average composite ACT score for the fourth consecutive year.\n(Photo: Coloradoan library)Buy PhotoLiberty Common High School has posted the state\u2019s highest average composite ACT score for the fourth consecutive year.\nPoudre High School\u2019s average was 21.8 and Fort Collins High School\u2019s average was 21.7.\nClearly, Liberty\u2019s instructional contributions to this extraordinary achievement started in kindergarten.\u201dLiberty Common was recently ranked Colorado\u2019s best high school by U.S. News and World Report.\nThe state average was 20.1, down from 20.3 in 2014."}
