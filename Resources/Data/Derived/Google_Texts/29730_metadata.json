Six people died in the area designated as the new 40km/h zone.\n\nNew speed limit for the city: Roads Minister Duncan Gay has proposed cars travel at 40km/h throughout Sydney's CBD.

In Centennial Park, where there's pedestrians and bikes, everyone abides by the 30km/h limit.\"\n\nHe said the current limit of 40km/h was \"too high\", and dropping it by 10km/h would cut the fatality rate \"by about 10 per cent\".", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The speed limit in the Sydney CBD will be cut to 40km/h after a spate of pedestrian deaths.", "title": "Sydney CBD speed limit to be reduced to 40km/h, Duncan Gay says", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-cbd-speed-limit-to-be-reduced-to-40kmh-duncan-gay-says-20140526-38zj7.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/z/j/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.38zj7.png/1401101849187.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/z/j/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.38zj7.png/1401101849187.jpg"}, "title": "Sydney CBD speed limit to be reduced to 40km/h, Duncan Gay says", "description": "The speed limit in the Sydney CBD will be cut to 40km/h after a spate of pedestrian deaths.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The speed limit in the Sydney CBD will be cut to 40km/h after a spate of pedestrian deaths."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8baa\"", "article_summary": "There are already 40km/h speed limits in Millers Point, Woolloomooloo, Darlinghurst, Surry Hills, Redfern, Chippendale, Rosebery, Leichhardt and Erskineville.\nNew speed limit for the city: Roads Minister Duncan Gay has proposed cars travel at 40km/h throughout Sydney's CBD.\n\"During peak times at schools that's the speed limit we need to have.\nCars to travel 10km/h slower: Map of the area affected by the new speed limit.\nThe speed limit in a large part of the CBD will be lowered to 40km/h in a move aimed at reducing the number of pedestrian deaths in the city."}
