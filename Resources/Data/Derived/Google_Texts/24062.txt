Parents of a former University of Kansas student who says she was raped in university housing are suing the university, claiming its housing is unsafe.

The university, however, says its campus and housing are safe and that it works hard to ensure student safety.

In the lawsuit filed Friday in Douglas County, James and Amanda Tackett's daughter, Daisy Tackett, says she was a freshman at the University of Kansas when she was raped in a university apartment by another student-athlete in 2014.

The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, claims the university has misled the public by representing campus housing as safe.

The Associated Press doesn't normally name rape victims, but Daisy Tackett, a former varsity rower, told The Lawrence Journal-World and The Dallas Morning News she wanted her name used.
