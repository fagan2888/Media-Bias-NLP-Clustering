Slavin said emergency medicine is at capacity almost every day, leading to \u201cdelays, dissatisfaction, and sometimes even concerns about quality and safety.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisits to the emergency department at the state\u2019s largest academic medical center have increased by 18 percent since 2010, Slavin outlined in his monthly memo, and now top more than 100,000 a year.\n\nIn addition to general demand, more patients are coming in for high-intensity, complex care that ties up beds longer, said Sally Mason Boemer, MGH\u2019s senior vice president of finance. The hospital is also seeing more patients arrive from many areas outside of Boston.\n\nA lack of available beds forced 80 percent of all patients last year to wait in the emergency room for varying periods of time.\n\nThe crux of the problem is 30 to 45 unused beds in shared rooms at any given time because of issues ranging from an inability to match patient gender, to an unwillingness to pair a patient in a room with someone suffering from a disruptive mental health issue, Mason Boemer said. This, combined with an increase in patients, thrusted MGH back to its preexpansion dilemma.\n\n\u201cOne of the clear lessons learned is the value of single rooms,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were more demands than we anticipated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year following the addition of 100 beds, there was a \u201cbrief moment of relief,\u201d but logjams began to creep up again in 2014, Mason Boemer said.\n\nIn the course of a year, MGH experienced a staggering 164 percent spike in the number of instances that the emergency department reached \u201ccode help\u201d or \u201ccapacity disaster\u201d status. The codes are activated after emergency departments are filled with a certain number of patients who have been admitted but have not been assigned a bed.\n\nAnd overcrowding isn\u2019t just affecting the emergency department. On a daily basis the state\u2019s largest teaching hospital is between 95 and 100 percent full at peak times, such as midday.\n\n\u201cWe know we must ramp up our efforts to provide efficient care \u2014 care that is safe, appropriate, and timely,\u201d Slavin said.\n\nTo address what Slavin calls an \u201cescalating situation,\u201d a task force comprising hospital leaders was formed and charged with coming up with immediate and long-term solutions.\n\nThe task force is divided into three groups focused on reducing the demand for beds; working to reduce patient readmissions; and identifying internal issues that may contribute to the gridlock.\n\n\u201cThis is an institutional problem, not an emergency problem,\u201d Mason Boemer said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be doing this task force if I had those 30 to 45 beds.\u201d\n\nThe hospital, part of Partners HealthCare of Boston, has also tapped the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for management expertise to help the groups determine whether their proposed solutions will work. Slavin said those recommendations could come in a few months.\n\nSlavin\u2019s comments come just as Boston Children\u2019s Hospital administrators are in the midst of seeking approval from state officials to build a 575,000-square-foot facility at its Longwood Avenue campus specifically due to a lack of capacity.\n\nAt a hearing before state public health officials last week, Children\u2019s chief executive Sandra L. Fenwick said that hospital\u2019s young patients are experiencing increasing wait times due to overcrowding, with many spending nights in the emergency room.\n\nBackup issues are plaguing emergency rooms in hospitals nationwide, said Caroline Steinberg, vice president of trends analysis for the American Hospital Association, a national advocacy group.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2014, the number of emergency room visits nationwide increased by about 40 percent, even as the number of emergency departments declined, Steinberg said. Hospitals recorded 31 million emergency room visits in 2014, up from 22 million in 2000.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.2655330636", "eomportal-id": 508758, "description": "Over the past five years, visits to MGH\u2019s emergency department have increased by 18 percent.
