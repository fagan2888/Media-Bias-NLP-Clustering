Consider: The country added 3.3 million jobs in the first full year of implementation of health care reform, that purported job-killer; unemployment has plunged to 5.5 percent from 10 percent during the darkest days of the downturn; and the top job-creating state right now is deep-blue California, upending the Rick Perry narrative holding that only low-tax, low-regulation red states are supposed to prosper.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman presents us with this economic picture in his New York Times column today, asking why the right can\u2019t seem to \u201chandle the good news.\u201d He identifies three principal reasons.\n\nFirst, Krugman posits, conservatives are beset by Obama Derangement Syndrome, a phenomenon that hardly requires further elucidation. Naturally, the right is not inclined to credit a president they\u2019ve called everything from an illegal alien to a Stalinist dictator with an improving economy.\n\nThen there\u2019s the conservatives\u2019 fantasy that they \u201cpossess the secret key to prosperity,\u201d as Krugman puts it. This is evident in the ludicrous claims of politicians like Rand Paul that St. Ronald of Tampico (that\u2019s Ronald Wilson Reagan for the heathens among you) was the last chief executive to preside over good economic times, even though Bill Clinton\u2019s administration oversaw the creation of more jobs (23 million) than Reagan\u2019s (try 16 million).
