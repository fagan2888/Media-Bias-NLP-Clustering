Though the deal has been terminated, Ares announced it would invest $150 million in Kayne's energy activities.\n\nLos Angeles-based Kayne is an alternative asset management firm that invests in energy and energy infrastructure, specialized real estate, middle market credit and private equity.\n\nThe two plan to keep an eye out for collaborative marketing opportunities, including jointly managing separately managed accounts, and other products, they say.\n\nAlthough it wasn't Ares' original plan, the firm joins a handful of others that have also made asset management investments.

(NYSE: NSAM) picked up a majority stake in GTCR-backed the Townsend Group for $380 million, and before that, Hellman & Friedman LLC grabbed a stake in Edelman Financial Services.\n\nThe low but fluctuating price of crude oil has spurred both M&A and bankruptcy activity as certain companies seek less-expensive investment opportunities and others struggle. Recent deal announcements in the energy sector include Duke Energy Inc.'s (NYSE: DUK) deal for Piedmont Natural Gas Co. (NYSE: PNY), and Energy Transfer Equity LP's purchase of Williams Cos.\n\nFor more on the energy sector, see Investors Flow Into Oil & Gas and check out the energy edition of Mergers & Acquisitions Mid-Market Pulse, a forward-looking sentiment indicator derived from monthly surveys of approximately 250 executives and published in partnership with McGladrey LLP.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_services/ares-kayne-anderson-call-off-merger-258635-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/tony-ressler.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Ares & Kayne Anderson Call Off Merger, Citing Energy Markets"}}, "article_summary": "Ares & Kayne Anderson Call Off Merger, Citing Energy MarketsInstead, Ares, under CEO Tony Ressler, will invest $150M in asset-management firm Kayne's energy activitiesAres Management LP (NYSE: ARES) and Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors LP have terminated their merger agreement, saying that the companies had different views about the merger because of the state of the energy market, which has remained volatile since the deal was announced in July.\nLos Angeles-based Kayne is an alternative asset management firm that invests in energy and energy infrastructure, specialized real estate, middle market credit and private equity.\nAlthough it wasn't Ares' original plan, the firm joins a handful of others that have also made asset management investments.\nThough the deal has been terminated, Ares announced it would invest $150 million in Kayne's energy activities.\n\"While we continue to strongly believe in Kayne and the long-term energy investment opportunity, it became clear this was not the right time to bring together our cultures and business models into a merged public company,\" says Ares CEO Tony Ressler."}
