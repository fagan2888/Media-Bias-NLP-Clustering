But despite \u201ca lot of hype about it,\u201d said Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein, a Tufts University professor of nutrition science and policy, \u201cthere\u2019s virtually no data to support the hype.\u201d\n\nCoconut oil is high in saturated fat, which has been linked to high cholesterol levels and heart disease. Though critics have recently raised questions about the scientific evidence for the link, longstanding dietary guidelines urge Americans to reduce saturated fat intake to less than 10 percent of daily calories.\n\nThere is little research on the health effects in people of coconut oil, Lichtenstein said, but \u201cthere appears to be no independent benefit of consuming it.\u201d\n\nThat said, virgin coconut oil may not have the same harmful effects as highly processed oils, said Dr. Tom Brenna, a professor of human nutrition at Cornell University. Refined, bleached and deodorized \u2014 RBD \u2014 coconut oil, treated with solvents and subjected to intense heat, raises cholesterol so reliably that scientists have used it as a control in experiments. The harsh processing may destroy some of the good essential fatty acids and antioxidants, such as lauric acid.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to use coconut oil, make sure you get virgin oil,\u201d Brenna said.\n\n\u2014 Roni Caryn Rabin, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/06/coconuts-002.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to use coconut oil, make sure you get virgin oil,\u201d Brenna said.\nQ: Why is coconut oil suddenly considered healthy after being declared unhealthy for three decades?\nRefined, bleached and deodorized \u2014 RBD \u2014 coconut oil, treated with solvents and subjected to intense heat, raises cholesterol so reliably that scientists have used it as a control in experiments.\nA: Coconut oil\u2019s image has had a makeover in recent years.\nThere is little research on the health effects in people of coconut oil, Lichtenstein said, but \u201cthere appears to be no independent benefit of consuming it.\u201dThat said, virgin coconut oil may not have the same harmful effects as highly processed oils, said Dr. Tom Brenna, a professor of human nutrition at Cornell University."}
