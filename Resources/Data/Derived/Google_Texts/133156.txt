Fiorina was asked what she would say to China’s president when he visits the White House. She answered, “I would say several things. First, China has made a bargain with their people. Their people have accepted a repressive, totalitarian regime in exchange for economic growth, and so China’s ability to keep growing is at the core of their power. I would say first that we are going to be more aggressive in helping our allies in that region push back against new Chinese aggression, whether those allies are Australia, or Japan, or the Philippines. I would be conducting actually now, at a moment when China’s economy is wavering a bit, I would be conducting more flyovers on the South China Sea. We cannot permit China to control a trade route through which passes $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year. And finally, I would say that Chinese cyberattacks are an act of aggression on the United States, and they must stop. It is also true that our government has to be more competent about detecting and repelling those attacks.”
