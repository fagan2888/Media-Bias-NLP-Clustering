I mean, that\u2019s just not capitalism. We have too many people that don\u2019t work to eat.\u201d\n\nObamacare appears to be worsening America\u2019s dependency issue. The Associated Press reported food-stamp enrollment increased in 11 states between January 2013 and the end of 2014, the period during which Obamacare went into effect.\n\nTen of those 11 states expanded Medicaid under the ACA, and six of them used new online enrollment systems that made it easy for customers to sign up for both Medicaid and food stamps at the same time. Such streamlined application systems were built specifically for the health-care overhaul.\n\nIn total, nearly 632,000 people were added to the food-stamp rolls in those 11 states during that period, at an estimated cost of almost $79 million a month to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food-stamp program also known as SNAP. This came at a time when the national economy was improving and food-stamp enrollment declined nationwide.\n\nDr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, sees the phenomenon as part of a government attempt to place more Americans under its thumb.\n\n\u201cSelf-reliant Americans are being crushed by taxation and regulation, directly and indirectly, and turned into government dependents,\u201d Orient said. \u201cHow can you resist if government can cut off your food and medicine?\u201d\n\nIn almost all of the 16 states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, food-stamp rolls have been decreasing as the economy improves.\n\nHieb, author of \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare,\u201d said Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion damaged the American medical system by dropping people from their private insurance and putting them on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cPeople think that all these people getting on Medicaid through Obamacare were uninsured,\u201d Hieb said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. A number of those people had private insurance, but now, because they qualify under these new guidelines, why not have somebody else pay for your health insurance? So instead of paying for health insurance, they\u2019re taking Medicaid.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cSo you\u2019ve turned paying patients into nonpaying patients. It\u2019s absolutely, clearly a failing economic model, and I don\u2019t understand how smart people believe it. I just don\u2019t understand how they do not see that point.\u201d\n\nBe medically prepared for health disaster! Get Dr. Lee Hieb\u2019s \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare\u201d\n\nHieb, an orthopedic surgeon, has observed firsthand the damage Medicaid expansion has done to hospitals. She recently reached the end of a contract to perform surgery two-and-a-half days a week at a small hospital, and she is now looking for a similar arrangement. However, she says she\u2019s found hospitals are running scared from orthopedic surgeons like her because they fear they won\u2019t make enough money to pay the surgeons\u2019 salaries.\n\nAccording to Hieb, the hospitals are struggling to bring in money because of the increase in Medicaid patients and corresponding decrease in private-pay patients. Medicaid does not reimburse hospitals as much as private insurance does. Hospitals have also struggled to cope with Medicare provider payment cuts and increased administrative paperwork.\n\nBut while Medicaid expansion has hurt hospitals, it has been a boon to health-care consumers. In states that expand Medicaid, adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level must qualify, and states are allowed to set even higher thresholds. Before the ACA took effect, the median Medicaid eligibility limit for parents was 106 percent of the federal poverty level. Medicaid expansion also made adults without dependent children eligible for the first time.\n\nHieb said she believes Americans are smart enough to act in their own financial self-interest, and, for many who hover just above the poverty level, that involves taking advantage of the welfare system. Hieb lives among the patients she serves in rural Iowa, and she says they know how to look out for themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think that all these poor people are children who cannot navigate this very complex medical system,\u201d Hieb asserted. \u201cThese are the people who have figured out if you don\u2019t make $35,000 a year working, it\u2019s not worth working because you can do that well if you know how to work the system of welfare.\u201d\n\nIf people can cobble together enough disability payments, unemployment payments and food stamps to earn a halfway decent living, Hieb argued, they are smart enough to hitch themselves to Medicaid, even if they might be able to afford health insurance on their own.\n\n\u201cPeople act in their own economic self-interest,\u201d Hieb said. \u201cIf you can get things for free, why pay for them?\u201d\n\nShe answered her own question: \u201cOne, because that\u2019s ethical, and two, medical providers cannot be in business unless somebody actually pays the bill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "By Paul Bremmer The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has created more dependency on government and perverted the capitalist foundations of America, according to a top surgeon. \u201cYou just can\u2019t keep giving everything away to people without them working for it,\u201d said Dr. Lee Hieb, former president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
