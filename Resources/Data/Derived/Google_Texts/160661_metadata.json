These four individuals have also brought clients to the White House, some of whom asked for tax breaks for U.S. financial companies.\n\nBrendan Daly and Hilary Rosen, public relations consultants, were also attendants of the Obama administration\u2019s regular communications meetings and have brought clients to the White House. In fact, Rosen, who infamously claimed on television in 2012 that Ann Romney \u201cnever worked a day in her life,\u201d insists that the White House solicited her for the client meetings.\n\nIn sum, these four lobbyists and two PR consultants have brought 31 different clients\u2013General Electric, the American Wind Energy Association, and BP, among others\u2013to the Obama White House for over 55 meetings since the president assumed office in 2009.\n\nHowever, the administration maintains that Obama has delivered on his promise to curtail lobbying efforts in the president\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has done more in the past six years to close the revolving door of special interests than any president before him,\u201d White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz alleged.\n\nThe individuals in attendance at the administration\u2019s communications meetings, meant to facilitate \u201coutward engagement,\u201d Schultz said, have consistently defended Obama on topics such as Obamacare, the Islamic State (IS, also known ISIS and ISIL), and immigration in the media.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, we value our external outreach and outward engagement\u2013excluding outside voices from our consultations would be a narrow-minded approach to public service,\u201d Schultz explained.\n\nThe White House has hosted 16 of such meetings thus far in 2015.\n\nOne of the registered lobbyists, David Goodfriend, held a post as an aide in the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cI am a friend of the White House,\u201d he told USA Today, saying that he has \u201cdefended the administration on TV.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president in 2016, has been scrutinized for her own connection to lobbyists. At least six major staffers on the Clinton campaign have at some point worked as registered lobbyists. Famed Washington, D.C., lobbyist Heather Podesta is also hosting a Clinton fundraiser later this month.\n\nLobbyists have already bundled millions to Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration has hosted regular communications meetings with about two dozen Democrats who regularly defend the president in the mainstream media.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Though President Obama promised\u00a0when he took office in 2009 to\u00a0\u201cclose the revolving door\u201d admitting lobbyists into the White House, his administration has hosted regular communications meetings", "title": "Obama Administration Has Hosted Regular Meetings With Lobbyists As Part of \u2018External Outreach\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/obama-administration-has-hosted-regular-meetings-with-lobbyists-as-part-of-external-outreach/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/President-Obama2-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though President Obama promised\u00a0when he took office in 2009 to\u00a0\u201cclose the revolving door\u201d admi", "creator": "@mchalfant16", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/President-Obama2-150x150.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Has Hosted Regular Meetings With Lobbyists As Part of \u2018External Outreach\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Brendan Daly and Hilary Rosen, public relations consultants, were also attendants of the Obama administration\u2019s regular communications meetings and have brought clients to the White House.\nThese four individuals have also brought clients to the White House, some of whom asked for tax breaks for U.S. financial companies.\nOne of the registered lobbyists, David Goodfriend, held a post as an aide in the Clinton administration.\nThe White House has hosted 16 of such meetings thus far in 2015.\nAt least six major staffers on the Clinton campaign have at some point worked as registered lobbyists."}
