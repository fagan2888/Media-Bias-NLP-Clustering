It's humiliating and wrong.'\n\nThe practice faces being banned in New York after a backlash and has sparked a political row in the UK with Labour condemning the covert \u2018segregation\u2019.\n\nThe housing block in Woolwich where tenants are frustrated they are being segregated from wealthier neighbours\n\nThe problem stems from rules which are supposed to stop areas becoming ghettos for the very rich.\n\nWhen planning permission is granted, developers are often told to set aside a set number of units for affordable housing.\n\nFrom the outside, there is often no way of telling the more basic homes from the hi-spec apartments aimed at the super-rich.\n\nBut behind the fa\u00e7ade, less well-off tenants are forced to enter through different doors and use separate bicycle racks, bins and post boxes.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds told MailOnline: \u2018I am strongly against this kind of segregation. There shouldn\u2019t be separate doors for people living in affordable housing.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "The,poor,door,Block,flats,separate,entrances,property,owners,housing,association,tenant,neighbours", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714809/The-poor-door-Block-flats-separate-entrances-property-owners-housing-association-tenant-neighbours.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Residents from a block of flats in Woolwich have criticised the building's policy of making low income tenants use a separate entrance.", "title": "Apartment block has two entrances for rich and low income residents", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714809/The-poor-door-Block-flats-separate-entrances-property-owners-housing-association-tenant-neighbours.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/03/article-0-2038C7BA00000578-763_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2714809/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2714809/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2714809, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "The,poor,door,Block,flats,separate,entrances,property,owners,housing,association,tenant,neighbours", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-08-03T15:53:05.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Corey+Charlton", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-08-04T13:23:40.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "The poor door Block flats separate entrances property owners housing association tenant neighbours"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Residents from a block of flats in Woolwich have criticised the building's policy of making low income tenants use a separate entrance.", "title": "Apartment block has two entrances for rich and low income residents", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714809/The-poor-door-Block-flats-separate-entrances-property-owners-housing-association-tenant-neighbours.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/03/article-0-2038C7BA00000578-763_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2014/07/1418450360_3700354260001_237876560.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Residents from a block of flats in Woolwich have criticised the building's policy of making low income tenants use a separate entrance."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f15\"", "article_summary": "London Mayor Boris Johnson recently faced calls to ban \u2018poor doors\u2019 in upmarket blocks of flats, which force people on low incomes to use different entrances.\nResidents at housing flats in South London have criticised the building's segregated entrances policy, where one doorway is set aside for the rich and the other for its housing association tenants.\nWhen planning permission is granted, developers are often told to set aside a set number of units for affordable housing.\nBut developers in London are promising wealthy tenants they will not have to share their smart lobby entrances, courtyard gardens or secure parking with people living in flats classed as \u2018affordable housing\u2019.\nThere shouldn\u2019t be separate doors for people living in affordable housing."}
