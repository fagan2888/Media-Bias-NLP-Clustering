Recently, researchers have found that stress in children in particular is linked to an increased likelihood of obesity and other health problems in adulthood. However, in a new study, which was presented at the American Psychosomatic Society in San Francisco, researchers found that the impact of stress on children has more far-reaching \u2014 and immediate \u2014 effects than previously thought.\n\n\u201cThe kids who have the highest number of adverse experiences have the highest likelihood of having multiple conditions,\u201d Melissa Bright, the study\u2019s author and a research coordinator at the University of Florida\u2019s Institute of Child Health Policy, said in a press release. \u201cIt is not one poor health outcome; it is a whole slew of poor outcomes across the board.\u201d\n\nIn the study, Bright and her team reviewed data of 96,000 children around the U.S., which included the number of difficult experiences the kids have faced \u2014 ranging from economic difficulties to parental divorce, to exposure to violence. Some 11 to 24 percent of parents reported that their kids had been diagnosed with some disorder, whether it be mental, learning, or physical; and about four percent of parents reported that their kids had all three. The authors found that kids who had been through difficulties were far more likely to have a disorder in every category than kids who hadn\u2019t experienced such stressful events.\n\nThe authors naturally link these disorders to chronic stress, which can be toxic to the mind and body; it changes the body\u2019s neuroendocrine and immune systems, making it easier for stressed people to get sick. \u201cThese adverse experiences are affecting multiple domains of health simultaneously,\u201d Bright said in the press release. \u201cWe need a holistic approach to tackle this issue.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to remember that though there is a correlation between stress and mental, physical, and learning disorders, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the stress is the direct cause: \u201cIt is also possible that having a child with multiple health conditions puts serious financial and emotional strains on families, making them more susceptible to adverse experiences such as caregiver mental illness and divorce,\u201d Bright said. The researchers plan on investigating this further.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stress is a normal part of life that everyone must face, and for children it can be a learning experience, coaxing them to begin finding ways to cope with difficulties. But the benefits of stress begin to \u201cdiminish when it is severe enough to overwhelm a child\u2019s ability to cope effectively,\u201d the CDC writes. \u201cIntensive and prolonged stress\u2026can disrupt early brain development and compromise functioning of the nervous and immune systems. In addition, childhood stress can lead to health problems later in life including alcoholism, depression, eating disorders, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases.\u201d\n\nThere are usually three different types of stress: positive stress response, which is short-lived and essential to normal development, like facing up to the fear of talking to new people or getting a shot. There is also tolerable stress response, which prompts the body\u2019s systems to a higher degree, which may involve a natural disaster, the loss of a loved one, or a scary incident. Toxic stress, however, is the worst and the most damaging kind of stress \u2014 when a child experiences prolonged difficulties like emotional abuse or neglect.\n\nThe CDC explains that toxic stress, like child abuse, can impair brain circuits, which are particularly vulnerable during early childhood. High levels of stress hormones like cortisol, meanwhile, can impair the immune system, damage the hippocampus, and ultimately create a lasting impact into adulthood. \u201cIf we can identify these changes early on, then we can develop interventions to hopefully prevent some of these poor outcomes,\u201d Bright said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chronic stress in kids, immune systems, health effects of stress, kids with stress, stressed out kids", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of chronic toxic stress, which can impair their immune systems and brain development.", "title": "Chronic Stress Takes A Toll On Kids, Weakens Their Immune Systems", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chronic-stress-worsens-kids-immune-systems-ability-fight-disease-271324", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/child-stress.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of chronic toxic stress, which can impair their immune systems and brain development.", "title": "Chronic Stress Takes A Toll On Kids, Weakens Their Immune Systems", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chronic-stress-worsens-kids-immune-systems-ability-fight-disease-271324", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/child-stress.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/child-stress.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-15T16:41:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-15T16:41:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of chronic toxic stress, which can impair their immune systems and brain development."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3373\"", "article_summary": "The CDC explains that toxic stress, like child abuse, can impair brain circuits, which are particularly vulnerable during early childhood.\nToxic stress, however, is the worst and the most damaging kind of stress \u2014 when a child experiences prolonged difficulties like emotional abuse or neglect.\nRecently, researchers have found that stress in children in particular is linked to an increased likelihood of obesity and other health problems in adulthood.\nHigh levels of stress hormones like cortisol, meanwhile, can impair the immune system, damage the hippocampus, and ultimately create a lasting impact into adulthood.\n\u201cIntensive and prolonged stress\u2026can disrupt early brain development and compromise functioning of the nervous and immune systems."}
