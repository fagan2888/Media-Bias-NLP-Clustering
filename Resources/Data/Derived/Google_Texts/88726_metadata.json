After eating some barbecue, a group of us decided to take a walk along the ocean. The mood on the beach that day was festive. Music from a nearby party pulsed through the haze of sizzling meat. Lovers strolled hand in hand. Giggling children chased each other along the boardwalk.\n\nMost of the foot traffic was heading in one direction, but then two teenage girls came toward us, moving stiffly against the flow, both of them looking nervously to their right. \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun,\u201d one of them said in a low voice.\n\nI turned my gaze to follow theirs, and was clasping my 4-year-old daughter\u2019s hand when a young man extended his arm and fired off multiple shots along the busy street running parallel to the boardwalk. Snatching my daughter up into my arms, I joined the throng of screaming revelers running away from the gunfire and toward the water.\n\nThe shots stopped as quickly as they had started. The man disappeared between some buildings. Chest heaving, hands shaking, I tried to calm my crying daughter, while my husband, friends and I all looked at one another in breathless disbelief. I turned to check on Hunter, a high school intern from Oregon who was staying with my family for a few weeks, but she was on the phone.\n\n\u201cSomeone was just shooting on the beach,\u201d she said, between gulps of air, to the person on the line.\n\nUnable to imagine whom she would be calling at that moment, I asked her, somewhat indignantly, if she couldn\u2019t have waited until we got to safety before calling her mom.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI am talking to the police.\u201d\n\nMy friends and I locked eyes in stunned silence. Between the four adults, we hold six degrees. Three of us are journalists. And not one of us had thought to call the police. We had not even considered it.\n\nWe also are all black. And without realizing it, in that moment, each of us had made a set of calculations, an instantaneous weighing of the pros and cons.\n\nAs far as we could tell, no one had been hurt. The shooter was long gone, and we had seen the back of him for only a second or two. On the other hand, calling the police posed considerable risks. It carried the very real possibility of inviting disrespect, even physical harm. We had seen witnesses treated like suspects, and knew how quickly black people calling the police for help could wind up cuffed in the back of a squad car. Some of us knew of black professionals who\u2019d had guns drawn on them for no reason.\n\nThis was before Michael Brown. Before police killed John Crawford III for carrying a BB gun in a Wal-Mart or shot down 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a Cleveland park. Before Akai Gurley was killed by an officer while walking in a dark staircase and before Eric Garnerwas choked to death upon suspicion of selling \u201cloosies.\u201d Without yet knowing those names, we all could go down a list of unarmed black people killed by law enforcement.\n\nWe feared what could happen if police came rushing into a group of people who, by virtue of our skin color, might be mistaken for suspects.\n\nFor those of you reading this who may not be black, or perhaps Latino, this is my chance to tell you that a substantial portion of your fellow citizens in the United States of America have little expectation of being treated fairly by the law or receiving justice. It\u2019s possible this will come as a surprise to you. But to a very real extent, you have grown up in a different country than I have.\n\nAs Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of The Condemnation of Blackness, puts it, \u201cWhite people, by and large, do not know what it is like to be occupied by a police force. They don\u2019t understand it because it is not the type of policing they experience. Because they are treated like individuals, they believe that if \u2018I am not breaking the law, I will never be abused.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe are not criminals because we are black. Nor are we somehow the only people in America who don\u2019t want to live in safe neighborhoods. Yet many of us cannot fundamentally trust the people who are charged with keeping us and our communities safe.\n\nAs protest and revolt swept across the Missouri suburb of Ferguson and demonstrators staged die-ins and blocked highways and boulevards from Oakland to New York with chants of \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d many white Americans seemed shocked by the gaping divide between law enforcement and the black communities they are supposed to serve. It was no surprise to us. For black Americans, policing is \u201cthe most enduring aspect of the struggle for civil rights,\u201d says Muhammad, a historian and director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. \u201cIt has always been the mechanism for racial surveillance and control.\u201d\n\nIn the South, police once did the dirty work of enforcing the racial caste system. The Ku Klux Klan and law enforcement were often indistinguishable. Black-and-white photographs of the era memorialize the way Southern police sicced German shepherds on civil rights protesters and peeled the skin off black children with the force of water hoses. Lawmen were also involved or implicated in untold numbers of beatings, killings and disappearances of black Southerners who forgot their place.\n\nIn the North, police worked to protect white spaces by containing and controlling the rising black population that had been propelled into the industrial belt during the Great Migration. It was not unusual for Northern police to join white mobs as they attacked black homeowners attempting to move into white neighborhoods, or black workers trying to take jobs reserved for white laborers. And yet they strictly enforced vagrancy laws, catch-alls that gave them wide discretion to stop, question and arrest black citizens at will.\n\nMuch has changed since then. Much has not.\n\nLast Fourth of July, in a few short minutes as we adults watched the teenager among us talking to the police, we saw Hunter become a little more like us, her faith a little shaken, her place in the world a little less stable. Hunter, who is biracial and lives with her white mother in a heavily white area, had not been exposed to the policing many black Americans face. She was about to be.\n\nOn the phone, she could offer only the most generic of suspect descriptions, which apparently made the officer on the other end of the line suspicious. By way of explanation, Hunter told the officer she was just 16. The police called her back: once, twice, then three times, asking her for more information. The interactions began to feel menacing. \u201cI\u2019m not from here,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI\u2019ve told you everything I know.\u201d\n\nThe fourth time the police called, she looked frightened. Her interrogator asked her, \u201cAre you really trying to be helpful, or were you involved in this?\u201d She turned to us, her voice aquiver. \u201cAre they going to come get me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d one of us said, trying to lighten the mood. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t call them.\u201d\n\nWe all laughed, but it was hollow.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones, at front; with her friends Carla Murphy, left, and Monifa Bandele; and her husband, Faraji Hannah-Jones, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. (Ben Baker/Redux Pictures)\n\nMy friend Carla Murphy and I have talked about that day several times since then. We\u2019ve turned it over in our minds and wondered whether, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have called 911.\n\nCarla wasn\u2019t born in the United States. She came here when she was 9, and back in her native Barbados, she didn\u2019t give police much thought. That changed when she moved into heavily black Jamaica, Queens.\n\nCarla said she constantly saw police, often white, stopping and harassing passersby, almost always black. \u201cYou see the cops all the time, but they do not speak to you. You see them talking to each other, but the only time you ever see them interact with someone is if they are jacking them up,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are making a choice, and it says they don\u2019t care about you, it tells you they are not here for your people or people who look like you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When gunfire interrupted my Long Island outing with friends, we didn't ring the cops.
