In 1974, Nixon put forward a plan to cover all Americans through private insurance, only to have the Watergate scandal force him out of office. An economic crisis prevented Jimmy Carter from pushing forward with a national health plan. Congress late in Reagan's second term attempted to expand Medicare, only to have the law repealed the following year. Bill Clinton had a 1,300-page health care reform bill that was never even taken up for a vote in Congress. Since Nixon's presidency, health care costs have continued to rise, often outpacing inflation. This increase is due to a number of factors, including the increased use of new medical technologies for diagnosis and treatment. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama was intended to cover the 30 million Americans who live without health insurance, according to the bill's authors. It has been the most far-reaching piece of health care legislation since Johnson's signed the legislation creating the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs. NEWS:Think You'll Live Long? Think Again\n\nAlthough health insurance was widely available to employed Americans in the mid-20th century, the unemployed and the elderly were often excluded from these plans. President John F. Kennedy campaigned on the issue of insuring these groups. President Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded where Kennedy left off, securing the passage of a bill through Congress creating Medicare and Medicaid. At the bill-signing ceremony, shown here, Johnson presented former president Truman with the nation's first Medicare card. Within the medical industry itself, an increasing number of doctors began specializing in certain fields of medicine rather than acting as general physicians. By 1960, more than two-thirds of doctors reported themselves as full-time specialists, rather than general practitioners.\n\nLike its predecessor, World War II would lead to new medical advancements, including the widespread adoption of antibiotics and the use of ultrasound. The war would also have a similar effect in terms of the spread of employer-sponsored health plans. Because the nation was in a state of emergency and had a legally mandated wage freeze as a result, employers had to attract workers to assist the war effort by providing them with benefits, including health insurance. Tax laws passed between 1943 and 1945 also gave breaks to employers who provided insurance to their employees, which gave businesses all the more incentive to offer coverage. Following the war, employer-sponsored health insurance became common. In 1951, around 77 million Americans had some kind of coverage, according to an insurance industry trade group. That era also saw one of the most celebrated medical achievements in history: Jonas Salk's polio vaccine. NEWS: World War II\n\nAs part of his push to create a social safety net for Americans during the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated the passage of national health insurance. Roosevelt pushed ahead with efforts to pass Social Security first, a bill which intentionally omitted any mention of medical care to ensure its passage. Harry Truman attempted to carry on Roosevelt's legacy in 1945 by calling on Congress to create such a program. His efforts failed, partly due to criticism by the American Medical Association (AMA), who called the plan \"socialized medicine.\" In this photo taken in 1937, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt examines a chart of enrollment of health care insurance plans.\n\nIn 1928, Alexander Fleming made one of the most important discoveries in the history of medicine: penicillin, a life-saving drug used to treat countless millions. It would be decades, however, before penicillin would be mass-produced. Fleming's discovery was the signature achievement in an era that saw medical treatment become more effective, and, as a result, expensive. The Great Depression also fueled concerns about affordability of medical treatment as millions of Americans suddenly found themselves out of work. In 1929, Baylor Hospital provided the first group health insurance plan in the United States through an agreement with Dallas-area teachers. The plan was the forerunner of Blue Cross. The effort wasn't just meant to be in the best interests of patients, but also the hospitals. Patient facilities saw more empty beds as fewer patients during the Great Depression could afford treatment without participating in these collective prepaid health insurance plans.

The horrors of World War I led to advances in the areas of wound care, sanitation, pain management and more, according to an article published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. Hospitals in the United States began to widely adopt the practice of using antiseptics to sanitize their facilities, preventing the possibility of medical personnel or patients becoming exposed to infection. That decade also saw the introduction of the first employer group insurance contracts (though not specifically for health insurance) as well as the first physician service and industrial health plans.\n\nIn 1912, Theodore Roosevelt was the first presidential candidate to get behind the idea of a national health insurance plan. Roosevelt ultimately didn't win election that year. Proponents of government-provided health care tried to press the issue through state initiatives, only to see their efforts fail in 16 states. Roosevelt's plan may have certainly been ahead of its time, particularly since there weren't that many services that doctors could actually provide patients during that era.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, nothing even close to what could be called a health care system existed in the United States. Although the Civil War had led to some medical breakthroughs in terms of surgical techniques and pain management, medical knowledge, techniques and treatment availability at the time left little hope that patients would actually recover from severe ailments. As NPR's Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson point out, medical treatments may have been downright medieval at the time, consisting of potions. But at least it was cheap. \"In 1900, the average American spent $5 a year on health care ($100 in today's money),\" they note in their report. How the Civil War Changed Modern Medicine\n\nToday the Supreme Court upheld the 2010 health care law in a dramatic victory for President Barack Obama. The lead up to today's decision has prompted debate between opponents and supporters of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act two years ago. Take a look at how we got to the health care system we have in place today. Do Mexicans Have Better Health Care Than You?\n\nWomen have a stronger immune response than men when given the flu vaccine, new research shows.\n\nThis may mean that vaccinated women are better protected against catching the flu than vaccinated men, although the new study did not look at this directly, the researchers said.\n\nPlay Video Don't Fear the Flu Shot If the influenza virus changes each year, does the flu shot even work? And what is the flu vaccine anyway? Commercial Eye/Stone/Getty Images\n\nIn the study, researchers examined the inflammatory responses of 53 women and 34 men following vaccination with a flu shot.\n\nScientists found that men had a weaker response, or less inflammation in their bodies, than women after receiving the vaccine, and the response was weakest among some of the men who had the highest testosterone levels.\n\nThe finding \"reinforces the message that there are major differences between men and women in terms of their immune systems,\" said study researcher Mark Davis, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Stanford School of Medicine. \"Like many other areas, it hasn't been that well explored.\"\n\nDavis said the study does not make immediately clear whether men and women have different levels of flu protection after vaccination, but other research suggests they do. [6 Flu Vaccine Myths]\n\n\"There is a literature to say women have better responses in general to infectious diseases, including flu,\" Davis told LiveScience.\n\nThe reasons for the difference are not entirely known, but the researchers noted that testosterone suppresses inflammation.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible there is a genetic component to people's flu responses, the researchers said. While the mechanism is not entirely clear, the researchers found the vaccine activated certain genes, and this activation predicted who would have the weakest flu shot response.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vaccinated women may be better protected against catching the flu than vaccinated men.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.discovery.news", "og": {"site_name": "DNews", "description": "Vaccinated women may be better protected against catching the flu than vaccinated men.", "title": "Flu Vaccine May Work Better in Women : DNews", "url": "http://news.discovery.com/human/health/flu-vaccine-may-work-better-in-women-131226.htm", "image": "http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/recipes/government-shutdown-could-worsen-flu-season-131014.htm-200x200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vaccinated women may be better protected against catching the flu than vaccinated men.", "title": "Flu Vaccine May Work Better in Women", "url": "http://news.discovery.com/human/health/flu-vaccine-may-work-better-in-women-131226.htm", "image": "http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/recipes/government-shutdown-could-worsen-flu-season-131014.htm-200x200.jpg", "site": "@dnews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=513902154", "fb": {"admins": 100001675325868, "app_id": 157869477569917}, "keywords": "flu vaccine, women's health, immune response, how the flu vaccine works, immunity, vaccinations Health Disease Flu", "viewport": "width=1075", "news_keywords": "flu vaccine, women's health, immune response, how the flu vaccine works, immunity, vaccinations Health Disease Flu"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfb3\"", "article_summary": "[6 Flu Vaccine Myths]\"There is a literature to say women have better responses in general to infectious diseases, including flu,\" Davis told LiveScience.\nIt has been the most far-reaching piece of health care legislation since Johnson's signed the legislation creating the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs.\nWomen have a stronger immune response than men when given the flu vaccine, new research shows.\nIn 1912, Theodore Roosevelt was the first presidential candidate to get behind the idea of a national health insurance plan.\nIn this photo taken in 1937, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt examines a chart of enrollment of health care insurance plans."}
