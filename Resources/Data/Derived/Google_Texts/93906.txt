Some Edmond Cub Scouts visited a retirement community to hear stories from veterans at the center.

Old and young swapped smiles at Touchmark at Coffee Creek Retirement Community on Veteran's Day to share military memories.

“They served our country so we could be free and they, they fought the war and they sacrificed their lives for us,” said Cub Scout Braeden Crawford.

“Some of them were in the Army and I think some of them were in the Air Force,” said Cub Scout Benny Bartoli.

Cub Scout Pack 90 out of Crosstimbers Elementary met veterans like Judith Harris who served in the Air Force in the 1960s.

“Couple of the little scouts came up to me and asked me if I was in the service and I said, ‘Yes,' and they put out their hands and said, ‘Thank you for your service,' and that was so good,” said Harris.

The veterans shared stories of a much different time in our nation's history.

“I don't think a lot of people realize what they went through,” said Edith Gant. “It sounds great, they're all heroes and everything, but there is a lot of tragedy,” she added.

Gant enlisted in the Navy's unit known as the 'Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service,' or WAVES.

Her uniform is on display at the retirement community.

Gant said passing down stories from the Greatest Generation to the youngest generation is priceless.

“I love hearing them, I wish everybody would record them and get their grandfathers, fathers, and whatever to get them down on tape, I think they need to be heard,” Gant told News 9.

The veterans said a lot of people served and are currently serving to make this country what it is, and it is great to share that with kids.
