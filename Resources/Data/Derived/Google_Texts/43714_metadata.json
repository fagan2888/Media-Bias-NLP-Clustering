After weeks of struggling to counter the narrative, they might have finally turned a corner.\n\nConsider an interview RNC Communications Director Sean Spicer gave CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. When asked whether Trump should get the nomination if he comes close, Spicer responded: \u201cRemember, ObamaCare when it was passed initially\u2026no one said, \u2018Hey, if it\u2019s close, it should pass.\u2019 That\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Spicer said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other time that we would ever say\u2014whether it\u2019s politics or sports\u2014\u2018Hey, if you get to the two yard line, well that counts as a touchdown.\u2019 That\u2019s just not how the rules work.\u201d\n\nCooper then asked him what he would say to Trump\u2019s supporters, should someone else win the nomination.\n\nSpicer responded:\n\nAnyone who remembers 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote [and] George Bush won the electoral college vote \u2026 Even Al Gore acknowledged that\u2019s how our democracy works here in America. We have a Constitution that\u2019s predicated on the Electoral College. George Bush won more electoral votes. And I don\u2019t think anybody at that time said, \u2018Well, we should throw out the Constitution and put Al Gore in office.\u2019 We have a system of rules that we follow in this country, whether it\u2019s our Constitution or our party rules. And our party rules dictate that you need 1,237 delegates this cycle to become the nominee.\n\nHeretofore, Trump\u2019s argument about the RNC\u2019s delegate system being \u201crigged\u201d has been an easy sell. In a modern world that fetishizes fairness and direct democracy, Trump\u2019s simplistic (if misleading) rhetoric about giving the nomination to whomever had the most votes seems like common sense.\n\nAlternative arguments about esoteric things like \u201cthe rule of law\u201d don\u2019t resonate as well. But by citing fairly recent examples of things such as Obamacare and the 2000 presidential election\u2014not to mention the rules of football\u2014the RNC has finally found a way to explain to average Americans why the rules must be followed.\n\nWatch the interview here:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt K.
