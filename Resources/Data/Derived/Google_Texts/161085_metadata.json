In Britain, they take their training seriously, while in the States, we\u2019re going through a sort of social-media, image-conscious thing rather than formal training. Many actors are getting caught up in this image thing, which is going on to affect their range,\u201d Mr. Douglas said.\n\n\u201cWith the Aussies, particularly with the males, it\u2019s the masculinity. In the U.S., we have this relatively asexual or unisex area with sensitive young men, and we don\u2019t have many Channing Tatums or Chris Pratts, while the Aussies do,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomena.\u201d\n\nMr. Douglas also addressed comments made by Dustin Hoffman, who said recently that the film industry is the \u201cworst it has ever been.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand what he\u2019s saying, but I think you have to look at the delivery system,\u201d Mr. Douglas told The Independent. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good stuff being made in the cable area, good writing there. \u2018Kramer vs. Kramer,\u2019 those great mainline films he was in aren\u2019t being made anymore [for cinema] but are in a different delivery system.\n\n\u201cMost of the great screen writers have gone into the cable area because that\u2019s where they can also produce,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem in making a film for cinema is the cost of distribution. People can scrape together money for a movie but not the advertising.\u201d\n\nMr. Douglas stars as Dr. Hank Pym in \u201cAnt-Man,\u201d which hits theaters on July 17.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Douglas believes young American actors are lacking in masculinity and are too image-obsessed to hone their craft, unlike British and Australian actors who are grabbing up the American roles.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Michael Douglas believes young American actors are lacking in masculinity and are too image-obsessed to hone their craft, unlike British and Australian actors who are grabbing up the American roles.", "title": "Michael Douglas: American actors \u2018asexual,\u2019 image-obsessed", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/10/michael-douglas-american-actors-asexual-image-obse/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/33f76251009bf613740f6a70670068e2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/33f76251009bf613740f6a70670068e2.jpg", "description": "Michael Douglas believes young American actors are lacking in masculinity and are too image-obsessed to hone their craft, unlike British and Australian actors who are grabbing up the American roles.", "card": "summary", "title": "Michael Douglas: American actors \u2018asexual,\u2019 image-obsessed"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Michael Douglas"}, "article_summary": "Michael Douglas believes young American actors are lacking in masculinity and are too image-obsessed to hone their craft, unlike British and Australian actors who are grabbing up the American roles.\nMany actors are getting caught up in this image thing, which is going on to affect their range,\u201d Mr. Douglas said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something going on with young American actors \u2014 both men and women \u2014 because the Brits and Australians are taking many of the best American roles from them,\u201d the 56-year-old \u201cWall Street\u201d actor told The Independent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomena.\u201dMr. Douglas also addressed comments made by Dustin Hoffman, who said recently that the film industry is the \u201cworst it has ever been.\u201d\u201cI understand what he\u2019s saying, but I think you have to look at the delivery system,\u201d Mr. Douglas told The Independent.\nPeople can scrape together money for a movie but not the advertising.\u201dMr. Douglas stars as Dr. Hank Pym in \u201cAnt-Man,\u201d which hits theaters on July 17."}
