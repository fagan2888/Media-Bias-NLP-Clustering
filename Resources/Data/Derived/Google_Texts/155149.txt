Coal production in China fell 6 percent during the first four months of 2015, The Associated Press reports.

The production dip comes amid declining demand for the fuel in the country. Besides production, Chinese coal imports fell 39 percent between January and April, per the AP.

The coal industry in China has been hampered by both a slowdown in the country's economy and a push from Chinese leadership to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions.

Earlier this month, the government released data showing coal consumption fell 7.7 percent during the first four months of 2015, compared to the same time period last year. That trend followed a nearly 3 percent dip in coal consumption during 2014.

Officials in China hope to see their emissions peak in 2030, and Greenpeace estimated earlier this month that the country's declining coal consumption lowered its emissions by 5 percent.

China still generates about 66 percent of its energy from coal, compared to about 39 percent in the United States.
