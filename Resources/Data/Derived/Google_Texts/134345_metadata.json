All the sites are in Columbia\u2019s city limits.\n\nBrenda Pierce, Maury County Convention and Visitors Bureau executive director, said she hopes to place the markers by Spring 2014 in time for better weather and more tourists.\n\n\u201cPeople who are interested in Civil War history like to travel and follow that trail and go visit the markers to learn about the history that goes along with them,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cIt\u2019s another reason for people to visit.\u201d\n\nThere are four other locations throughout the county where similar Civil War markers are located, Pierce said.\n\nColumbia City Council\u2019s approval earlier this month was the last step toward getting the markers placed. Council had to approve the marker because the old Nelson Hotel is on city property.\n\nOLD NELSON HOTEL\n\nMaury County Archives Director Bob Duncan is working on the Nelson Hotel sign\u2019s description. A large part of the former hotel\u2019s significance lies in what is known as \u201cThe \u201cForrest-Gould Affair.\u201d\n\nThe old hotel is where Confederate Lt. Andrew Wills Gould died after a confrontation with Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest in summer 1863, Duncan said.\n\nA downtown Columbia Masonic Hall was the setting where Gould faced Forest, challenging the general about being blamed for losing some artillery pieces.\n\n\u201cGould confronted Forrest in the hall,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cNow, confronting Forrest took nerves of steel to start with.\u201d\n\nAn argument ensued, and Gould shot Forrest in his abdomen. Forrest retaliated and stabbed Gould in his side. The young lieutenant was eventually taken to the Nelson Hotel for medical treatment.\n\nGen. Forrest was examined by doctors who determined the injury was a survivable flesh wound, Duncan said. Forrest, perhaps, was more wounded by the news his lieutenant was more severely injured, Duncan said.\n\nForrest recovered, but Gould died from infection caused by the stab wound. The general carried the guilt from killing the young soldier long after the war was over, Duncan said.\n\nELM SPRINGS\n\nElm Springs, the current International Headquarters of The Sons of Confederate Veterans, is a Greek revival style mansion in Columbia. The home has a fiery history, and will also get a marker recognizing its place in local Civil War lore.\n\nDuncan said there are several stories related to Elm Springs, but the most memorable tale occurred when Union Troops nearly burned the home in Nov. 1864.\n\nElm Springs was home to Col. A.M. Looney who commanded a Confederate regiment at The Battle of Shiloh. Looney eventually wound up in the 1st Tennessee Infantry, or Company H (Aytch) of Sam Watkins fame, according to home\u2019s website.\n\nIn 1864, Union Gen. John Schofield was trying to slow Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood\u2019s invasion of Tennessee while in Columbia, Duncan said. Two Union soldiers entered the home, set a broom on fire and tossed it underneath a flight of stairs.\n\nConfederate Gen. Frank Armstrong, of Forrest\u2019s Calvary, arrived in time to put out the fire. Two Confederate soldiers shot and killed the fleeing Union soldiers.\n\nSAM WATKINS\u2019 GRAVE\n\nWatkins was born in June 1839 in the Zion community, between Mt. Pleasant and Columbia.\n\nThe book, \u201cCo. Aytch,\u201d is highly regarded among historians and enthusiasts alike for its detailed accounts into the soldier\u2019s daily plight, Duncan said.\n\n\u201cWe have people coming through here all the time wanting to know where Sam Watkins\u2019 grave is because Sam Watkins is probably the best known private soldier of the Civil War,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cEvery Civil War expert or hobbyist has a copy of \u2018Co. Aytch\u2019 sitting on his shelf.\u201d\n\nA marker will be placed in front of the Zion Church Cemetery where Watkins is buried.\n\nDuncan said he is not quite sure what draws people to travel far and wide for a chance to trace Civil War history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget that at one time this country was literally tearing itself apart,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder the country survived.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A downtown Columbia gun and knife fight, a home nearly destroyed and a local soldier\u2019s literary work are all part of Maury County\u2019s Civil War history.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "TIM HODGE thodge@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "A downtown Columbia gun and knife fight, a home nearly destroyed and a local soldier\u2019s literary work are all part of Maury County\u2019s Civil War history.", "title": "County adds three historic markers to Civil War Trails", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/county-adds-three-historic-markers-civil-war-trails", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Nelson-Hotel_0990_swt_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/county-adds-three-historic-markers-civil-war-trails", "title": "County adds three historic markers to Civil War Trails", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=732016", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=732016", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-22T23:29:47-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4141\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s another reason for people to visit.\u201dThere are four other locations throughout the county where similar Civil War markers are located, Pierce said.\nThe home has a fiery history, and will also get a marker recognizing its place in local Civil War lore.\nNow, these events will be memorialized through new historical markers on the Civil War Trails \u2014 a route of historic demarcations dedicated to one of the greatest divides in American history.\nA downtown Columbia gun and knife fight, a home nearly destroyed and a local soldier\u2019s literary work are all part of Maury County\u2019s Civil War history.\nDuncan said he is not quite sure what draws people to travel far and wide for a chance to trace Civil War history."}
