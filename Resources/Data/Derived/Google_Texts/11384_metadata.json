(AP) \u2014 Rachel Dolezal leads the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, teaches African studies to college students and sits on a police oversight commission.\n\nBut the 37-year-old artist and activist with dark curly hair and light-brown skin now finds herself at the center of a furor over racial identity after family members said she has falsely portrayed herself as black for years when she is actually white. As proof, they produced pictures of her as a blonde, blue-eyed child.\n\nThe city is also investigating whether she lied about her ethnicity when she applied to be on the police board. And police on Friday said they were suspending investigations into racial harassment complaints filed by Dolezal, including one from earlier this year in which she said she received hate mail at her office.\n\nThe NAACP issued a statement Friday supporting Dolezal, who has been a longtime figure in Spokane\u2019s human-rights community.\n\n\u201cOne\u2019s racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership,\u201d the group said. \u201cIn every corner of this country, the NAACP remains committed to securing political, educational and economic justice for all people.\u201d\n\nDolezal did not return several telephone messages left Friday by The Associated Press.\n\nOn Thursday, she avoided answering questions directly about her race and ethnicity in an interview with The Spokesman-Review (http://bit.ly/1MuATMc ) newspaper.\n\n\u201cThat question is not as easy as it seems,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexities \u2026 and I don\u2019t know that everyone would understand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all from the African continent,\u201d she added.\n\nDr. Camille Zubrinsky Charles, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in racial-identity issues, said people can identify with people of other races without doing what Dolezal did.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, being a part of that community doesn\u2019t require someone to claim that identity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might be difficult to become president of the local NAACP chapter, but achieving the goals? That in itself doesn\u2019t require passing as a member of that group.\u201d\n\nMaybe she \u201csaw her whiteness as a barrier to doing the advocacy work in the social justice world,\u201d said Charles, who is black.\n\nRuthanne Dolezal of Troy, Montana, told reporters this week that she has had no contact with her daughter in years. She said Rachel began to \u201cdisguise herself\u201d after her parents adopted four African-American children more than a decade ago. Rachel later married and divorced a black man and graduated from historically black Howard University.\n\nRuthanne Dolezal also showed reporters pictures of her daughter as a child, with blonde hair, blue eyes and straight hair.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parents of NAACP leader say she lied about her race", "author": "Nicholas K.
