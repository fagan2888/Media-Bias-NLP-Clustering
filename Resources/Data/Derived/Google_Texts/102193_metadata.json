(AP) - U.S. Sen. John Thune says the problems facing an Indian Health Service hospital in Rosebud are \u201clife and death issues.\u201d\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s senior senator toured the medical facility Friday with officials from the U.S. Public Health Service and Rosebud Sioux Tribal Health Administrator Evelyn Espinoza.\n\nFederal inspections recently highlighted serious problems at the IHS hospitals on the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations. The regional office of the IHS closed the emergency department at the Rosebud facility two weeks after the inspection.\n\n\u201cGrowing up out here, I\u2019ve seen some of these problems, I\u2019ve seen some of these challenges, and here I am 40 years later and they have the same problems, the same challenges,\u201d Thune said.\n\nEspinoza told Thune and reporters the lack of emergency services means ambulances can\u2019t legally deliver a patient to the hospital.\n\nShe said a Rosebud man, who was on dialysis, needed an ambulance after feeling chest pains, but due to the closed emergency room, he had to be sent to the hospital in Valentine, Nebraska. The man died on Thursday night in an ambulance 15 miles from Valentine.\n\nIn October, inspectors visiting the hospital in Pine Ridge cited safety deficiencies including unlocked cupboards with syringes, needles and other equipment; unsecured drugs and medical records; an isolation room without gowns and masks; and doctors without proper credentials.\n\nAn inspection of the Rosebud hospital in November found conditions so alarming the emergency room was shut down. A patient having a heart attack wasn\u2019t treated until 90 minutes after she arrived. Serious staffing shortages in the emergency room included vacancies for the supervising medical officer, a medical officer, two physician assistants and three clinical nurses.\n\nEspinoza said she wants to look forward from the past problems and work with others to get the hospital functioning appropriately again for the people of the tribe, who have treaty rights to health care from the federal government.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to point fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cI want us to come together and use each other\u2019s strengths.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Sen.
