America is leading the world in global action on climate change. America is leading the world to write smarter and stronger trade rules for the 21st century. We\u2019ve begun a new chapter of engagement with the Cuban people,\" he said.\n\n\"...But we've got a lot of folks who are attacking the right of women just to have basic health care in this country and to be able to make decisions about reproductive freedom without having some member of Congress or some governor or some other elected official try to intrude.\"\n\nObama said his \"overall\" point is \"we\u2019re making enormous progress. And it does make you wonder -- why is it that Republican politicians are so down on America?\"\n\n\"I mean, they are gloomy. They\u2019re like Grumpy Cat. Everything is terrible, according to them. We\u2019re doomed! I mean, I know it\u2019s political season, but you listen to them and they\u2019ve constructed this entire separate reality -- it\u2019s like the Twilight Zone. And according to their story, their narrative, everything was terrific back in 2008 -- when unemployment was skyrocketing, and uninsured rates were rising, and folks were losing their homes and their jobs, and we were engaged in two wars, and bin Laden was still at large. If you were listening to them, those were like the good old days. The golden years. And then I came in and the Democrats came in -- no, but according to them, that\u2019s when everything all went to heck,\" he said, topping off his Grumpy Cat comment by making a Grumpy Cat face.\n\n\"...I mean, just look at the facts. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Go back and take a look at, all right, here\u2019s Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, and then there\u2019s Bush presidency, and then there\u2019s my presidency, and take a look.\"\n\nThe president quipped that \"you\u2019ve got to feel bad for the fact-checkers for the Republicans because they\u2019ve got to spend hours trying to keep up with some of the crazy stuff that their candidates are claiming.\"\n\n\"And the reason they have to make up stuff is because they don\u2019t have a record to run on,\" he said. \"...I think the way they approach climate change is a good illustration of the problems that they\u2019re having.\"\n\nObama said the Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas made the party \"proud\" because the candidates \"weren\u2019t just saying crazy stuff.\"\n\n\"We are right on most policy issues. Our arguments are the right ones. But at our core, what I\u2019m really proud of is the fact that we believe in this country that everybody has a fair shot, that everybody has got to be able to get ahead.\"", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Obama: 'Gloomy' Republicans 'Down on America' Like 'Grumpy Cat'", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "'You listen to them and they\u2019ve constructed this entire separate reality -- it\u2019s like the Twilight Zone.'", "title": "Obama: 'Gloomy' Republicans 'Down on America' Like 'Grumpy Cat'", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/obama-gloomy-republicans-down-on-america-like-grumpy-cat/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/10/grumpycat.png", "updated_time": 1464258388, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'You listen to them and they\u2019ve constructed this entire separate reality -- it\u2019s like the Twilight Zone.'", "title": "Obama: 'Gloomy' Republicans 'Down on America' Like 'Grumpy Cat'", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/obama-gloomy-republicans-down-on-america-like-grumpy-cat/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/10/grumpycat.png", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Obama: 'Gloomy' Republicans 'Down on America' Like 'Grumpy Cat'", "pinterestDescription": "Obama: 'Gloomy' Republicans 'Down on America' Like 'Grumpy Cat'", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3452\"", "article_summary": "Obama: 'Gloomy' Republicans 'Down on America' Like 'Grumpy Cat'President Obama today accused Republicans of being \"down on America\" like \"Grumpy Cat.\"\nAnd then I came in and the Democrats came in -- no, but according to them, that\u2019s when everything all went to heck,\" he said, topping off his Grumpy Cat comment by making a Grumpy Cat face.\nThey\u2019re like Grumpy Cat.\n\"Today, America is leading the world in confronting new threats -- making sure Iran doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon.\nAmerica is leading the world to write smarter and stronger trade rules for the 21st century."}
