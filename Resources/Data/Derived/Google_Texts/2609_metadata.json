Burwell, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced in early 2015 an expedited transition towards alternative payment models.\n\nAccording to HHS\u2019s proposed timeline, 30 percent of payments are planned to be value-based by the end of this year.\n\nHHS said this number will hopefully hit 50 percent by the end of 2018.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said its timeline is indeed doable.\n\n\u201cThese are measurable goals to move the Medicare program and our healthcare system at large toward paying providers based on quality, rather than quantity, of care,\u201d CMS claimed.\n\nThis important news is still making an impact on the industry as the fee-for service payment realm diminishes with time.\n\nAlternative payment models need to be a primary focus for the industry moving forward to ensure smooth claims reimbursement and the ongoing delivery of top-notch care.\n\nHere is a deeper look at how two of these specific alternative payment models \u2013 bundled payments and accountable care organizations (ACOs) \u2013 are progressing.\n\nDiving into the fundamentals of bundled payment models\n\nSharing is caring when it comes to bundled payments.\n\nUnder this prospective payment model, a single payment involving a variety of services is shared among various providers across different settings.\n\nThe primary objective of the bundled payment model is to foster more dynamic relationships and productive partnerships by making the payment process a tad less isolated.\n\nCMS confirmed bundled payments allow for greater provider adaptability and flexibility in deciding how payments are allocated across participating providers.\n\nBut the bundled payment design still demands a bit of tweaking in regard to care coordination efforts, said the American Hospital Association (AHA) last April.\n\nBundled payment arrangements \u201cpresent many challenges, as providers will face substantial risk if they do not have tools available to understand and select the post-acute and other services that will achieve the best outcome for a given patient,\u201d the AHA stated.\n\n\u201dOur members strive to provide the right care in the right setting, but a lack of care coordination in the fee-for-service system produces significant variation in how patients receive post-acute care,\u201d the organization added.\n\nThe AHA additionally confirmed support for the testing of new models on a small scale and \u201cusing the lessons learned to develop proposals before considering widespread adoption and implementation.\u201d\n\nNearly two months later, the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) announced the formation of a Bundled Payments Taskforce.\n\nIts goal was to examine how bundled payment initiatives were unfolding, especially in connection with the value-based reimbursement transition.\n\nWEDI was particularly interested in streamlining the exchange of clinical and administrative data among payment models.\n\nThe organization also remained focused on effectively utilizing technology to ensure payment-related data was being seamlessly relayed between parties.\n\nAs these and other bundled payment initiatives advance, the Medicare payment shift continues onwards.\n\nParticularly worthy of note is that CMS\u2019s Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative (BPCI) began in January of 2013.\n\nUnder this initiative via the Affordable Care Act (ACA), CMS worked with a variety of organizations to determine how and why bundled payment models lower Medicare costs and improve patient care.\n\nCMS confirmed that as of last month, its BPCI initiative had over 1,500 participants, including 409 acute care hospitals, 700 skilled nursing facilities, 288 physician group practices, and 100 home health agencies.\n\nBut hospitals are apparently struggling with their BPCI endeavors, especially in regard to maintaining accurate, up-to-date risk-adjustment pricing data.\n\n\u201cIf healthcare providers have timely, reliable data, the Bundled Payments initiative presents a great opportunity to reduce costs, decrease readmissions, and enhance patient care,\u201d Andre Blom, Director of Rehabilitation at the Illinois Bone & Joint Institute said.\n\n\u201cBut if the data isn\u2019t trustworthy, the benefits of the program will elude them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will need to fix the infrastructure that has failed to provide accurate, actionable information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf hospital administrators are working with retrospective information, if their data is two years old, it\u2019s irrelevant today,\u201d he added.\n\nInvesting on the front-end with merely unguaranteed return on investment on the back-end is not necessarily appealing to the medical community at large.\n\nBlom advised hospital executives to evaluate the overall scope of their health system and identify blind spots. Additionally, noting what elements may simply be beyond their control is imperative for success, he stated.\n\n\u201cHealthcare is changing into a retail environment. With high deductible plans, healthcare providers are realizing the need to view patients as collaborators in value-based care initiatives and redesign,\u201d he explained.\n\nExecutives are able to track their risk bearing entities with real-time, accurate data at their fingertips, he said.\n\nAnd care coordination technology solutions are helping them efficiently connect the dots between various patient episodes across an entire acute and post-acute network, he stated.\n\nInvesting a given amount of money is less painful if the back-end amount can be estimated accordingly early on, he added.\n\nMany across the industry believe bundled payments simply represent a better way to practice medicine, he claimed.\n\n\u201cThe paradigm shift to value-based care is forcing people to start talking to one another about what\u2019s going on, which is new,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are communicating inside and outside of their system because they recognize they need to be able to take care of the whole patient.\u201d\n\nAccountable care organizations are about quality measures\n\nUnder the Medicare Shared Savings Program for ACOs, providers who willingly coordinate patient care and who meet around 30 different quality measures \u2013 including patient experience, patient safety, and at-risk populations \u2013 can experience increased savings, CMS confirmed.\n\n\u201cACOs which elect to become accountable for shared losses have the opportunity to share in greater savings,\u201d said CMS.\n\n\u201cThe higher the quality of care providers deliver, the more shared savings their Accountable Care Organization may earn, provided they also lower growth in health care expenditures,\u201d CMS added.\n\nA great deal of positive ACO news has been swirling across the healthcare industry in recent months.\n\nACOs reportedly have been assuming high levels of risk while generating over $411 million in net program savings within a one-year period, CMS reported.\n\n\u201cIn the third performance year, Pioneer ACOs showed improvements in 28 of 33 quality measures and experienced average improvements of 3.6% across all quality measures,\u201d CMS said.\n\n\u201cShared Savings Program ACOs that reported quality measures in 2013 and 2014 improved on 27 of 33 quality measures,\u201d the organization stated.\n\nAnd Pioneer ACOs alone have generated over $380 million in Medicare savings, according to HHS.\n\n\u201cThe Pioneer ACO Model has demonstrated that patients can get high quality and coordinated care at the right time, and we can generate savings for Medicare and the health care system at large,\u201d stated Burwell last May.\n\nBut there is still a steep educational learning curve when it comes to relatively new ACOs.\n\nACOs may need to adopt tighter standards and more openly embrace technological opportunities to stay afloat.\n\n\u201cThe lower cost connection is that hospitals are going do an asset allocation of their revenue stream,\u201d explained Dutch Dwight, Medullan\u2019s Vice President of Business Development.\n\nSuccessful ACOs must drive more standards adoption, he claimed.\n\n\u201cAcross the healthcare industry there have yet to be transformational solutions to enable a dramatic reduction in cost per claim. Many ideas have been bantered about, but none have been combined in a fundamental way,\u201d Dwight added.\n\nThe Pioneer Program was a vital learning experience for the greater industry.\n\n\u201cThe Pioneer Program was sort of a big experiment in value-based or risk-based contracting,\u201d Johnathan Niloff, MD, McKesson\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, said.\n\n\u201cCMS and CMMI view this program as a success because of its effectiveness in improving quality metrics and in reducing total cost of care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA number of the parameters of the original Pioneer Program did not create the optimal environment for an organization to be able to manage an at-risk population from a perspective of coordination of care across the continuum,\u201d Niloff stated.\n\n\u201cThe organization needs to come to terms with internal conflicts and unify around a strategy to move forward and successfully transition. They have to align their objectives and incentives among all their constituents,\u201d he added.\n\nNiloff advised implementing a coordinated care model around a primary care medical home model to help coordinate care across a wider continuum.\n\n\u201cYou need a methodology to identify high-risk patients and then a care management program to manage the care of those high-risk patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou need analytics to understand the key drivers of your total cost of care and to be able to manage those drivers,\u201d Niloff added.\n\n\u201cIn a value-based or ACO world, what historically a CFO might have thought of as a revenue center becomes a cost center in a total-cost-of-care model,\u201d he relayed.\n\nKey drivers that are helping providers align their efforts with CMS\u2019s alternative payment model timeline, he said, include the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) and the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS).\n\n\u201cThe passage of [MACRA] supports the ongoing transformation of healthcare delivery by furthering the development of new Medicare payment and delivery models for physicians and other clinicians,\u201d said CMS.\n\n\u201cCMS is committed to reducing provider burden through the use of measures aligned across federal and private-payer quality reporting programs,\u201d the organization stated.\n\n\u201cWe stress harmonization of data elements and specifications among measure developers, whose cooperation and sharing are essential to creating aligned measures.\u201d\n\nImage Credits: [Health Affairs] (Image 1)\n\nImage Credits: [United States Government Accountability Office] (Image 2)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicare alternative payment models have the ability to make affordable, high quality care reality.
