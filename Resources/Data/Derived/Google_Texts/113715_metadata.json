She has been on record stating that she is Creole (Louisiana). She even has a song titled, \u201cCreole,\u201d in which she celebrates her Creole heritage (on her 2006 album B\u2019Day). But on the commercial it stated that she was also \u201cAfrican American, Native American, and French.\u201d I began thinking, well, what is the relationship between being Creole and Native American?\n\nI understand the advertising goal of a company trying to market to a particular audience, especially in an allegedly period where we can celebrate our multicultural heritages and simultaneously exist in a post-racial world (though just about any social indicators suggests otherwise). However, the link between being Creole and Native remains an interesting point. On the one hand, being Creole is celebrated as a unique identity, with African, French, or sometimes Spanish mixture. Creole people emerged with a unique mixture of cultural/ethnic heritages that influence everything from foods to language. Some even cite the generic term \u201cNative American\u201d as a part of this racial mixture.\n\nThe term Creole is a broad term, which has many (unstable) definitions, but is generally based upon geographic location and historical experience. If you scour the Internet, you can find numerous sites that celebrate being Creole, but they don\u2019t usually cite a specific Indigenous community or tribe. I reached out to Andrew Jolivette, Professor and Chair in American Indian Studies at San Francisco State University for comment. In an email he exchange he wrote, \u201cthere is a longstanding and interwoven cultural, ethnic, and land based and kinship connection between Native peoples of Louisiana and Creoles.\u201d However, the general public lacks an understanding of this relationship because of \u201ccoercive settler colonial forces\u201d that \u201crender those relationships as invisible through a systematic form of paper genocide through the [U.S.] Census.\u201d\n\nNumerous scholars, including Brian Klopotek, Andrew Jolivette, Carolyn Dunn, and Rain Gomez, among others, have written extensively about the relationship between Creole and Indigenous identities. On an extensive Facebook post, Rain Gomez, an expert on Creole indigeneity wrote, \u201cLouisiana holds within its territories intensely multilayered histories\u201d and \u201cLouisiana\u2019s history of racial mixing has given rise to specific Indigenous descended communities.\u201d She notes that there are four federally recognized tribes and seven state recognized tribes. Gomez also notes that there are many Creole communities. She identifies as Cane River Creole and Opelousas Creole. The Cane River Creole are a well-documented group, according to Gomez. This group intermarried among other Creoles, traded, and consists of particular Indigenous groups including \u201cCaddo, Choctaw, Wichita, Chitimacha, Tunica, Choctaw-Biloxi, Apache, and Quapaw.\u201d Importantly, she identifies particular tribal communities. Thus, she avoids the erasure of Native peoples while highlighting the diversity that makes up a particular Creole community, and herself. Thus, being Creole and Indigenous are not separate, but can be embodied in unique, if not wonderful ways. Recognizing the links between Creoleness and indigeneity, according to Chickasaw theorist Jodi Byrd, is to recognize \u201cthe deep connection to indigenous resistances and cultural practices as well as indigenous kinship.\u201d\n\nThe research and writing of some of the aforementioned scholars will continue to shed light on Creole indigeneity in Louisiana and beyond. I think Rain Gomez summarized well the importance of this work, and why it matters in our multicultural society:\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how Louisiana Creoles have been marginalized, fractionalized, and racialized means serious conversations about colorism, racism, and the lasting effects of Jim Crow segregation, exclusion from both White and Black communities, Indian Removal, and Indian Termination and Relocation, all of which had serious impacts on Louisiana Creole peoples and their perspectives within both home communities and (more importantly) outside communities.\u201d\n\nAlthough misperceptions about Creole indigeneity persist, Jolivette stated that relationships within the Creole community are \u201cbeing strengthened\u201d among the \u201cCoushatta, Choctaw, and Atakapa-Ishak.\u201d During a so-called post-racial era, Native identity policing, and when many Native people are fighting tribal disenrollment the story of Louisiana Creoles suggest that Native communities might do well to embrace their broad diversity and rid themselves of essentialized notions of Native identity that ignore the reality of how people actually live today.\n\nKyle T.
