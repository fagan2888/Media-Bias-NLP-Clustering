Eric Connor, U.S. Army Reserve Command spokesman.\n\nThe problem affects the broader service as well. According to Army Recruiting Command statistics compiled last year, 71 percent of young people wanting to join the military would fail to pass service tests because of their physical, moral or cognitive shortcomings.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 U.S. fighter jets\n\nThese problems are worsening even as the Defense Department wants in the coming year to add thousands of members to every branch of the service, both the active forces and the reserves, a plan that will place additional pressure on recruiters who must operate with smaller budgets.\n\nMilitary budget documents show that the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps are being asked in fiscal year 2016 to recruit 2,000 to 9,500 more active-duty The Army Reserve\u2019s goal in fiscal year 2014 was to recruit 33,261 personnel, but military planners have considerably upped that goal in fiscal year 2016. By the end of next year, recruiters must be able to persuade 39,860 men and women to join the reserves.\n\nLt. Gen. David Barno, a distinguished practitioner in residence at American University\u2019s School of International Service, said recruiters will face a more challenging environment in the coming years because of the improving U.S. economy \u2014 in a tough market, younger men are more attracted to the military as a last-resort job \u2014 and because the end of major military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq lessen the chances for glory and honor.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 U.S. military helicopters\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of jobs out there, and now it looks like the military is not as involved in as many operations that seem exciting to 18-year-olds,\u201d Gen. Barno said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be very, very tough to recruit in that population. It\u2019s going to be some really, really challenging times coming up for recruiters.\u201d\n\nBut according to Capt. Connor, the Army Reserve has been struggling to meet its recruitment goals for reasons having more to do with the quality of the recruits.\n\n\u201cA major reason is only 3 out of 10 people qualify for the Army Reserve, being disqualified because of mental, moral and physical reasons. We\u2019re also competing against other services for potential recruits and many civilians don\u2019t know about the benefits offered by the Army Reserve or the military,\u201d he said.\n\nRecruiters have seen an uptick in the number of applicants who are dependent on prescription medication for behavioral issues, such as hyperactivity, that preclude them from action.\n\nOther candidates have been rejected for having tattoos too low on their forearms, as the Army put into place more stringent ink restrictions last year. Other recruiters are saying that obesity has become an issue, with many hopeful recruits failing short of the military\u2019s physical standards.\n\nArmy Reserve soldiers return to their civilian lives after training, but continue to spend one weekend a month training to keep their skills sharp and, for roughly two weeks a year, receive specialized training. They serve three to six years and can be called into action at any point.\n\nIronically, some of the biggest competition for the reserve forces is coming from the active forces, which are under similar pressure.\n\nThe regular Army, which is facing the same recruiting problems as its reserve force, is under the most pressure to replenish its troop levels. It has been instructed to boost its target of 57,000 recruits in fiscal year 2016 to 66,500 new troops, even as the U.S. draws down its presence in the Middle East.\n\nSome analysts say the military could remedy any impending recruiting problems by getting more creative in its recruiting efforts, such as establishing a preconditioning camp aimed at those who would fail the physical test but want to join, essentially delaying their active duty until they qualify physically.\n\n\u201cThe [recruiting] numbers I have seen are not that bad,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a national security and defense policy analyst at the Brookings Institution. Once the numbers start sinking, however, considerations like a preconditioning camp will have to be made, he said.\n\nAir Force officials concerned about the shrinking defense budget are reorganizing recruitment staff to require fewer resources to do their jobs, said Capt. Brooke Brzozowske, a spokeswoman for the service. Rather than having multiple one- or two-member recruiting offices, the Air Force plans to consolidate into fewer centralized locations, she said.\n\n\u201cThis transformation will strengthen our recruiting force while simultaneously requiring fewer resources to carry out the mission,\u201d Capt. Brzozowske said, adding that the effort is expected to save $11.8 million a year.\n\nThe Air Force last month said it has been searching desperately for more pilots to operate the drones that the Obama administration uses to track and kill terrorists in the Middle East. Its overall goals are increasing from 24,018 recruits in 2014 to 26,836 in fiscal year 2016.\n\nAlong with the Army, the Marines will be under pressure to up recruiting efforts. Documents show they will need to add 6,258 members \u2014 more than the Air Force or Navy \u2014 next year.\n\nMarines have been playing an increasingly important role in carrying out President Obama\u2019s military policies, including special missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and evacuations of U.S. embassy staff from Libya, Syria and Yemen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The majority of potential Army reservists are either hooked on prescription drugs, have too many tattoos, are overweight or have mental conditions that prohibit them from joining the military, recruiters say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The majority of potential Army reservists are either hooked on prescription drugs, have too many tattoos, are overweight or have mental conditions that prohibit them from joining the military, recruiters say.", "title": "Army Reserve candidates\u2019 tattoos, obesity, prescription drugs hinder recruitment effort", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/16/army-reserve-candidates-tattoos-obesity-prescripti/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/tattoo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/tattoo.jpg", "description": "The majority of potential Army reservists are either hooked on prescription drugs, have too many tattoos, are overweight or have mental conditions that prohibit them from joining the military, recruit", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Army Reserve candidates\u2019 tattoos, obesity, prescription drugs hi"}, "Author": "Maggie Ybarra", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, War Conflict, Army, Air Force"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb236\"", "article_summary": "Seven out of 10 applicants fail to meet Army Reserve standards on \u201cmental, moral and physical reasons,\u201d said Capt.\nConnor, the Army Reserve has been struggling to meet its recruitment goals for reasons having more to do with the quality of the recruits.\nEric Connor, U.S. Army Reserve Command spokesman.\n\u201cThis transformation will strengthen our recruiting force while simultaneously requiring fewer resources to carry out the mission,\u201d Capt.\nThe majority of potential Army reservists are either hooked on prescription drugs, have too many tattoos, are overweight or have mental conditions that prohibit them from joining the military, recruiters say."}
