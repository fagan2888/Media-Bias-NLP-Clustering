Yoga For Children\n\nOn January 3, Fox & Friends asked whether young children participating in yoga is leading to the \"wussification of America.\"Guest Larry Winget called yoga a \"disturbing trend\" and complained that yoga wasn't competitive enough and, doesn't teach people how to be \"tough.\" Winget admitted that yoga has positive properties only because he didn't \"want all those yoga Nazis coming after [him] on this thing.\" [Fox News, Fox & Friends, 1/3/2013]\n\n9.Fines For Poor Sportsmanship\n\nOn September 25, Fox reported that youth football coaches in one town may face up to $200 in fines for allowing their teams to run up the score against an opponent.

A Police Officer Who Was Suspended For Cursing\n\nOn the December 6 edition of The Kelly File, host Megyn Kelly reported that a police officer was suspended for cursing at a school bus full of children, while the children who were misbehaving faced no consequences.

Paid Internships\n\nOn the May 18 edition of Fox & Friends Saturday, co-host Clayton Morris hosted author Ron Perlin to discuss internships and the \"culture of unpaid work.\" Morris asked if interns deserve money for their work, or if this demonstrates an \"entitlement generation\" and the \"wussification of America.\" [Fox News, Fox & Friends Saturday, 5/18/13]\n\n6. The Possible Redskins Name Change\n\nOn the November 1 edition of Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, guest host Eric Bolling was incredulous that the NFL's Washington Redskins considered changing their team name to something less racially offensive, characterizing the proposed change as the continued \"wussification of America.\" [Fox News, The Five, 11/1/13]\n\n5. Common Core Math Strategies\n\nOn August 19, Fox & Friends guest host Anna Kooiman wondered if new Common Core math standards' emphasis on the learning process actually represented \"the continuation of the wussification of America.\" [Fox News, Fox & Friends, 8/19/13]\n\n4. Helmets For Youth Soccer League\n\nOn the October 10 edition of Fox & Friends, co-host Brian Kilmeade reported that one town was campaigning for youth soccer leagues to require helmets.

Human Resources\n\nOn September 9, Fox & Friends hosts asked regular guest Larry Winget to weigh in on people who talk themselves into being \"victims\" and offer advice on how to take personal responsibility.
