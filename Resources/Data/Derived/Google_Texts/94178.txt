A new local locksmith is helping Fremont County residents with lockouts morning, day and night.

All American Locksmith, which opened less than a month ago, also sells items, including locks and keys.

"(We sell) any type of key for any type of lock: vehicles, equipment, anything," said owner Jake Mason.

He said the business offers new, state-of-the-art designs, which include Brinks Home Security push, pull, rotate door locks.

"You twist it, you push it or pull it from either side," Mason said.

He said he encourages customers to come inside the store to see how the new locks function.

A larger selection of items will fill the shelves in the near future, he said.

Mason said he enjoys working as a locksmith.

"I retired from the military," he said. "This is just something fun to do and to help people out."

Mason gives military and veteran discounts.

The store, located at 221 #A West Main Street in Florence, is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

For lockout emergencies, call 719-569-5625.
