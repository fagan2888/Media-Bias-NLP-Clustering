But 30 percent of Americans say they are ambivalent about the merits of cohabiting, and another 25 percent say it\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nSEE ALSO: Scott Walker mocked by media member for saying he talks with God in prayer\n\nSimilarly, having sex before marriage is the norm, but only 36 percent of Americans say it is OK to \u201cget together for sex and not expect anything further,\u201d he said. Another 29 percent of Americans say they aren\u2019t sure if casual sex and \u201cbooty calls\u201d are OK, and 35 percent of people oppose it, said Mr. Regnerus.\n\nOn gay marriage, 42 percent of Americans say it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to marry.\n\nThe Relationships in America survey, however, deliberately \u201cgave people an out\u201d if they didn\u2019t want to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to that and other questions, said Mr. Regnerus.\n\nAs a result, 27 percent of people said they were undecided about gay marriage; another 31 percent opposed it.\n\nOn divorce, the survey asked people if married couples with children should stay married unless there\u2019s physical or emotional abuse. The results are 28 percent say no divorce, 39 percent say OK to divorce, and 33 percent are undecided.\n\nThe survey, which is sponsored by the Austin Institute for the Study of Family and Culture, distills answers by categories such as gender, religiosity, marital status, race and age.\n\nIt finds, for instance, that \u201cpolitical liberalism\u201d tracks with \u201cpermissiveness\u201d in sexual and romantic behaviors, said Mr. Regnerus.\n\nBut regardless of political and religious views, most Americans draw the line at \u201cpolyamory\u201d (55 percent oppose several people living together in a sexual or romantic relationship) and adultery (74 percent of Americans do not approve of spouses having sex with someone other than their spouse).\n\nAnd for those who long for a revived marriage culture in America, the study provides hope: Sixty-six percent of Americans disagreed with the statement, \u201cMarriage is an outdated institution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 2014 survey of 15,738 Americans finds strong rejection of adultery and homes with multiple live-in sex partners.
