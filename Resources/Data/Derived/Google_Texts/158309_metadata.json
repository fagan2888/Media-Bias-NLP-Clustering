She was diagnosed with a brain tumor in late 2013. She had delayed care for months while dealing with enrollment problems through the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange, Nevada Health Link, her husband said in a press conference in mid-June.\n\nThe family says Rolain\u2019s tumor was treatable last fall when diagnosed, but became fatal by this spring as she waited for the Obamacare exchange to communicate her coverage to the insurance company. Both Rolain and her husband\u2019s health insurance took effect in March, according to the exchange, but the couple alleged that they were told the coverage wouldn\u2019t be in effect until May, according to the Review Journal.\n\nAttorney Matthew Callister filed the class action lawsuit in April after a Las Vegas man, Larry Basich, was charged $407,00 for care after suffering a heart attack, although he had purchased coverage and paid several monthly premiums. The Obamacare marketplace and its contractor Xerox had failed to properly communicate Basich\u2019s coverage to the insurer.\n\nCallister alleged in April that when faced with website flaws and a daunting queue of corrupted applications, state Obamacare officials and Xerox discussed dumping all the applications for coverage they had received and starting over, including those like Basich who had already paid their premiums.
