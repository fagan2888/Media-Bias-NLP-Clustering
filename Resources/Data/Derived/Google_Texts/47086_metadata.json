Our key operating metrics for the periods presented were as follows:\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2016\n\n2015 Net Insurance Service Revenues (in thousands) $ 50,847\n\n\n\n$ 45,359\n\nNet Service Revenues (in thousands) $ 163,250\n\n\n\n$ 142,375\n\nTotal WSEs 324,103\n\n\n\n288,817\n\nTotal Sales Representatives 507\n\n\n\n408\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe use Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted to provide an additional view of our operational performance. Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define Net Insurance Service Revenues as insurance service revenues less insurance costs, which include the premiums we pay to insurance carriers for the health and workers compensation insurance coverage provided to our clients and WSEs and the reimbursements we pay to the insurance carriers for claim payments within our insurance deductible layer. We define Net Service Revenues as the sum of professional service revenues and Net Insurance Service Revenues. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income, excluding the effects of our income tax provision, interest expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income, excluding the effects of our effective income tax rate, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense, debt prepayment premium, and the income tax effect of these pre tax adjustments at our effective tax rate. For purposes of our non-GAAP financial presentation, as a result of a 2016 increase in New York City tax rates and an increase in blended state rates, we have adjusted the effective tax rate to 42.5% for the periods ended March 31, 2016, from 40.5% for the periods ended March 31, 2015. Each of these effective tax rates exclude income tax on non-deductible stock-based compensation and discrete items including the cumulative effect of state law changes. Non-cash interest expense represents amortization and write-off of our debt issuance costs.\n\nWe believe that the use of Net Insurance Service Revenues provides useful information as it presents a measure of revenues from our provision of insurance services to our clients that eliminates the cost to us of that insurance. We believe that Net Service Revenues provides a useful measure of total revenues for the two main components of our revenues calculated on a consistent basis. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted provides additional period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain one-time and non-cash expenses. We believe that Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted are useful for our stockholders and board of directors by helping them to identify trends in our business and understand how our management evaluates our business. We use Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted to monitor and evaluate our operating results and trends on an ongoing basis and internally for operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes, in addition to allocating our resources to enhance the financial performance of our business and evaluating the effectiveness of our business strategies. We also use Net Service Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in determining the incentive compensation for management.\n\nNet Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measurements required by GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As non-GAAP measures, Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:\n\nNet Insurance Service Revenues and Net Service Revenues are reduced by the insurance costs that we pay to insurance carriers;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the amounts we paid in taxes or other components of our tax provision;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted do not reflect the non-cash component of employee compensation;\n\nAlthough depreciation and amortization of intangible assets are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\n\nOther companies in our industry may calculate these measures or similar measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted alongside other financial performance measures, including total revenues, net income and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of GAAP insurance service revenues to Net Insurance Service Revenues:\n\n\n\nThree months ended\n\nMarch 31,\n\nChange 2016 vs. 2015\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n$\n\n%\n\n(in thousands, except percentages) Insurance service revenues $ 620,536\n\n\n\n$ 528,562\n\n\n\n$ 91,974\n\n\n\n17 % Less: Insurance costs 569,689\n\n\n\n483,203\n\n\n\n86,486\n\n\n\n18 % Net Insurance Service Revenues $ 50,847\n\n\n\n$ 45,359\n\n\n\n$ 5,488\n\n\n\n12 %\n\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of GAAP total revenues to Net Service Revenues:\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31,\n\nChange 2016 vs. 2015\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n$\n\n%\n\n(in thousands, except percentages) Total revenues $ 732,939\n\n\n\n$ 625,578\n\n\n\n$ 107,361\n\n\n\n17 % Less: Insurance costs 569,689\n\n\n\n483,203\n\n\n\n86,486\n\n\n\n18 % Net Service Revenues $ 163,250\n\n\n\n$ 142,375\n\n\n\n$ 20,875\n\n\n\n15 %\n\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(in thousands) Net income $ 11,577\n\n\n\n$ 15,811\n\nProvision for income taxes 9,241\n\n\n\n10,476\n\nStock-based compensation 7,397\n\n\n\n3,920\n\nInterest expense and bank fees 5,042\n\n\n\n5,204\n\nDepreciation 3,916\n\n\n\n3,434\n\nAmortization of intangible assets 4,980\n\n\n\n11,217\n\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 42,153\n\n\n\n$ 50,062\n\n\n\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share - diluted:\n\n\n\nThree months ended\n\nMarch 31,\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(in thousands) Net income $ 11,577\n\n\n\n$ 15,811\n\nEffective income tax rate adjustment 394\n\n\n\n(170)\n\nStock-based compensation 7,397\n\n\n\n3,920\n\nAmortization of intangible assets 4,980\n\n\n\n11,217\n\nNon-cash interest expense 775\n\n\n\n1,217\n\nIncome tax impact of pre-tax adjustments (5,590)\n\n\n\n(6,623)\n\nAdjusted Net Income $ 19,533\n\n\n\n$ 25,372\n\nGAAP Weighted average shares of common stock - diluted 71,746\n\n\n\n73,350\n\nAdjusted Net Income per share - diluted $ 0.27\n\n\n\n$ 0.35\n\n\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trinet-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2016-results-300261117.html\n\nSOURCE TriNet Group, Inc.\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.trinet.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "california", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "SAN LEANDRO, Calif., May 2", "description": "SAN LEANDRO, Calif., May&#160;2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TriNet Announces First Quarter, Fiscal 2016 Results. 17% Growth in Total Revenues and 15% growth in...", "author": "TriNet Group, Inc.", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trinet-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2016-results-300261117.html", "image": "http://content.prnewswire.com/images/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "SAN LEANDRO, Calif., May\u00a02, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0TriNet Group,\u00a0Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0TNET),\u00a0a...", "title": "TriNet Announces First Quarter, Fiscal 2016 Results"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "TriNet Announces First Quarter, Fiscal 2016 Results", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "TriNet Group, Inc., NYSE:TNET, california, Earnings, Conference Call Announcements, Human Resource & Workforce Management", "date": "2016-05-02T16:15:00Z", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Net Service Revenues consisted of professional service revenues of $112.4 million and Net Insurance Service Revenues of $50.8 million.\nWe define Net Service Revenues as the sum of professional service revenues and Net Insurance Service Revenues.\nNet Insurance Service Revenues consisted of insurance service revenues of $620.5 million, less insurance costs of $569.7 million.\nProfessional service revenues for the first quarter of 2016 increased 16%, and Net Insurance Service Revenues increased 12%, compared to the first quarter of 2015.\nNet Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share \u2013 diluted are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP."}
