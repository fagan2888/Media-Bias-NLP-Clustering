There must come a point, we reasoned, when the long rock slide of seeking and wanting and getting and seeking more would stop. And a man would know some peace.\n\nI am pleased to report that we have both achieved that angle, perhaps a little late in life. But the whole point of an antlion's pit is that the tiniest insect can start the whole thing sliding again, with the poor little tumbling down to be devoured.\n\nOn this show, we'll talk frankly about what modern life has done to love, and vice versa.\n\nGUESTS:\n\nBetsy Kaplan and Chion Wolf contributed to this show, which originally aired on February 13, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts/Culture", "description": "It's hard to improve on the poet, Rilke, who wrote, \"Love consists of this, that two solitudes meet, protect, and greet each other.\" But did Rilke have to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "The Colin McEnroe Show", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/pondering-modern-love-2", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201604/javier_delgado.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It's hard to improve on the poet, Rilke, who wrote, \"Love consists of this, that two solitudes meet, protect, and greet each other.\" But did Rilke have to", "title": "Pondering Modern Love"}, "story_id": 473830413, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ChionWolf"}, "author": "Chion Wolf, Colin McEnroe, Betsy Kaplan", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Pondering Modern Love"}, "nid": 57035, "datePublished": "2016-04-11", "keywords": "books, human behavior, psychology, gender", "wordCount": 372, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "On this show, we'll talk frankly about what modern life has done to love, and vice versa.\nMy friend Peter and I used to discuss the angle of repose in terms of love.\nIt's hard to improve on the poet, Rilke, who wrote, \"Love consists of this, that two solitudes meet, protect, and greet each other.\"\nI am pleased to report that we have both achieved that angle, perhaps a little late in life.\nThere must come a point, we reasoned, when the long rock slide of seeking and wanting and getting and seeking more would stop."}
