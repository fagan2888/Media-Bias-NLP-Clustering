John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\nAre Americans of faith engaged, and do they care enough to \u201cfight\u201d for their liberties? Share:\n\nThune, who is Chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee (a Senate committee with direct oversight of the FCC) said that the new federal regulations of the internet represent a dramatic departure from the stance towards internet governance that the previous presidential administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had assumed.\n\n\u201cSince the early days of the privatization of the internet we\u2019ve used what we call a \u2018light touch\u2019 regulatory approach, in which the government sort of stayed out of it. This is at odds with that approach. This will cost consumers, and I believe it will stifle innovation of the internet,\u201d Thune said, while raising the specter of government regulation of religious web content.\n\n\n\nWhile speaking from a unique vantage point, Thune\u2019s perceptions and comments on the issue are nonetheless his own. Yet his remarks about an \u201cassault on faith and people of faith coming from the political left\u201d amount to more than partisan political bickering, and are not without merit. The promises that led up to the passage of the federal Obamacare legislation, for example, and the outcomes that the federal law have produced, both serve to substantiate Thune\u2019s concerns.\n\nAs President Barack Obama and his allies in Congress insisted in previous years that the legislation would bring about higher quality, less expensive, and universally accessible health insurance for all, in early 2010 many pro-life groups began to raise concerns that the Obama administration\u2019s agenda could lead to both taxpayer-funded abortions, and employers who provide health insurance to their staffers being forced to provide abortion insurance coverage.\n\nDuring congressional debate that year, then-U.S. Congressman Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) led a contingency of pro-life Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to push for changes to the emerging Obamacare legislation, so as to alleviate the concerns about abortion mandates.\n\nAnd in the midst of the rancor, President Obama summonsed Stupak to the White House for a meeting, and to make a deal: if Stupak would agree to support the Obamacare legislation as it existed, the -resident would promise to issue an executive order after the bill\u2019s passage that would prohibit taxpayer funded abortions.\n\nStupak, of course, agreed to the president\u2019s \u201cdeal.\u201d Yet now, five years later, evidence abounds that American taxpayers are indeed subsidizing abortion coverage, while individuals and groups who morally object to aborting unborn children are being forced to go to court to regain their right to not pay for abortion insurance coverage.\n\nToday, the Obama administration is promising a more \u201copen,\u201d more accessible, more \u201cfair\u201d internet via the new net neutrality regulations. Yet there have also recently been both public policy analysts and editorial writers who have suggested that in the future, some of the finer points of historic Christian theology and doctrine will likely be deemed to be \u201coffensive\u201d by the FCC. In turn, it has been predicted that the FCC will eventually harness its new-found powers to restrict or prohibit this religious content from being distributed via the world wide web.\n\n\u201cWhether or not this ends up in that place, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Thune said of these disconcerting claims. \u201cWhat we do know is that we have now given a federal agency a tremendous amount of power to regulate something that we have thus far regulated very little. This is the reason that people of faith need to be engaged in the political process. The other side is engaged. People of faith need to be paying attention, as well, and engaged with their political leaders.\u201d\n\nBut are Americans of faith engaged, and do they care enough to \u201cfight\u201d for their liberties as Thune suggests they must? Or are they content to have \u201cthe trust of Stupak,\u201d and allow the president and his administration to have their way?\n\nTime will tell. But given the scarcity of diaolg among faith-based groups about the FCC\u2019s new policiies, for now it appears that most prefer the Stupak approach and are ignoring Thune\u2019s warnings.\n\nAustin Hill is an Author and Talk Show Host.
