He caught the crowd by surprise, however, when he dropped this little gem about the Apple Watch.\n\n\u201cI think we should repeal Obamacare,\u201d Bush said this week at Arizona\u2019s Four Peaks Brewery. Then, he pointed to his Apple Watch. \u201cOn this device in five years will be applications that will allow me to manage my healthcare in ways that, five years ago, were not even possible.\u201d\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush\u2019s radically transparent email dump leaves private info radically exposed\n\nBush gave one somewhat fanciful and misguided example of how the Apple Watch could act as a doctor in the future.\n\n\u201cBecause of my blood sugar, someone will send me a signal, I\u2019ll get a double beep saying, you just ate a butter scotch sundae, you\u2019re diabetic, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d said Bush. \u201cWhatever, we\u2019ll be able to guide our decisions in a way that will make us healthier.\u201d\n\nFOX 10 News | fox10phoenix.com\n\nHopefully, the possible GOP frontrunner for the Office of the President of the United States of America isn\u2019t actually suggesting that America replace its entire healthcare system with a smartwatch. However, there is a kernel of truth to his statements about the potential of wearables. Wearables are increasingly focused on health and wellness, and some doctors are starting to look at data from wearables to help treat their patients.\n\nApple has been working to bring its HealthKit app, which syncs data from the Apple Watch, into as many hospitals as possible. The company has had success, earning trials at many major hospitals. Although the Apple Watch and other wearables cannot replace doctors, it seems that these devices may be able to help them.\n\nCurrently, the Apple Watch can\u2019t track blood sugar levels, and Siri doesn\u2019t typically offer medical advice, so we\u2019re not sure where he got that idea from. However, it\u2019s possible that wearables and health applications may one day reach a higher level of patient analysis. For now, we might want to keep the healthcare system around, though.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.ratio_4_3": "http://icdn6.digitaltrends.com/image/jebbush-480x360-c.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/jebbush-50x50.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Andre Revilla", "description": "Jeb Bush was speaking in Arizona when he caught us all by surprise by dropping this little gem about the Apple Watch.", "tags": "Apple watch,GOP,Jeb Bush,Obamacare,smartwatch", "og": {"site_name": "Digital Trends", "description": "Jeb Bush was speaking in Arizona when he caught us all by surprise by dropping this little gem about the Apple Watch.", "title": "Jeb Bush wants to repeal Obamacare, replace with Apple Watch", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/jebbush-1200x630-c.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-15T08:15:44+00:00", "url": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/jeb-bush-obamacare-apple-watch/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Digital Trends", "description": "Jeb Bush was speaking in Arizona when he caught us all by surprise by dropping this little gem about the Apple Watch.", "creator": "@digitaltrends", "image": "http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/jebbush-1500x1000.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush wants to repeal Obamacare, replace with Apple Watch", "site": "@digitaltrends", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-15 07:15:38", "sailthru.title": "Jeb Bush wants to repeal Obamacare, replace with Apple Watch", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"app_id": 61377565444, "pages": 8522591132}, "sailthru.image.ratio_3_2": "http://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/jebbush-600x400-c.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Apple watch, Jeb Bush, Obamacare, smartwatch, Andre Revilla, Apple, Health & Fitness, Mobile, Wearables", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrendsftw", "tag": "smartwatch", "published_time": "2015-05-15T07:15:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-15T08:15:44+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "Jeb Bush was speaking in Arizona this week when he began to explain why he wants to repeal Obamacare.
