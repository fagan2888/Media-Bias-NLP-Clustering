But she advised against touching the dead animals.\n\nThe National Wildlife Health Center says the disease is caused by a toxin produced by a common bacterial species. Birds ingest the toxin from water or by eating maggots or flies.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the tranquil Sugar House Park pond, ducks are dying.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/24/avian-botulism-killing-ducks-in-sugar-house-park/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "In the tranquil Sugar House Park pond, ducks are dying.", "title": "Avian botulism killing ducks in Sugar House Park"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the tranquil Sugar House Park pond, ducks are dying.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Avian botulism killing ducks in Sugar House Park"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0d7\"", "article_summary": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - In the tranquil Sugar House Park pond, ducks are dying.\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1LBLC7r ) that a disease known as avian botulism is killing birds that live in the water there.\n___Information from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com\nThe National Wildlife Health Center says the disease is caused by a toxin produced by a common bacterial species.\nThe Salt Lake County Parks and Recreation department doesn\u2019t have an estimate on the number of deaths, but spokeswoman Callie Birdsall says they have seen between one and a dozen dead birds per day lately."}
