(Carie Canterbury / Daily Record)\n\nVeterans from all wars were honored during the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery Committee's annual Veterans Day ceremony Saturday.\n\nThe ceremony honored American military veterans living and dead, and servicemen and women who currently are active duty. Three veterans were recognized Saturday.\n\nJoyce Mozley retired after serving 21 years in the United States Air Force. She and her husband, Bill, used to decorate their town's Main Street with flags to honor military personnel when they lived in Missouri. The couple moved to Ca\u00f1on City about a year ago, and they hope to become involved with the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery, Joyce Mozley said.\n\n\"It just feels like something we have to do, something we need to do,\" she said. \"I am also recognizing my father who was in World War II; he was the inspiration for me to join the service.\"\n\nSaturday's featured speaker was Leonard Nelson who shared the history and meaning of \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"\n\n\"The fourth and final stanza gives us hope for the future, and when sung should be done so more slowly than the other verses and with even deeper meaning,\" he said.\n\nThe observance also included two separate flag-raising, one for the Grand Army of the Republic, or Union, and the other for the Confederate States of America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarol McNew, secretary for the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery Committee said having two separate flag-raisings at the cemetery is how it's been done dating back to 1912.\n\n\"There was a Union camp and a Confederate camp, and the veterans would get together and do a ceremony,\" she said.\n\nShe said the event went into despair after World War II, but the committee has had a ceremony every year to honor veterans since being formed in 2000.\n\nRick Ulrich, Tom Monaco and a group of observers salute the Confederate flag Saturday during a Veterans Day ceremony in the Confederate States of America section of the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery. The cemetery also has a section for the Grand Army of the Republic. (Carie Canterbury / Daily Record)\n\nTom Monaco of the Greenwood Pioneer Cemenery Committee said veterans representing wars dating back to the War of 1812 are buried at the cemetery which has been designated as a state and national historic site. There also are three veterans from the Mexican-American War, several from the Civil War, and some from the Spanish-American War, World War I, World II, Korean War, and one from the Vietnam War.\n\nMonaco said the Confederate burial section is the only one in Colorado. He said the Grand Army of the Republic purchased that section as a final resting place for the Confederates. A monument, that still stands today, was erected in honor of the Confederates in 1899.\n\n\"We still work together \u2014 Union and Confederate \u2014 it doesn't matter, we take care of all the graves,\" Monaco said.\n\nMcNew said the Greenwood Pioneer Cemenery Committee wishes to thank the Civil Air Patrol and the J Troop of the Colorado Mounted Rangers for their participation in the event.\n\nCarie Canterbury: 719-276-7643, canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com or twitter.com/cariecanterbury", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26902926/veterans-active-duty-men-and-women-honored-during", "modificationDate": "2014-11-09T17:00:12-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1109/20141109__10DRVETERANSw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "Veterans from all wars were honored during the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery Committee's annual Veterans Day ceremony Saturday.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26902926:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-09T16:58:55-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26902926/veterans-active-duty-men-and-women-honored-during", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1109/20141109__10DRVETERANSw~4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Veterans from all wars were honored during the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery Committee's annual Veterans Day ceremony Saturday.", "title": "Veterans, active duty men and women honored during annual event at Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Veterans from all wars were honored during the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery Committee's annual Veterans Day ceremony Saturday.", "title": "Veterans, active duty men and women honored during annual event at Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26902926/veterans-active-duty-men-and-women-honored-during", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1109/20141109__10DRVETERANSw~4.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-09T16:58:55-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2024-11-09T13:18:57-0700", "sailthru.title": "Veterans, active duty men and women honored during annual event at Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Carie CanterburyThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1109/20141109__10DRVETERANSw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-11-09T17:00:17-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "article_summary": "(Carie Canterbury / Daily Record)Veterans from all wars were honored during the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery Committee's annual Veterans Day ceremony Saturday.\nAdvertisementCarol McNew, secretary for the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery Committee said having two separate flag-raisings at the cemetery is how it's been done dating back to 1912.\nThe couple moved to Ca\u00f1on City about a year ago, and they hope to become involved with the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery, Joyce Mozley said.\nVeterans from all wars buried at the Greenwood Pioneer CemeteryTom Monaco explains the history of the Confederate flag that is etched on an 1899 monument Saturday at the Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery.\nThere also are three veterans from the Mexican-American War, several from the Civil War, and some from the Spanish-American War, World War I, World II, Korean War, and one from the Vietnam War."}
