Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who sits on the tax-writing Finance Committee. \u201cThe extenders has been a huge political and policy issue, with a whole army of lobbyists. Most of that is now resolved.\"\n\nEnding the ritual would amount to a sea change in how Congress writes tax policy, not to mention bad news for everyone from racehorse owners to NASCAR, whose favorite provisions were not awarded permanent status in last week\u2019s agreement.\n\nFor decades, lawmakers have been rolling over the hodgepodge of breaks, usually at the last minute and with little scrutiny, as lawmakers prepared to leave for Christmas recess.\n\nIt\u2019s become one of Congress\u2019 routines, with the number of extender provisions steadily growing. The very first extenders bill, the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, had eight provisions. This year, there were more than 50.\n\nIt\u2019s been a triumph of both budget gamesmanship \u2014 lawmakers made the breaks temporary to make the cost appear cheaper \u2014 and lobbying, with a cottage industry growing up on K Street around the provisions.\n\nTax writers said what they did this year will allow them to focus on better things. The $680 billion tax-cut package will give \u201cbreathing room to the cause of bipartisan tax reform,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance panel.\n\nThe legislation takes aim at the fact that some extenders are more popular than others.\n\nLawmakers may not like the idea of handing out special tax breaks to NASCAR or Puerto Rican rum companies. But, typically, they hitched a ride on other, more pressing extenders provisions.\n\nFor many years, that was the alternative minimum tax. It hadn\u2019t been indexed for inflation, so Congress repeatedly intervened to prevent it from hitting more Americans, and that legislation ended up moving all sorts of other, unrelated extenders.\n\nAfter Congress permanently fixed the AMT as part of the 2013 fiscal-cliff agreement, the R&D credit, which has long enjoyed broad bipartisan support, became the next must-pass extender.\n\nBut last week\u2019s agreement not only made the credit permanent, it also made more than a dozen other popular provisions permanent. Among them: special breaks for small businesses, schoolteachers and people who make charitable contributions.\n\nThat raises the question of which of the remaining provisions could be considered must-pass legislation by lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to drive the effort to get them extended now that the research credit has been made permanent?\u201d said John Gimigliano, a former Ways and Means aide who now heads the tax legislative group at KPMG. \u201cIt\u2019s less clear which of these remaining extenders is going to emerge as the one that people are going to say, \u2018This is the one that we must do.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt will be especially tricky because the remaining extenders have different expiration dates, so they won\u2019t come up for renewal at the same time.\n\nLawmakers agreed to extend about a half-dozen provisions for five years. They were the ones that were strongly supported by one party, but not the other, said a senior tax aide. They include so-called bonus depreciation, which provides more generous investment write-offs for equipment purchases; the New Markets tax credit, which subsidizes investment in low-income areas; and a credit for the wind-power industry.\n\nThe remaining 30 extenders, which lawmakers agreed to extend through next year, are most in danger of eventually dying off. They tend to be more parochial, with a relatively small number of supporters. Among them: special incentives for film and television productions; a credit for electric motorcycles; a break for those hiring people working on Indian reservations; and generous write-offs for mine safety equipment.\n\nBut some lawmakers say Congress will at least consider continuing to renew the remaining provisions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this alone kills it entirely because we have a number of provisions that are simply being extended another two years, so there\u2019s still that list to deal with,\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.).\n\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), another Finance Committee member, said \u201cyou\u2019ll still have need for extenders,\u201d noting \u201csome are pretty important that are in the two-year package.\u201d\n\nHe predicted lawmakers will become \u201cmuch more selective\u201d about which will be renewed, predicting \u201csome will expire\u201d and \u201csome will be modified.\u201d\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) agreed it was too early to declare the extenders process dead, \"but I don\u2019t think it will have the same drama associated with it that it\u2019s had.\u201d\n\nSome lobbyists say lawmakers may have inadvertently created a new vehicle for the remaining extenders when they decided to delay the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Cadillac tax on pricey health care benefits. Some doubt lawmakers will ever allow the tax to take effect, saying it, or two other Obamacare taxes that were suspended in the legislation, could end up carrying the leftover extenders.\n\nOthers hope a new president will tackle tax reform in 2017, so the question of the fate of the remaining provisions will become moot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as clear how this is going to play out as it has been in past years,\u201d said Gimigliano. \u201cIt\u2019s a new world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Some lawmakers are hoping that a massive tax package signed into law last week will mean the end of the recurring need to extend dozens of tax breaks with expiration dates.", "title": "RIP tax extenders?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/congress-tax-extenders-217112", "image": "https://images.politicopro.com/images/financial_services/130604_rob_portman_ap13052111048.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Some lawmakers are hoping that a massive tax package signed into law last week will mean the end of the recurring need to extend dozens of tax breaks with expiration dates.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo Finance and Tax RIP tax extenders?\nGoodbye tax extenders?\nSome lawmakers are hoping that a massive tax package signed into law last week will mean the end of the recurring need to extend dozens of tax breaks with expiration dates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s less clear which of these remaining extenders is going to emerge as the one that people are going to say, \u2018This is the one that we must do.\u2019\u201dIt will be especially tricky because the remaining extenders have different expiration dates, so they won\u2019t come up for renewal at the same time.\nLawmakers may not like the idea of handing out special tax breaks to NASCAR or Puerto Rican rum companies."}
