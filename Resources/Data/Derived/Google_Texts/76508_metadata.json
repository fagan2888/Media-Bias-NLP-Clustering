(VRX/TSX)\n\nAnnual return: 110.01%\n\nCanada\u2019s largest publicly-traded drug company was also the biggest winner on the S&P/TSX 60 Index in 2013. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International\u2019s stock price more than doubled for the year as investors rewarded the company for its active and profitable acquisition streak. Valeant\u2019s most recent deal, on Dec. 16, was an offer to buy U.S.-based medical-device company Solta for a 40% premium. RBC analyst Douglas Miehm gave the deal a big thumbs up, saying it showed Valeant\u2019s ongoing efforts to expand its business. He also hiked his price target for Valeant to $120 from $117 following the announcement. Adding further allure for investors heading into 2014, Valeant\u2019s management in October said they continue to hunt for profitable acquisitions and that Valeant would even be open to a \u201cmerger of equals.\u201d\n\nMagna International Inc. (MGA/TSX)\n\nAnnual return: 75.32%\n\n\n\nMagna International\u2019s stock had a breakout year in 2013. After spending two years essentially moving sideways, two key events allowed the share price to soar. First, Magna founder Frank Stronach, who long held an iron grip over Magna and had significant voting power through his large stake, stepped out of the picture by ceding the chairmanship in November 2012. Around the same time, Magna\u2019s European division, which had long suffered due to Europe\u2019s economic challenges, finally began to show signs of recovery. But the meteoric rise of Magna\u2019s stock has some analysts cautioning investors about the risks of getting in now. David Tyerman, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said the share price appreciation this year has \u201cpushed up Magna\u2019s valuation to a high level\u201d and currently maintains a hold rating.\n\nCanadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP/TSX)\n\nAnnual return: 59.22%\n\n\n\nChief executive Hunter Harrison continues to give Canadian Pacific Railway investors plenty of reasons to love him. In July, Mr. Harrison told investors during a conference call that his four-year plan to turn CP around is 10 to 12 months ahead of schedule \u2014 and it\u2019s no coincidence CP\u2019s stock hasn\u2019t stopped rallying since. Most recently, the company announced a record third-quarter profit and operating performance, largely due to Mr. Harrison\u2019s drive for increased efficiency. Financial data firm FactSet recently revealed that CP is one of the most widely held Canadian stocks among U.S. hedge funds, with some US$3.4-billion worth of shares being held south of the border.\n\nCGI Group Inc. (GIB.A/TSX)\n\nAnnual return: 54.93%\n\n\n\nThe heated debate over the myriad problems with the Affordable Care Act website in the United States has caught the website\u2019s creator, CGI Group, in the crossfire. But the negativity wasn\u2019t enough to put a damper on CGI\u2019s stock, which has nicely spiked during the past couple of years. The biggest growth catalyst came from CGI\u2019s $2.7-billion acquisition of European IT firm Logica in 2012. CGI went on to restructure many of Logica\u2019s European operations, squeezing more efficiency out of them and improving profits. That paid off big in 2013 as stronger earnings and analyst upgrades lured investors to buy in. Some uncertainty continues to hover over CGI because of the U.S. health-care website fiasco, but the majority of analysts still rate the stock as a buy, with Desjardins recently upgrading its target from hold to buy in the wake of an 8% price pull back in the past month.\n\nGildan Activewear Inc. (GIL/TSX)\n\nAnnual return: 55.82%\n\n\n\nGildan Activewear, maker of underwear, socks and t-shirts, was the S&P/TSX 60\u2019s top performer in 2012 and had another blockbuster year in 2013. That\u2019s an impressive back-to-back performance considering the company was near collapse just a few years ago, when Gildan\u2019s largest wholesale buyer nearly filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy during the height of the financial crisis. But with the economy bouncing back, Gildan\u2019s sales have recovered and the company continues to grow. Gildan\u2019s management has announced that they have earmarked $350 million for facility upgrades and a new plant over the next year. They\u2019re also more upbeat about costs since Gildan continues to benefit from normalizing cotton prices, which have dropped to about US90\u00a2 a pound from a high of US$2.20 a pound in 2011. Analysts are certainly optimistic about the company\u2019s future, with Bloomberg showing most analysts rate it a buy.\n\nWORST\n\nBy David Pett\n\nPotash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc. (POT/TSX)\n\nAnnual loss: -13.49%\n\n\n\nPotash Corp.\u2019s fate as one of the year\u2019s worst performers was sealed in late July when shares in the fertilizer giant plummeted 23% in just two days, following the breakup of Belarusian Potash Co. (BPC), one of two global marketing ventures that controlled 40% of potash exports worldwide. The stock has since somewhat rebounded, rising 13% over the past five months, but the large majority of analysts covering the company believe 2014 will be another tough year. That could all change, however, if rumours prove true that Urakali and Belaruskali, the estranged partners in BPC, are set to resume their cartel-like relationship in the new year.\n\nBlackBerry Inc. (BB/TSX)\n\nAnnual loss: -33.05%\n\nAfter falling 20% in 2012, BlackBerry shares were again in the red this past year due to ongoing troubles at the Canadian smartphone maker and persistent doubts about its much-talked-about turnaround. With any luck, John Chen, the company\u2019s new chief executive, will get things moving in the right direction over the next 12 months as the company tightens its focus on enterprise customers. But if his tenure to date is any indication, get ready for another rocky year. Since taking the helm in mid-November, the stock is up more than 16%, but fell almost 5% earlier this week on news that former co-chief exec Michael Lazaridis was selling his shares following his failed takeover bid.\n\nEldorado Gold Corp. (ELD/TSX)\n\nAnnual loss: -52.89%\n\n\n\nEldorado Gold was the worst-performing big-cap gold miner in 2013 as the falling price of bullion continued taking its toll on the industry\u2019s heaviest hitters. If there is a silver lining to the story, it\u2019s that analysts believe the worst may finally be over for the sorry group that also includes Barrick Gold Corp., Goldcorp Inc. and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd., to name but a few. There are 16 analyst buy recommendations on Eldorado, versus seven holds and two sells heading into the new year and the stock is expected to climb 55% over the next 12 months, according to average price target estimates.\n\nTeck Resources Inc. (TCK.A/TSX)\n\nAnnual loss: -23.51%\n\n\n\nTeck Resources also fell prey to weaker gold prices in 2013, but the bigger headache for the diversified miner is the precipitous drop in coking coal prices to below US$150 per tonne from more than US$3oo/tonne a little over two years ago. The fossil fuel was responsible for roughly half of Teck\u2019s operating profits in 2013 and prices are not expected to improve anytime soon due to supply increases following a rebound in Australian production and stronger domestic production in China. \u201cWhile the lower Q1/14 benchmark price has likely already been discounted in Teck\u2019s share price, the weak start to 2014 coal pricing is likely to weigh on share price performance until there is more clarity on pricing for the balance of the year,\u201d said Greg Barnes, an analyst at TD Securities, in a recent note to clients.\n\nPenn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT/TSX)\n\nAnnual loss: -17.87%\n\n\n\nPenn West Petroleum disappointed shareholders in 2013 by falling more than any other large-cap energy play in the country. The lowlight \u2014 a two-day 23% plunge \u2014 came in early November, when the company announced sweeping changes that would result in asset sales and reduced short-term production levels. Fortunately, most market observers don\u2019t foresee another big selloff next year, but caution is still strongly advised. Of the analysts who cover the stock, 14 have hold ratings, five have sells and three have buys.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We take a look at the five best- and worst-performing stocks in the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&amp;P/TSX 60 index for the year", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Post", "description": "We take a look at the five best- and worst-performing stocks in the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&P/TSX 60 index for the year", "title": "5 of Canada\u2019s biggest market winners and losers in 2013", "url": "http://business.financialpost.com/investing/5-of-canadas-best-and-worst-performing-stocks-of-2013", "image": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2013/12/performance-stocks.jpg?quality=60&strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://business.financialpost.com", "description": "We take a look at the five best- and worst-performing stocks in the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&P/TSX 60 index for the year", "title": "5 of Canada\u2019s biggest market winners and losers in 2013", "image": {"src": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2013/12/performance-stocks.jpg?quality=60&strip=all"}, "site": "@financialpost", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Just another WordPress.com site", "fb": {"admins": 576295511, "app_id": 138801856165024}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Financial Post", "keywords": "investing, news, breaking, financial markets", "google-site-verification": "UhYuz5WLj9O99xHz05IP4O2gExeR_rozYMFxe-OeqTg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.financialpost.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf78b\"", "article_summary": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International\u2019s stock price more than doubled for the year as investors rewarded the company for its active and profitable acquisition streak.\nBut the meteoric rise of Magna\u2019s stock has some analysts cautioning investors about the risks of getting in now.\nValeant\u2019s most recent deal, on Dec. 16, was an offer to buy U.S.-based medical-device company Solta for a 40% premium.\nBESTBy John ShmuelValeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.
