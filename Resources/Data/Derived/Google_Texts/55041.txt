(CNN) Ignoring criticism from Donald Trump about speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, Jeb Bush uses his second language in a new video celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month.

The one-minute video, "Todos Somos Americanos" or "We are all Americans," also features a rare appearance from his wife of 41 years, Columba, who's from Mexico.

"I have lived over half my life here," she says in English in the video. "We all have the same interests, the same feelings."

The Republican presidential candidate says in Spanish that he is "proud" that his children and grandchildren are Hispanic. "Hispanics contribute more every day to our culture; they are an integral part of the American dream," Bush says.

The video comes a couple of weeks after Trump, who's rocketed to fame in part because of his inflammatory rhetoric about illegal immigrants, said that Bush should "set an example by speaking English while in the United States."
