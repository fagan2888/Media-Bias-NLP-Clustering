Clinton\u2019s drug cost proposal caused a slide in health-care stocks on Monday, sending the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index down 4.4 percent after she said on Twitter that she would release a plan.\n\n\u201cWhen Americans get sick, high costs shouldn\u2019t prevent them from getting better.\u201d Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\n\nShe also called for health insurance reforms that build on what\u2019s already in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nOut-of-Pocket Costs\n\n\u201cWhen Americans get sick, high costs shouldn\u2019t prevent them from getting better,\u201d Clinton said in a statement. \u201cWith deductibles rising so much faster than incomes, we must act to reduce the out-of-pocket costs families face. My plan would take a number of steps to ease the burden of medical expenses and protect health-care consumers.\u201d\n\nThe campaign cited a report released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation that showed patient deductibles were rising faster than the cost of buying health coverage.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign also promised to \u201cvigorously enforce antitrust laws to scrutinize mergers and ensure they do not harm consumers,\u201d mentioning insurers as well as doctors and hospitals that sell them services.\n\nDeals announced this year will consolidate the health insurance industry\u2019s top five companies into three. In July, Anthem agreed to buy Cigna Corp. for about $48 billion, and Aetna struck a $35 billion deal for Humana Inc. Anthem\u2019s and Aetna\u2019s chief executive officers told lawmakers on Tuesday that the deals would benefit consumers and are necessary to succeed in a changing health-care landscape.\n\nClinton also would create a process for states that don\u2019t have the authority to block or modify health insurance premium increases to stop what the campaign called \u201cunreasonable\u201d rises in rates.\n\nHigher Deductibles\n\nConsumer costs are becoming the focus of the campaign\u2019s proposals, prompted in part by changes that have companies asking workers to pay a greater share of the cost of coverage. The deductibles that patients pay before insurance kicks in climbed about 9 percent this year, and workers now pay an average of $1,077 a year in upfront medical costs for a single-person plan, according to the Kaiser report.\n\nClare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the insurer lobby America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said consolidation by doctors and hospitals \u201cdrives up costs and insurance premiums for individuals across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe first need to address underlying prices for medical services and repeal costly taxes,\u201d Krusing said. The Affordable Care Act is partly funded by taxes on health insurance companies.\n\nMonthly Limits\n\nSince 2010, health insurance deductibles have grown 67 percent, while premiums are up 24 percent, according to the report, which was conducted with another research group, the Health Research & Educational Trust.\n\nClinton\u2019s drug-cost plan would limit patients\u2019 out-of-pocket spending on pharmaceutical treatment to $250 a month, or $3,000 a year. Obamacare limits total out-of-pocket medical spending to $6,600 a year for an individual and $13,200 for a family.\n\nClinton also would give patients three visits to a doctor for illnesses without having to meet their health insurer\u2019s deductible first, expanding on a provision in Obamacare that requires insurance companies to offer preventive health-care services, like flu shots and annual physicals, without cost-sharing.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "sailthru.author": "Anna Edney", "description": "The Democratic candidate\u00a0also called for health insurance reforms that build on what\u2019s already in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The Democratic candidate\u00a0also called for health insurance reforms that build on what\u2019s already in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.", "title": "Clinton Promises Health Insurance Merger Scrutiny in Plan", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-23/clinton-promises-health-insurance-merger-scrutiny-in-policy-plan", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/in2fJC6KVCho/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-23/clinton-promises-health-insurance-merger-scrutiny-in-policy-plan", "twitter": {"description": "The Democratic candidate\u00a0also called for health insurance reforms that build on what\u2019s already in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.", "title": "Clinton Promises Health Insurance Merger Scrutiny in Plan", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-23/clinton-promises-health-insurance-merger-scrutiny-in-policy-plan", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/in2fJC6KVCho/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Health,Policy Proposals", "fb": {"status": "The Democratic candidate\u00a0also called for health insurance reforms that build on what\u2019s already in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Clinton Promises Health Insurance Merger Scrutiny in Plan", "parsely-tags": "Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Health,Policy Proposals,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NV4XPC6VDKI301", "parsely-author": "Anna Edney", "parsely-type": "post", "date": "2015-09-23T17:00:01.001Z", "parsely-section": "politics", "news_keywords": "Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Health,Policy Proposals", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/in2fJC6KVCho/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-23T17:00:01.001Z"}, "article_summary": "Monthly LimitsSince 2010, health insurance deductibles have grown 67 percent, while premiums are up 24 percent, according to the report, which was conducted with another research group, the Health Research & Educational Trust.\nDeals announced this year will consolidate the health insurance industry\u2019s top five companies into three.\nObamacare limits total out-of-pocket medical spending to $6,600 a year for an individual and $13,200 for a family.\nClinton\u2019s drug-cost plan would limit patients\u2019 out-of-pocket spending on pharmaceutical treatment to $250 a month, or $3,000 a year.\nThe Affordable Care Act is partly funded by taxes on health insurance companies."}
