The Obama administration insists that religious freedom simply doesn\u2019t belong to families if they try to earn a living in business.\n\nImagine if we were to sit down with the Pilgrims at that first Thanksgiving table. It might surprise them to learn that their future government doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re entitled to religious freedom in their daily toil. Today, in the view of our government, anyway, freedom means keeping your faith \u2014 as long as you keep it to yourself.\n\nThis warped view of religious freedom was summed up recently by the federal appeals court in Chicago. It rejected the Obama administration\u2019s \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d view of religious freedom, as if it exists \u201cin the home and the house of worship but not beyond.\u201d A federal district judge in Pittsburgh was likewise bewildered by the government\u2019s attempt to \u201crestrict the right to the free exercise of religion as set forth in the First Amendment to a right to worship only.\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s few remaining defenders now claim that families in business are the real villains, not the Obama administration as it tries to amputate religious freedom from daily life. According to their view, unless we take religious freedom from families in business, \u201ccorporate personhood\u201d would be expanded. Obamacare\u2019s apologists sneer that \u201ccorporations don\u2019t go to heaven.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccorporate personhood\u201d bogeyman is a diversion. Families are the ones who must fund abortion drugs in their business or else Obamacare\u2019s Internal Revenue Service enforcers will destroy their livelihoods. Often these families are the ones whose parents and grandparents founded their family businesses in their garages, and who follow God\u2019s command to treat their customers and employees with fairness. Families are the ones being coerced by Obamacare if they dare try to earn a living in the United States.\n\nHyperventilation over \u201ccorporate personhood\u201d also reveals the radical abortion agenda of Obamacare\u2019s supporters. Media giants like The New York Times, Slate and others were apoplectic recently when the Supreme Court refused to block a Texas law that requires minimal safety precautions for women. That case was brought on behalf of for-profit abortion corporations, raising constitutional \u201crights\u201d that Roe v. Wade called \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cintimate.\u201d\n\nIn other words, for-profit abortion corporations can assert constitutional \u201crights\u201d to abortion and contraception so intimate the Constitution doesn\u2019t even mention them. The New York Times itself is a for-profit corporation exercising constitutional rights. Why don\u2019t families earning a living as job creators have a right to the free exercise of religion explicitly guaranteed to all Americans in the First Amendment and by the Clinton-era Religious Freedom Restoration Act?\n\nThe last time the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to cut religion from the First Amendment it lost 9-0 in Hosanna Tabor. Time and again, the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations, such as churches and universities, can exercise religion. Businesses, such as Jewish merchants objecting to Sunday-closing laws and Amish farmers objecting to certain taxes, can exercise religion, and people, such as pacifists or Sabbath observers who have trouble finding employment, seeking money \u2014 including government money \u2014 can exercise religion.\n\nAll Americans have religious freedom, whether doing business, worshipping, serving or pursuing health care. The Supreme Court should affirm the full breadth of religious freedom in daily life, from the lives of those first settlers of this country down through today.\n\nMatthew S.
