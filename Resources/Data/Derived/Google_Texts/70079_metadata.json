Trails and terrain: Up to 88 acres of new trails, plus no more than 164.4 gladed acres of terrain. Lodge: New Challenge Mountain facility below the top of the Indian Peaks lift, offering 16,000 to 20,000 square feet and 850 seats for guests. The existing Lookout facility would increase from 3,000 square feet to 7,700 to 9,700 square feet. Boundary adjustment: The resort's footprint would grow by about 70 to 75 acres toward Middle Boulder Creek and by less than 30 acres toward Jenny Creek. More info: Eldoraeis.com The proposed expansion and improvements at Eldora Mountain Resort are not likely to disturb the eternal sleep of the two men believed to be buried in the cold ground near a simple stone marker at Deadman's Gulch. And while the dead hold their silence, the land above and around them is alive with the pulse of progress. Eldora management is anxiously awaiting a finalized Environmental Impact Statement from the U.S. Forest Service accompanied by a draft decision on the future of its planned expansion. Resort officials believe a favorable ruling would ensure the ski area's ability to remain competitive in the ever-evolving winter sports market. Both documents from the Forest Service are expected to be released as soon as Feb. 26. Advertisement The notion that one or two people of a historic pioneer era are buried in a chilly valley of the Eldora nordic area, and potential implications for the expansion review, prompted a team of citizen sleuths to bring in cadaver dogs this past summer to probe the mysteries beneath the ground at Deadman's Gulch. There, just below the base of what management hopes will be the new high-speed detachable six-seat Jolly Jug lift, stands a simple waist-high stone marker, with a plaque bearing this legend: \"On this spot are buried two of Fremont's Men 1845-46.\" The site of Deadman's Gulch, near the boundary of Eldora Mountain Resort (Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer) But maybe they're not. Or maybe it's only one body. And maybe they had no association with the renowned Western explorer John C. Fremont, who went on to become one of the first two U.S. senators representing California. Dogs, radar brought to site It's doubtful that many have poured more time into the mystery than retired Boulder physician Bill Johnson, and a second local history buff with whom he has teamed up, Gary Flauaus. \"I'm a curious person, and so is Gary,\" said Johnson, who first happened on a mysterious memorial marker in the area while cross-country skiing in the late 1960s or early 1970s. \"How did the legend ever get started about the two Fremont men? This was wild country here in the 1840s. There was no one here but hostile Indians. Who were these men, why were they here, and what happened to them?\" Despite the best efforts of Johnson and Flauaus, local historian and Camera columnist Silvia Pettem \u2014 she brought Johnson and Flauaus together \u2014 plus others, a conclusive answer has not been found. \"Out of all the thousands of persons who must have seen the grave marker, why have they not also wondered as to its provenance? Only Gary and I?\" Johnson asked. J.D. Sharp, of Boulder, catches some air in the terrain park Thursday at Eldora.

(Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer) Eldora planning director Jim Spenst said the curious site, located in Eldora's nordic center at the bottom of Deadman's Trail, won't be threatened by anything Eldora does, providing the Forest Service signs off on the resort's plan. \"The proposed Jolly Jug lift bottom terminal is uphill from the marker approximately 75 yards,\" he wrote in an email. \"The proposed lift and trails will not affect the marker.\" Deep into the 500-plus pages of the Forest Service's Environmental Impact Statement draft, released last February, the burial site gets but brief mention. \"The Fremont Men's Burial was recommended as not eligible for the NRHP (National Register of Historic Places); however, avoidance is required until additional data can be gathered (this location is on private land),\" the draft document states. As part of the U.S. Forest Service's due diligence in making sure every potential impact of Eldora's plans has been evaluated, an agency representative was on hand Aug. 20 as two body-sniffing canines were unleashed in an attempt to verify whether anyone's remains are really there. And, if so, whose? Burial site moved? When the two dogs provided through Colorado Forensic Canines were loosed upon the site in August, their read of the landscape was inconclusive. The memorial marker visible today was put in place in 1983 by the late Henry W. Toll Jr., who owned the land where it stands today, according to local historians. But that is not where Johnson actually first saw a previous smaller, cut-stone marker a couple of decades earlier. \"The new marker wasn't where the old marker was,\" said Johnson, 79. \"The new marker is 50 feet south of where the old marker is. And the gravesite is within 15 feet of what we think of the old marker that we saw.\" Johnson was among the team that examined the site Aug. 20, along with Paul Alford, the environmental impact project leader for the Forest Service. Alford doubles as the south zone archaeologist for the Forest Service's Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland. \"The dog handlers were saying they didn't have any solid hits,\" said Alford, who noted the hounds were deployed separately so that they might not influence one another. \"They both hovered around the same spots, and they both got interested in a little pile of rocks that seemed suspicious. And that wasn't near the (new) marker, but what Bill (Johnson) said is where the original marker used to be.\" Johnson and Alford both recall that the dogs also keyed on a nearby tree, sniffing up its trunk; dog handlers have told the pair that cadaver dogs can detect when organic compounds from decomposed human bodies are taken into the root system of a tree, then the tree itself. Because of heavy groundwater saturation \u2014 the Jenny Creek wetlands are nearby \u2014 a ground-penetrating radar was of no help. \"There may be nothing there if the ground has a low Ph, which means it's acidic,\" said Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon before retirement. \"I have learned that, with what they call a 'clandestine gravesite,' if it's shallow and if it's in acidic soil ... after this length of time, which is about 150 years, then there would be nothing left. Not even skeletal remains.\" Furthermore, Johnson said that the older, original marker he saw in that area while skiing long ago claimed it as the final resting place of \"a Fremont man,\" not two. Alford, who had heard the same thing, said, \"I don't know how it became 'two'\" men. And then there's the debate over whether the men \u2014 or man \u2014 really had any association with at all with Fremont, who led five expeditions throughout the western United States prior to becoming one of the first U.S. senators from California after that state joined the union in 1850. \"I'm sure one or two men are buried there. But there were no Fremont expeditions through Boulder or Gilpin counties,\" Pettem wrote in an email. Patty Limerick, faculty director of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado, who describes herself as \"preoccupied\" with Fremont since 1975, also said the adventurer never personally explored in Boulder County. \"It seems like his most famous misadventures were in southern Colorado,\" Limerick said. \"I've always found it very funny that there's a vehicle called the Pathfinder. Fremont was known as 'the Pathfinder,' but he is not the person I would name a car after. Although he did not die (during his explorations), he made it possible for other people\" to die. Fremont lost 10 men on a brutal expedition in the winter of 1848-1849, one that reportedly saw men beaten down by winter in the southern Colorado mountains resort to cannibalism. Fremont's talent for imperiling others feeds into a theory of the Eldora memorial developed by Johnson and Flauaus. Their thesis holds that if there are two men buried in a lonely high-country grave on the fringes of the resort, they might be Shawnee hunters Jimmy Rodgers and his son, Thomas Jefferson Rodgers. They had been part of Fremont's second expedition, but according to Pettem, split from Fremont at Fort St. Vrain (modern-day Platteville) in 1843. Johnson believes that Rodgers and son may have been deployed by Fremont to western Boulder County in search of an overland pass suitable for the railroad line his father-in-law, then-U.S. Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, of Missouri, hoped could facilitate a St. Louis-to-San Francisco route. The only way to guarantee the viability of an overland mountain passage, perhaps at Rollins Pass, would have been to survey it in the heart of Colorado's challenging winter weather. Memorial's proximity not an issue Johnson's next planned step in his ongoing research into the mystery marker is to try to establish whether Jimmy Rodgers is interred elsewhere. If there is no record of such a burial, he said, then process of elimination will suggest to him even more strongly that the elder Rodgers might be spending his eternal rest on the slopes of Eldora. \"I think what happened is that by this time, Jimmy Rodgers was in his 70s, and his son was in his 40s, and that the father got hypothermia and died,\" Johnson said. \"The thing that is logical is that the son was able to not be frozen to death. That's my opinion, based on the research that I have been able to do.\" And where does this leave the Eldora expansion plans? It's likely not to affect them in any significant way \u2014 although Alford said the finalized environmental impact statement will recommend that the meadow area immediately adjacent to the memorial not be used for the staging of trucks and equipment, in order to protect both the memorial and the wetland area. \"The (Jolly Jug) terminal that's proposed over there, the last time I was there, I marked it, and it's actually a lot further away (from the memorial marker) than it looked on the map,\" Alford said. \"I don't see that as being an issue.\" Referring to the proposed Eldora expansion, Johnson said, \"I don't think anything would impair this marker or affect it in any way. I wouldn't be objecting to it at all.\" And likely, nor will the person or people buried at Deadman's Gulch.
