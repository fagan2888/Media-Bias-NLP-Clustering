According to a story published by Kaiser Health News, the 10 highest-priced markets are characterized by lack of competition among doctors, hospitals and insurers.\n\nThat will probably not be a surprise to most clinical laboratory managers and pathologists, particularly if they work for a health system that has lots of market clout in their community. That\u2019s because concentration of market share by just a few powerful hospitals or health systems is associated with higher prices for healthcare. However, there are exceptions.\n\nKaiser Researchers Studied Regional Markets for Health Insurance\n\nTo identify the nation\u2019s regions with the highest cost for health insurance, researchers at Kaiser identified the highest cost of a Silver Plan in each region. In every state, health insurance exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) offer Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum plans.\n\nAccording the report, published by Kaiser Health News, the type of coverage most often selected by consumers is the Silver Plan, which is a mid-range option.\n\nThe 10 highest-priced health insurance markets range from Colorado ski resort towns to Connecticut suburbs and rural regions of Georgia, Mississippi and Wisconsin, according to the Kaiser story.\n\nDark Daily Reported on the Least Expensive Health Insurance Markets\n\nKaiser Health News also reported the least expensive markets for health insurance. Dark Daily\u2019s coverage of that side of the story revealed that insurance premiums were ranked lowest in areas like Minneapolis-St. Paul\u2014cities with robust competition and deep experience with managed care. (See Dark Daily, \u201cKaiser\u2019s Ranking of 10 Least Expensive Markets for Health Insurance Contain Surprises and Show Where Prices for Pathology and Clinical Laboratory Testing May be Cheapest,\u201d March 3, 2014.)\n\nBut while the low price of $154 is a monthly premium paid by a 40-year-old in Minnesota, a whopping $483 per month may be paid by a resident of the same age in the Colorado mountain resort region. And $461 is the monthly premium paid by someone living in rural Baker County, Georgia. (Kaiser did note that these monthly premiums do not reflect any government subsidies for which an individual may qualify.)\n\n\u201cThe causes of the stratospheric premiums vary from region to region, although a recurring theme is that in some areas the limited number of hospitals and specialists allows them to demand high prices from insurers,\u201d Kaiser Health News reported.\n\n10 Most Expensive Markets for Health Insurance in the United States\n\nKaiser Family Foundation researchers ranked the expensive health insurance markets by the lowest cost Silver Plan for a 40-year-old. The 10 most expensive markets, including specific counties, are:\n\n$483; Colorado Mountain Resort Region. Eagle, Garfield and Pitkin counties, location of Aspen and Vail ski resorts. (Summit County premiums are $462). $461; Southwest Georgia. Baker, Calhoun, Clay, Crisp, Dougherty, Lee, Mitchell, Randolph, Schley, Sumter, Terrell and Worth counties. $456; Rural Nevada. Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Lincoln, Elko, Mineral, Pershing, White Pine and Churchill counties. $445; Far western Wisconsin. Pierce, Polk and St. Croix counties, near the St. Paul, Minn. (Interestingly, Minneapolis-St. Paul was ranked the least expensive health care market by Kaiser.) $423; Southern Georgia. Ben Hill, Berrien, Brooks, Clinch, Colquitt, Cook, Decatur, Early, Echols, Grady, Irwin, Lanier, Lowndes, Miller, Seminole, Thomas, Tift and Turner counties. $405; Most of Wyoming. All counties except Natrona and Laramie. $399; Southeast Mississippi. George, Harrison, Jackson & Stone counties (In Hancock County, $447 is the lowest price plan.) $395; Vermont. All counties. $383; Fairfield, Connecticut. (The southwestern-most county that includes New York City commuter areas.) $381; Alaska. All counties.\n\nCharacteristics of Most Expensive Health Insurance Markets\n\nLack of competition in the markets is one of the main reasons for the higher pricing. Other reasons include poor health of the population and actuarial tables themselves. Kaiser researchers took a look at the Colorado All-Payer Claims Database and reported that, in Summit County, the average hospital inpatient cost was $786, 61% above the state average.\n\nA New York Times analysis concluded that a goal of the ACA\u2014to increase competition among insurance companies\u2014is not being met in rural areas. The Times noted that insurers do not want to enter markets where medical costs are high or dominant players exist.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the structure of the Affordable Care Act which really deals with that problem [of little competition],\u201d observed John Holahan. \u201cI think that all else being equal, premiums will clearly be higher when there\u2019s not that competition.\u201d Holahan is a fellow at the Urban Institute and was quoted in The New York Times story.\n\nLessons and Insights for Clinical Laboratories and Pathology Groups\n\nFor pathologists, medical technologists and other laboratory leaders and professionals, health insurance marketplace issues are important to understand. Lessons can be learned from diverse areas like Colorado, Georgia and southwest Connecticut, where characteristics such as lack of competition, rural landscapes and poor health of populations have resulted in markets where, for now, health care seems to come at a higher price\u2014even with the ACA in effect.\n\n\u2014By Donna Marie Pocius\n\nRelated Information:\n\nThe 10 Most Expensive Insurance Markets in the U.S.\n\nHealth Care Law Fails to Lower Prices for Rural Areas\n\nAffordable Care Act & Health Insurance Marketplace", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, kaiser health news, 10 most expensive markets for health insurance, health insurance costs, laboratory news, states, health reform, insurance, health costs, affordable care act, marketplace, kaiser health foundation, dark daily, john halohan, health insurance premiums, the new york times, ,10 most expensive markets for health insurance,affordable care act,clinical laboratory,dark daily,health costs,health insurance costs,health insurance premiums,health reform,insurance,john halohan,kaiser health foundation,kaiser health news,laboratory news,marketplace,medical laboratory,states,the new york times,laboratory management and operations,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology,laboratory sales and marketing,management & operations", "description": "What do the 10 most expensive U.S.health insurance markets have in common?
