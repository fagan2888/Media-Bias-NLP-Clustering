Manning going into the game was already the oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl and will now decide whether he will end his career at a highpoint.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take some time to reflect,\u201d Manning said when asked if Super Bowl 50 is the end. \u201cI got a couple priorities first. I\u2019m going to go kiss my wife and my kids. \u2026 I\u2019m going to drink a lot of Budweiser tonight. Take care of those things first.\u201d\n\nBroncos linebacker Von Miller was named the MVP after finishing with six tackles, 2.5 sacks totaling a combined 27 yards, two quarterback hits, a pass defensed and the two forced fumbles. Denver\u2019s defense, left by Miller, plagued Panthers quarterback Cam Newton all night, despite him wearing golden shoes before the game.\n\nNewton finished off the season in which he was the league\u2019s MVP with the loss. Miller twice stripped him, once for a touchdown, the second time setting up a clinching TD. Denver\u2019s top-ranked defense, the same defense that ran over Tom Brady in the AFC championship, hammered away at Newton and wore him down.\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, we came into the game wanting to play our defense,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe knew if we were to be consistent and play [our] style of defense that we\u2019d be able to come out on top.\u201d\n\nStill, despite many commentators calling it his night, Miller credited his teammates.\n\n\u201cIf I could cut this award,\u201d he said, \u201cI would give it to DeMarcus [Ware] and [Derek] Wolfe and all the other guys. That\u2019s what I would do. This is all great and stuff, but for me, I want to be with my guys.\n\n\u201cI would take the ring. The MVP is great, but I\u2019ll take the ring. I want to go in there with my teammates.\u201d\n\nManning opened the game with an 18-yard completion to Owen Daniels, later hit Andre Caldwell for 22, and C.J. Anderson had a 13-yard run. When the Panthers held, Brandon McManus kicked a 34-yard field goal.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Peyton Manning, Super Bowl, Denver Broncos, Carolina Panthers, Super Bowl 50", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "The Denver Broncos Defeated the Carolina Panthers on Sunday 24-10 to win Super Bowl 50, making 39-year-old Peyton Manning the oldest quarterback to win.", "title": "Denver Broncos Defeat Carolina Panthers, 24-10, to Win Super Bowl 50", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0207%2Fr51607_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-08T07:49:10-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/sports/2016/02/08/denver-broncos-defeat-carolina-panthers-24-10-to-win-super-bowl-50/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Denver Broncos Defeated the Carolina Panthers on Sunday 24-10 to win Super Bowl 50, making 39-year-old Peyton Manning the oldest quarterback to win.", "title": "Denver Broncos Defeat Carolina Panthers, 24-10, to Win Super Bowl 50 | People's Pundit Daily", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/sports/2016/02/08/broncos-d-dominates-panthers-in-24-10-super-bowl-50-win/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/876/493/1454889430974.jpg", "creator": "@PPDNews", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/sports/2016/02/08/denver-broncos-defeat-carolina-panthers-24-10-to-win-super-bowl-50/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/36266", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/36266", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "robots": "noodp", "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "Peyton Manning, Super Bowl, Denver Broncos, Carolina Panthers, Super Bowl 50", "article": {"section": "Sports", "tag": "Super Bowl", "published_time": "2016-02-08T06:16:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T07:49:10-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "The Denver Broncos Defeated the Carolina Panthers on Sunday 24-10 to win Super Bowl 50, making 39-year-old Peyton Manning the oldest quarterback to win."}, "article_summary": "The Denver Broncos Defeated the Carolina Panthers on Sunday 24-10 to win Super Bowl 50, making 39-year-old Peyton Manning the oldest quarterback ever to win the big game.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take some time to reflect,\u201d Manning said when asked if Super Bowl 50 is the end.\nDenver\u2019s defense, left by Miller, plagued Panthers quarterback Cam Newton all night, despite him wearing golden shoes before the game.\nManning going into the game was already the oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl and will now decide whether he will end his career at a highpoint.\n\u201cIn all honesty, we came into the game wanting to play our defense,\u201d Miller said."}
