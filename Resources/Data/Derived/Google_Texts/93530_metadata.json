In 2012 alone, the CDC says 259 million prescriptions were written for painkillers, enough to supply every American adult with a bottle of pills.\n\nNow many states are pushing back, including New York, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, and Washington State. Three of those states now require doctors to check a patient database before writing a prescription. This year, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Georgia, and Texas are also considering tighter laws.\n\nBut some physicians and patient advocates say this crackdown is creating new problems.\n\nWe get two views now.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny is the director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. He\u2019s also chief medical officer for the Phoenix House Foundation. It\u2019s a national nonprofit addiction agency. Bob Twillman is the executive director of the American Academy of Pain Management and also a clinical psychologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Mr. Twillman was caught in a traffic jam tonight. He couldn\u2019t make it to the studio, so he joins us by telephone.\n\nAnd we welcome both of you.\n\nDr. Kolodny, I\u2019m going to turn to you first. You believe that it is important to impose more regulations on the use of painkillers. Why?\n\nDR. ANDREW KOLODNY, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing: Well, the United States is in the midst of a severe epidemic of opioid addiction and overdose deaths. According to the CDC, this is the worst drug epidemic in United States\u2019 history.\n\nAnd the CDC has been very clear about what\u2019s causing this epidemic. The CDC has said that, as prescriptions for opioid painkillers began to skyrocket in the late 1990s, that it\u2019s led to parallel increases in rates of addiction and overdose deaths. And what this is suggesting is that we may not be able to turn this epidemic around until doctors and dentists begin to prescribe more cautiously.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And what \u2014 just quickly, what do you mean by that, more cautiously?\n\nDR. ANDREW KOLODNY: Well, the United States, with about 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, is consuming 80 percent of the world\u2019s entire oxycodone supply and 99 percent of the world\u2019s hydrocodone supply.\n\nOpioids are essential medicines for end-of-life care or when used short term for acute pain, but this vast overprescribing of opioids is mainly for conditions where use of opioids are probably not safe or effective, like low back pain with a normal spine, fibromyalgia, chronic headache.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Bob Twillman, let me turn to you now. And, again, apologies that we\u2019re \u2014 you are not able to join us on television, but we can hear you.\n\nYou have told us that you believe some regulations of painkillers makes sense, but you think the regulations have gone too far. Why do you believe that?\n\nBOB TWILLMAN, American Academy of Pain Management: Well, I think what we have seen with regulations in this area has been an attempt to find very simple solutions to what is really two complex problems, those two problems being the problems with prescription drug abuse, but also the problem of chronic pain.\n\nAnd, you know, just a point on that, if prescription drug abuse is an epidemic, then I think chronic pain may be a pandemic, because the Institute of Medicine tells us that affects over 100 million people in the United States. So I think what we have to do is to find the kinds of solutions that really address both of these problems and don\u2019t wind up giving us what\u2019s essentially a zero sum game.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Kolodny, what about his point? You heard him, that there\u2019s a problem with chronic pain and something has to be done about that.\n\nDR. ANDREW KOLODNY: Chronic pain is a serious problem, and many Americans do suffer with chronic pain.\n\nBut, unfortunately, we are harming far more people with chronic pain than we\u2019re helping when we treat them with long-term opioid medications.\n\nWhen we talk about drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone, these are drugs that come from opium, in the same way that heroin comes from opium. And, in fact, the effects that hydrocodone and oxycodone produce are indistinguishable from heroin. So these drugs are essential. We should be using them, but we shouldn\u2019t be treating low back pain, fibromyalgia and chronic headaches with long-term opioids.\n\nWhat we heard from Bob Twillman is really the argument that the industry has been making from the very beginning of this epidemic. They would like policy-makers to think there are these two distinct populations, millions of pain patients who are helped by these medications and drug abusers.\n\nAnd what they\u2019re saying is, let\u2019s not penalize the pain patients for the bad behavior of the drug abusers. The reality is that we don\u2019t have two distinct populations. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of overlap. And when you look at who\u2019s dying from painkiller overdose deaths, the majority appear to be patients having these medications prescribed to them for chronic pain.\n\nIn fact, there are more Americans dying from painkiller overdoses who are getting these medications from doctors than young people who we now see switching to heroin.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, Bob Twillman, if that\u2019s the case, why shouldn\u2019t there be much more careful regulation of the prescription of these painkillers?\n\nBOB TWILLMAN: Well, we do think there should be much more careful use of these medications.\n\nWe also agree that they are being overprescribed and prescribed for the wrong kinds of pain. So, I think we have to do, though, is to find the solutions that will allow to us really use these medications for those patients for whom they do provide benefit, and not get into a situation where what we\u2019re doing is saying, let\u2019s just \u2014 let\u2019s just lower the supply across the board, because what we have seen is that the policies that we have put in place in the last few years that have actually done that have caused patients who have legitimate pain and need these medications to be fully functional have trouble getting those medications.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: How have you seen that? Where is the evidence for that?\n\nBOB TWILLMAN: Well, you know, it\u2019s hard evidence to collect, because, in essence, what you\u2019re doing is asking people to collect evidence about services that have not been delivered to them, as opposed to services that have been delivered.\n\nBut I have talked to patients who call into our offices and tell us they\u2019re having trouble getting their prescriptions filled. One gentleman I talked to had been to 35 pharmacies trying to get his prescription filled. And he had been to \u2014 going to the same pharmacy year after year, month after month, and one month he shows up and they say, we won\u2019t fill this anymore. We can\u2019t fill this anymore.\n\nAnd so he winds up going to 35 pharmacies trying to get his prescription filled.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are clearly not going to be able to resolve this tonight.\n\nDr. Kolodny, just very quickly, what is your answer, in brief, to those individuals who can\u2019t get prescriptions who need them?\n\nDR. ANDREW KOLODNY: I think that we do all need to worry about access to opioid medications, and we\u2019re beginning to see pharmacies put signs in the window that say, \u201cNo oxycodone here.\u201d\n\nThe pharmacists are not doing that because of state or federal interventions or regulations. They\u2019re doing this because they\u2019re worried about getting robbed or shot. We have a severe epidemic of opioid addiction. And if we want to preserve access to opioids so that they\u2019re available for all of us when we need them, we need to bring this epidemic under control. And that may not happen until doctors and dentists begin to prescribe more cautiously.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Andrew Kolodny, Bob Twillman, we thank you both.\n\nBOB TWILLMAN: Thank you.\n\nDR.
