Under Obama's plan, newly protected immigrants will not be eligible for public health benefits such as Medicaid, the government's program for poor or disabled Americans, or Medicare, the government's health care program for seniors.\n\nBut immigrants will be paying taxes into those programs.\n\n\"These individuals' eligibility for programs will not change,\" Padilla says.\n\nPrivate health care options, however, are available, and may become more accessible. Coverage can be provided through an employer, through becoming a dependent on a spouse's plan or bought directly from an insurance company.\n\nUnder the executive action, work permits will be available for 4 million immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for over five years and have children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents. Once they pass a background check, they will get work authorizations and Social Security numbers and will be required to pay taxes. Those who obtain jobs that come with health insurance coverage would have the same employer-sponsored benefits as others, which also could include dental or vision coverage.\n\nThe move is likely to result in coverage for only a small number of uninsured immigrants living in the country illegally, says Steven P. Wallace, associate director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\n\n\"It will help, but it's on the margin because of the types of industries people are in,\" he says, adding that a lot of service or construction jobs that immigrants tend to work in do not typically come with health insurance.\n\nSome newly shielded immigrants may choose to go after new jobs, however. \"If you have a paper that says you can work here legally, then the breadth of employers likely to hire you is much wider, so you are more likely to find employer-sponsored health insurance,\" Wallace says.\n\nThere are an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission, according to the Pew Research Center. Through the executive action plan, the Department of Homeland Security will focus its efforts on deporting serious criminals and immigrants who recently entered the U.S.\n\nCritics of Obama's immigration action have been concerned that new protections would allow immigrants in the U.S. illegally to take part in benefits provided by the Affordable Care Act \u2013 the president's health care reform bill \u2013 which last year provided citizens with $36 billion in health savings.\n\n[READ: Obamacare Enrollment Estimates Reduced]\n\nUnder the law, Americans are required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. Newly protected citizens would, as before, not have to pay the tax, but they also could not access more affordable health insurance subsidized by the government.\n\nAlso under Obamacare, Americans who do not qualify for Medicaid, who do not have an employer-sponsored insurance plan or cannot afford their own health coverage can receive government-funded subsidies allowing them to buy plans at a reduced price through federal and state online marketplaces. The marketplaces help people shop for health plans in their areas at different benefit levels.\n\nThe subsidies, however, specifically are not extended to people who do not have legal immigration status, and would not include newly protected immigrants. In September, the Obama administration cut off health insurance coverage for 112,000 people who, after multiple outreach efforts from federal health officials, did not provide proof of their citizenship or immigration status, according to the most recent figures provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe subsidies also are not expected to apply to younger people protected under Obama's executive action plan. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, originally launched in 2012, will be extended under the plan to allow more immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children \u2013 so-called Dreamers \u2013 to be shielded from deportation. Shortly after the 2012 program was put in place, health officials issued regulations saying Dreamers would not be eligible to take part in federal health care programs like Medicaid or sign up for insurance through the marketplaces \u2013 rules expected to continue under the new executive action plan.\n\nAnd while immigrants do have the option of purchasing health insurance directly through an insurance company or a broker, Padilla doesn't think many will avail themselves of such an option. \"A lot of [plans] are unaffordable,\" he says. \"Without access [to the marketplaces], it will probably be out of reach.\"\n\nUnder federally facilitated marketplace plans, customers receiving Obamacare tax credit subsidies were paying an average monthly premium of $82 after receiving an average credit amount of $264.\n\n[READ: Obamacare Hasn't Propelled Mental Health Treatment]\n\nThere are other ways newly protected immigrants can receive coverage or care, though. Even before Obamacare or the announcement of Thursday's executive action, the government was funding some health care for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.\n\nUnder the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, for example, hospitals are reimbursed when they provide emergency and maternity care for low-income people who need it, regardless of immigration status. The federal government paid out $1.3 billion under the program in 2011, according to The Washington Post, and states paid hundreds of millions more. Immigrants in the country illegally also can receive medical care through community health clinics.\n\n\"It's good to have that safety net, but we think it's better to get them enrolled so they can have access to affordable health insurance,\" Padilla says.\n\nCoverage also varies by location. The District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington state offer health insurance through state funds to low-income people granted deferred status, and more people could be added to those rolls under the expanded categories. In California, Dreamers can get coverage paid for by Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, and emergency Medicaid also is available to pregnant women delivering their babies.\n\n\n\nReducing the threat of deportation will not just help immigrants' health through providing access to better jobs that can offer health insurance, Wallace says, but people also will be less afraid to seek medical care when they need it.\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction for people who contribute to our economy \u2026 but just one,\" he says.\n\nPadilla, who advocates for greater health care access for immigrants, says he has to keep in perspective how much the president's plan means for immigrants despite the lack of health care access.\n\n\"This is such a huge deal for a lot of families. There are things we wish were included. But in reality, this is transformative for a lot of people,\" he says.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "public health", "title": "Obama's Immigration Action Still Leaves Health Coverage Gap", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Newly protected immigrants do not get some health care benefits, although coverage may be within reach.", "title": "Immigration Action Leaves Health Coverage Gap", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/21/obamas-immigration-action-still-leaves-health-coverage-gap", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1b/d38a98dc8edcf82861c5f43c8f496f/media:5adf5864036b4ee5be257b486d7fa17cObamaImmigration.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newly protected immigrants do not get some health care benefits, although coverage may be within reach.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's Immigration Action Still Leaves Health Coverage Gap"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 21, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,immigration reform,immigration,HHS,health care,health,Pulse,picks,public health", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Newly protected immigrants do not get some health care benefits, although coverage may be within reach."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4fd\"", "article_summary": "Those who obtain jobs that come with health insurance coverage would have the same employer-sponsored benefits as others, which also could include dental or vision coverage.\nThe subsidies also are not expected to apply to younger people protected under Obama's executive action plan.\n[READ: Obamacare Enrollment Estimates Reduced]Under the law, Americans are required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.\nPrivate health care options, however, are available, and may become more accessible.\nPadilla, who advocates for greater health care access for immigrants, says he has to keep in perspective how much the president's plan means for immigrants despite the lack of health care access."}
