However, as Churchill said in a delightful essay called \u201cA word to end a sentence with,\u201d there is certain nonsense up with which I will not put.\n\nA reader who goes by the name of \u201cThe_Heretic70\u201d had this to say about my weekend article, \u201cThe Trumpster as Joker: Can He Go All the Way?\u201d\n\nThe Wilson nitwit states what Trump is saying, he will not (do).\u2026 I doubt that very much. In fact, I look forward to all of it occurring. The author is an imbecile. He was probably one of those that didn\u2019t believe Obama when he said he was going to fundamentally change this country [emphasis added]. Look at how that turned out for us.\n\nI take a back seat to no one \u2014 and certainly not to Donald Trump or any of his supporters \u2014 when it comes to early and strongly stated recognition of just how ruinous the \u201ctransformation\u201d promised by Obama could be. I wrote this articlein the Wall Street Journal in early September 2008, just a few days after he became nominee for president at the Democratic Party convention in Denver.\n\nSince then, I have written scores of other articles (some screaming with outrage, others of a satiric bent) criticizing Obama and his policies. That includes more than a hundred articles in The American Spectator.\n\nWhat was Trump doing back at this time. Well, in 2006, he was a big supporter and heavy contributor to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. You can credit him with help to create the Democratic Party super-majorities of both houses that went on to pass Obamacare.\n\nTrump contributed to Hillary Clinton in her race against Obama in the Democratic primary. And he wants to run against her in 2016.\n\nAfter all the wrack and ruin left behind by Obama, it scares the hell out of me to think that it could come down to a choice between the two of them in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "You can credit him with help to create the Democratic Party super-majorities of both houses that went on to pass Obamacare.\nI will defend to the death the right of any American Spectator reader to call me (or anyone else in the stable of writers) a nitwit.\nI wrote this articlein the Wall Street Journal in early September 2008, just a few days after he became nominee for president at the Democratic Party convention in Denver.\nTrump contributed to Hillary Clinton in her race against Obama in the Democratic primary.\nSince then, I have written scores of other articles (some screaming with outrage, others of a satiric bent) criticizing Obama and his policies."}
