The Kansas Highway Patrol and law enforcment in Harvey County took around 40 children and their families fishing, hoping to better the relationship between officers and the community.

This was the 10th year of the C.A.S.T. for Kids program, which takes children with special needs or in special circumstances and teaches them how to fish.

The Kansas Highway Patrol sponsored the event.

The goal for law enforcement is to build a better relationship between them and children.

"We want to build the trust of the children, we do not want them to ever be afraid of law enforcement," said Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Chad Crittenden.

The fishing took place at Harvey County East Lake, just east of the town of Newton, Kan.

All the children received an award for their fishing.
