An Edmond man died in a motorcycle wreck that involved several vehicles on Interstate 35, Thursday afternoon.

It happened around 3:52 p.m. Thursday on northbound Interstate 35, north of Wilshire in Oklahoma County.

According to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, 56-year-old Kent Thionnet was traveling on northbound Interstate 35 on a 2005 Harley Davidson motorcycle.

The collision report states traffic slowed due to congestion, causing Thionnet to brake and depart the roadway to the left. The motorcycle laid down, making contact with the ground, and caused Thionnet to strike a cable barrier support post.

OHP said Thionnet died at the scene from head and neck injuries.

The report states Thionnet was wearing a helmet, and the cause of the collision was "unsafe speed - for traffic conditions."
