Some people work 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet, and that is a value that has been considered for a long time to be something, you know, that has merit.\n\nKirsten Powers replied:\n\nJust to be clear, jobs haven\u2019t been cut, the number of hours have gone back, people have taken less numbers (of hours). People have chosen to work fewer hours. ...If you\u2019re a person who had an elderly parent to take care of or a child and the only way to do it was to cut back on your hours and now you were able to do it because of having health insurance, I think you\u2019d probably think it was a net plus. \u2026Americans haven\u2019t always worked like this. \u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always been normal to work the way that we work, and so I like the idea that people aren\u2019t locked into their jobs just for health insurance and working extra hours and do other things including being with their families.\n\nBut MacCallum made it clear that the values she really cares about are making sure that her own \u201cmaker\u201d dollars don't go to the \u201ctakers.\u201d She said, \u201cIt\u2019s this overall philosophy\u2026 that it\u2019s better to work less and to perhaps have the government help you out a bit more. And that\u2019s really the debate that\u2019s at question here.\u201d\n\nOr to put it another way,\"patriot\" MacCallum thinks it\u2019s better that more Americans should struggle and stay locked into jobs in order to get health insurance than to cough up any of her dough to them.\n\nVideo below, from yesterday's America's Newsroom, via Media Matters.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "Lx+UVkna0E59srA9W69ZkocOm7MtkUX9CtdheTsReQI=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/martha_maccallum_thinks_it_s_just_peachy_for_you_to_work_2_or_3_jobs_to_get_by_02112014", "type": "article", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "title": "Martha MacCallum Thinks It\u2019s Just Peachy For You To Work 2 or 3 Jobs To Get By"}, "Title": "Martha MacCallum Thinks It\u2019s Just Peachy For You To Work 2 or 3 Jobs To Get By"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd04\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s good to know that Martha MacCallum\u2019s generous salary has not prevented her from knowing that it\u2019s downright patriotic or, as she put it, \u201cuniquely American,\u201d for other people to work three jobs just to make ends meet.\nKirsten Powers replied:Just to be clear, jobs haven\u2019t been cut, the number of hours have gone back, people have taken less numbers (of hours).\nPeople have chosen to work fewer hours.\nSome people work 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet, and that is a value that has been considered for a long time to be something, you know, that has merit.\nAnd that\u2019s really the debate that\u2019s at question here.\u201dOr to put it another way,\"patriot\" MacCallum thinks it\u2019s better that more Americans should struggle and stay locked into jobs in order to get health insurance than to cough up any of her dough to them."}
