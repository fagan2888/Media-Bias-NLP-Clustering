Reid made the calculation that in the GOP\u2019s current chaotic contest for Speaker of the House, Ryan was the best that Democrats could hope for.\n\n\u201cHe appears to me to be reasonable,\u201d Reid said to reporters. \u201cI mean, look at some of the other people.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some of the \u201cother people\u201d\u2014such as Representative \u201cTaliban Dan\u201d Webster of Florida, an acolyte of the disgraced, misogynist religious leader Bill Gothard\u2014are pretty horrifying. But if Ryan\u2019s the most \u201creasonable\u201d the Republicans have to offer, they really do have an extremism problem. Because Paul Ryan, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and former vice presidential candidate, is no moderate. In fact, were Ryan to win the speaker\u2019s gavel, the Koch brothers\u2019 control of Congress will be virtually complete.\n\nIn 2005, at a meeting of an Ayn Rand fan club known as the Atlas Society, Ryan voiced his contempt for Social Security, decrying it as a \u201ccollectivist system.\u201d\n\nHis idea for reforming Medicare is to voucherize it, leaving seniors with a fixed amount to apply to their medical bills, regardless of individual circumstances.\n\nRyan is a no-exceptions anti-choicer, and an opponent of programs that help the poor, such as food stamps, whose funding he proposed cutting by $150 billion over the course of 10 years.\n\nHe\u2019s such an anti-choice zealot he\u2019s earned a 100-percent rating from National Right to Life, having cast votes for bills asserting that human life begins at fertilization, another based on false \u201cfetal pain\u201d science, and one that would apply 14th-Amendment protections to fetuses. One of these anti-choice bills, postulates Kevin Drum of Mother Jones, would theoretically allow a rapist to sue the woman he raped if she aborts a pregnancy produced by the crime.\n\nIn 2013, he did the bidding of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, threatening to shut down the federal government if the contraception mandate in Obamacare were allowed to stand.\n\nMost of all, Paul Ryan, for all his Catholic schoolboy (I once watched him mansplain Catholic doctrine to Sister Simone Campbell of Nuns on the Bus Fame), goody-two-shoes demeanor, is a liar of the pants-on-fire variety.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, Ryan fabricated positions he ascribed to President Barack Obama. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, he recast the $716 billion in Medicare savings budgeted into the Affordable Care Act as a cut to the Medicare program.\n\nHe even claimed that Obama had promised to keep open a General Motors plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, and blamed the president for its closure. Never mind that Obama never made such a pledge and that the plant had closed during the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nAt the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference, he repeated a lie told by Eloise Anderson, an aide to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who said she had met a little boy who claimed that he\u2019d rather bring his lunch to school in a brown paper bag than eat his subsidized school lunch\u2014because the lunch from home proved somebody cared about him. (You can read the debunking here.)\n\nAnd this is the man the Senate majority leader thinks Democrats have the best shot at working with.\n\nThe Republicans find themselves in their current pickle, you\u2019ll recall, because John Boehner, the man who currently wields the gavel, failed to pass the ideological purity test concocted by the secretive House Freedom Caucus, whose complete membership list has yet to be revealed to the public. Guesses are that the Freedom Caucus numbers some 40 or so far-right members of Congress\u2014enough to scuttle any outcome that fails to satisfy members\u2019 every desire on critical votes such as that for House Speaker.\n\nHFC members have less seniority on the whole than other Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center, so they want more power as rank-and-file members.\n\nOne thing Freedom Caucus members seem to revile is the kind of give-and-take demanded of this thing we call governance. The only good deal, in their eyes, is one that gives them absolutely everything they want. These are the people who would shut down the government in order to deprive low-income women of cancer screenings in Planned Parenthood clinics; they are the folks who now threaten the same rather than permit the government to borrow money to meet the financial obligations bestowed on it by Congress.\n\nThey never liked Boehner\u2014too much of an old-style politician, the kind who make deals with the other side in order to pass legislation. Plus, they didn\u2019t like the way he ran the House, enforcing discipline in ways that deprived the minority Freedom Caucus of the gargantuan importance its members believe to be its natural right.\n\nThey threatened a challenge to Boehner\u2019s speakership, effectively forcing him out. They didn\u2019t like Kevin McCarthy, either\u2014the House majority leader who seemed poised to win the gavel, until he revealed the GOP's hand regarding the real reason for the Benghazi committee\u2014to harm the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn Tuesday night\u2019s meeting with fellow Republicans, Ryan postured to suggest that he was open to accepting the speaker\u2019s job, while making it difficult for the Freedom Caucus types to line up behind him. Included in his demands is that the rule the Caucus threatened to invoke to push out Boehner (a motion to vacate the chair) be done away with, which would serve to consolidate the speaker\u2019s power\u2014something it\u2019s difficult to see the far-right types accepting.\n\nBut if rejected, Paul Ryan, inveterate liar, will get to pretend that he tried to be a hero.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "He may seem moderate next to the House Freedom Caucus, but the former vice presidential candidate holds plenty of extreme positions.", "title": "Sorry, Paul Ryan is Far From 'Reasonable'", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/sorry-paul-ryan-far-reasonable", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/ap551293794597_0.jpg?itok=C5L-gkET", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce387\"", "article_summary": "But if rejected, Paul Ryan, inveterate liar, will get to pretend that he tried to be a hero.\nBecause Paul Ryan, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and former vice presidential candidate, is no moderate.\nAs House Republicans huddled Tuesday with Representative Paul Ryan, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid gave the Wisconsinite something of a thumbs-up.\nAP Photo/Andrew Harnik Representative Paul Ryan speaks at a news conference following a House Republican meeting, Tuesday, October 20, 2015, on Capitol Hill in Washington.\nOne thing Freedom Caucus members seem to revile is the kind of give-and-take demanded of this thing we call governance."}
