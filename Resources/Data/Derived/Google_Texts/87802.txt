People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has named Jared Leto and Ellen Page as the “Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrities” of 2014, touting their vegan and professional qualities as their reasons for winning.

Leto, the front man of the band 30 Seconds To Mars, is 42 but claims his vegan lifestyle has contributed to his youthful looks: “I’m pretty healthy so I think that helps a lot,” he told British GQ in 2013. “I’ve been that way for a long time — 20 solid years of eating vegetarian/vegan and taking care of myself. That probably helps the preservation process.”

Page beat out Jenna Dewan-Tatum, Kate Mara, Laura Prepon and Jessica Paré for the Sexiest Vegetarian title; Leto won over Peter Dinklage, Woody Harrelson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Samuel L. Jackson.

Not only does Leto only eat vegan food — meaning no dairy or meat products — but he also has a tendency to highlight his vegan lifestyle on his Instagram by showing off “vegan leather cuffs" or flipping vegan pancakes.

Page is 27 and enjoys the vegan lifestyle, noting that it makes her feel great. “I really used to eat a lot of crap,” she said in a TakePart interview in 2010. “And now I don’t, and I feel great, and I absolutely love healthy food.” In 2011, Page tweeted her support for vegans: “Why are vegans made fun of while the inhumane factory farming process regards animals and the natural world merely as commodities to be exploited for profit?” PETA describes Page as “a feminist, an environmentalist, an activist, a pioneer, and a compassionate vegan. It doesn’t get sexier than that!”

On its Vegan Life website, PETA offers a full list of easy ways to go vegan — from buying mock meats like pig-free pork and faux chicken or turkey, to “Non-Dairy Delights” like vegan butter, frozen desserts and soy-cheese. Previously, PETA awarded the Sexiest Vegetarian titles to Kristen Wiig, Olivia Wilde, Carrire Underwood, Russell Brand, Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, and Leona Lewis.
