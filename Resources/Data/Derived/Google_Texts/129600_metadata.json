(The general election might be different.) Catch him making an utterly false assertion, and his supporters just see it as the liberal media conspiring against him. It\u2019s driving the establishment Republicans wild.\n\nBut really, why should they be shocked? Think about what the establishment has to say on other issues. The chairman of the House science committee says that global warming is a fraud, perpetrated by a vast conspiracy at the NOAA, which is presumably part of a global scientific conspiracy. When the administration reported large numbers of people signing up for Obamacare, leading Republican Senators accused it of cooking the books \u2014 and I\u2019m unaware of any apology or even acknowledgement that they were wrong. Rush Limbaugh claimed that one of the Batman films was an anti-Romney conspiracy. And on and on.\n\nSo how are base voters supposed to know that Trump\u2019s claims that the media suppressed films of Muslims cheering on 9/11 mark him as crazy, while all the other conspiracy theories on the right are OK? I guess someone could try to put out a cheat sheet listing acceptable and unacceptable tin-hat views; but Trump would just call that part of the conspiracy, and a lot of people would believe him.\n\nSorry, guys, you created this monster, and now he\u2019s coming for you.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151125154427, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 25, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/It's A Conspiracy!
