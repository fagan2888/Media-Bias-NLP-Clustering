The three-day Medicare payment window applies to outpatient services that hospitals and hospitals' wholly owned or wholly operated Medicare Part B entities provide to Medicare beneficiaries. It requires providers to bundle the technical component of all outpatient diagnostic and related non-diagnostic services with the claim for an inpatient stay when they are administered in the three days preceding an inpatient admission.\n\nFurthermore, according to the AHA, hospitals will lose $35.3 billion to Medicare severity diagnosis-related group coding cuts in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and CMS regulations.\n\nAnother $2.4 billion in cuts will come from an offset for the two-midnight rule, under which inpatient admissions are considered reasonable and necessary for Medicare beneficiaries who require more than a one-day hospital stay or who need inpatient-only treatment.\n\nFinally, in accordance with the Bipartisan Budget Act, long-term acute care hospital payments will be reduced by $3 billion.\n\nMore Articles on Hospital Payments:\n\nAHA: Medicare, Medicaid Underpaid Hospitals by $56B\n\nHospital Groups: Don't Cut Medicare to Fund Unemployment Benefits\n\nAHA to MedPAC: Consider Sequestration Effects for 2015 Medicare Payments\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
