Whether a person agrees with that view or not, it's our sincerely held belief. We believe it to our core.\"\n\nUnder the HHS rules, employees must have access to all contraceptives, including the four in question, in order for the employer to comply with Obamacare and the contraceptive mandate and avoid penalties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe petitioners oppose the accommodation rule that they have to submit a form stating that they're a religious employer and they object to the contraceptives and the insurance company will pay for it instead of the institution.\n\n\"They sincerely believe that fulfilling the contraceptive mandate via this regulatory option facilitates the provision of contraceptives and abortifacients and makes them complicit in actions that violate their religious beliefs,\" the petition said.\n\nIt said countless religious colleges and seminaries, faith-based charities, orders of nuns, and other religious organisations remain subject to the contraceptive mandate.\n\nIn October 2012, the two universities filed a suit while Westminster intervened in March 2013 to challenge the mandate.\n\nA district court issued a permanent injunction in their favour in December 2013. The government appealed and last month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied relief to the two universities and the seminary.\n\n\"The government has already told thousands of businesses they don't need to comply with the HHS mandate. So why is it bullying nuns, religious schools, soup kitchens, and homeless shelters unless they comply? It makes no sense,\" said Diana Verm, legal counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.\n\nSloan said, \"We cannot help the government or anyone else provide potentially life-threatening drugs and devices. The government has many other ways to achieve its goals without involving us. It ought to pick one of those and let us go back to educating our students.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three religious educational institutions are asking the US Supreme Court to intervene in their appeal to overturn the contraceptive accommodation mandate under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Religious groups seek US Supreme Court action on Obamacare contraceptive rules", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/32974/houston-rally.jpg", "description": "Three religious educational institutions are asking the US Supreme Court to intervene in their appeal to overturn the contraceptive accommodation mandate under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Religious groups seek US Supreme Court action on Obamacare contraceptive rules"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,Obamacare contraceptive accommodation,Affordable Care Act,deadly contraceptives", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It said countless religious colleges and seminaries, faith-based charities, orders of nuns, and other religious organisations remain subject to the contraceptive mandate.\n(Becket Fund for Religious Liberty)Three religious educational institutions are asking the US Supreme Court to intervene in their appeal to overturn the contraceptive accommodation mandate under the Affordable Care Act.\n\"The government has already told thousands of businesses they don't need to comply with the HHS mandate.\nUnder the HHS rules, employees must have access to all contraceptives, including the four in question, in order for the employer to comply with Obamacare and the contraceptive mandate and avoid penalties.\nIt makes no sense,\" said Diana Verm, legal counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty."}
