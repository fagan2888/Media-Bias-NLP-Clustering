He also discussed his experience in Washington so far.\n\n\"I liken it to a boxing match. You get into your corner and you get all revved up and you go out and you box for maybe 15 rounds.

And the people are competent. They are good people. The system needs to change.\u201d\n\nAshford said government either does too little, such as passing the Affordable Care Act without any debate, or does way too little by doing nothing about immigration reform. He said it\u2019s been on the agenda for 12 years and has never been debated.\n\nCongressman Brad Ashford\u2019s presentation will air in its entirety on KIOS on Monday, May 18th at Noon.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government", "description": "Congressman Brad Ashford was the special guest at an Omaha Press Club Noon Forum earlier this month.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kios.org/post/congressman-brad-ashford-his-first-90-days-office", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kios/files/styles/medium/public/201504/brad_ashford.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Congressman Brad Ashford was the special guest at an Omaha Press Club Noon Forum earlier this month.", "title": "Congressman Brad Ashford On His First 90 Days in Office"}, "story_id": 400063598, "twitter": {"site": "@kiosomaha", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kiosomaha"}, "author": "Cheril Lee", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Congressman Brad Ashford On His First 90 Days in Office"}, "nid": 62350, "datePublished": "2015-04-16", "keywords": ",", "wordCount": 238, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Congressman Brad Ashford was the special guest at an Omaha Press Club Noon Forum earlier this month.\nAshford talked about some of the challenges he has faced in his first 90 days in office as well as what he thinks the future will bring.\nCongressman Brad Ashford\u2019s presentation will air in its entirety on KIOS on Monday, May 18th at Noon.\nAnd at the end of 15 rounds, it\u2019s a draw.\nYou get into your corner and you get all revved up and you go out and you box for maybe 15 rounds."}
