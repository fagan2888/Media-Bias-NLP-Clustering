But the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services thinks the new physician payment system unveiled on Wednesday is the first step to winning them back, he told POLITICO in an exclusive interview.\n\nAppearing on the debut episode of POLITICO\u2019s \u201cPulse Check\u201d podcast, Slavitt said the new payment system, MACRA, is intended to make amends for the electronic health records Meaningful Use program and other onerous reporting requirements that have left doctors feeling over-regulated and overmeasured.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNot seeing the podcast?

That led to value-based pilots like accountable care organizations to pay doctors and hospitals in new ways. Now CMS is exploring new tools and value-based models for drugs, and Slavitt said some pharmaceutical companies are contributing ideas for potential reforms.\n\n\n\nDuring the wide-ranging conversation, Slavitt also reminisced on the difficult launch of the Obamacare exchanges \u2014 with his former company, QSSI, partially blamed for the HealthCare.gov failure in 2013 \u2014 and how he went from being a contractor to being CMS\u2019 point man on the exchanges and ultimately leader of the agency, all in less than 18 months.\n\nHe also acknowledged that CMS\u2019 army of acronyms and lengthy regulations haven\u2019t always helped the agency communicate its message. \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s a conspiracy to confuse consumers,\u201d Slavitt said. And looking back on some of CMS\u2019 initiatives, \u201cnothing was ever done in a way that makes sense for normal people.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one reason that Slavitt has been stepping up his Twitter presence recently. \u201cIt's a great way to listen \u2014 and a great way to demystify this place,\u201d he said. But Slavitt knows other federal officials are leery of his social media use; it \u201cscares the crap out of my colleagues,\u201d he conceded.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The CMS acting administrator talks Medicare payment reform, drug prices and HealthCare.gov in POLITICO's new health care podcast.", "title": "POLITICO Pro Q&A: How Andy Slavitt plans to win doctors' hearts and minds again", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/exclusive-q-a-how-andy-slavitt-plans-to-win-doctors-hearts-and-minds-again-222556", "image": "http://static.politico.com/22/6b/448aa9bc480f899523f907da6455/slavitt2.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The CMS acting administrator talks Medicare payment reform, drug prices and HealthCare.gov in POLITICO's new health care podcast.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Bridget Mulcahy/POLITICO POLITICO Pro Q&A: How Andy Slavitt plans to win doctors' hearts and minds againAndy Slavitt knows the Obama administration has lost doctors\u2019 hearts and minds.\nBut the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services thinks the new physician payment system unveiled on Wednesday is the first step to winning them back, he told POLITICO in an exclusive interview.\nThat led to value-based pilots like accountable care organizations to pay doctors and hospitals in new ways.\nBut Slavitt knows other federal officials are leery of his social media use; it \u201cscares the crap out of my colleagues,\u201d he conceded.\nMeanwhile, CMS will sunset Meaningful Use and replace it with a new program called Advancing Care Information that offers more flexible standards."}
