By inducing ventricular hypertrophy into the hearts, they were able to test medications for the condition that might help find a cure.\n\nVentricular hypertrophy is a form of heart disease in which the muscles of the ventricles, or chambers, become thickened or enlarged.\n\nScientists have been working on developing lab-grown hearts for quite some time, but the authors of this particular study claim this is the first time researchers have been able to induce disease into mini hearts. \u201cIn some people, a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm will develop, and this is the most common cause of sudden death in young people,\u201d said Professor Nikolai Zhelev, an author of the study, in a press release. \u201cAlthough there are treatments, these only help to control the symptoms and there is no known cure at the moment.\u201d\n\nVentricular hypertrophy can be caused by diseases like diabetes; they can be hereditary; or they can be the consequence of too much strenuous exercise, Zhelev says. Because the muscles in the heart stiffen with this condition, it makes it harder for blood to be pumped through the body. In order to stimulate this condition in the lab-grown hearts, Zhelev and his team used chemicals to spur the physiological features and abnormal cells that make the hearts hypertrophic. This way, scientists are able to treat the hearts with new therapies and medications to test their efficacy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tested a number of different compounds on these hearts \u2014 some of them entirely new ones that haven\u2019t been tested in humans yet, which is why we\u2019re testing them on these hearts we\u2019ve grown in the lab,\u201d Zhelev said.\n\nThe hearts are tiny \u2014 only about one millimeter in diameter. They contract at about 30 beats per minute, and were developed using stem cells. By using biosensors that pinpoint certain molecules and pathways that have to do with ventricular hypertrophy, the researchers aim to be able to develop medications that target these molecules. In fact, they found that one particular cancer drug worked well in halting hypertrophy \u2014 since the pathways of molecules in hypertrophic hearts are quite similar to those in cancerous cells, they hypothesized that a cancer drug might have a positive effect on the heart as well. It proved to be true.\n\nZhelev says that although it may be a long time before the drugs are available clinically and commercially, he hopes that \u201cone day [we will] be able to stop heart hypertrophy from developing in those at risk of the disease.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lab-grown hearts, stem cells, heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers developed miniature lab-grown hearts with which they can test medications for ventricular hypertrophy.", "title": "Lab-Grown Mini Beating Hearts Are A Promising Cure For Heart Disease [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cure-heart-disease-scientists-develop-lab-grown-mini-beating-hearts-test-meds-them-290482", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/28/researching-mini-hearts.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers developed miniature lab-grown hearts with which they can test medications for ventricular hypertrophy.", "title": "Lab-Grown Mini Beating Hearts Are A Promising Cure For Heart Disease [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cure-heart-disease-scientists-develop-lab-grown-mini-beating-hearts-test-meds-them-290482", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/28/researching-mini-hearts.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/28/researching-mini-hearts.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-06-28T16:07:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-28T16:07:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers developed miniature lab-grown hearts with which they can test medications for ventricular hypertrophy."}, "article_summary": "A team of scientists from Abertay University have developed miniature beating hearts in the lab, providing researchers with a better insight into heart disease.\nVentricular hypertrophy is a form of heart disease in which the muscles of the ventricles, or chambers, become thickened or enlarged.\nBy inducing ventricular hypertrophy into the hearts, they were able to test medications for the condition that might help find a cure.\nIn order to stimulate this condition in the lab-grown hearts, Zhelev and his team used chemicals to spur the physiological features and abnormal cells that make the hearts hypertrophic.\nThis way, scientists are able to treat the hearts with new therapies and medications to test their efficacy."}
