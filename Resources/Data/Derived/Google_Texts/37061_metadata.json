But the chip giant can use some help on the style front, so it is turning to a company with celebrity connections.\n\nThat would be SMS Audio, the company launched by rapper 50 Cent that has basketball star Carmelo Anthony as an investor. It is announcing plans to launch a new line of fitness-oriented earbuds based on a concept that Krzanich demonstrated in January in a keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nThe earbuds are designed to work with a smartphone app to measure the wearer\u2019s heart rate, using an optical sensor. The biometric data is sent over the same wire that sends music to the listener\u2019s ears, which simultaneously helps charge the device, the companies say.\n\nIntel and SMS Audio are collaborating to develop earbuds that can measure a user\u2019s heart rate. Intel\n\nNot that there is any shortage of biometric monitoring gadgets on the market, including smartwatches and other wrist-worn fitness bands. But one of Krzanich\u2019s key messages is that people often don\u2019t want an extra device\u2013they want more functions in devices they have already.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who exercise are wearing earbuds anyhow,\u201d said Mike Bell, who is point person for the wearables push as vice president in charge of Intel\u2019s new devices group.\n\n\u201cThe ear provides a great platform for doing this kind of measurement,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not moving around a lot.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no Intel chips inside, Bell said. But the company helped design some of the key circuitry and software.\n\nSMS seems to draw on the fame of its backers in ways reminiscent of Beats Audio, the company led by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine that was recently purchased by Apple.\n\nSMS President Brian Nohe said the product line formally called SMS Audio BioSport In-Ear Headphones powered by Intel will be available in the fourth quarter. The Florida-based company is not disclosing pricing yet.\n\n\u201cThe price point will be acceptable by consumers,\u201d Nohe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a crazy price point.\u201d\n\nSMS earbuds now sell for $79 to $399.\n\nRelated: WSJ\u2019s Lee Hawkins talks with 50 Cent about SMS Audio.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wants to play a major role in wearable devices.
