Over the past few days, Bush\u2019s political-action committee released e-mails that included some Floridians\u2019 social-security numbers, and its newly hired chief technology officer had been forced to resign over several comments he had made in the past, including tweets that referred to women as sluts.\n\nIn a phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Newsom acknowledged the potential pitfalls of his decision\u2014he joked that he was giving opposition researchers more time to dig up dirt\u2014but said that, rather than quietly open a fund-raising account that is purportedly meant to raise money for some other race, when everyone knows that he wants to be governor, he preferred to be forthcoming about his intentions. \u201cLove me or hate me, at least you know where I stand,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cYou can be coy, or you can be candid\u2014I\u2019d rather be candid and let people judge that. Obviously there\u2019s not much precedent for jumping out this early, so it\u2019s ripe for critique.\u201d Newsom acknowledged, too, that announcing so soon lets him get an early start on raising money and articulating a platform. \u201cSo often, time and its constraints get in the way of good decision-making\u2014like, \u2018We have to get this policy paper out this week even though it might not be vetted, might not have the substance it otherwise would if we had taken more time.\u2019 \u201c He added, \u201cIf I waited two years, it\u2019d be all about raising money, raising money, raising money.\u201d The Democratic establishment in California might be eager, too, to anoint a frontrunner early on; it\u2019s unclear who will run against Newsom, though the state treasurer, John Chiang, and both the previous and current mayors of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa and Eric Garcetti, all Democrats, have been named as potential candidates, among others.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2011, when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco, he had\u2014and sometimes nurtured\u2014a spectacularly high profile. He issued licenses for same-sex marriages, in defiance of state law at the time, and instituted universal healthcare for city residents. He also slept with a top aide\u2019s wife, went into rehab to address what he called \u201cproblems with alcohol,\u201d and supported controversial real-estate development and homelessness programs. Nevertheless, Newsom\u2019s legacy as mayor is one seen as having been substantial, if not universally admired. But he has barely been in the news since his election, in 2010, as lieutenant governor\u2014a position that, he readily acknowledges, isn\u2019t particularly powerful. \u201cThere are constraints to this office,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou serve in these formal roles\u201d\u2014he sits on the University of California\u2019s Board of Regents and on the State Lands Commission, among other positions\u2014\u201cand by the way those are very significant roles, they\u2019re important, but beyond that you\u2019re not negotiating labor contracts, you\u2019re not signing executive orders, vetoing or approving legislation, or participating in that legislative process.\u201d In California, the position is mostly seen as a relic of a time when, if the governor travelled out of state, it was important to have a backup in Sacramento to do business for him; now that governors can easily take care of state business even while travelling, it\u2019s sometimes unclear what, exactly, the lieutenant governor is supposed to do.\n\nNewsom was made aware of the limits of the job early in his tenure, in 2011, when he decided to focus on economic development, even publishing a report, with input from the Brookings Institution and the McKinsey Global Institute, on how California should change its economic policies to better support growth. But Brown\u2014the person in the best position to turn those recommendations into policies\u2014didn\u2019t seem much interested in adopting Newsom\u2019s ideas, on the economy or on other matters. He cared more about balancing the state\u2019s budget; plus, the two men, who ran against each other ahead of the 2010 gubernatorial primary, before Newsom dropped out and sought the lieutenant governorship instead, aren\u2019t said to have a particularly warm relationship, and Newsom\u2019s economic-development report was interpreted, in some quarters, as a challenge to Brown.\n\nSince then, Newsom seems to have settled for quieter moves\u2014opposing proposed tuition hikes at the University of California, for example\u2014while biding his time. When he ran for re\u00eblection, in 2014, the Los Angeles Times editorial board preceded its endorsement of him by calling the position a \u201cnotoriously do-little job.\u201d The board wrote, \u201cBeing lieutenant governor mostly serves as a perch for gubernatorial candidates-in-waiting. Nevertheless, voters are asked every four years to choose among the aspirants, so here goes.\u201d It\u2019s little wonder, then, that Newsom\u2014who, love him or hate him, did more as mayor of San Francisco than most\u2014is eager to start doing something again.\n\nBy the time 2018 comes around, California will have changed tremendously since 2009, the last time Newsom campaigned for governor. In some ways, his race, and the way Californians react to it, will be a proxy for that evolution. Some of those changes bode well for Newsom. The last time he ran for governor, he recalls, even his friends questioned whether his gay-marriage stunt, in 2004, would hurt him. In 2008, after all, Californians had passed the Proposition 8 ballot measure, which defined marriage as being between a man and a woman. It wasn\u2019t until 2010\u2014after Newsom had dropped his bid for governor\u2014that the percentage of Californians supporting gay marriage surpassed the percentage opposing it, and it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed the legalization of gay marriage in the state. \u201cHis bet, and it was a courageous bet, when he was mayor, was that supporting gay rights would not be a career killer\u2014he was right,\u201d Bruce Cain, a political-science professor at Stanford University and a longtime observer of California politics, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s he\u2019s going to be able to rightfully tout.\u201d The idea of universal healthcare, once seen as radical, has also become more accepted, particularly in California, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the California electorate is also changing in ways that may not favor Newsom. The four counties that are expected to see the greatest population growth, in absolute numbers, from 2010 to 2020, are all in Southern California\u2014Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, and Orange. The differences among the California electorate are blurry for those on the outside\u2014they look like varying shades of blue\u2014but they\u2019re real; Democratic voters in some parts of the south, for instance, describe themselves as \u201cconservative\u201d at much higher rates than those in the Bay Area do. Southern Californians can also be mystified by\u2014and resentful of\u2014Silicon Valley and its solutionist ethos. Though Newsom has now won two statewide races, he is perceived as a distinctly San Francisco type, with the gel-enabled good looks, and the breezy confidence\u2014in himself and in the power of technology to solve problems\u2014of a venture capitalist. In 2013, he wrote a book called \u201cCitizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government,\u201d which, as George Packer wrote, in a 2013 article about Silicon Valley\u2019s politics, includes lines like: \u201cWhat if you could create competition among city services . . . through a kind of government Yelp? Then we\u2019d be on to something.\u201d Newsom is also, of course, white, in a state with a growing non-white population; last year, the number of Latinos in the state was estimated to have surpassed the number of white non-Latinos.\n\n\u201cFrom a distance, you think, He has matinee-idol looks, he\u2019s kind of glossy\u2014but he comes across, in university settings, as somebody who tries to dig into things,\u201d Cain said. \u201cI think Gavin is a person of substance. The question is whether the changing demographics of the state and the growing resentment from Southern California of Northern California dominance is going to be a problem for him.\u201d\n\nWhen I ran the notion of a North\u2013South divide by Newsom, he acknowledged that there\u2019s some truth to it, but largely dismissed it as \u201cjust a lot of politics.\u201d He told me, \u201cI have, as lieutenant governor, a moral, ethical responsibility to represent everyone in the state\u2014including people in the rural parts of the state.\u201d Indeed, \u201cCitizenville\u201d aside, Newsom has spent his time as lieutenant governor on issues with broad appeal\u2014economic development, higher education. He said that, as governor, he would continue to represent the interests of the state at large. In his letter announcing his bid for the governorship, he wrote, \u201cWe must continue to grow our economy and create private-sector jobs, we must invest in public education and keep college affordable, we must address the widening inequalities that separate our communities and we must maintain California\u2019s historic leadership in meeting the climate challenge.\u201d He also promised, \u201cThis won\u2019t be an ordinary campaign.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s language and the timing of his announcement were reminders of the dramatic tactics he once successfully deployed as mayor, but has avoided as lieutenant governor\u2014surely calibrated with the headlines in mind (and, this time around, the tweets). It seems to have worked, attracting more attention than he has seen in at least half a decade, and donor money may well follow. But if, in the long, long run-up to the 2018 election, he\u2019s to win over those voters who regard his legacy as mayor with suspicion and his time as lieutenant governor with apathy, he\u2019ll have to use the time as he says he plans to, by making considered decisions about policy positions that appeal to all Californians\u2014and that presumably don\u2019t mention Yelp.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "By the time 2018 comes around, California will have changed tremendously since 2009, the last time Newsom campaigned for governor.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Newsom\u2019s language and the timing of his announcement were reminders of the dramatic tactics he once successfully deployed as mayor.", "title": "Gavin Newsom\u2019s Long, Long Campaign for Governor - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Vara-Gavin-Newsom-2018-1200-630-12140701.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-02-12T15:52:45-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/california-gavin-newsom-governor", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newsom\u2019s language and the timing of his announcement were reminders of the dramatic tactics he once successfully deployed as mayor.", "title": "Gavin Newsom\u2019s Long, Long Campaign for Governor - The New Yorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Vara-Gavin-Newsom-2018-1200-630-12140701.jpg", "creator": "@vauhinivara", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"2989250\",\"title_alt\":\"Gavin Newsom\\u2019s Long, Long Campaign for Governor\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/02\\/Vara-Gavin-Newsom-2018-728-375-12140710.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "San Francisco", "published_time": "2015-02-12T15:40:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-12T15:52:45-04:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 2989250, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "California, Election, Gavin Newsom, Jerry Brown, San Francisco"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd61cc\"", "article_summary": "By the time 2018 comes around, California will have changed tremendously since 2009, the last time Newsom campaigned for governor.\n\u201cWhen Californians see something we truly believe in, we say so and act accordingly\u2014without evasiveness or equivocation,\u201d Newsom wrote in a letter to supporters, announcing that he is forming an official campaign committee to seek the governorship.\nFrom 2004 to 2011, when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco, he had\u2014and sometimes nurtured\u2014a spectacularly high profile.\nHe said that, as governor, he would continue to represent the interests of the state at large.\nNevertheless, Newsom\u2019s legacy as mayor is one seen as having been substantial, if not universally admired."}
