MINNEAPOLIS — Chances are, if 23-year-old Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado had not broken his finger sliding into a second base on that fateful Friday night in Atlanta, he would be here for the 85th All-Star Game.

That’s not just my opinion, it’s the viewpoint of Rangers all-star third baseman Adrian Beltre, who’s been selected to his fourth Midsummer Classic.

“No doubt he’ll be an all-star,” Beltre said Monday afternoon. “He’s not here because he got hurt. Everything you want in a player, he has. Defensively, he’s unbelievable, Offensively, he’s doing better that he was last year.

“You hate to see a player of his stature get hurt. But I think you will see him (in this game) for many years.”

Arenado has played in only 59 games and is hitting .289 with six homers and 30 RBIs. He’s got a lot of growing to do, no doubt, but he certainly caught the eye of Beltre, who played the Rockies four times earlier this season.

Arenado has said he idolized Beltre as a kid, something Beltre finds a little disconcerting.

“It makes me feel old,” the 35-year-old Beltre said with a laugh. “It’s always nice in baseball to know that somebody else looks up to you. It’s humbling, but it’s nice to see that what you have done is appreciated by somebody. As good as he is, to know that he idolized you, it’s nice.”

Beltre said that he gave Arenado a gift when the two met in spring training, but he declined to say what it was.

Said Beltre: “I don’t like to say what it is, but the first time we met in spring training, I have him a nice gift.”
