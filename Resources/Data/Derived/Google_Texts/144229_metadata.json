Along with offending many Orioles fans, the shirt also ignited controversy because of the vulgar and derogatory nature of the song\u2019s original lyrics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already apologized to a number of people because there\u2019s no intention to offend. If you know me, I\u2019m not a person that likes confrontation,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cThis shirt was sent to me, and it will be sent to the garbage, because that\u2019s probably where it belongs.\u201d\n\nGuthrie said he was aware of Brown\u2019s hip-hop song, and that he\u2019d probably heard it about three times. But he said he wasn\u2019t aware of the reaction it might generate.\n\nHe spent Wednesday morning sending out text messages to friends who still play for the Orioles and took to Twitter to apologize to their fan base.\n\n\u201cHe sent me a text apologizing this morning,\u201d said Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman, a former teammate. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to text him back yet.\u201d\n\nOrioles manager Buck Showalter wasn\u2019t aware of the furor, though a question did touch of an entertaining exchange. When told Guthrie had worn a shirt riffing on a lyric from a Chris Brown song, he replied: \u201cChris Brown is weighing in on the Royals and the O\u2019s in a song?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the original line?\u201d Showalter asked.\n\nAt that point, a spokesperson for Major League Baseball pointed out that Showalter\u2019s pregame news conference was being televised live, and it would be better not to fill him in.\n\nShowalter later acknowledged he had a few \u2014 ah, rather sensitive \u2014 shirts in his own wardrode, though he also said he doesn\u2019t wear them where folks will take notice.\n\n\u201cI might offend somebody,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the subplots to the ALCS since it returned to Kansas City for Game 3 has been the bravado of the young Royals, who had yet to lose in seven postseason games. Outfielder Jarrod Dyson brashly predicted the series would not return to Baltimore, and that if the Royals won Game 3 on Tuesday night, many of the Orioles would already feel defeated.\n\nKansas City won 2-1, taking a 3-0 lead in the series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bragging if you can back it up,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cRegardless of what happens in the series, it won\u2019t be because somebody wants it more than the other. It won\u2019t be because of what somebody didn\u2019t do. It would be because of what somebody did.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Guthrie, a prolific user of social media, said in his apology early Wednesday that he did not consider the reaction the shirt might generate and did not intend to offend.", "Author": "Dave Skretta", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Guthrie, a prolific user of social media, said in his apology early Wednesday that he did not consider the reaction the shirt might generate and did not intend to offend.", "title": "Jeremy Guthrie apologizes for \u2018These O\u2019s Ain\u2019t Royal\u2019 T-shirt", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/15/jeremy-guthrie-apologizes-these-os-aint-royal-t-sh/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/15/alcs-royals-orioles-b_lanc3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/15/alcs-royals-orioles-b_lanc3.jpg", "title": "Jeremy Guthrie apologizes for \u2018These O\u2019s Ain\u2019t Royal", "description": "Guthrie, a prolific user of social media, said in his apology early Wednesday that he did not consider the reaction the shirt might generate and did not intend to offend.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Baltimore Orioles, Jeremy Guthrie, Kansas City, Baltimore, Buck Showalter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc8b\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Royals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie wore his familiar home jersey into the Kauffman Stadium interview room Wednesday and promptly apologized for what he had worn just 12 hours earlier.\nAlong with offending many Orioles fans, the shirt also ignited controversy because of the vulgar and derogatory nature of the song\u2019s original lyrics.\n\u201cHe sent me a text apologizing this morning,\u201d said Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman, a former teammate.\n\u201cRegardless of what happens in the series, it won\u2019t be because somebody wants it more than the other.\nIf you know me, I\u2019m not a person that likes confrontation,\u201d Guthrie said."}
