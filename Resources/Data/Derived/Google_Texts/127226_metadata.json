But not in the case of measures 1A in Denver and Adams County.\n\nVoters in those counties without question should approve 1A to allow economic development to flourish in and around Denver International Airport.\n\nA successful vote would amend the 1988 intergovernmental agreement between the two counties that was written when Denver annexed the land for the airport. Back then, the arrangement made sense. Adams County didn\u2019t want to give up 50 square miles of land for DIA and watch Denver fill it with businesses and reap the revenue.\n\nThe original deal forbade Denver from allowing businesses unrelated to airport functions. Those restrictions now are an impediment to progress. DIA has grown beyond expectations and the airport is a huge economic engine for the region.\n\nAs the world becomes more connected, industry often needs a global reach to be successful. Businesses should be allowed to locate in and around one of the world\u2019s busiest airports.\n\nThe vote would allow new types of development on DIA land, such as retail space, manufacturing and offices that aren\u2019t directly related to airport uses. If not for this deal, these businesses might not locate to Colorado.\n\nThe agreement still would restrict residential development, which is smart because that is what caused many problems for Stapleton International Airport.\n\nProponents say the measures could generate an estimated 12,000 new jobs.\n\nIf approved, Adams County would get $10 million from Denver and the two counties would equally split the tax revenues, with Adams sharing its money between cities in the county. And an airport authority would be created to handle decisions on marketing, economic development and planning.\n\nIt is an impressive arrangement considering the rancor that had festered between the two counties throughout the history of DIA\u2019s development.\n\nJust two years ago, Adams County astoundingly demanded Denver return the land for DIA, saying Denver was intent on violating terms of the IGA.\n\nThankfully, cooler heads prevailed after the counties entered into mediation.\n\nThe deal in front of Denver and Adams County voters this election is a straightforward and reasonable d\u00e9tente. It will be good for everyone, benefiting the entire metro region in addition to the counties that will decide its fate.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "With ballot measure 1A, DIA area will take off", "title": "With ballot measure 1A, DIA area will take off", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/02/with-ballot-measure-1a-dia-area-will-take-off/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002__OP04DIAp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002__OP04DIAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-02T13:49:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T09:02:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4533\"", "article_summary": "Just two years ago, Adams County astoundingly demanded Denver return the land for DIA, saying Denver was intent on violating terms of the IGA.\nThe deal in front of Denver and Adams County voters this election is a straightforward and reasonable d\u00e9tente.\nBut not in the case of measures 1A in Denver and Adams County.\nVoters in those counties without question should approve 1A to allow economic development to flourish in and around Denver International Airport.\nAdams County didn\u2019t want to give up 50 square miles of land for DIA and watch Denver fill it with businesses and reap the revenue."}
