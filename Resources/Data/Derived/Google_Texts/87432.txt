PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A popular Philadelphia restaurant has closed after 24 years due to a city tax debt.

Philly.com (http://bit.ly/1PTn1jR ) reports a notice posted on the door of Derek’s says it was shut down by the city Revenue Department due to “serious tax violations.”

The restaurant in the city’s Manayunk neighborhood opened in 1992 under the name Sonoma.

Owner and chef Derek Davis says the restaurant has been closed permanently.

Records don’t specify a tax lien on the business, but Davis says the financial problems stemmed from an employee who stole $280,000 from the business.

Davis says, “The economic pressure was just too much too recuperate from” and now says his 40 employees are out of work.
