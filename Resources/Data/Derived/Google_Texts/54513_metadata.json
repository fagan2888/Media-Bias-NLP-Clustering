Tens of thousands in cash prizes draw people from across New England. Each year, I drag along as many friends as I can.\n\n\u201cThanks for the invite, but ice fishing literally combines my two least favorite things on planet Earth \u2014 fishing and cold,\u201d a friend R.S.V.P.\u2019d this year. \u201cThere are very few things I would rather do LESS than go on this trip.\u201d\n\nIce fishing on paper reads like a checklist for the clinically depressed: isolation, risky behavior, unrealistic expectations, drinking. So when describing the weekend to friends I give a little presentation: Picture days tending to the frozen tundra, using wit and muscle to hunt creatures of the depths for a bounty. Picture nights around the wood stove.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m, like, really excited,\u201d my friend Peter, who has come before, tells me a month before this year\u2019s trip. \u201cPeople ask me \u2018what\u2019s new\u2019 and I tell them \u2018ice fishing,\u2019 \u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s like the main thing in my life right now that I\u2019m looking forward to.\u201d Peter\u2019s ignoring the fact that we haven\u2019t caught a fish in five years. This is why I like him.\n\nSpring is easy to love. All you have to do is mention the basics \u2014 flowers, new life \u2014 and you\u2019re halfway to a poem. And fall\u2019s publicist has convinced us that to dress in mudroom-chic attire and take a yellow lab apple-picking is the world\u2019s greatest joy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut winter, especially the days of late February and early March, is tougher. The season starts out quaint \u2014 holidays and hot cocoa \u2014 but ends as a yearly reminder that the planet doesn\u2019t care if we die. I start tossing salt on ice like it\u2019s my enemies\u2019 land. By late January I curse Thomas Kinkade paintings, with their horse-drawn sleighs that never have to circle the block for parking.\n\nSkiing saves some. Others go insane and pretend snowshoeing isn\u2019t just walking. I feel for them. We all need something to transform our winter dread into excitement.\n\nI hear forecasts for extreme cold now, and I see late-season lake ice. It\u2019s a delight that helps with the discomfort, a magazine you love in your dentist\u2019s waiting room. The friend who didn\u2019t come ice fishing because he hates the cold \u2014 I think he hates the cold because he hasn\u2019t come ice fishing.\n\nYou start by using a manual auger on a foot and a half of ice. A concentrated scraping, the blades turn and shave. Snow-cone-grade mush swirls up out of the hole. Soon tiny, rarely used muscles in your back announce their existence, catch on fire and become useless. You lean on the auger and breathe heavy, still turning, turning. Eventually you\u2019ll stumble away from the hole and say \u201cYour turn\u201d to no one in particular.\n\nJust to be outside, sweating, in winter, seems a small act of protest. And each hole, even when the group has drilled 15, is a thing of wonder when you clean the slush out with a special scoop and look while it\u2019s still hollow. When you do punch through, the water makes a sucking noise and gurgles up. You spin the auger, lightly, to clean out the bottom of the hole and also as a little victory lap.\n\nHours later, someone politely asks if fish hibernate. Someone else whispers, \u201cMy toes are cold.\u201d Ice fishing, like winter, like life, isn\u2019t really that much fun, but it can be.\n\nIt\u2019s the lead-up, the excitement. A month before the tournament my friend Mike and I made cusk traps, special lines that sit on the bottom overnight to catch a type of fish called cusk, which looks like a cross between a cod and a nightmare. We\u2019d never caught a cusk before, but this year was like all the other years in that we assumed it\u2019d be different. It takes about 300 days for the human brain to forget the terrible parts of ice fishing.\n\nThe weekend was bright, Saturday and Sunday morning. So little wind moved across the lake that everyone\u2019s footprints stayed all weekend and we could see the huge distances we\u2019d trekked, our only real accomplishment before Sunday morning, when we caught a cusk. It twirled our line and made us yell. Four of us stood around the hole and watched as an 18-inch, beautiful, slimy, tiger-spotted, bulging pork-roast-stomached thing came through. Too small for the prize board, it fit perfectly into our pot. Everyone agreed it was the best cusk chowder they\u2019d ever had.\n\nSome year, maybe we\u2019ll catch what\u2019s probably the most prized species of the seven the tournament accepts: the lake trout. It needs cold, oxygen-rich waters. Since the last ice age the lake trout have ridden out New England summers in the depths, where it stays cool. But in winter the whole lake\u2019s theirs. They can go where they please. It\u2019s something you have in common with them as you stand in the middle of a lake, on real estate made by temperature \u2014 when you wouldn\u2019t wish summer on your worst enemy.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140301143001, "twitter": {"description": "Ice fishing, like winter, isn\u2019t really that much fun.
