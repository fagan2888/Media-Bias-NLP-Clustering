A short time later, the teen died.\n\nPolice say 21-year-old David Randle Jr was the shooter. He was allegedly handling a loaded gun, possibly an AK-47, when it went off, hitting the victim. Randle and the victim have been close friends for years, according to Randle's mom Shona. She tells KELOLAND News the shooting was an accident.\n\n\"I was shocked. I really didn't expect it. It's really quiet over here and there's not a lot that goes on. We were surprised,\" Koutsarath said.\n\nKayleigh Koutsarath says many young families live in the area. Dylon Krist is frustrated that someone would get shot near his home, considering all the children in the area.\n\n\"It's like, you know, kids are running around, playing every day. So somebody who's going to have an automatic weapon... I don't think that's right,\" Krist said.\n\nResidents in the northwest side of Sioux Falls woke up to police cars this morning. However, residents say they're not too concerned about this isolate incident.\n\n\"It doesn't seem like it's a really random thing. I'm not afraid of someone coming up to my house or anything,\" Koutsarath said.\n\nPolice haven't released the name of the victim. Randle is being held at the Minnehaha County jail on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nUPDATE: According to the Minnehaha County Sheriff\u2019s Office inmate listing, Randle faces two manslaughter charges: a first degree charge for heat of passion, and a second degree charge for recklessly killing. He also faces a charge of violating a stalking protection order and a felony charge for failing to appear.\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
