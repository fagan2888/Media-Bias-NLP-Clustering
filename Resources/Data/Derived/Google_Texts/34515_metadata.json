But those employees who aren\u2019t eligible for federal subsidies will face large out-of-pocket costs for potentially less value, Mr. Kirschbaum said. In addition, employers taking such an approach will be hit with an ACA-mandated penalty of $2,000 for each full-time employee.\n\nFor example, the ACA\u2019s least expensive bronze plans still have deductibles that may reach $4,000 to $6,000, he said.\n\nSome employers provide high-deductible plans in that range but \u201cameliorate that deductible\u201d with a health savings account (HAS) or a health reimbursement arrangement, he said, but \u201cthat\u2019s not available on the public exchange.\u201d\n\nStill, the majority of employers \u201cexpect and want to continue to offer benefits to their employees\u2026and not just because it\u2019s mandated or required, but because it\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d and its value proposition, said Rob Harkins, Willis\u2019 Boston-based practice leader for private exchanges.\n\nPrivate exchanges, though not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for tackling all costs, may offer opportunities to control annual increases by establishing a set dollar amount on how much employers will contribute toward coverage, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nCurrently, only 2 percent of organizations use a private health exchange, according to Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) research. However, there is a large amount of interest, said Bruce Elliott, manager of compensation and benefits for SHRM, and more employers may jump on the trend as the Cadillac tax \u201cgets closer and closer\u201d and more employers figure out they\u2019ll be affected, he said.\n\nSome large companies, like Walgreen Co., CVS Health Corp. and IBM, have already moved to a private exchange, Mr. Elliott said, and he predicts midsize and smaller companies will shift as 2018 approaches.\n\nA private exchange offers a defined contribution model, so the employer can decide whether it wants to provide a set amount of money per type of benefit or a lump sum per month for all benefits combined, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nThat way, the employer has \u201cvalue in addressing your long-term costs because your budget can be set a little bit better than what you\u2019re doing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nFamiliar shopping experience\n\nOne thing to note is that private exchanges are technology platforms that essentially provide an online shopping experience to employees, Mr. Harkins said, and \u201cthat\u2019s something people know how to do and do often.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe intuitively know how to shop for something, to pay the least amount of money to get the highest value for what we\u2019re buying,\u201d he said. And though it\u2019s a complicated subject, exchanges help answer a lot of the questions that employees have about benefits, he added.\n\nThey also provide more choice for plans than the one, two or three plans typically offered by employers, and \u201cpeople like choice,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, private exchanges will help with the extensive IRS reporting requirements for full-time employee health coverage by providing a \u201cvehicle that could take all your benefits and put it into one neat package, and give you the employer the ability to (create) the report that you need to submit to the government,\u201d Mr. Harkins said.\n\nThey also reduce the administrative burden on employers. Mr. Harkins said Willis moved to a private exchange during the past year for its 8,000 U.S. employees. In the past, the Willis human resources team handled questions and issues employees had during enrollment about benefits choices.\n\nBut last season, the private exchange \u201chelped navigate a lot of the questions individuals had,\u201d and the exchange provider offered a team of people to address further questions.\n\nWhen deciding which exchange to use, employers should look at the structure of the platforms, which insurance providers the exchanges use, whether they allow fully insured or self-insured plans or both, and whether they have any limitations on plan design, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nIf a platform is prebuilt by an exchange provider, make sure it\u2019s in line with what you hope to offer employees. If not, look for a more customizable platform, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a transformation in our industry,\u201d Mr. Harkins said. \u201cI do believe that five years, 10 years down the line, the concept of a private exchange is going to be the norm.\u201d\n\nThis report appeared on the website of Crain\u2019s Business Insurance magazine, a Chicago-based sister publication of Tire Business.", "article_metadata": {"category": "NEWS", "article_guid": "50CC69C5-5656-4891-8B28-B3A1AAABEE81", "description": "By Shelby Livingston, Crain News ServiceLAS VEGAS (July 7, 2015) \u2014 The 40 percent excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans set to go into effect in 2018 is driving employer interest in private health insurance exchanges as a way to control costs and avoid the tax.That was the assessment by...", "title": "PERSONNEL MATTERS: Employers look to private healthcare exchanges", "og": {"site_name": "Tire Business", "image": "http://www.tirebusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TB/20150708/NEWS/150709963/AR/0/health-insurance-symbol.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Shelby Livingston, Crain News ServiceLAS VEGAS (July 7, 2015) \u2014 The 40 percent excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans set to go into effect in 2018 is driving employer interest in private health insurance exchanges as a way to control costs and avoid the tax.That was the assessment by...", "title": "PERSONNEL MATTERS: Employers look to private healthcare exchanges - Tire Business"}, "image": "http://www.tirebusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TB/20150708/NEWS/150709963/AR/0/health-insurance-symbol.jpg", "author": "Crain News Service", "summary": "By Shelby Livingston, Crain News ServiceLAS VEGAS (July 7, 2015) \u2014 The 40 percent excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans set to go into effect in 2018 is driving employer interest in private health insurance exchanges as a way to control costs and avoid the tax.That was the assessment by", "topic": "Healthcare", "url": "http://www.tirebusiness.com/article/20150708/NEWS/150709963", "published_at": "20150708_00:00:00", "year": 2015, "category_id": "NEWS", "type": "article", "image_src": "http://www.tirebusiness.com/assets/rwd/logo@2x.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda772\"", "article_summary": "Currently, only 2 percent of organizations use a private health exchange, according to Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) research.\nMr. Harkins said Willis moved to a private exchange during the past year for its 8,000 U.S. employees.\nMost employers can\u2019t shoulder those costs, so some may stop offering benefits, meaning their employees may move to the public exchanges.\nBut last season, the private exchange \u201chelped navigate a lot of the questions individuals had,\u201d and the exchange provider offered a team of people to address further questions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a transformation in our industry,\u201d Mr. Harkins said."}
