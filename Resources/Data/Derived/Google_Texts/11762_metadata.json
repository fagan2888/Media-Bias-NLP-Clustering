It became a fee-based service in 2010. Since then, approximately 2,200 households have regularly used the service.\n\nCompost consists of items such as food, yard refuse and non-recyclable items like paper towels.\n\nThanks to a loan from the Department of Environmental Health, the program will add a second truck for pickup and more than double its capacity for 2014.\n\nThe $2 million loan will allow Denver Recycles/Solid Waste Management to gauge the success of the expansion and possibly grow to four trucks at the start of 2015.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for busy families to send off their compost,\u201d said Charlotte Pitt, manager of Denver Recycles/Solid Waste Management.\n\nThe program is scattered throughout the city. Pitt said approximately 32,000 homes are eligible for the service. See addresses on the route at denvergov.org/DenverRecycles.\n\nPostcards were mailed to eligible homes, and Pitt said around 750 new homes already signed up and will get a green composting cart to put on their curb and a 2-gallon receptacle for the home.\n\nSignups work on a first-come, first-serve basis and the program is designed to support only 5,000 homes.\n\n\u201cAs we expand, we want to bring it to any Denver resident who wants it,\u201d\n\nPublic Works spokeswoman Emily Williams said.\n\nJoe Vaccarelli: 303-954-2396, jvaccarelli@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joe_vacc\n\n", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver expands composting program", "title": "Denver expands composting program", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/31/denver-expands-composting-program/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20100323__20100325_W04_ZWW0325COMPOSTPG4p1.jpg", "height": 383}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20100323__20100325_W04_ZWW0325COMPOSTPG4p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-31T16:41:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T07:20:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d76\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is an opportunity for busy families to send off their compost,\u201d said Charlotte Pitt, manager of Denver Recycles/Solid Waste Management.\nDenver is expanding its composting program, which could serve as many as 5,000 homes in 2014.\nThe Denver Compost program was launched as a pilot program in 2007 to give residents an opportunity to have their organic waste picked up separately from their trash.\nThe $2 million loan will allow Denver Recycles/Solid Waste Management to gauge the success of the expansion and possibly grow to four trucks at the start of 2015.\n\u201cAs we expand, we want to bring it to any Denver resident who wants it,\u201dPublic Works spokeswoman Emily Williams said."}
