EMC EMC, -0.18% has been considering a number of options since The Wall Street Journal reported it was doing a strategic review last year, and other options could still be on the table.\n\nAnalysts have said it would make sense for Dell, which was taken private in a landmark leveraged buyout in 2013, to buy EMC\u2019s big data-storage operation, but there are various ways it could go about doing so, including a full takeover followed by a spin off.\n\nEMC has a market capitalization of $50 billion, meaning that any such deal could rank as one of the largest tech-industry mergers. Chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd.\u2019s pending $37 billion agreement to buy Broadcom Corp. is the largest pure-tech takeover ever struck. There has been a raft of tech and other takeovers this year, and merger volume overall is running at a near-record pace. Still, market volatility could slow down the overall merger market and pose a threat to the EMC-Dell talks, one of the people cautioned.\n\nEMC has been under pressure to boost its lagging stock since last year, when activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. took a roughly 2% stake in the company and urged it to spin off its VMware Inc. VMW, -0.18% unit. EMC owns 80% of VMware, which has a market value of $34 billion. A standstill struck in January between Elliott and Hopkinton, Mass.-based EMC that had barred the fund from publicly pressuring EMC expired last month. Elliott has since stayed quiet.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CW640_dell_c_ZG_20141016132522.jpg", "height": 742}, "description": "Dell Inc. is in talks to strike a combination with EMC Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would remove questions about EMC\u2019s future that have hung over the data-storage giant for more than a year.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Joann S.
