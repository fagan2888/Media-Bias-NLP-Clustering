Only one had some prior woodworking experience, but all have been quick studies and dedicated to doing the work themselves, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real joy, teaching the girls,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quick learners, and they\u2019re not afraid to do anything.\u201d\n\nThe girls \u2014 Vannorsdall, Chamberlin, 14-year-old Sadie Allen and 15-year-old Erin Dowd, all of Camden, took Chamberlin\u2019s brother\u2019s toboggan for last year\u2019s championships and raced as the Rockport Rockettes. They were the fastest children\u2019s team and got a taste for toboggans, as well as for winning. They have big hopes for their showing in the 24th annual championships, scheduled for Feb. 7-9 at the Camden Snow Bowl, when they will race as \u201cDer Blitz.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Spanish class we learned \u2018Der Blitz,\u2019 which means \u2018the lightning\u2019 in German,\u201d Dowd explained.\n\n\u201cSpanish class!\u201d Vaughn, who clearly was amused by the girls\u2019 high spirits, repeated with a laugh.\n\nThey haven\u2019t figured out what their costumes \u2014 critically important during the toboggan championships \u2014 will be yet, but they\u2019re working on it. Last year, the girls were moving so quickly down the wooden, 400-foot long chute to Hosmer Pond that Allen burned through the leg of her spray-painted Tyvek suit when she brushed against the side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most exhilarating nine seconds,\u201d she said.\n\nThey said that when Vaughn asked after last year\u2019s strong showing if the girls would be interested in learning how to build a new sled, they were skeptical that they could do the work \u2014 but they wanted to try.\n\nVaughn and Tom Cox of Camden, a toboggan inspector with the championships, sawed enough wood runners and slats for a few sleds, and the girls chose the ones they wanted. They learned how to steam the end and bend it over a mold to make the characteristic swooping toboggan shape. Some boards snapped and cracked, but it was all part of the learning process, they said.\n\nThey drilled holes for the screws and then made tiny ash dowels to fill in those holes. Then came their introduction to the DeWalt sander.\n\n\u201cSanding is a huge part,\u201d Allen said.\n\n\u201cAny imperfections can slow you down on the chute,\u201d Dowd chimed in.\n\nThe bottom of their toboggan felt perfectly smooth, ready to zip down the chute faster than their namesake bolt of lightning, but they encouraged their competition to go in a different direction.\n\n\u201cPut sand on the bottom!\u201d Vannorsdall suggested.\n\n\u201cA little pumice in the paint,\u201d Vaughn added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CAMDEN, Maine \u2014 Four teenage girls hard at work putting the finishing touches on their toboggan for the upcoming U.S. National Championships have a strong message for other would-be competitors in their class. \u201cNobody else should do this,\u201d Emma Vannorsdall, 14, of Camden said Friday.
