WASHINGTON– The leading contenders for the GOP nomination for president exchanged jabs Thursday, comparing each other to Jim Carrey movies.

Billionaire businessman Donald Trump prodded Sen. Ted Cruz, posting a revamped version of a Liar, Liar poster featuring Cruz.

“Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar – Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know,” Trump asked his 1.2 million followers. The post has almost 45,000 likes. Trump has painted Cruz as a liar in recent month, for attacks that Trump claims are false. The attacks include Trump’s stance on abortion, Obamacare and Supreme Court nominees.

Trump has since dubbed Cruz “Lyin Ted.”

Cruz responded on twitter with a new take on “Me, Myself and Irene,” implying Trump has multiple personalities. Cruz has hit Trump repeatedly on changing his positions on key issues, walking back from previously liberal stances.

“Don’t take a chance on this new release coming to ballot boxes in November 2016,” Cruz tweeted his nearly 14,000 followers.

Trump says he has evolved on issues like abortion over time. Cruz claims he is a phony conservative.
