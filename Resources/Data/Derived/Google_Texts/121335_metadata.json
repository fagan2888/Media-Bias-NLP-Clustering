The voluntary buyout program will trim the nearly 5,000-member John Muir Health workforce by about 4 percent, although no doctors are being asked to leave, Drew said. They expect to get enough volunteers, but layoffs are possible if they do not reach the desired savings, Drew said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I hear concerns that John Muir Health's focus on affordability could have a negative impact on patient care,\" Knight wrote to workers. \"These are challenging issues, but I want to assure you that our focus will always be on providing the absolute best possible care and patient experience.\"\n\nThe \"voluntary separation\" plan comes about a week after John Muir Health announced it is selling its MuirLab business and laying off 540 employees. The company, which will shutter MuirLab's main 56,000-square-foot Concord lab, expects about 150 of those workers to be rehired by MuirLab's buyer, Laboratory Corporation of America.\n\nThe last public tax return in 2011 shows John Muir Health's profit dropping from $132 million to $101 million. From 2008 to 2011, the nonprofit saw a $157 million increase in costs; however, during that same time period it realized a $302 million revenue increase, according to tax records.\n\nIn his letter, Knight said the nonprofit's staffing was higher than more than 75 percent of hospitals with \"similar recognitions for quality.\"\n\n\"Our current costs are not sustainable in the long run,\" he said.\n\nContact Matthias Gafni at 925-952-5026.
