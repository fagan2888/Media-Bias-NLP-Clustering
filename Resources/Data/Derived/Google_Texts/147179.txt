A great deal of Americans will be taken by surprise should the Supreme Court rule against the Affordable Care Act in the coming weeks — a new poll finds seven in ten Americans say they’ve only heard a little or nothing at all about the pending case.

According to a new poll by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 44% of Americans haven’t heard anything while 28% have heard only a little about King v. Burwell, a case due to be heard within weeks that could cause millions to lose federal subsidies for health insurance.

Though more people report knowing about the case than did when the Court announced it would take it up, the lack of knowledge isn’t a good sign given the impact the case could have on health insurance for low and middle-income Americans.

An estimated 6.4 million Americans could lose the federal government’s help in paying for their insurance if the Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

The majority of surveyed adults say Congress or the states should act if the Court rules to gut the law, but a larger number of Republicans say neither should act on the issue.

The Kaiser poll was conducted between June 2 and 9 and 1,200 adults were contacted for the survey. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
