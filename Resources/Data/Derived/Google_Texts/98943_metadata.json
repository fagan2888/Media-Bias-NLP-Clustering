She always hesitates before stepping onto an escalator and rarely walks beyond our circular driveway. So when her physician ordered her onto a treadmill last winter, it hardly seemed surprising that her heartbeat jumped dramatically, even when the pace was not brisk. She is 80, after all.\n\nTo temper her tempo, she was soon prescribed a very expensive heart medication. \u201cI have to take it or I might have a stroke,\u201d she told me (a problem for me, as her future caregiver, as well as for her). Luckily, Medicare and her supplemental insurance picked up most of the cost, so a 90-day prescription\u2019s worth of pills came to just $135 \u2014 a good rate to pay, I thought, for a good heart rate. But in July, her discount suddenly ended.\n\n\u201cYour mother is in the doughnut hole,\u201d my 83-year-old father said to me grimly. I had no idea what he was talking about but knew from his expression it was not a good place to be. I instantly pictured my mom encased in a giant inner tube of fried flour, uselessly trying to eat her way out like a doomed character in Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory.\n\nI quickly learned that the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d has nothing to do with baked goods and is, instead, the term used to describe the gap my mother had now reached in her Medicare Part D prescription drug program. She had hit her initial coverage limit of close to $3,000 a year (calculated by adding together the full fee of all her drugs), and now would have to pay a higher out-of-pocket cost for her prescription drugs until she reached the catastrophic coverage threshold, thousands of dollars later.\n\nGiven that she also takes other medications, her drug costs were suddenly going to go through the roof \u2014 and as I share that roof with my parents, husband, brother and children, it was also going to skyrocket our mutually managed budget. Her heart medication alone would now cost more than $800 for a three-month supply. Now it was my heart that was starting to palpitate. But it turned out that my parents had a plan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCall it \u201cThe Dallas Buyers Club of Seniors,\u201d but a number of their octogenarian friends are now ordering their prescription drugs through pharmacies in Canada. Living in Michigan, as we do, the border is an easy maple-syrup-outing away.\n\nHaving spent a portion of my youth wondering where I could score pot for myself and my friends, I now found myself spending late-night hours on the Internet looking for Canadian medications for my mother. I quickly learned that her biggest-ticket item, the one for her ticker, would cost just $335 for a 90-day supply if I bought it a mere 47 miles from our hometown.\n\nSuddenly, Canada seemed like one giant Costco to me.\n\nAs luck would have it, I was about to go to Ontario to visit some close friends. The timing could not have been more lucky. I just had to learn the rules of the geriatric game before my time.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if you can help me out,\u201d I asked in a polite voice a few days later as I slipped a guy at a Toronto pharmacy a folded piece of paper containing copies of my mother\u2019s prescriptions.\n\nThe pharmacist looked me over closely. \u201cWe get a lot of Americans like you doing just this,\u201d he said, making me feel like the medication mule I had now become.\n\n\u201cIs it legal?\u201d I asked him quietly, mumbling into the collar of my jean jacket.\n\n\u201dNo,\u201d he said, explaining that the Food and Drug Administration cannot allow foreign drugs to be resold or distributed in the United States. I wondered if I should make a run for the door before he called in the feds. But then he explained how it \u201creally works.\u201d\n\n\u201cCustoms looks the other way when it comes to personal use,\u201d he said.\n\nAs I soon learned, by checking the F.D.A. website, the United States government has issued guidelines on bringing prescription drugs over the border. As the pharmacist explained, my mother could not sell the drugs and could obtain only a 90-day supply of medication she had already been prescribed by a doctor licensed in the United States. More important, a Canadian doctor had to sign off on her personal doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nI left the pharmacy wondering if I could pick up a doctor in a bar nearby and get him on the phone with my mother for a quick consultation. But given that it was 10 a.m., and I am married, that did not seem like the best idea, or one my parents would applaud even if I did return with a stash of pills.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo days later I was visiting another friend on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls and he happened to mention a doctor friend who lived nearby. Knowing my parents \u2014 as my friend has for many years \u2014 I quickly pulled him aside, slipping my drug list into his front pocket.\n\n\u201cCan you get me these?\u201d I said, explaining the situation. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nWithin a half-hour he was off, trying to track down his doctor. But, alas, the doctor had gone on a golfing weekend, as doctors do in August. In the end, I left the country empty-handed, with nothing but a six-pack of Molson to declare at Customs.\n\nThe good news is that we have now found a Canadian physician (my mother has met with him) who works with a reliable Canadian pharmacy that will ship the doughnut-hole drugs to our doorstep.\n\nThe bad news is, I now realize how many elderly people in the United States must be facing this same problem (by 2020 the Affordable Care Act is supposed to fill the doughnut hole).\n\nBut I am also happy knowing that if my parents ever need any medical marijuana, I have sharpened my old skills and won\u2019t need a passport to ease their pain.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140919175238, "twitter": {"description": "Some across-the-border negotiations provide an elderly woman\u2019s prescriptions at a fraction of the cost at home.", "title": "A Drug Mule for the Medicare Set", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/a-drug-mule-for-the-medicare-set.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003125890"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/fashion/21REVERSE/21REVERSE-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/a-drug-mule-for-the-medicare-set.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003125890", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/a-drug-mule-for-the-medicare-set.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "fashion", "hdl_p": "Scoring Drugs for the Medicare Set", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 19, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Elderly,Medicare,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Canada,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Elder Care,Drugstores", "description": "Some across-the-border negotiations provide an elderly woman\u2019s prescriptions at a fraction of the cost at home.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jennifer Conlin", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/fashion/21REVERSE/21REVERSE-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "21REVERSE", "byl": "By JENNIFER CONLIN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Some across-the-border negotiations provide an elderly woman\u2019s prescriptions at a fraction of the cost at home.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/fashion/21REVERSE/21REVERSE-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Old age,Medicare,Canada,Drugstore", "CG": "fashion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/fashion/index.html", "section": "Fashion & Style", "modified": "2014-09-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Drugstores", "published": "2014-09-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "B3DFBD82-F298-43B3-9458-219B4F6AA2A5"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Canada", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140924154601, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/a-drug-mule-for-the-medicare-set.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/fashion/21REVERSE/21REVERSE-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some across-the-border negotiations provide an elderly woman\u2019s prescriptions at a fraction of the cost at home.", "title": "A Drug Mule for the Medicare Set"}, "pdate": 20140919, "des": "Drugstores", "articleid": 100000003125890, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Drug Mule for the Medicare Set", "col": "Reverse Parenting", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd152c\"", "article_summary": "\u201dNo,\u201d he said, explaining that the Food and Drug Administration cannot allow foreign drugs to be resold or distributed in the United States.\nTo temper her tempo, she was soon prescribed a very expensive heart medication.\nHer heart medication alone would now cost more than $800 for a three-month supply.\nwebsite, the United States government has issued guidelines on bringing prescription drugs over the border.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyCall it \u201cThe Dallas Buyers Club of Seniors,\u201d but a number of their octogenarian friends are now ordering their prescription drugs through pharmacies in Canada."}
