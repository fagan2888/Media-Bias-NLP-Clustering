It was on a street on the west side of town, close to US-254 and I-35.\n\nAnother person in the vehicle was critically hurt in the crash. He is being treated at a Wichita hospital for his injuries.\n\nAccording to the KHP incident report, the vehicle traveled at a high rate of speed. It appears the driver failed to negotiate a curve and the vehicle left the roadway.\n\nThen, El Dorado Police confirm that the vehicle struck a light pole and rolled numerous times, ejecting both the driver and the passenger. Then, the vehicle came to rest in an empty lot.\n\n\"Essentially the biggest challenge is that the accident scene spreads over quite a distance from where the vehicle left the roadway to its final resting spot,\" said Sgt. Christopher Jones with the El Dorado Police Department.\n\nThe KHP does not know if Plummer or the other person, both 32, were the driver or passenger.\n\nWe are not identifying the other person in this case until next of kin are notified for him. Plummer's family has been notified of the fatal crash.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A man has died following a rollover accident in El Dorado.", "language": "english", "author": "Annette Lawless", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/1-killed-1-critically-hurt-in-rollover-crash-in-El-Dorado-318564701.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/2015072695012225.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A man has died following a rollover accident in El Dorado.", "title": "1 killed, 1 critically hurt in rollover crash in El Dorado"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A man has died following a rollover accident in El Dorado.", "title": "1 killed, 1 critically hurt in rollover crash in El Dorado", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/1-killed-1-critically-hurt-in-rollover-crash-in-El-Dorado-318564701.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/2015072695012225.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "1 killed, 1 critically hurt in rollover crash in El Dorado", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "1 killed, 1 critically hurt in rollover"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09c0\"", "article_summary": "A man has died following a rollover accident in El Dorado.\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol confirms that Derrick Plummer, of El Dorado, passed away in a the accident around 9:30 Saturday night.\nChristopher Jones with the El Dorado Police Department.\nThen, El Dorado Police confirm that the vehicle struck a light pole and rolled numerous times, ejecting both the driver and the passenger.\nAnother person in the vehicle was critically hurt in the crash."}
