Then you were there.\n\nBut as of Saturday, those yuks were as obsolete as the stadium in which the joke was born.\n\nThe President\u2019s Suite at the $26 million, completely reconstructed Marv Kay Stadium is now a space fit for the name. And prior to Saturday\u2019s inaugural game for the entire facility, it burst at the seams with all of the big wigs \u2014 the administrators, donors and friends of the program, which included former Broncos coach Mike Shanahan.\n\nAnd everyone, in the suite, and the capacity crowd of more than 5,000 in the stands and the grassy Fiddler\u2019s Green-esque area behind the west end zone, was treated to the easiest of victories \u2014 a 63-28 win for the No. 18 Orediggers over the outmatched South Dakota School of Mines.\n\nThe day was a celebration from start to finish.\n\n\u201cWords are hard to come by describing the feelings that you have,\u201d said Kay, the legendary former CSM coach for whom the stadium is named. \u201cEvery kid that\u2019s ever donned the silver and blue is a part of this. Teachers, administrators, everything.\u201d\n\nOne fan, in an elevator headed to the concourse level, thought about when he last saw the stadium.\n\n\u201cI think it was 2006,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd what did he think about the new digs?\n\nHe grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot different than when I last saw it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stands were alive with commotion \u2014 smiles and hugs and laughs and so many pictures taken. It felt like the new day that it was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just soaking all of this in,\u201d Mines president Paul C. Johnson said. \u201cIt represents the pride everybody has in Mines as an institution.\u201d\n\nThe football team made sure none of those smiles faded.\n\nThe CSM offense basically did whatever it wanted. After its first drive stalled, the Orediggers scored on their next four possessions on drives of 83, 65, 59 and 53 yards. The trio of quarterback Justin Dvorak, running back Sam Seeton and receiver Cole Spurgeon were all over the field making most of it happen.\n\nDvorak had two games\u2019 worth of stats in the first half alone, completing 29-of-37 passes for 427 yards and six touchdowns in 30 stat-stuffing minutes. Spurgeon caught eight of those for 185 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe CSM defense didn\u2019t allow a point until 8:56 remained in the second quarter, but by then the damage was already done. CSM scored three more touchdowns before halftime to lead 49-14, and finished the game with 703 yards of total offense.\n\nDvorak had a career-high 555 passing yards and a school-record eight touchdown passes. The yards were seventh-most in RMAC history and the touchdown passes tied for the most in RMAC history, stats that Dvorak cooly noted \u201cfeels great when you win.\u201d\n\nAll of it put a opening day smile on new head coach Gregg Brandon\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cIt certainly was a great win for us,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cWith a new head coach and new stadium, and a lot of stuff going on around the program that you might consider distractions, these kids focused in and got the job done.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mines opens up new Marv Kay Stadium in style with big win", "title": "Mines opens up new Marv Kay Stadium in style with big win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/05/mines-opens-up-new-marv-kay-stadium-in-style-with-big-win-2/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T16:30:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-05T16:30:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8b2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWords are hard to come by describing the feelings that you have,\u201d said Kay, the legendary former CSM coach for whom the stadium is named.\nThe President\u2019s Suite at the $26 million, completely reconstructed Marv Kay Stadium is now a space fit for the name.\nTeachers, administrators, everything.\u201dOne fan, in an elevator headed to the concourse level, thought about when he last saw the stadium.\nBut as of Saturday, those yuks were as obsolete as the stadium in which the joke was born.\n\u201cIt represents the pride everybody has in Mines as an institution.\u201dThe football team made sure none of those smiles faded."}
