Paul Zoeller/Staff\n\nJamey Chadwell gathered his gleeful football team in the middle of the Johnson Hagood Stadium field Saturday night for a post-game prayer following a 33-20 victory over The Citadel. He was interrupted by a giggly shout.\n\n\u201cGive him the broom!\u201d a player said.\n\nWith that, the Charleston Southern head coach found his new favorite household tool and made three broad stokes. One for each of the relatively glorious wins over the Bulldogs the last three seasons.\n\n\u201cSweep! Sweep! Sweep!\u201d the players yelled in unison.\n\nChadwell thanked the Lord, then ripped The Citadel for its cool interest in continuing the series beyond this season \u2014 on Charleston Southern\u2019s home-and-home terms, that is.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably not a chance that we\u2019re ever going to play again as long as I\u2019m here, maybe while he (Citadel head coach Mike Houston) is here,\u201d Chadwell said.\n\nThe 38-year-old coach was just getting warmed up.\n\n\u201cWe feel disrespected by them,\u201d Chadwell said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying their coach, or maybe their team, but there are a lot of people that maybe look down on us for maybe what we stand for because of our facilities.\u201d\n\nAnd: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to play them, it\u2019s going to be home-and-home. We win more games here than they do, so it\u2019s like a home game for us.\u201d\n\nSafe to say that Chadwell\u2019s approach to series diplomacy might at least temporarily hamper negotiations to schedule another game or two.\n\nBut let us embrace bitterness, bad blood and brooms, critical elements to any good rivalry. A terrific game Saturday night begs for more action between the two Lowcountry programs.\n\nThe sooner, the crazier.\n\nBlue Crew vs. cadets\n\nThe crowd of 11,998 was the largest at The Citadel since Nov. 16, 2013. It isn\u2019t South Carolina-Clemson, or Georgia-Florida. But it is Charleston\u2019s largest outdoor football cocktail party and good, (mostly) clean fun on the field.\n\nIt was an often exciting night of \u201cBlue Crew\u201d T-shirts and bare-chested male students sporting coordinated body paint on one side, the famed corps of cadets and Citadel band on the other.\n\nEvery third down was a loud contrast of noise and different shades of blue. It was a game of big momentum swings, but nothing changed the direction of the notion that a dormant rivalry is just plain wrong.\n\nAs Charleston Southern quarterback Austin Brown broke through the Citadel line for a 5-yard gain, the cheer from a few thousand Charleston Southern fans echoed throughout the stadium.\n\nOnly to be immediately answered by the roar of Citadel cadets, fans and significant others. They liked the way Brown\u2019s helmet flew up in the air after a wallop applied by linebacker Tevin Floyd and defensive end Joe Crochet.\n\nBring out the broom\n\nIf only the Charleston Southern band had the money to travel a few miles off campus.\n\nIf only The Citadel started a Cowbells for Cadets drive.\n\nBut these are nit-picks easily corrected with a few loyal sponsors.\n\nSadly, with no games scheduled beyond 2015, there is plenty of time to tweak.\n\nThe Citadel should compromise, realizing that playing at Charleston Southern creates a week of valuable buzz.\n\nCharleston Southern should come around to considering a 2-for-1 or 3-for-2 series arrangement titling toward Johnson Hagood Stadium, because this rivalry has been as good for the Bucs as anything in its football history.\n\nThe broom, for instance.\n\nIt didn\u2019t find its way to the Charleston Southern sideline until the Bucs took a 33-20 lead with 3:54 left on Mike Holloway\u2019s 73-yard touchdown run and a 2-point conversion.\n\n\u201cIt was in the locker room,\u201d Chadwell said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t cocky. After we broke that long run, I said, \u2018Go get it, I think we\u2019re good.\u2019\u201d\n\nLogic says Chadwell, 21-8 at Charleston Southern, is such a good coach, he won\u2019t be around much longer. But wouldn\u2019t Citadel fans love to give him the broom treatment three or four wins down the line?\n\nAh, sweet bitterness, the best reason why smart people at both schools must make a Buccaneers-Bulldogs football game bloom as annually as azaleas.\n\nFollow Gene Sapakoff on Twitter @sapakoff", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sapakoff: Charleston Southern, Citadel better with bitterness, Sports, \r\nSportsFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nGene Sapakoff, \r\nGene Sapakoff, Big South Conference,Charleston Southern,Citadel Bulldogs,Citadel football,CSU,CSU Bucs,Jamey Chadwell,Johnson Hagood Stadium,Mike Houston,SoCon,The Citadel", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Jamey Chadwell gathered his gleeful football team in the middle of the Johnson Hagood Stadium field Saturday night for a post-game prayer following a 33-20 victory over The Citadel.
