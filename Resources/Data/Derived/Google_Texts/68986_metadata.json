A recent study conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles\u2019 Department of Psychology has revealed that even though the use of digital media has destroyed children\u2019s social skills by hindering face-to-face interactions, five days without any electronic devices can significantly improve a child\u2019s ability to identify another person\u2019s feelings.\n\n\u201cMany people are looking at the benefits of digital media in education, and not many are looking at the costs,\u201d said Patricia Greenfield, lead researcher and professor of psychology at UCLA, in a statement. \u201cDecreased sensitivity to emotional cues \u2014 losing the ability to understand the emotions of other people \u2014 is one of the costs. The displacement of in-person social interaction by screen interaction seems to be reducing social skills.\u201d\n\nGreenfield and her colleagues recruited 51 sixth-graders from a Southern California public school to spend five days at the Pali Institute, a nature and science camp that does not permit the use of electronic devices. The research team gauged each student\u2019s ability to identify other peoples' emotions when they got to the camp and when they left. Campers were shown 48 pictures of people with a happy, sad, angry, or scared expression and asked to categorize each feeling. They were also a shown a video and were asked to identify what the actors were feeling during certain social situations.\n\nThe results of the first 51 campers were compared to a second group that did not attend the Pali Institute. After tracking the amount of errors campers made while attempting to identify the emotions displayed in each photo and video, the psychologists found that campers made an average of 14.02 errors when identifying emotions at the beginning of the study compared to 9.41 errors at the end. Sixth-graders who didn't spend five days away from their devices showed no perceivable changes in the amount of errors.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t learn nonverbal emotional cues from a screen in the way you can learn it from face-to-face communication,\u201d said Yalda Uhls, senior researcher at the UCLA Children\u2019s Digital Media Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not practicing face-to-face communication, you could be losing important social skills. We are social creatures. We need device-free time.\u201d\n\nCampers and non-campers participating in this study reported spending an average of four-and-a-half hours a day watching TV or playing video games; however, some national averages indicate that American children spend more time buried in their electronic devices. Seeing as five days without the use of a smartphone, tablet, or TV significantly improved the social skills of these sixth-graders, researchers concluded that all is not lost for children in this digital era.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown a model of what more face-to-face interaction can do,\u201d Greenfield added. \u201cSocial interaction is needed to develop skills in understanding the emotions of other people.\u201d\n\nSource: Uhls Y, Greenfield P, Zgourou E, et al.
