Dannel Malloy (D-WFP), the newly released Quinnipiac University survey finds the Connecticut governor\u2019s approval rating has plummeted to 32%, the \u201clowest score for any governor in the nine states surveyed\u201d this year.\n\nThe Courant endorsed Malloy in his re-election bid last year, referring to the state as \u201can incubator for progressive policies.\u201d The legislature is Democrat-led, as well.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOn the occasion of President Obama\u2019s visit to Connecticut prior to Malloy\u2019s re-election, the Courant wrote:\n\nWhether in the area of gun control, a minimum wage increase, universal preschool or the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Malloy has been a champion for the liberal cause, accomplishing in Connecticut what the president has failed to advance federally.\n\nNevertheless, despite advancing liberal social justice policies, Medicaid expansion for Obamacare, one of the nation\u2019s strictest gun control laws, transgender bathrooms, and driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants, the Governor is being rebuked by Democrats, Republicans, and independents for raising taxes and mismanaging the state\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cGov. Dannel Malloy\u2019s job approval rating has plummeted to 32 percent, close to the historic 24 percent low hit by disgraced former Gov. John Rowland in January 2004, and Gov. Malloy is not in the middle of a corruption scandal,\u201d said Quinnipiac University Poll Director Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D. \u201cMalloy is getting hammered on the critical pocketbook issues, taxes, the budget and the economy and jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly 36 percent of voters are satisfied with the way things are going in the state, one of the lowest scores since Quinnipiac University started asking this question in 1997,\u201d he added.\n\nThe poll shows Connecticut voters sharply disapprove of Malloy, 58-32 percent, with 4-1 negative scores for his management of taxes and the state\u2019s finances.\n\nOnly 58% of Democrats in the state approve of Malloy, while 86% of Republicans and 61% of independents disapprove. Men disapprove of the Governor at 62% and women at 55%.\n\nA full 75% of Connecticut voters give Malloy a \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d rating on the state\u2019s economy, with only 5% of voters finding Malloy\u2019s policies have helped them.\n\nA Gallup poll in 2014 found Connecticut had dropped to dead last place in the nation in job creation, as workers reported the worst climate for hiring.\n\nAccording to the Hartford Courant, Malloy spokesman Devon Puglia said about the survey results, \u201cPolls go up, they go down, and we don\u2019t comment on them. What\u2019s always constant, however, is our work to build Connecticut\u2019s long-term future.\u201d\n\nFrom October 7-11, 1,735 registered voters participated in the poll, which has a margin of error of +/-2.4 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Hartford Courant says Connecticut Gov.
