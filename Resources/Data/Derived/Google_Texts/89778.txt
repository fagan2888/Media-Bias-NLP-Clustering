Four days before an enrollment deadline they vow not to extend, federal health officials on Thursday tried to dismiss suggestions Affordable Care Act sign ups slowed in January and emphasized that momentum is building toward Jan. 31, which is the last chance for most uninsured individuals to get 2016 health insurance.

Instead, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted that December enrollment was particularly strong and he singled out 14 states — including Louisiana, North and South Dakota and Tennessee — where signups are running at least 20% higher than they were last year at this time. And Slavitt noted that Thursday traffic was 50% higher than a week ago, showing how interest is picking up during what he called "the final countdown."

CMS said Wednesday that 8.9 million consumers had signed up or had their coverage renewed through Healthcare.gov, the federal site handling enrollment for 38 states. Several large southern cities are also seeing big enrollment boosts, Slavitt said. Houston, for example, made up for 3.2% all plan selections for 2015 and is already accounting for 4% — a 27% increase.

For the first time this year, CMS' enrollment numbers reflect people whose plans are canceled, something CMS wasn't able to calculate until later in the process.

Most people can find plans on Healthcare.gov with premiums for less than $75 a month after tax credits are applied, CMS says. Fail to sign up and penalties at tax time in 2017 start at $695.
