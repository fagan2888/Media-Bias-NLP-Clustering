Other consumers are buying health insurance through the private marketplace instead of government ones like www.healthcare.gov because of their more expansive choices and more easily navigable websites.\n\n\u201cThe gap between reality and expectations is especially notable when you look at middle class Americans who earn too much to qualify for them,\u201d said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nOne benefit is that more consumers are purchasing health insurance, which lowers their cost in the case of an emergency or illness since medical bills can run into the thousands quickly. Others are buying coverage instead of paying the tax penalty, which has risen in 2016 to $695 or 2.5% of their income, but is capped at a maximum of $2,085, which is what an individual would pay for a bronze plan on average.\n\nAlthough premiums have risen, the Congressional Budget Office said that since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the number of uninsured people will be lowered by 22 million in 2016. When open enrollment ended in January, only 12 million people signed up for plans through the federal or state-run exchanges , because many people opted to buy them directly from insurance companies or use their employer\u2019s plan, the CBO said.\n\nAmericans earning middle class wages are feeling the pinch since many of them make too much money to qualify even for a partial subsidy as deductibles and out of pocket costs have risen.\n\n\u201cA lot of Americans aren\u2019t eligible for subsidies and more than expected are steering away from government exchanges, because they can find better options elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAn individual earning $47,000 qualifies for subsidies, but someone earning $48,000 does not. This is solidly middle class.\u201d\n\nWhile the government exchanges were intended to provide health insurance options to everyone, but they are \u201creally designed only to serve subsidy recipients,\u201d Purpura said.\n\nOne issue that arises is the private insurers offer more options and customer service to help consumers determine if they need a lower deductible plan with higher premiums but better prescription drug coverage or, by contrast, a higher deductible plan with lower premiums for people who are healthy and rarely see their doctors.\n\n\u201cConsumers are learning that if you don\u2019t get subsidies, you are better off shopping elsewhere,\u201d Purpura said. \u201cThe trend here has troubling implications - we could end up with a two-tiered system where poorer folks who get subsidies shop at government exchanges and middle class folks earning too much for subsidies get more options to choose from and better customer service.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Americans in the middle class are purchasing health insurance plans from private insurers instead of subsidized government plans because many of them are earning too much money to qualify.", "author": "Ellen Chang", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Americans in the middle class are purchasing health insurance plans from private insurers instead of subsidized government plans because many of them are earning too much money to qualify.", "title": "Why Middle Class Consumers Don&rsquo;t Use Government Health Insurance Exchanges", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-middle-class-consumers-donrsquot-use-government-health-insurance-exchanges", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/258ea595-f5d6-11e5-94cd-d90a977e666c.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/258ea595-f5d6-11e5-94cd-d90a977e666c.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "deductible, prescriptions, premiums, ACA, tax penalty, Obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2016-04-01T16:04Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611359"}, "date": "2016-04-01T16:04Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13511333, "twitter": {"description": "Americans in the middle class are purchasing health insurance plans from private insurers instead of subsidized government plans because many of them are earning too much money to qualify.", "title": "Why Middle Class Consumers Don&rsquo;t Use Government Health Insurance Exchanges", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-middle-class-consumers-donrsquot-use-government-health-insurance-exchanges", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/258ea595-f5d6-11e5-94cd-d90a977e666c.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/258ea595-f5d6-11e5-94cd-d90a977e666c.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "deductible, prescriptions, premiums, ACA, tax penalty, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd117d\"", "article_summary": "Other consumers are buying health insurance through the private marketplace instead of government ones like www.healthcare.gov because of their more expansive choices and more easily navigable websites.\nThis is solidly middle class.\u201dWhile the government exchanges were intended to provide health insurance options to everyone, but they are \u201creally designed only to serve subsidy recipients,\u201d Purpura said.\nADVERTISEMENTMiddle class Americans are purchasing health insurance plans from private insurers instead of subsidized government plans, because many of them are earning too much money to qualify.\nAmericans earning middle class wages are feeling the pinch since many of them make too much money to qualify even for a partial subsidy as deductibles and out of pocket costs have risen.\n\u201cA lot of Americans aren\u2019t eligible for subsidies and more than expected are steering away from government exchanges, because they can find better options elsewhere,\u201d he said."}
