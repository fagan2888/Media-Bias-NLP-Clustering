In 2008, IBM built the first supercomputer for the U. S. Department of Energy. It operated at 1 petaflop, a modest processing speed compared to today's fastest computers.



Today, the fastest supercomputer is the Tianhe-2 in China, which operates at 55 petaflops.



The U.S. Department of Energy is spending $425 million on two new supercomputers which will be the world's fastest, and the U.S. will reclaim the top spot, reports News Daily.



From the funding, $325 million goes towards building Summit for Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and Sierra at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.



Summit will operate at 150 petaflops and Sierra at 100 petaflops, which will run roughly five to seven times faster than the United States' current supercomputers.



Summit will replace Oak Ridge's Titan supercomputer, which operates at 27 petaflops. It is meant to be used for scientific applications and to drive discoveries.



Oak Ridge will share the supercomputer with other researchers. However, they must apply for a time to use the computer.



Sierra will be located at the Lawrence Livermore lab, and it is designed to help the the National Nuclear Security Administration "ensure the safety, security and effectiveness of the nation's nuclear deterrent without testing," according to a spokesperson for Nvidia.



Nvidia develops chips used for parallel processing on supercomputers and in data centers.



For the other $100 million of funding, as part of a program called FastForward2, the DOE is awarding research grants for the development of critical technologies needed for supercomputers.



Typically, more powerful computers also use more electricity. However, the DOE is only expecting a10 percent increase in power consumption for Summit and Sierra, according to Digital Trends.



IBM, Nvidia and Mellanox are making the components for the new supercomputers, which are expected to be installed in 2017.
