Broncos backup running back Ronnie Hillman and cornerback Kayvon Webster will be on the active game roster today when Denver plays the Kansas City Chiefs at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

Both players missed the opener last week after they fell ill following the Broncos’ final preseason game Aug. 28 in Dallas and missed a few days of practice and meetings. They had a full week of preparation this week so they’re up.

The question is whether Hillman and Webster got Wally Pipp’ed. Hillman was the No. 2 running back behind Montee Ball through the offseason, training camp and preseason, but No. 3 tailback C.J. Anderson ran well last week against Indianapolis, rushing four times for 27 yards.

The Broncos will dress all four running backs from their 53-man roster today — Ball, Hillman, Anderson and rookie Juwan Thompson, who plays on multiple special-teams units.

Webster was supposed to open as the Broncos’ No. 3 corner, or nickelback, but rookie Bradley Roby had an impressive debut last week against the Colts.

With Webster playing today, the Broncos will place cornerback Tony Carter on the inactive list.

But while the Broncos get Hillman and Webster back, they will not have their special teams captain today against the Chiefs.

David Bruton won’t dress as he continues to recover from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in the opener last week against the Indianapolis Colts. Bruton was blasted on a touchback by the Colts’ Colt Anderson.

Also inactive for Denver: Rookie WR Cody Latimer, CB Tony Carter, T Mike Schofield, G Ben Garland, LB Danny Trevathan. And, of course, Wes Welker.
