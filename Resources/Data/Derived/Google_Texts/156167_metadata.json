Stay inside. Avoid area. \u2014 PGPDNEWS (@PGPDNews) March 13, 2016\n\nLocal station WJLA reports police reported a suspect opening fire at the station and police returned fire, injuring the suspect in the cross-fire. It is unclear at this point if Colson was shot by the suspect or by police-fire as they shot back. The cause is under investigation.\n\nDetails from the second suspect arrested in connection to the shooting were not outlined by police.\n\nIn a live conference, Police Chief Hank Stawinski told the press Sunday night that \"officers did not shrink. They bravely advanced and engaged this individual who was threatening not just the police officers he was opening fire onto, but numerous members of the community in the area.\"\n\nThis attack comes 15 days after Prince William County Police Officer Ashley Guindon was shot and killed in a domestic-related shooting.\n\nPrince George's County is a suburb of Washington DC. The headquarters is near FedEx Field where the Washington Redskins play.\n\nCopyright 2016 Raycom News Network.
