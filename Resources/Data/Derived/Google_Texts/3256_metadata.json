He is trained by Ken McPeek, who ended War Emblem\u2019s Triple Crown try in 2002 with 70-1 shot Sarava.\n\nTrainer Mark Casse said Conquest Curlinate would not run in the Belmont Stakes. The colt wasn\u2019t nominated to the Triple Crown series and it would have cost $75,000 to supplement him to the 1 1/2-mile race.\n\nOther expected runners are Frosted, who finished fourth in the Kentucky Derby, and Tale of Verve, who was second in the Preakness Stakes. Carpe Diem, Frammento, Keen Ice, Madefromlucky, Materiality and Mubtaahij are also likely to be in the field, which will be set next Wednesday, when entries are taken and post positions drawn.\n\nBob Baffert, who trains American Pharoah, downplayed the issue of Kentucky Derby horses skipping the Preakness Stakes to rest up five weeks and run in the Belmont Stakes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame them,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cThat part of the Triple Crown doesn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201d\n\nBaffert won\u2019t send American Pharoah from Kentucky to Belmont Park until next Tuesday, and the horse won\u2019t have an official workout over the big oval. Instead, he\u2019ll gallop up to the race on June 6.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my comfort zone,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had so much luck shipping out of Churchill Downs and winning Grade 1 races. I feel more confident doing that than if I was just sitting around up there.\u201d\n\nKiaran McLaughlin will saddle Frosted at his home track, and he agreed with Baffert that American Pharoah doesn\u2019t need extended time over the track.\n\n\u201cHe could probably run down a street very well over broken glass. He\u2019s a very, very nice horse,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think working over it is going to make him like it. It\u2019s more the distance, because no one has run a mile and a half, and you don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll want a mile and a half.\u201d\n\nAmerican Pharoah has never run at Belmont Park, nor have most of his challengers. However, six of them train there and The Truth or Else has those two victories on the track.\n\n\u201cWeird things happen in the Belmont,\u201d McPeek said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t duck one horse in a race. American Pharoah could possibly not handle the surface. You don\u2019t know. So long as it\u2019s a dry track, we\u2019ll pull the trigger.\u201d\n\nBaffert agreed weather is a factor at Belmont Park, where the extended forecast currently calls for partly cloudy skies with a 20 percent chance of rain on race day.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s windy and dry, it becomes deep and loose and tiring,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many variables. I want a fair track.\u201d\n\nBaffert is confident in American Pharoah and his preparation, and the only pressure he\u2019s feeling is on behalf of racing fans that have waited patiently for 36 years to see another Triple Crown winner.\n\nOnly 11 horses have swept the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, the last being Affirmed in 1978.\n\nThe most recent attempt was last year, when California Chrome finished in a tie for fourth in the Belmont Stakes. In 2012, I\u2019ll Have Another won the first two legs but was scratched on the eve of the race with a leg injury. In 2008, Big Brown didn\u2019t finish the Belmont Stakes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to let those fans down,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cEvery year we go, \u2018This is the one.\u2019 Hopefully, maybe, this is the one. So far, all indications show me that he\u2019s doing well. It\u2019s about the horse now. Is he that good of a horse to do it?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The colt will likely face seven of his rivals from the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes, while two other formidable entries will be in the field for the Belmont Stakes on June 6.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The colt will likely face seven of his rivals from the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes, while two other formidable entries will be in the field for the Belmont Stakes on June 6.", "title": "American Pharoah could have nine challengers in pursuit of Triple Crown", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/28/american-pharoah-triple-crown-belmont-stakes/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/28/Belmont_Baffert_Evolution_Horse_Racing.JPEG-0c0d2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/28/Belmont_Baffert_Evolution_Horse_Racing.JPEG-0c0d2.jpg", "description": "The colt will likely face seven of his rivals from the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes, while two other formidable entries will be in the field for the Belmont Stakes on June 6.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "American Pharoah could have nine challengers in pursuit of Triple Crow"}, "Author": "Beth Harris", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Bob Baffert, Derby, Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, The Preakness Stakes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2be9\"", "article_summary": "He is trained by Ken McPeek, who ended War Emblem\u2019s Triple Crown try in 2002 with 70-1 shot Sarava.\nThe colt wasn\u2019t nominated to the Triple Crown series and it would have cost $75,000 to supplement him to the 1 1/2-mile race.\nKentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner American Pharoah figures to have nine challengers when he runs in the Belmont Stakes next week and tries to become the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years.\nSeven of his expected rivals return from the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes, while two others are new to the Triple Crown trail.\nOnly 11 horses have swept the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, the last being Affirmed in 1978."}
