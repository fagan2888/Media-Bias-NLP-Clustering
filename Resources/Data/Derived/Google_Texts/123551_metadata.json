GCX designed the over-bed, adjustable table to accommodate mobile devices, particularly the iPad, and it can serve as a charging station for the mobile device.\n\nWithin 24 hours of the Patient Engagement Table\u2019s official launch in mid-September, some of the largest U.S. healthcare systems indicated the table meets a strong need among their hospitalized patients for more connectivity while in the hospital and a stronger link to their physicians.\n\n\u201cThis versatile solution addresses something very much on the minds of IT organizations and hospitals around the country, which is empowering patients with mechanisms that help them become more engaged in their care and increase their control over their situation,\u201d Cris Daugbjerg, GCX Vice President of Development and Sales, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very current, very real need, and it definitely struck a nerve with hospital administrators who had been looking for this type of solution.\u201d\n\nThere are almost one million hospital beds in the U.S., according to the American Hospital Association. Unlike existing over-bed tables, the medical-grade Patient Engagement Table includes an adjustable arm to hold a personal or hospital-issued tablet. Patients can then use the devices to stay connected, entertained and informed. Tablets also are used to schedule follow-up appointments and provide secured patient data, including discharge instructions.\n\nThe Patient Engagement Table\u2019s patent-pending design includes:\n\nAn adjustable-height, over-bed table made of a durable, synthetic, thermoplastic surface, with welled areas to contain spills\n\nEasy-to-use hand controls\n\nAnodized aluminum construction for durability and ease of cleaning\n\nIntegrated, industry-standard GCX channel profile to facilitate IT hardware integration\n\nAccessory track to add storage, a 4-port USB charging module and medical-grade coiled or straight power cord\n\nGrip points for easier positioning by patients and clinicians\n\nFinding ways to improve the patient experience is a top priority for U.S. healthcare systems complying with The Patient Rights and Affordable Care Act. Patients with more options to communicate with clinicians, hospital staff, family and friends may rate their hospital experience more favorably on satisfaction surveys.\n\nHospitals looking to utilize the Patient Engagement Table also are exploring mobile applications that can improve staff productivity, such as an app to control a room\u2019s lighting and climate \u2013 one of the most popular reasons patients call a floor\u2019s nursing station.\n\nOptional USB ports and power strips also provide a convenient place for patients and visitors to recharge mobile phones or tablets.\n\nFor more information or to place an order for the Patient Engagement Table, visit the GCX website at www.gcx.com or contact Kevin Merritt, Director of Marketing, at (800) 228-2555, Ext. 713.\n\nAbout GCX Corporation\n\nGCX Corporation, based in Petaluma, Calif., has been providing medical instrument and IT mounting solutions for the healthcare industry since 1971.
