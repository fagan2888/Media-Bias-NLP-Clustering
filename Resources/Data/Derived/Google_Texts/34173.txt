National health services organization IASIS Healthcare, the Phoenix Suns and the Phoenix Mercury basketball teams have joined forces to open a multi-specialty clinic, the organizations announced Monday.

The $7.9 million, 28,000 square-foot clinic is located inside what was formerly the Phoenix Suns Athletic Club, at 230 S. 3rd St. in Phoenix.

The clinic is the cornerstone of a partnership between the three organizations. It will provide access to healthcare in the same place where the team's athletes will have their own services performed.

"With three hospitals, a behavioral health hospital, numerous physician practices and a managed care organization in Arizona, this clinic is a significant addition to our operations here," said Carl Whitmer, CEO of IASIS Healthcare, in a statement. "It fills a void, bringing vital healthcare services to those who live, work, and attend school in downtown Phoenix."

The clinic will offer diagnostic imaging services that include downtown Phoenix's only MRI machine, equipped with Ambient Design lighting and sound technology that aims to make patients more comfortable and relaxed during their procedure, as well as CT and digital X-ray.

The facility will also offer medical specialties such as cardiology, dermatology, primary care, women's care, dentistry, podiatry, ophthalmology, chiropractic care, sports behavioral medicine, orthopedics, sports medicine and physical therapy, essentially making it a one-stop-shop for most healthcare needs.

Phoenix Suns President Jason Rowley said in a statement that patients will sometimes undergo treatment alongside some of the team's star players.
