Yet, there are still many misconceptions about these conditions and how we diagnose them. Although food allergies are thought to be uncommon, about one in 13 kids suffer from them. This means that sometimes it\u2019s even harder to recognize or diagnose rare instances in which allergic reactions seem to occur \u2014 some people have even been diagnosed with water and cold air allergies. And now, a family in Massachusetts is suing their son\u2019s school, alleging that its Wi-Fi is causing him to have allergic reactions.\n\nThe young boy\u2019s symptoms began in the spring of 2013, when he began coming home from school with headaches, itchy skin, and a rash. However, the strangest aspect of the boy\u2019s symptoms was when they appeared: only during school hours. According to a 45-page complaint filed by the boy\u2019s family this summer, the symptoms never showed up during the weekends or holidays \u2014 only when he returned to school, the Daily Beast reported. Then, in 2014, the symptoms got worse; the boy began suffering from bloody noses, dizziness, heart palpitations, and nausea.\n\nAfter his illness stumped doctors, the boy\u2019s family took matters into their own hands. They discovered that The Fay School, which their son had attended since 2009, had installed a stronger wireless service in the spring of 2013, around the same time the boy\u2019s symptoms began to show. Putting the two together, the boy\u2019s mother decided that he suffered from electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), a condition caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), symptoms include redness, tingling, and burning sensations, fatigue, tiredness, concentration difficulties, dizziness, nausea, heart palpitations, and digestive disturbances. All of these were consistent with the symptoms the boy reported. Calling his condition a disability, the boy\u2019s parents called on the school to adopt an Ethernet connection or find a way to lower the Wi-Fi connection\u2019s electromagnetic emissions, according to the lawsuit.\n\nHowever, EHS is shrouded in mystery. According to WHO, symptoms of EHS are real, however, \u201cthe collection of symptoms is not part of any recognized syndrome.\u201d Most people who have EHS are reportedly self-diagnosed. And in a 2010 study published in Bioelectromagnetics, Dr. James Rubin performed a systematic review of 46 different blind or double blind studies on 1,175 individuals who self-diagnosed themselves as having EHS and found that there was no evidence that EHS alone was causing the symptoms. Rather, the condition may be more closely related to mental health, as participants experienced similar reactions when exposed to electromagnetism that wasn\u2019t actually there. \u201cAs sham exposure was sufficient to trigger severe symptoms in some participants,\u201d Rubin wrote, \u201cpsychological factors may have an important role in causing this condition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wifi massachusetts allergy electromagnetic hypersensitivity", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A family is suing a Massachusetts school over claims that their son is allergic to the school's WiFi.", "title": "Lawsuit Claims Boy Is 'Allergic' To His School's Wi-Fi", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/electromagnetic-hypersensitivity-massachusetts-family-sues-school-over-sons-apparent-352454", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/wi-fi-allergy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A family is suing a Massachusetts school over claims that their son is allergic to the school's WiFi.", "title": "Lawsuit Claims Boy Is 'Allergic' To His School's Wi-Fi", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/electromagnetic-hypersensitivity-massachusetts-family-sues-school-over-sons-apparent-352454", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/wi-fi-allergy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/wi-fi-allergy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-09-14T13:33:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T14:35:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A family is suing a Massachusetts school over claims that their son is allergic to the school's WiFi."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc852\"", "article_summary": "One in five Americans suffer from allergy or asthma symptoms, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.\nThe young boy\u2019s symptoms began in the spring of 2013, when he began coming home from school with headaches, itchy skin, and a rash.\nAnd now, a family in Massachusetts is suing their son\u2019s school, alleging that its Wi-Fi is causing him to have allergic reactions.\nAfter his illness stumped doctors, the boy\u2019s family took matters into their own hands.\nHowever, the strangest aspect of the boy\u2019s symptoms was when they appeared: only during school hours."}
