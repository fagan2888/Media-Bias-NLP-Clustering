The credits can be claimed before filing a return or on a return. Credits received in advance must be reconciled with the amount that\u2019s actually allowed.\n\nIn 2014, the House Appropriations Committee requested that TIGTA evaluate whether overpayments in credits were recouped.\n\nAccording to the report, computer program errors caused incorrect calculations of the allowable tax credits on almost 28,000 of the 183,000 targeted returns. In almost 5,000 returns, the IRS lacked the authority to correct the tax credit claim during processing of the subsidy. It\u2019s not clear what the issues are with the remaining roughly 150,000 returns, and the report indicates that TIGTA and the IRS are working to determine the cause of \u201ccalculation differences.\u201d\n\nThe report also indicates that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace didn\u2019t give information, known as Exchange Periodic Data, to the IRS before tax season began. System troubles resulted in the IRS\u2019s inability to use the data received between Jan. 20 and March 29, 2015. Without that information, the agency couldn\u2019t electronically match it with filed claims or ensure that taxpayers who got the credits filed a return as they are supposed to.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nOther findings indicated that IRS processes to detect possible fraud in tax credit claims were performing and that the agency corrected programming mistakes found by TIGTA that failed to spot returns that required more review. And, while the agency notified people who received the tax credits but failed to file returns that reconciliation is required, the IRS used out-of-date tax-filing information to identify the taxpayers.\n\nTIGTA recommendations include:\n\nThe IRS should review the almost 28,000 tax returns to ensure that the taxpayers get the proper tax credits.\n\nThe IRS should adjust its family size and income verification so that the most current information available is used when determining if tax credits have been reconciled.\n\nIn a letter responding to TIGTA\u2019s findings, Debra Holland, commissioner of the IRS Wage and Investment Division, said that during the 2015 filing season, more than 300,000 returns were sent back to senders for correction of tax credit errors, inconsistencies, or missing forms. The agency\u2019s other fact-checking resolved about 2.4 million errors before tax returns were processed.\n\n\u201cFor those [roughly 28,000] returns where the [tax credit] claim may have been incorrectly verified, due to the reliance on projected partial-year data and programming errors, it is important to note that the IRS does not have the statutory authority to correct discrepancies without following deficiency procedures,\u201d Holland wrote, adding that those procedures are known as audit procedures.\n\nShe wrote that audit procedures are costly \u201cand compete with other enforcement priorities for scarce resources. We will review those returns to identify those that merit appropriate follow-up activity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Terry Sheridan"}, "dcterms.title": "IRS Properly Calculated ACA Tax Credit on Most Returns in 2015", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "IRS"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "IRS Properly Calculated ACA Tax Credit on Most Returns in 2015", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-properly-calculated-aca-tax-credit-on-most-returns-in-2015", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/irs_building_pgiam.png?itok=z1Y4yoTy", "updated_time": "2016-05-04T14:45:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-properly-calculated-aca-tax-credit-on-most-returns-in-2015", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS Properly Calculated ACA Tax Credit on Most Returns in 2015"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-properly-calculated-aca-tax-credit-on-most-returns-in-2015", "dcterms.creator": "Terry Sheridan", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-04T14:45+00:00", "dcterms.language": "en", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Affordable Care Act\",\"TIGTA\",\"Tax credit\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"IRS\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"IRS\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_26722\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-04T21:48:51+01:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-04T21:48:51+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "IRS", "sft-tag": "TIGTA", "sft-date": "May 4th 2016", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Tax", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-26722", "publishtime": "2016-05-04T21:48:51:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Terry Sheridan", "sft-title": "IRS Properly Calculated ACA Credit on Most Returns"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TIGTA recommendations include:The IRS should review the almost 28,000 tax returns to ensure that the taxpayers get the proper tax credits.\nIn almost 5,000 returns, the IRS lacked the authority to correct the tax credit claim during processing of the subsidy.\nThe Affordable Care Act created the tax credits as refundable to offset health insurance costs for low- to moderate-income taxpayers.\nStill, the report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) slaps the tax agency for problems in about 183,000 of the more than 2.6 million tax returns involving the tax credits that were filed between Jan. 20 and May 28, 2015.\nThe agency\u2019s other fact-checking resolved about 2.4 million errors before tax returns were processed."}
