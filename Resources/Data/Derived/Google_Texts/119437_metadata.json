John McCain (R) for reelection to the U.S. Senate.\n\nSen. John McCain has supported pro-life measures that protect mothers and their unborn children, in stark contrast with his opponent, Ann Kirkpatrick, whose pro-abortion extremism is demonstrated by her co-sponsorship of H.R. 448, a proposed federal law to invalidate virtually all state and federal limits on abortion.\n\nDuring the current Congress, McCain co-sponsored and voted to advance the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act \u2013 groundbreaking legislation to protect unborn children after 20 weeks, when the unborn child can experience great pain during dismemberment or other late abortion methods. In contrast, Ann Kirkpatrick voted against this legislation (H.R.36).\n\nSen. McCain voted repeatedly to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, and to prevent taxpayer funding of abortions. In contrast, Ann Kirkpatrick voted to allow government funding of abortion providers, and to allow taxpayer funding of elective abortions (H.R.7).\n\nSen. McCain also voted to repeal Obamacare \u2013 a law that created a national program of massive federal subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion, and imposes rationing of lifesaving medical care. In contrast, Ann Kirkpatrick voted to enact and against repeal of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAll voters who are concerned with the right to life and with the protection of the most vulnerable members of the human family should vote to return John McCain to the U.S. Senate, so that he can continue to work to advance vital pro-life public policies,\u201d said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TobiasMcCain3re-300x249.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 National Right to Life today announced its endorsement of U.S. Sen.
