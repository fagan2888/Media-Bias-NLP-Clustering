He was young, he had a family, he was a gifted orator. He seemed bright and in the 2008 primary season he didn\u2019t attack his main opponent, Hillary Clinton. Was this a new kind of politician? As it turns out, no.\n\nOne of the other things we were told about Mr. Obama was that he had been a professor of constitutional law. He was an expert on the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court considers parts of the Obamacare law, we are reminded that maybe Obama wasn\u2019t such an expert on the Constitution after all. Or that he has no respect for it.\n\nIn his 2010 State of the Union speech to Congress and to the nation, President Obama scolded the high court because he didn\u2019t like the justices\u2019 interpretation of the law. It differed from his opinion.\n\nJust last week, he mocked the Supreme Court of the United States while speaking in Germany. Mr. Obama presumed to know better than the court what cases it should should and shouldn\u2019t hear.\n\nNow, he is lobbying publicly to try and sway the outcome of the court on Obamacare. Apparently Barack Obama really doesn\u2019t understand the roles of the co-equal branches of government as outlined in Constitution.\n\nOr maybe he just thinks he knows better than nine Supreme Court justices and the Founding Fathers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Barack Obama first ran for president, the American public was sold on several things.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When Barack Obama first ran for president, the American public was sold on several things.", "title": "TIM CONSTANTINE: Obama\u2019s blatant disrespect for the Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/12/tim-constantine-obamas-blatant-disrespect-supreme-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/12/AP927656769927.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/12/AP927656769927.jpg", "description": "When Barack Obama first ran for president, the American public was sold on several things.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "TIM CONSTANTINE: Obama\u2019s blatant disrespect for the Supreme Cour"}, "Author": "Tim Constantine", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Barack Obama, US Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd2d\"", "article_summary": "Or maybe he just thinks he knows better than nine Supreme Court justices and the Founding Fathers.\nJust last week, he mocked the Supreme Court of the United States while speaking in Germany.\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court considers parts of the Obamacare law, we are reminded that maybe Obama wasn\u2019t such an expert on the Constitution after all.\nMr. Obama presumed to know better than the court what cases it should should and shouldn\u2019t hear.\nOne of the other things we were told about Mr. Obama was that he had been a professor of constitutional law."}
