A not-to-miss summer concert is coming up: the Summer Spirit Festival, happening Aug. 2 in Columbia, Maryland.

We didn't think it'd be fair for you to miss seeing Lauryn Hill and Janelle Monae or the 10 other artists on the bill for the Spirit Festival, held at the Merriweather Post Pavilion.

Other featured artists include Meshell Ndegeocello, Raheem DeVaughn, Talib Kweli, Junkyard Band, Backyard Band, RDGLDGRN, George Tandy Jr., Roman GianArthur and DJ Quicksilva.

Doors open to the marketplace and park at 2 p.m., with the first artist on stage at around 3 p.m. Tickets range from $46-$125 -- you can get them at ticketfly.com or merriweathermusic.com . Pay a little more to sit inside the pavilion if you're worried about rain; otherwise, bring a blanket and stretch out on the lawn.

The Merriweather Post Pavilion is located at 10475 Little Patuxent Parkway Columbia, Maryland, about an hour from downtown D.C.
