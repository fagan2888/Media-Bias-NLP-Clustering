It lacks an automated tool for users to update their coverage or personal information, and small businesses mandated into the exchange have never been able to use the website.\n\nState officials have said not to expect those functions to be there when the site is brought back online, sometime before open enrollment, which begins Nov. 15.\n\nOptum is helping the state prepare for a rush of traffic during open enrollment, when many existing users will renew coverage and new users are expected to create accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Vermont will contract with Optum to build the exchange\u2019s remaining functions, and state officials were not immediately available to comment on the revision.\n\nThe total amount Optum can earn is now $29.4 million on a contract that currently runs through the end of January 2015. The revision, signed Oct. 10, dates back to Sept. 15.\n\nOptum\u2019s contract is described by state officials as \u201copen-to-buy\u201d or a \u201ctime and materials\u201d contract, meaning it can be expanded as needed. The latest revision is the second time Optum\u2019s contract has been expanded since the company was hired as a consultant in June.\n\nIts original $5.6 million contract was expanded by $9.5 million in August when Optum was tasked to manage the state\u2019s transition away from the tech firm CGI, and ensure the state is prepared for open enrollment Nov. 15.\n\nVermont paid CGI $67 million of an $84 million contract, but CGI left significant portions of the exchange unbuilt. CGI also failed to help the state reduce security risks identified by the feds or improve the site\u2019s usability to the terms of its contract.\n\nThe unresolved security issues forced the state to take Vermont Health Connect offline in mid-September, and Optum and the state workers are using the window to perform maintenance and improve the site\u2019s usability, officials have said.\n\nAs of Sept. 3, Vermont has spent more than $100 million of its $171 million federal Affordable Care Act earmark building and supporting the Vermont Health Connect exchange.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cgi, exchange, optum, vermont health connect, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "The total amount Optum can earn is $29.4 million on a contract that currently runs through the end of January 2015.", "title": "State signs $14.3 million expansion of Optum\u2019s exchange contract | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/themes/vtdigger-2013/images/vtd-smaller.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-14T22:00:07+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2014/10/14/state-signs-14-3-million-expansion-optums-exchange-contract/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The total amount Optum can earn is $29.4 million on a contract that currently runs through the end of January 2015.", "title": "State signs $14.3 million expansion of Optum\u2019s exchange contract | VTDigger", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Optum.jpg?fit=137%2C67", "creator": "@true_morgan", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Optum, Vermont Health Connect, contract expansion, exchange, CGI", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont Health Connect", "published_time": "2014-10-14T14:27:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T22:00:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d04\"", "article_summary": "Vermont paid CGI $67 million of an $84 million contract, but CGI left significant portions of the exchange unbuilt.\nOptum\u2019s contract is described by state officials as \u201copen-to-buy\u201d or a \u201ctime and materials\u201d contract, meaning it can be expanded as needed.\nVermont expanded its contract with technology firm Optum by $14.3 million last week, further cementing its role as the company that will likely complete the underperforming Vermont Health Connect exchange.\nState officials have said not to expect those functions to be there when the site is brought back online, sometime before open enrollment, which begins Nov. 15.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Vermont will contract with Optum to build the exchange\u2019s remaining functions, and state officials were not immediately available to comment on the revision."}
