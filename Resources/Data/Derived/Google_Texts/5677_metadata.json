The White House acknowledged the mistake shortly after the speech.\n\nWhite House issues correction to Obama's speech tonight pic.twitter.com/EgIBgVIKBR \u2014 Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) December 7, 2015\n\nAccording to Politico, Obama inadvertently added the word \u201cwaiver\u201d in his comments about Tashfeen Malik, who carried out the California attack with her husband Syed Rizwan Farook last week. Malik came to the United States through the K-1 fianc\u00e9 visa program. The attack killed 14 and left 21 injured Wednesday.\n\nIn his speech, Obama said he \u201cordered the Departments of State and Homeland Security to review the visa waiver program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country.\u201d\n\nObama delivered the speech at 8 p.m. ET from a podium in the Oval Office, reading from a teleprompter. It\u2019s rare for the White House to issue a formal correction to a nationally televised speech.\n\nThe president\u2019s mention of the visa waiver program comes at a time of heightened scrutiny for the program. In recent weeks, members of Congress have proposed changes to the program, which allows citizens from 38 countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa.\n\nSome lawmakers want to prohibit people who have visited Syria and Iraq in the past five years to obtain a waiver. Others have suggested a 30-day waiting period.\n\n>>> Terrorism Fears Fuel Debate Over Government Program That Allows US Travel Without a Visa", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama incorrectly claimed one of the San Bernardino terrorists arrived in the United States under the visa waiver program.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama incorrectly claimed one of the San Bernardino terrorists arrived in the United States under the visa waiver program.", "title": "White House Issues Correction to Obama's Terrorism Speech", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151206_Obama.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-06T23:10:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Ryzucy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama incorrectly claimed one of the San Bernardino terrorists arrived in the United States under the visa waiver program.", "creator": "@RobertBluey", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151206_Obama.jpg"}, "title": "White House Issues Correction to Obama's Terrorism Speech", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-12-06T22:28:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-06T23:10:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "San Bernardino, terrorism, president barack obama, Tashfeen Malik, visa waiver program, Syed Rizwan Farook"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s rare for the White House to issue a formal correction to a nationally televised speech.\nThe president\u2019s mention of the visa waiver program comes at a time of heightened scrutiny for the program.\nThe White House acknowledged the mistake shortly after the speech.\nMalik came to the United States through the K-1 fianc\u00e9 visa program.\nWhite House issues correction to Obama's speech tonight pic.twitter.com/EgIBgVIKBR \u2014 Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) December 7, 2015According to Politico, Obama inadvertently added the word \u201cwaiver\u201d in his comments about Tashfeen Malik, who carried out the California attack with her husband Syed Rizwan Farook last week."}
