Newly seated Texas Rep. Brian Babin didn’t pull punches on his assessment of President Obama, saying the White House executive, without a doubt, “deserves impeachment.”

But he probably won’t get it, Mr. Babin said, The Daily Caller reported.

Still, the majority Republican Senate can at least curb the president’s executive overreaches, he continued.

“[Obama] can no longer hide behind the skirts of Harry Reid,” who is no longer the Senate majority leader, he said, The Daily Caller reported.

Mr. Babin didn’t elaborate on why the president ought to be impeached. But the new lawmaker holds a similar view of House Speaker John Boehner. He was one of the 25 who didn’t vote for Mr. Boehner during the recent House vote for the speaker slot.
