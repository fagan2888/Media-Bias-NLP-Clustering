Liberty Common High School has posted the state’s highest average composite ACT score for the fourth consecutive year.

Though the Fort Collins charter school came up short of its state-record 28.6 composite average set last year, the 27.08 composite average for the school’s 54 seniors is still the state’s best, narrowly edging out the 27.05 compiled by Thomas MacLaren State Charter School of Colorado Springs.

Liberty Common Principal Bob Schaffer, in an e-mail, said the fourth-straight top ranking, “is a function of a solid, coordinated, well-designed, classical curriculum, active and engaged parents, and the best instructors on earth. Clearly, Liberty’s instructional contributions to this extraordinary achievement started in kindergarten.”

Liberty Common was recently ranked Colorado’s best high school by U.S. News and World Report.

Another Fort Collins charter, Ridgeview Classical, ranked 11th in the state with a 24.6 average, while Fossil Ridge High School was 12th at 24.5.

The American College Test is a curriculum- and standards-based educational and career planning tool that assesses students’ academic readiness for college.

Poudre High School’s average was 21.8 and Fort Collins High School’s average was 21.7.

The Poudre School District average was 22.5, 10th-best among Colorado’s 178 school districts, and an improvement from last year’s average of 22.3.

The state average was 20.1, down from 20.3 in 2014.

Approximately 55,379 students, up from 54,512 in 2014, took the exam in Colorado, according to the Colorado Department of Education.

The ACT consists of multiple-choice tests in English, math, reading and science. Statewide, all subject areas were down slightly in 2015, with the exception of science, which increased from 20.4 in 2014 to 20.5 in 2015.

However, PSD’s average in all subject areas either met or exceeded last year’s averages, highlighted by a 0.6 percent increase, to 22.6, in science.
