That could be because people are excited or because they want to be one of the 100 people who will get a year of free meals for being the first people here when they open.\n\nOne of them is Joel Shrimpton, who says the occasion was a good excuse to hang out with friends, even in the cold.\n\nThe store opens at 6 in this already- busy intersection near Campbell and Sunshine.\n\nSo if you have an option of potentially avoiding the area, you may want to consider that this morning-- unless, of course, you want chicken.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- The opening of a new restaurant is expected to make one area of Springfield extra busy today.", "og": {"site_name": "OZARKSFIRST", "description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- The opening of a new restaurant is expected to make one area of Springfield extra busy today.", "title": "Expect Heavy Traffic Thursday Around New Chick-fil-A", "url": "http://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/expect-heavy-traffic-thursday-around-new-chick-fil-a", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/ozarksfirst/photo/2015/12/03/Chick%20Fil%20a%20line_1449147070816_5850789_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1631794217050460}, "google-site-verification": "yajPFA3faS8IXhyhEQy0u8jahhAZ84S-y6tkL5ZMPeU", "keywords": "News,Local News,Morning News", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-12-03T13:49:05+0000", "modified_time": "2015-12-03T13:49:04+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The store opens at 6 in this already- busy intersection near Campbell and Sunshine.\n-- The opening of a new restaurant is expected to make one area of Springfield extra busy today.\nA new Chick fil A store is opening at 6:30 a.m. Thursday near Sunshine and Campbell in Springfield.\nKOLR10's Dana Thayer is there to check out the traffic situation around this busy intersection and talk to some of the people who camped out overnight for a shot at free food for a year.\nAnd as with many of their openings, a large crowd has already been camping as they wait for the doors to open."}
