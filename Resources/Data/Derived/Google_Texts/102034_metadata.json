Watch below as Truth Teller analyzes his remarks and incorporates fact checks aggregated by the Tribune and the Post.\n\nGun restrictions\n\n\"She voted to restrict Second Amendment rights, and she even said that she would 'happily' sign more gun restrictions into law.\" \u2014 TRUE\n\nAsked about the claim, Abbott campaign spokeswoman Amelia Chass\u00e9 pointed to a Texas Tribune article in which Davis discussed her position on gun shows. As a member of the Fort Worth City Council, Davis tried to impose restrictions on gun shows to ensure that people were buying from licensed dealers and would face background checks.\n\nAs governor, Davis said, she would leave it up to the Legislature to decide whether to require background checks at gun shows. She said she would \u201chappily\u201d sign a bill to that effect.\n\n\u201cIf I were governor and a bill came to my desk that provided for background checks at gun shows, I would sign that,\u201d Davis told the Tribune.\n\nDavis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acu\u00f1a said the Democratic candidate supports gun rights and has endorsed an open-carry law. Davis \u201cfully supports the right for honest citizens to own, purchase and sell guns,\u201d Acu\u00f1a said.\n\nOne nation, under God\n\n\"She took action against keeping God in our pledge of allegiance.\" \u2014 FALSE\n\nAsked about this claim, Chass\u00e9 pointed to the minutes from a 2002 meeting of the Fort Worth City Council, of which Davis was a member.\n\nAt the meeting, two city councilmen proposed a resolution \u201cexpressing the sense\u201d that a federal judge\u2019s ruling from days before was \u201cwrongly decided and should be reversed.\u201d That ruling, from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, held that the Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional because of the phrase \u201cone nation under God.\u201d\n\nThe meeting minutes show that Davis supported a motion to table the councilmen\u2019s proposed resolution. An account in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Davis \u201cargued that the council should stick to legitimate city issues and noted that the ruling, later put on hold, didn't even affect Texas.\u201d\n\nAsked about it by the conservative Daily Caller, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas said: \u201cWendy Davis believes the entire Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional and has proudly recited all its words thousands of times.\u201d He noted that, as a state senator, she voted in 2011 for a bill that added the phrase \u201cone state under God\u201d to the pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag during a state flag retirement ceremony.\n\nGiven that Davis\u2019 \u201caction\u201d was against a resolution that would not have had any meaningful effect, and given her voting record as a state lawmaker, we rate Abbott\u2019s comment as false.\n\nPro-life?\n\n\u201cAnd she stood for 13 hours to advocate for abortion even after five months of pregnancy. Of all things, she then said she was \u2018pro-life\u2019 because she wants every child to have a chance in life.\u201d \u2014 TRUE\n\nAfter Davis\u2019 well-known filibuster of a bill that, among other things, outlawed abortion after 20 weeks and imposed stricter requirements on clinics that provided abortions, she drew criticism from abortion opponents for describing herself as \u201cpro-life\u201d at a November campaign stop at the University of Texas at Brownsville, according to the Valley Morning Star.\n\nDavis later clarified her comment, saying, \u201cTo be pro-life doesn\u2019t necessarily end with a woman\u2019s pregnancy, and in Texas, the point I was making was we need to think of life at all stages.\u201d\n\nWe rate this claim as true.\n\nTaxing seniors\n\n\"She didn\u2019t just vote to raise taxes, she specifically targeted seniors and the disabled for higher taxes\u201d \u2014 FALSE\n\n\n\nFor this claim, Chass\u00e9 pointed to several news stories recounting how Davis, on the Fort Worth City Council in 2007, voted against a property tax freeze for seniors and the disabled. She was the only member to oppose the tax freeze, with one other person abstaining.\n\nAccording to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, under the ordinance that Davis voted against, \u201ctax bills would be frozen at the 2007 level for people who are already disabled or over 65.\u201d\n\nBut did Davis actually vote to raise taxes? Asked for a specific example, Chass\u00e9 pointed out that property tax revenue in Fort Worth grew from about $180 million to $325 million from 2001 to 2007. What Chass\u00e9 didn't say is that during the same period, the property tax rate actually fell.\n\nIn fact, Acu\u00f1a said Davis \u201crepeatedly supported budgets that cut the property tax rate\u201d overall, noting that property tax rates in Fort Worth fell from 89.75 cents to 85.5 cents per $100 valuation during her time on city council. City budgets show an expansion of the tax base was responsible for much of the increase in revenue, despite falling rates.\n\nOil and gas\n\n\"She supports Barack Obama\u2019s EPA war on the Texas energy industry.\" \u2014 IT\u2019S COMPLICATED\n\nFor this claim, Chass\u00e9 referred to an audio recording of a 2010 hearing of the Environmental Protection Agency in Houston. Dan Buda, who was then Davis\u2019 chief of staff, spoke in favor of stricter standards the EPA proposed for smog-causing pollutants, including ground-level ozone.\n\n\u201cAs EPA continues to study the issues and implement policies and regulations, Sen. Davis urges you towards the 0.06 parts per million standard for ozone,\u201d Buda said.\n\nThe 0.06 parts per million rule, as reported by The New York Times, was a tighter limit than the 0.075 ppm limit previously imposed by the Bush administration. In its proposal, the EPA estimated that complying with the new standard would cost between $19 billion and $90 billion per year but would be offset by health benefits from improved air quality, which it valued at $13 billion to $100 billion per year.\n\nAcu\u00f1a disputed Abbott\u2019s claim that Davis was antagonistic to the energy industry. During her tenure on the Fort Worth City Council, the city for the first time allowed fracking but limited noise, kept most drilling 600 feet from homes and spelled out duties for local inspectors. Davis told The Texas Tribune in March that she was proud of her work with the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cOn the Fort Worth City Council, we promoted the industry while making sure drilling in urban areas was safe and respected individual property rights and communities,\u201d Davis said in a statement. \u201cWe must continue to support this industry, and its growth, while having common sense disclosure to protect homeowners, communities and first responders.\u201d\n\nGiven Davis\u2019 track record, which includes support for both drilling rights and tighter limits on pollution, Abbott\u2019s claim that she supports a \u201cwar\u201d on the energy industry deserves more scrutiny.\n\nExpanding the Affordable Care Act\n\n\"She\u2019s already said that she would expand Obamacare in Texas.\" \u2014 TRUE\n\nDavis has vocalized her support for expanding Medicaid to provide health insurance for low-income Texans. Medicaid expansion was a tenant of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to provide coverage for people living below 138 percent of the federal poverty line \u2014 many of whom do not qualify for subsidies in the health care law\u2019s insurance marketplace. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the federal government could not require states to expand Medicaid but that states could voluntarily opt into the program. The federal government would fund 100 percent of states\u2019 cost for expanding Medicaid through 2016, gradually decreasing to 90 percent in 2020.\n\nTexas\u2019 Republican leadership has vehemently opposed Medicaid expansion, but some Democratic lawmakers \u2014 including Davis \u2014 have recommended that the state do so, citing Texas\u2019 uniquely high rate of people without health insurance.\n\nAbbott\u2019s claim, therefore, is true, though it merits some clarification.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With help from The Washington Post&rsquo;s&nbsp;Truth Teller, we&rsquo;re analyzing the speeches that Texas&rsquo; candidates for governor gave at their respective state political party conventions.
