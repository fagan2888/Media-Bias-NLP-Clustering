She says she and Cruz are among those still in support of putting the brakes on the law\u2019s funding and implementation because it has \u201cmade health care completely unaffordable\u201d and that families are losing employer-provided health care coverage because of it.\n\nNext week, House leaders will advance a measure that demands a one-year delay in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation, according to the Washington Post. In return, Republicans would agree to help avert the nation\u2019s first-ever debt default sometime next month.\n\n\u201cWhenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it,\u201d Palin writes. \u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse to roll over and play dead. It\u2019s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!\u201d\n\n[Breitbart]\n\n[Washington Post]", "article_metadata": {"description": "In commentary published on Saturday by the conservative website Breitbart.com, former Alaska governor and vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin lets loose against Republicans who she sees as too soft in the fight against President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/09/22/sarah-palin-gop-gutless-for-not-standing-against-obamacare/", "type": "article", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/rtr3f2zi.jpg?w=753", "site_name": "TIME.com", "title": "Sarah Palin: GOP \u2018Gutless\u2019 for Not Standing Against Obamacare | TIME.com"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care, sarah palin,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care, sarah palin,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b90\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it,\u201d Palin writes.\nNext week, House leaders will advance a measure that demands a one-year delay in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation, according to the Washington Post.\nIt\u2019s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!\u201d[Breitbart][Washington Post]\nThe political class in Washington, she writes, is \u201cnothing if not gutless and rudderless.\u201d She also suggests the effects of a government shutdown would not be too harmful if the fight over Obamacare funding leads to that.\nIn return, Republicans would agree to help avert the nation\u2019s first-ever debt default sometime next month."}
