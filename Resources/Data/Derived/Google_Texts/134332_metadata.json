He was right to fret.\n\nHayek\u2019s greatest contribution to economics was to show that society is far more complex than we realize, with little pieces of knowledge dispersed among millions of individuals. \u201cThe curious task of economics,\u201d he famously wrote in \u201cThe Fatal Conceit,\u201d which he published in 1988, \u201cis to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.\u201d\n\nRecent government interventions suggest that politicians and bureaucrats today think they can design just about anything. This ignorance has backfired, as it always does, bringing with it what economists call \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Post Keywords", "og": {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/10/13/f-a-hayek-and-the-pretense-of-knowledge/", "site_name": "Washington Post", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article", "title": "F.A.
