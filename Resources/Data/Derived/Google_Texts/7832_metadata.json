We don\u2019t pay for quality or appropriate care. Value-based payment identifies services that stress quality, patient satisfaction and cost indicators that reward providers for service to patients.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Valence research, payment models fall on a continuum of care, ranging from FFS and Patient-Centered Medical Homes to full capitation and provider-sponsored plans. Chief financial officers \u201cnavigating significant changes in how they conduct business and deliver care,\u201d must determine the best value-based care model for their healthcare organization.\n\n\u201cAll payment models have fans and critics,\u201d Guterman said. \u201cAll have upsides and downsides. Many say the best may be a combination of payment methods, depending on the provider and population.\u201d\n\n[Also: What CFOs think about revenue cycle]\n\nAccording to Landman, a specialty provider might find bundled payments for episodic care something at which they would excel, while a regional health system that has gained experience with high-spend patients might think about capitation.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Medicare Shared Savings, or BPs, they are built on a FFS chassis,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though the physician or hospital is paid FFS, at the end of the year there\u2019s a reconciliation against historical benchmarks. If spending is less, the savings is split between CMS [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] and the provider. It works the same way on the commercial side.\u201d\n\nGuterman said staff-model HMOs, such as Kaiser-Permanente, are better equipped to take risks because they\u2019re in charge. \u201cKaiser owns their hospitals. Their patients are part of their system. If you\u2019re a solo physician in a fragmented health system, you don\u2019t have control where your patients go and that could generate costs you have no control over.\u201d\n\nLandman predicts a growing number of smaller community hospitals will form collaboratives to share patient data, best practices and compete as a network.\n\n\u201cThey gain scale and access to participate in a capitated or BP system,\u201d he noted, and said he tells small hospital CFOs there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t be successful under alternate payment systems.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cStart experimenting with care coordination and population health,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for the hospital and employees because you\u2019re spending less and gaining expertise in techniques to roll out to a broader population.\u201d\n\nRegardless what payment model you choose, Guterman said the CFO and medical staff should be in agreement about the approach.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s best for patients is what results in better financial outcomes for organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cDo well by doing good.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospitals-mull-multiple-models-value-based-payments", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/billing-statement-feature_7.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Chief financial officers must determine the best value-based care model for their healthcare organization, experts say.", "title": "Hospitals mull multiple models for value-based payments"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/billing-statement-feature_7.gif"}, "title": "Hospitals mull multiple models for value-based payments", "description": "Chief financial officers must determine the best value-based care model for their healthcare organization, experts say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Jim Landman, director of healthcare finance policy, perspectives and analysis at the Healthcare Financial Management Association in Westchester, Ill., predicts that we will indeed see a time when fee-for-service \u00a0is significantly reduced.&#13; \u201cIn finance, most people are jazzed up about the potential for value-based payment to make a better healthcare system,\u201d he said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn finance, most people are jazzed up about the potential for value-based payment to make a better healthcare system,\u201d he said.\nChief financial officers must determine the best value-based care model for their healthcare organization, experts say.\nChief financial officers \u201cnavigating significant changes in how they conduct business and deliver care,\u201d must determine the best value-based care model for their healthcare organization.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s best for patients is what results in better financial outcomes for organizations,\u201d he said.\nIf spending is less, the savings is split between CMS [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] and the provider."}
