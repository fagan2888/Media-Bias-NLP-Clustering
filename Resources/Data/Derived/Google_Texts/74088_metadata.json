He had been in a hospice for less than a week. He was 66.\n\nRELATED: In desperate move for medical marijuana, a former Texas football player finds hope\n\n\u201cIt was like Bobby, his best friend, gave him permission to die,\u201d Greg\u2019s wife, Deb, said this week. \u201cI guess all great athletes are fighters. He did not want to give up.\u201d\n\nPloetz was a popular long-time artist, art teacher and football coach in the Fort Worth area. His death came a year after Deb, hoping marijuana products could be openly used in his treatment, brought him to the Denver area for several months in 2014. Eventually, in part because of mixed messages and disputes over whether marijuana oils could be administered in state-monitored facilities, including at a memory-care assisted-living home in suburban Denver, Deb took Greg back to Texas. They moved on to Arkansas in January.\n\nDeb said that being able to use marijuana oils in his treatment \u201cwouldn\u2019t have prolonged his life, but would have kept him from being so miserable. That\u2019s a topic that needs to be studied. I truly believe it calmed him.\u201d\n\nPloetz\u2019s brain was donated to Boston University. In a few months, word will come about whether he also suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated blows to the head.\n\nListed at 5-foot-10 and 205 pounds, small for a defensive tackle even in his era, Ploetz was taking painting classes when starting for the Longhorns and was named UT\u2019s top art student as a senior. There never was any question about his toughness; he played in the 1969 Texas-Arkansas showdown for the national title with a cracked bone in his ankle.\n\nCTE can be diagnosed only after death, and it has has been linked to concussions and suicides of several athletes, including former NFL players Dave Duerson and Junior Seau. Most recently, an autopsy showed that former NHL player Steve Montador, whose cause of death in February hasn\u2019t been released, had widespread CTE.\n\nA memorial service for Ploetz \u2014 a celebration of life \u2014 will be held on May 24 in Fort Worth. His former Longhorn teammates are organizing a similar gathering to take place in Austin, perhaps on May 30.\n\nA Ploetz teammate from that era, Dallas attorney Julius Whittier, who was Texas\u2019 first African-American letterman in football, has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s. In October, he filed a $50 million class-action lawsuit against the NCAA on behalf of players who didn\u2019t make the NFL, but are suffering from brain injuries.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Greg Ploetz, former Texas football player, dies at age 66", "title": "Greg Ploetz, former Texas football player, dies at age 66", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/14/greg-ploetz-former-texas-football-player-dies-at-age-66/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140531__20140601_C1_SP01FBCPLOETZp1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140531__20140601_C1_SP01FBCPLOETZp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-14T15:05:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T07:42:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Colorado"}, "article_summary": "Three weeks ago, when it happened again, his former Texas Longhorns football teammate, former fullback Bobby Callison, was visiting Ploetz in Little Rock, Ark.\nRELATED: In desperate move for medical marijuana, a former Texas football player finds hope\u201cIt was like Bobby, his best friend, gave him permission to die,\u201d Greg\u2019s wife, Deb, said this week.\nA Ploetz teammate from that era, Dallas attorney Julius Whittier, who was Texas\u2019 first African-American letterman in football, has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\nGreg Ploetz, for several years confused and weakened by mixed dementia and frontal lobe damage, fell often.\nHe did not want to give up.\u201dPloetz was a popular long-time artist, art teacher and football coach in the Fort Worth area."}
