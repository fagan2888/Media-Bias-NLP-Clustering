But when a political doctrine evolves, in essence, into a religious dogma\u2014blind and deaf to reason, to evidence, and to the real-world consequences of its agendas\u2014it invariably results in moral illiteracy. Among the most committed exponents of such a political doctrine are the many Israel-hating leftists who insist, against all evidence to the contrary, that if not for the depredations of Israeli Jews, the Palestinian people would now be living peacefully and prosperously in an idyllic homeland of their own. Seventy-seven-year-old activist Dorothy Zellner offers us a most revealing window into the mindset of these individuals.\n\nZellner is a co-founder of Jews Say No, an organization that condemns \u201cIsrael\u2019s oppression of the Palestinian people.\u201d She once described a 2002 Israeli military response to a massive wave of Palestinian terrorism in the West Bank, as a \u201chorrible Israeli invasion.\u201d Without even mentioning the many suicide bombings and murders that preceded Israel's action, Zellner instead recalled that, during a visit to Israel later in 2002, she had been moved to tears by the sight of \u201cthe barbed wire on the wall, and the guard tower on top of the wall.\u201d These \u201cimages flooded back to me from World War II,\u201d she lamented, implying that modern-day Israelis reminded her of Hitler-era Nazis.\n\nIn 2009 Zellner signed a petition imploring members of the Israeli Defense Forces to stop the \u201catrocities,\u201d \u201cwar crimes,\u201d and \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d that they were allegedly perpetrating \u201cagainst the people of Gaza.\u201d The source of Zellner's angst, in this case, was Operation Cast Lead\u2014another Israeli military response to a relentless barrage of rockets and mortars that Hamas-affiliated terrorists in Gaza had been launching into southern Israel. Again turning a blind eye to those provocations, Zellner and her co-signers exhorted IDF soldiers to defy the \u201cflagrantly illegal orders\u201d of their commanders. In short, according to Zellner's political religion, the victims of the \u201catrocities\u201d and \u201cwar cimes\u201d in this case were the members of an organization\u2014Hamas\u2014whose founding charter openly condemns \u201cthe Nazism of the Jews,\u201d calls jihad \u201can individual duty binding on every Muslim,\u201d and demands the fulfillment of the Koranic scripture exhorting Muslims to \u201ccome on and kill\u201d every last Jew on earth. And of course the villains were \u2026 yes, the Jews.\n\nWhen Israel in July 2014 initiated yet another military incursion designed to eliminate Hamas's stockpiles of armaments, destroy its vast network of secret subterranean tunnels, and put an end to its renewed firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel, Zellner dismissed the notion that the Israeli action was in any way necessary. \u201cWe don\u2019t buy it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is blaming the victim to the extreme.\u201d You read that correctly: Zellner's political religion requires her to believe that Hamas is Israel's \u201cvictim.\u201d\n\nToday Zellner supports the Boycott, Divestment, & Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to isolate Israel politically and cripple its economy. She contends that the \u201croot cause\u201d of \u201call the death and destruction\u201d in Israel and the Palestinian territories \u201cisn\u2019t Hamas,\u201d but rather, \u201cthe injustice of one group controlling the lives and future of another group.\u201d \u201cAs long as Israel occupies Palestine,\u201d Zellner elaborates, \u201cand as long as Palestinians resist (which, according to International human rights law, they have the right to do), confrontations and death will result. The root cause is the occupation, which itself flows from the previous dispossession of Palestinians from the land they inhabited for generations.\u201d\n\nWhen asked in a 2014 interview whether Israel even has \u201ca right to exist as a Jewish state,\u201d Zellner was blunt: \u201cMy answer is I do not think that states that privilege one group over another are viable states.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Zellner's contempt for Israel is mirrored by her abhorrence for the irredeemably \u201cracist society\u201d of the United States, where, for instance, she says that \u201cvoter ID laws and other impediments were invented\u201d not to ensure the integrity of elections, but to prevent blacks from casting their ballots. And when black teenager Michael Brown was infamously killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri last August, Zellner didn't bother to wait for the facts of the case to become clear before shooting her mouth off. Instead she quickly and confidently announced that the killing was just \u201canother incident of violent racism [by police] in our country\u201d; \u201cone more example of the basic inequality that still exists in the U.S., where communities of color are still unrepresented in their police departments or their city governments and live amidst poverty and neglect\u201d; and further evidence that America's intransigent bigotry had bred \u201can unequal criminal-justice system that retains more than two million people, mostly Black and Brown, in prison.\u201d The \u201croot cause\u201d of what occurred in Ferguson, Zellner concluded, was \u201ca basically flawed economic and social system that sanctions exploitation and needs racism and division to survive.\u201d\n\nObviously, the actual facts of the Ferguson case don't matter one bit to Dorothy Zellner\u2014just as the facts of Palestinian terrorism and Jew-hatred are entirely meaningless to her. Though she identifies herself as a \u201c100 percent atheist,\u201d Zellner is in fact a woman of deep and unshakable faith \u2026 faith in the ever-enduring leftist narrative of oppressor-vs.-oppressed, victimizer-vs-victim. Leftism is her religion, and she's never going to give it up.
