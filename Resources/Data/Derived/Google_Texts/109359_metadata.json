Susan is also an avid investigative researcher having honed her skills in the legal profession. Susan\u2019s website, SusanKnowles.com , covers articles she has written on an array of topics, including governmental interference of U.S. Constitutional rights, military and veterans\u2019 issues, issues pertaining to California from the viewpoint of a conservative living in a Blue State, and other hot topics in the news. Susan\u2019s book, a political fiction, is entitled \u201c Freedom\u2019s Fight: A Call to Remember ,\u201d and is available on Amazon.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to vote Thursday on proposed net neutrality regulations. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and chairman of the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler asking him to temporarily postpone the vote.\n\nIn that letter, Chaffetz questioned whether the FCC has been \u201cindependent, fair and transparent\u201d in developing the rules to protect content on the Internet. Chaffetz expressed his belief that the process was \u201cconducted without using many of the tools at the chairman\u2019s disposal to ensure transparency and public review.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chaffetz sought to have Wheeler release the 332-page draft order that was made available to four other commissioners almost three weeks ago. He also requested that Wheeler appear before a House Oversight hearing on Wednesday ahead of the Thursday vote.\n\nIn addition to Chaffetz\u2019s appeal to Wheeler, two other FCC commissioners, Ajit Pai and Michael O\u2019Reilly, asked for a release of the proposal to the public and for a postponement of the Thursday vote. They are also seeking a 30-day waiting period to allow the public to respond with comment to the proposal and asked that Wheeler reconsider his decision about testifying at the House Oversight hearing.\n\nThe public has not been given any information about the FCC\u2019s proposal except that Wheeler drafted the new rules based on both the Communications Act of 1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n\nIt has been reported that Wheeler initially had a different plan but changed his strategy to label the Internet as a utility under Title II of the Communications Act. Many have wondered if President Barack Obama influenced Wheeler\u2019s decision.\n\nThis administration continues to claim transparency while at the same time it surreptitiously passes major laws, such as the Affordable Care Act, without releasing pertinent information to the public prior to enactment.\n\nAs you may recall, it was Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who said before Obamacare was passed \u201cWe have to pass the [health care] bill so that you can find out what\u2019s in it\u2026\u201d\n\nWe all now know \u201cmostly\u201d what\u2019s in Obamacare and many are unhappy with what they have discovered, albeit too late. While many had hoped that the current GOP controlled majority of Congress would swiftly repeal Obamacare, it appears that this may not prove to be an easy task.\n\nMany Americans were critical of Obama\u2019s quick actions to sign Obamacare into law. Some are now concerned about the FCC\u2019s decision to vote on the bill before public involvement.\n\nObama hurriedly signed his approximately 11,000 page health care bill into law with very little time for public scrutiny. It was only after the law was signed that many began to see that promises made by the administration were not going to be kept.\n\nObama promised on numerous occasions before his health care bill was enacted that \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\u201d\n\nFor many, this certainly has not been the case and it has been forecasted that a number of employers will drop their healthcare plans and replace them with Obamacare. Some doctors are also beginning to refuse to accept Obamacare patients.\n\nIt would appear that we could be headed down this administration\u2019s all too familiar path should we allow the FCC\u2019s proposal to be voted on this week before the draft-order has even been released to the public.\n\nWhether you are for or against net neutrality, there is no reason why the FCC\u2019s new proposal has to be hastily passed without scrutiny from the American public. We don\u2019t need to pass another law with wide-sweeping implications before knowing what\u2019s in it and what impact it will have.\n\nChances are, based upon past lessons learned after Obamacare became law, what some may think is in the proposed net neutrality draft-order may not be the case. We can\u2019t afford to be \u201csurprised\u201d after the fact again.\n\nAlso, if true that Obama influenced Wheeler\u2019s decision to treat the Internet like a utility, then what impact will classifying it as a utility have on the cost of doing business on the Internet and on your First Amendment rights should the bill pass? If we don\u2019t know the answers to these questions, then these issues must be discussed in an open forum.\n\nWe all recall the speculation surrounding U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 decision in favor of Obamacare. It was believed by many that Roberts was pressured by the Obama administration to change his original decision to vote against the passage of Obamacare.\n\nAlthough, it has never been proven that the administration in any way influenced Roberts\u2019 decision, it makes one pause and consider how important it is to ensure that this is not occurring in the current FCC net neutrality proposal.\n\nWe must act as a nation to ensure that any decision garnered by the FCC or other government entities are independent decisions reached only after public review.\n\nThere are still too many unanswered questions and concerns. This is exactly why it is necessary to make the public fully aware of the advantages and disadvantages of net neutrality before final actions are taken by the FCC.\n\nIt is imperative that the public have full access to the FCC proposal and participate in the decision-making process before blindly allowing the FCC to mandate our future on the important issue of Internet regulation.\n\nIt may also turn out after closer examination, that current law already exists on the books to sufficiently address any issues without the need for further government intrusion.\n\nContact your Congress member today and let them know that you support the release of the FCC\u2019s proposal and a public discussion before any vote is taken.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
