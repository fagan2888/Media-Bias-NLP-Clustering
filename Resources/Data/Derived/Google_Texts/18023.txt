Long-time foes China and Japan have accused each other of being many things over the years, but this may be the first time they have compared each other to an evil wizard from a children’s book.

Ambassadors for the Asian neighbors in the UK invoked Lord Voldemort, the arch villain of J.K. Rowling’s best-selling Harry Potter series, in the latest spat between the two countries, which was sparked by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s recent visit to a controversial war shrine.

Writing in the British newspaper, The Telegraph, last week, Beijing’s envoy to London, Liu Xiaoming, said: “If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation’s soul.”

As Harry Potter fans will remember, Voldemort created seven horcruxes to hold fragments of his soul in order to achieve immortality. To kill him, all seven horcruxes must be destroyed.

Japan’s ambassador to the UK, Keiichi Hayashi, responded in kind in the same newspaper and compared Beijing to the grotesque-looking wizard.

“East Asia is now at a crossroads. There are two paths open to China,” he wrote.

“One is to seek dialogue, and abide by the rule of law. The other is to play the role of Voldemort in the region by letting loose the evil of an arms race and escalation of tensions, although Japan will not escalate the situation from its side.
