But it's a nice start.\n\nThe Times story mixes fresh reporting -- including the scene at Bush's church and emailed responses to questions by the former governor -- with excellent research on what Bush has said in the past about his religion:\n\nMany of his priorities during his two terms as governor of Florida aligned with those of the Catholic Church -- including his extraordinary, and unsuccessful, effort to force a hospital to keep Terri Schiavo on life support, as well as less well-known, and also unsuccessful, efforts to appoint a guardian for the fetus of a developmentally disabled rape victim and to prevent a 13-year-old girl from having an abortion. He even, during his first year in office in 1999, signed a law creating a \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plate.\n\nHe differed from his church, significantly and openly, over capital punishment; the state executed 21 prisoners on his watch, the most under any Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. But he has won praise from Catholic officials for his welcoming tone toward immigrants and his relatively centrist positions on education \u2014 two issues in which he is at odds with the right wing of his party.\n\n\u201cAs a public leader, one\u2019s faith should guide you,\u201d Mr. Bush said in Italy in 2009, explaining his attitude about the relationship between religion and politics at a conference associated with Communion and Liberation, a conservative Catholic lay movement.\n\nAlong with Bush's own words, the newspaper provides insight from Catholic clergy familiar with him -- from the priest who officiated at his wedding to Florida bishops who recall his time as governor:\n\nThe bishops who led Florida\u2019s seven Catholic dioceses met annually with Mr. Bush, often opening their gatherings with prayer. Each year, the bishops would try to convince Mr. Bush that the death penalty should be ended in Florida, and each year they failed.\n\n\u201cAnybody could see he was a devout Catholic \u2014 he was new to the Catholic faith and took his faith seriously,\u201d said Bishop John H. Ricard, who oversaw the Pensacola-Tallahassee Diocese when Mr. Bush was governor. \u201cHe approached the whole thing, especially the death penalty, with seriousness and respect, but we just agreed we would disagree. We were firm in our position, but I think he was sincere about his.\u201d\n\nBut there is one significant journalism hole here. I wish that the Times had made clearer that the church hierarchy views the death penalty differently than, say, abortion or euthanasia. As I understand it, there are two levels of church doctrine and authority here. While recent popes have stated their opposition to the death penalty, as practiced in most modern societies, a Catholic's position on capital punishment is more of a matter of individual conscience. Opposition to abortion, however, is a matter of firmly stated doctrine. Thus, a Catholic politician who publicly opposes church teachings on abortion might be denied Holy Communion.\n\nThat point aside, this story is must reading for anyone interested in faith's role in Jeb Bush's life and political career.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If this is Michael Paulson's last hurrah on the Godbeat,\u00a0it's a good one.\r\n\r\nLast week, we lamented\u00a0the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0religion writer's move to the \r\ntheater beat.\r\n\r\nThis week, we were reminded why we're going to miss Paulson's expertise and \r\nstorytelling talents on religion news.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPaulson's\u00a02,000-word story on the Catholic faith of former Florida Gov.
