Even after America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam ended, the bans remained in place at many schools, with student and faculty critics using issues such as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d to justify the continuation. Harvard only welcomed ROTC back on campus in 2012.\n\nWhen Garland arrived at Harvard in 1970, ROTC had already been banned for a year. But in 1973, Harvard University President Derek Bok called for ending the ban, reigniting the issue. The New American Movement (NAM), a student socialist group, launched a petition drive in opposition to Bok\u2019s proposal and collected over 2,500 signatures. The group also asked CHUL to conduct a campuswide vote on the matter, with the likely expectation that the vote among students would be overwhelmingly hostile to welcoming back ROTC.\n\nGarland soon became indirectly involved in the matter: He was the member of CHUL who put forward the potential referendum for consideration, and at the time he said the odds were \u201cpretty good\u201d that CHUL would agree to hold it.\n\nThe vote was never held, though. Instead, Harvard administrators pledged that ROTC\u2019s return was not being seriously considered, and CHUL agreed to drop the matter as long as Harvard agreed to provide a warning if ending the ROTC ban was considered in the future.\n\nGarland\u2019s own opinion throughout the situation remains unclear. The Boston Globe cites a \u201cperson familiar with the judge\u2019s thinking\u201d to say that Garland had no settled view on the campus ROTC question, but that certainly won\u2019t stop speculation that he may have broadly supported the anti-ROTC push. The referendum that NAM was pushing, and that Garland officially proposed, was clearly expected to show a strong rejection of ROTC and was intended to pressure Harvard against allowing the military back, and the vote was only canceled after Garland and the rest of CHUL received strong assurances that ROTC was in no danger of returning.\n\nBut much like with Garland\u2019s judicial record, which is lacking in strongly-worded rulings on contentious issues, the evidence of Garland\u2019s personal views is very limited.\n\nGarland himself hasn\u2019t commented on the matter, reflecting the traditional refusal of Supreme Court nominees to grant media interviews. The only way for him to weigh in would likely be for Republicans to hold confirmation hearings in the Senate. Thus far, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed not to do so, but some moderate Republicans have already suggested Garland\u2019s nomination should be considered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland is facing allegations he is hostile to the military, after The Boston Globe unearthed details of his involvement", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "description": "Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland is facing allegations he is hostile to the military, after The Boston Globe unearthed details of his involvement", "title": "Merrick Garland's College Record May Show Anti-Military Bent", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.trunews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-16T160621Z_1_LYNXNPEC2F1E8_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-GARLAND.jpg", "height": 541}, "updated_time": "2016-03-21T08:14:23-04:00", "url": "http://www.trunews.com/merrick-garlands-college-record-may-show-anti-military-bent/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 107546629279454, "app_id": 107546629279454}, "msvalidate.01": "F6797679D7E81DB3F5C960F7552EF745", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/trunews", "section": "Featured", "tag": "ticker", "published_time": "2016-03-21T07:30:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T08:14:23-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "But much like with Garland\u2019s judicial record, which is lacking in strongly-worded rulings on contentious issues, the evidence of Garland\u2019s personal views is very limited.\nOpposition to the Vietnam War resulted in many schools, including Harvard, banning ROTC from campus.\nThe only way for him to weigh in would likely be for Republicans to hold confirmation hearings in the Senate.\nWhen Garland arrived at Harvard in 1970, ROTC had already been banned for a year.\nGarland himself hasn\u2019t commented on the matter, reflecting the traditional refusal of Supreme Court nominees to grant media interviews."}
