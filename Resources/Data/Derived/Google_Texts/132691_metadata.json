Also, next month bishops will gather in Rome for a synod devoted to church teachings on the family.\n\nThe US Conference of Bishops has been among the staunchest advocates for excluding gays from marriage, citing the Church\u2019s view that even civil marriage should be reserved for heterosexual couples.\n\nBut now that the Supreme Court has established the right marriage as equally guaranteed by the Constitution for gays and straights, much of the conservative criticism has focused on fears that the religious liberty of Catholics and others who see it as contrary to God\u2019s will will be compromised as Americsn courts interpret the ruling in various settings, from the workplace to the awarding of government grants.\n\nAfter his welcome at the White House, the pope was headed to a private prayer service with bishops from America\u2019s 195 dioceses, including Bishop Kevin Farrell of Dallas. In an interview yesterday, Farrell told me the key to hashing out differences over religious liberty is for all sides to talk calmly to each other, instead of \u201cthe shouting across the TV set\u201d that more typically passes for dialogue in today\u2019s political environment.\n\nHe said Catholics believe that religious liberty means more than the right to worship as one pleased, but also to live according to tenets of whatever faith one chooses.\n\nThat\u2019s created a tension as citizens, businesses and even government officials have increasingly cited religious beliefs as reasons to exempt themselves from laws designed to protect the rights of others.\n\nThe pope did not specifically cite these tensions in his brief remarks, but underscored the priority his church places on the issue.\n\nHere is what the Pope said this morning:", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2JpemJlYXRibG9nLmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMTUvMDkvcG9wZS1mcmFuY2lzLXByYWlzZXMtb2JhbWFzLWFncmVzc2l2ZS1lcGEtYWdlbmRhLXdhcm5zLWhpbS1vbi1yZWxpZ2lvdXMtbGliZXJ0eS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Michael A.
