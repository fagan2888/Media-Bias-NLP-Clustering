I was very proud of the many, many young people working for me, volunteering for me, voting, caucusing for me in Iowa, and the ones I have here in New Hampshire. I\u2019m just so impressed with\u2014so that\u2019s a net good no matter what. I do think that we have an obligation to keep people focused on what\u2019s at stake in this election, and you got close to saying it, Chris. We can\u2019t let the Republicans rip away the progress we\u2019ve made. We can\u2019t let them go back to trickle-down economics, repeal the Affordable Care Act. We can\u2019t let them stack the Supreme Court for another generation against common sense kind of changes that we need.\n\nShe continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to the middle, we\u2019ve got to get back to the big center, we\u2019ve got to get back to solving problems. That\u2019s how we make progress in America. I am proud to be in a line of Democratic presidents who just got in there and fought it out, who got civil rights, who got an economy producing high incomes, who got, finally, the Affordable Care Act, something we\u2019ve been fighting for since Harry Truman. I know how hard this is and I totally appreciate how exciting it can be to be involved in a campaign that really just puts out these great big ideas. But I want folks to stop and think, no matter what age you are, okay, we agree on getting the economy going. We agree on raising incomes. We agree on combating climate change. We agree on universal coverage. Who has the track record? Who\u2019s gotten the results? Who can actually produce the kind of change you want for yourself and your family and for our country? So I\u2019m very energized about this because I like a contest of ideas. That\u2019s what politics should be. We\u2019re going to be talking about and arguing about issues on our side. They\u2019re going to keep insulting each other on the Republican side. But the goal for any sensible American has to be, do not turn the White House over to the Republicans in November. Do not turn the Supreme Court further over to their nominees. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary: No 'Sensible American' Wants to Turn the White House Over to a Republican", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hillary: No 'Sensible American' Wants to Turn the White House Over to a Republican", "title": "Hillary: No 'Sensible American' Wants to Turn the White House Over to a Republican - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/hillary.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/02/hillary-we-have-to-get-back-to-the-center/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary: No 'Sensible American' Wants to Turn the White House Over to a Republican", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/hillary.jpg", "title": "Hillary: No 'Sensible American' Wants to Turn the White House Over to a Republican - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,Hillary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2016-02-02T12:41:45-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4209\"", "article_summary": "But the goal for any sensible American has to be, do not turn the White House over to the Republicans in November.\nWe can\u2019t let them stack the Supreme Court for another generation against common sense kind of changes that we need.\nWe can\u2019t let them go back to trickle-down economics, repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nWe can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\nWe can\u2019t let the Republicans rip away the progress we\u2019ve made."}
