A day after Hrithik Roshan broke the news about Sussanne's decision to end their 13-year-long marriage, Sussanne Roshan has spoken to the media and issued an official statement on the status of her marriage.

In her massage Sussanne says, "We are two individuals who respect and care for each other and have made our own individual choices".

"We are parents to two wonderful kids and our responsibility remains to protect and take care of them. Nothing can change that," adds Sussanne.

"Thank you for your warmth and concern for both of us and the family".

Sussanne and Hrithik have known each other for the last 17 years and got married in 2000 after the mega success of Hrithik Roshan's Kaho Na Pyaar Hai.
