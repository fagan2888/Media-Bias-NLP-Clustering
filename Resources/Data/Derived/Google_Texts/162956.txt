Duck Dynasty’s Robertson family is teaming with Mossberg to launch a line of shotguns, .22 rifles, and a pistol.

The line of guns is branded Duck Commander, and includes nine different shotguns, two semi-automatic rifles and a semi-automatic pistol.

According to CNN Money, the “guns will come in a ‘waterfowl pattern’ camouflage design.”

The Duck Commander shotguns will be complimented by “military-style” .22 rifles and a AR-15-based .22 pistol.

The .22 rifle is on an AR-15 frame and is a Duck Commander version of the Mossberg International 715T rifle. CNN Money described it as having “some of the features of an ‘assault rifle.'”

Mossberg’s motto is, “Built Rugged. Proudly American.” Sounds like a perfect fit for the Robertson family.
