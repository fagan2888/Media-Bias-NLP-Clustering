Mattel last week said international were up 9%, compared with a rise of 3% in North America.\n\n\u201cThe two toughest areas around the world I\u2019d say from a consumer sentiment continue to be Australia and the U.S.,\u201d Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said on Monday\u2019s conference call to discuss a 17% jump in profit. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing enthusiasm in Latin America and major areas of Europe particularly in Russia and Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe indicators suggest that sales from outside of the U.S. can offset weak domestic demand heading into the holidays, the most critical time of the year for toy makers, when they ring up more than 50% of their sales.\n\nThe U.S. will be the closest watched market, given it is the largest and most-profitable for toy makers, and retailers are approaching the period with caution, mimicking the sentiment in the broader economy. Forecasts for the November and December holiday season suggest sales growth of 2.4% below last year\u2019s 3%, according to ShopperTrak estimates.\n\nMattel\n\nHasbro and Mattel have spent more than a year planning for the 2013 holidays, and have several toys, like Hasbro\u2019s latest Elmo doll that gives hugs and Mattel\u2019s Barbie Dreamhouse to try to give a boost to the iconic doll, dotting various hot lists from retailers and others. Now it\u2019s time to execute during the fiercely competitive time and make sure their toys are on shelves and that people are buying them.\n\nHasbro\u2019s shares are up Monday in a bit of a relief rally following better than expected results, as sales for its games business rose 6% due to its Magic: The Gathering franchise, while My Little Ponies helped girls toys rise 29%.\n\nBoys toys continued to struggle, with sales down 17%, as the Marvel-branded items continue to have a hard time topping last year\u2019s success from toys tied to The Avengers movie from last year.\n\nNeedham & Co. analsyst Sean McGowan thinks the boys business is bound to turn around. Hasbro will be making toys for movies like Transformers and Spider-Man in 2014 and Star Wars the year after that. Monday\u2019s results, where the results of the games business was the key surprise, \u201cgives you greater confidence that you don\u2019t have to wait for things to get better,\u201d Mr. McGowan said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "With American consumers still showing caution leading into the holiday season, toy makers can draw optimism from strong demand in emerging markets", "title": "The Good News for U.S. Toy Makers is All Overseas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/21/the-good-news-for-u-s-toy-makers-is-all-overseas/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AF901_05TW5_G_20131004163535.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "The Good News for U.S. Toy Makers is All Overseas", "description": "With American consumers still showing caution leading into the holiday season, toy makers can draw optimism from strong demand in emerging markets", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Paul Ziobro", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "With American consumers still showing caution leading into the holiday season, toy makers can draw optimism from strong demand in emerging markets", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-21T17:14:43-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/21/the-good-news-for-u-s-toy-makers-is-all-overseas/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-2676", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "With American consumers still showing caution leading into the holiday season, toy makers can draw optimism from strong demand in emerging markets", "title": "The Good News for U.S. Toy Makers is All Overseas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/21/the-good-news-for-u-s-toy-makers-is-all-overseas/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AF901_05TW5_G_20131004163535.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-2676", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-21T17:15:08-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd965a\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. will be the closest watched market, given it is the largest and most-profitable for toy makers, and retailers are approaching the period with caution, mimicking the sentiment in the broader economy.\nParamount/EverettToy makers have some good news to counter concerns about holiday sales in the U.S.: International consumers.\nForecasts for the November and December holiday season suggest sales growth of 2.4% below last year\u2019s 3%, according to ShopperTrak estimates.\nHasbro will be making toys for movies like Transformers and Spider-Man in 2014 and Star Wars the year after that.\nMattel last week said international were up 9%, compared with a rise of 3% in North America."}
