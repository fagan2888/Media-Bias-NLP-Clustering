It closed over thirty years ago. Now, the Wechsler Foundation is trying to transform it into a community center to unveil the rich history that lies inside.\n\n\"Pull out that history and show them that we are still here. We are trying to bring awareness that we are still here, trying to come together to reconstruct this beautiful building,\" says Joanne Hooper, Wechsler Foundation board member.\n\nInside the school is a museum filled with graduation composites, class achievements, and black history milestones. That's only a small part of the school. The rest still needs restoration, but the foundation can't come up with the money on their own.\n\n\"We are having a fundraiser. We have applied to grants. We have asked supervisors and council if they could possibly donate us some funding to help us renovate this building,\" says Hooper. \"We need a lot, a lot of work done, electrical as well as structural. We need all of the community to come together.\"\n\nThe foundation has been able to secure some funding for the project from the supervisors, Young Foundation, and tourism committee, but they are still in need of more funding to achieve the overall goal.\n\n\"We would like it be a building where the community can come together, have resources, use it for young people to have programs, social activities so that we can come together and be a community,\" says Hooper.\n\nTo raise awareness about African-American history, the foundation has put together a \"hallowed grounds\" tour, stopping at seven historic sites in Meridian.\n\n\"We are going to tour these buildings and these places so that people can be aware of all our great African-American history,\" says Hooper.\n\nThe historic sites toured were Wechsler, Baptist Seminary, Council of Organizations, First Union Baptist Church, James Chaney Gravesite, Fielder & Brooks, and Carnegie Branch Library.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Wechsler Foundation is putting forth effort to renovate the Wechsler School into a community center.", "language": "english", "author": "Lindsey Jennings", "og": {"description": "The Wechsler Foundation is putting forth effort to renovate the Wechsler School into a community center.", "title": "Wechsler Foundation Moving Forward with Restoration Effort", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Wechsler-Foundation-Moving-Forward-with-Restoration-Effort-368721541.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E71/70C/E7170C133D2C4FD8890988FDA198C1DF", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/802/255/8022557C1A0C47D2A40BF69F4F9314F5.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The Wechsler Foundation is putting forth effort to renovate the Wechsler School into a community center.", "title": "Wechsler Foundation Moving Forward with Restoration Effort", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Wechsler-Foundation-Moving-Forward-with-Restoration-Effort-368721541.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/wechsler3.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Wechsler Foundation Moving Forward with Restoration Effort", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wechsler Foundation Moving Forward with"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07ff\"", "article_summary": "Now, the Wechsler Foundation is trying to transform it into a community center to unveil the rich history that lies inside.\nThe Wechsler School was the first publicly-funded, brick school for African-Americans in Mississippi.\nWe are trying to bring awareness that we are still here, trying to come together to reconstruct this beautiful building,\" says Joanne Hooper, Wechsler Foundation board member.\nThe rest still needs restoration, but the foundation can't come up with the money on their own.\nTo raise awareness about African-American history, the foundation has put together a \"hallowed grounds\" tour, stopping at seven historic sites in Meridian."}
