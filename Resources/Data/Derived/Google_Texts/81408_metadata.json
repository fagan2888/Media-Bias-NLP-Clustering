Beyond the championship trophy and maybe some added sales of school gear, exactly what kind of spoils the Ohio State victors will enjoy is hard to say.\n\nStill, Ohio State and other schools in the five major conferences will emerge as clear winners from the new College Football Playoff (CFP) system to determine a national champion, along with the likes of ESPN and Nike. \u201cMost of the direct gains of the CFP accrue to the power five conferences whose payouts have more than doubled under the new ESPN CFP format,\u201d Vrooman said.\n\nThat could further the split between the haves and have-nots in college sports. Just over half of the 128 teams in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision turned profits on their football programs in the 2013-4 season, according to data provided by Vrooman. That includes the teams in the five top conferences: the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, PAC-12 and SEC, as well as independents Notre Dame and Brigham Young.\n\nOutside of the five major athletic conferences, though, colleges tend to lose money on football and sports more generally, which has led some colleges, such as the University of Alabama - Birmingham and Philadelphia\u2019s Temple University, to pare back on the number of teams that they field in order to save money.\n\nRelated: The Big Business of College Football\n\nSports economist Victor Matheson of the College of the Holy Cross estimates that Ohio State University\u2019s athletic department overall earned about $24 million in profit in the last school year. That figure, derived by subtracting the athletic program\u2019s $120 million in costs from its $143.7 million in revenue, equals less than 1 percent of the Columbus, Ohio-based college\u2019s $2.7 billion budget, excluding the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.\n\nMost of that profit comes from football. The Buckeyes football team generated $63 million in revenue while incurring $43 million in expenses, according to data published by the school. Ohio State\u2019s men\u2019s basketball program, which is ranked 22nd in the country, also is profitable, though the rest of the teams fielded by Ohio State lose money, as they do in most colleges. Moreover, Matheson recommends taking the university\u2019s data with a \u201cgrain of salt\u201d because it probably includes subsidies which wouldn\u2019t be counted as revenue it most businesses.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that athletics are a very expensive amenity for students,\u201d says Matheson, adding that when a college enjoys surprising success \u2014 such as a \u201cCinderella\u201d team reaching the Final Four of the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament \u2014 \u201cwe definitely see a temporary increase in applications when that happens. There also is some evidence that there is an increase in alumni donations.\u201d\n\nSCHOOL CONF REVENUE (millions) EXPENSE (millions) PROFIT (millions) HEAD COACH SALARY (millions) Texas Big 12 $112.51 $38.43 $74.08 Charlie Strong $5.00 Michigan Big Ten $91.38 $26.76 $64.63 Brady Hoke $2.86 Alabama SEC $94.99 $41.72 $53.27 Nick Saban $7.16 LSU SEC $87.87 $37.86 $50.01 Les Miles $4.37 Georgia SEC $77.16 $27.25 $49.91 Mark Richt $3.31 Tennessee SEC $70.48 $21.67 $48.81 Butch Jones $2.96 Notre Dame Ind. $80.56 $32.76 $47.80 Brian Kelly $1.46 Florida SEC $69.25 $23.04 $46.21 Will Muschamp $2.73 Oklahoma Big 12 $71.37 $28.11 $43.26 Bob Stoops $5.06 Ohio State Big Ten $65.77 $23.38 $42.39 Urban Meyer $4.54\n\nAll figures for 2013-4 school year .
