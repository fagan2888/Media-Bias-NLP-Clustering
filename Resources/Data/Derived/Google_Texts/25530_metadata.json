Some wanted hospital workers to speak Spanish to Spanish-speaking patients. Others complained that Parkland\u2019s contract-bidding process was unfair to minority businesses. Finally, a Parkland doctor stepped forward to ask about the thousands of people who are waiting to get into the Parkland system.\n\nCerise offered measured responses, asking speakers to recognize that the demand for medical service would always exceed Parkland\u2019s ability to provide it. He noted repeatedly that Dallas County has the second-highest percentage of uninsured residents among U.S. urban counties.\n\n\u201cThe country is struggling with how you take care of the entire population,\u201d he told a gathering at Eastfield College\u2019s Pleasant Grove campus.\n\nEven as more Dallas County residents purchase health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, it is not known how many will leave the county health system. An estimated 31 percent of county residents \u2014 about 661,000 people \u2014 are uninsured, according to the latest U.S. census data.\n\n\u201cWe see a continued role for Parkland, regardless of what happens,\u201d Cerise said. \u201cThe need for our services is not going to change.\n\n\u201cWe have to show that we\u2019re providing good quality services with the resources we have. Then we decide what is the unmet demand and what can we do in the organization to meet it.\u201d\n\nParkland spends over $1 billion annually trying to meet indigent health care needs. About a third of that money comes from local taxpayers. The county hospital district also is building a new hospital, at a cost of $1.3 billion, with county taxes footing more than half the bill.\n\nCerise said Parkland expects to make some improvements, mainly using Medicaid funding available under the new federal law. More than $300 million will be channeled into basic medical services over the next five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how to deliver services differently,\u201d Cerise told a crowd of several hundred people at Friendship West Baptist Church in southeast Oak Cliff.\n\nFor starters, Parkland plans to open a half-dozen storefront clinics that will boost its primary care capacity. The locations will be revealed after rental agreements are finalized, officials said.\n\nCerise also raised the possibility of Parkland partnering with private doctors and clinics to reduce access problems. Several speakers insisted the greatest need was in southern Dallas County, where patients have the fewest medical choices.\n\n\u201cWe need to address access in an intelligent way so that we know they\u2019re getting a high quality of service,\u201d Cerise said. \u201cIf the southern half of the county is being ignored, it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nCerise and other hospital officials described changes Parkland made in recent years to satisfy federal and state regulators. More than $75 million was spent to make the hospital system safer for patients.\n\n\u201cThere really are some positive measures in place for quality, safety, efficiency and cost,\u201d he told 75 people gathered at the Irving Chamber of Commerce in Las Colinas.\n\nSuch metrics \u201care the tools you need to assure you\u2019re getting a good product for your money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public health systems haven\u2019t been pressured in this way over the years.\u201d\n\nAt the three sessions held so far, the exchanges were mostly polite and respectful. However, a few comments from the audience led to uncomfortable pauses.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do about the emergency room?\u201d asked one woman. She recounted how her sister spent three days in Parkland\u2019s ER a year ago, awaiting admission to the hospital for high blood pressure.\n\n\u201cThey were telling her, \u2018We got to get you a room,\u2019\u201d she recalled the staff saying. \u201cNobody gave her a bath or any food. It was really frustrating to know who to talk to.\u201d\n\nCerise seemed perplexed by the woman\u2019s comments. It was clear he knew about recent ER upgrades that were intended to reduce such waits to four hours or less.\n\n\u201cI was shocked if she was there and not followed,\u201d Cerise said of the staff\u2019s supposedly lagging response. \u201cIt\u2019s a changed world now.\u201d\n\nAfter several other patients offered examples of the hospital\u2019s staff insensitivity, Cerise acknowledged that Parkland needs to be more \u201cpatient-centered.\u201d It must become a \u201cmedical home\u201d that welcomes patients from a variety of cultures, he said.\n\nAt the Friendship West meeting, Parkland\u2019s first new CEO in more than 30 years got a feel for how long his honeymoon might last.\n\nCerise listened as Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price told the crowd he was unhappy with Parkland\u2019s CEO selection process. Price had supported the lone black candidate; Cerise is white.\n\nSince Parkland serves mainly patients who are black and Hispanic, Price said, the hospital board should have tried harder to find a leader from one of those ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no reflection on Dr. Cerise. He\u2019s here now,\u201d Price said. \u201cBut I\u2019m still not a happy camper, and I don\u2019t expect to be soon.\u201d\n\nPrice and several speakers sought assurances from Cerise that minority businesses would have a fair shot at winning contracts at Parkland. They also want better minority recruitment to fill top administrative openings.\n\nCerise said he was committed to improving diversity among Parkland\u2019s top 60 managers, who overwhelmingly are white.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my personal goals to deliver a plan of diversity in hospital leadership,\u201d Cerise said. \u201cGive me some time, and I will show you it\u2019s something we take seriously.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a series of public forums last week, Dr. Fred Cerise heard a variety of complaints about the county hospital system.", "og": {"description": "At a series of public forums last week, Dr. Fred Cerise heard a variety of complaints about the county hospital system.", "title": "New Parkland CEO prepares to step in", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140322-new-parkland-ceo-prepares-to-step-in.ece", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140322-nm_20med.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_20med.jpg", "height": 400}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-03-23T04:06:33Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-03-23T03:52:13Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"New Parkland CEO prepares to step in\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140322-new-parkland-ceo-prepares-to-step-in.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140322-nm_20med.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_20med.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1539694\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-23T03:52:13Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140322-nm_20med.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NM_20med.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-03-23T03:52:13Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Even as more Dallas County residents purchase health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, it is not known how many will leave the county health system.\nHe noted repeatedly that Dallas County has the second-highest percentage of uninsured residents among U.S. urban counties.\nCerise listened as Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price told the crowd he was unhappy with Parkland\u2019s CEO selection process.\nFinally, a Parkland doctor stepped forward to ask about the thousands of people who are waiting to get into the Parkland system.\nThe county hospital district also is building a new hospital, at a cost of $1.3 billion, with county taxes footing more than half the bill."}
