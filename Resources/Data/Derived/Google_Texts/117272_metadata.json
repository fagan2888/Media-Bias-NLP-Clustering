Janos allegedly \u201cdemonstrated that he never liked [Wilson] and never wanted him at the bureau because of [Wilson\u2019s] protected characteristics, including his race, color, and ancestry, among other things.\u201d Wilson says he filed multiple complaints about Janos, who he says \u201cruled the Los Angeles bureau through fear and intimidation,\u201d and the cultural climate at the office.\n\nOn Jan. 7, a story Wilson wrote came under scrutiny. Three sentences allegedly resembled the text of another outlet\u2019s story without attribution. The copy editor who reviewed the piece reported it to Janos. An audit of Wilson\u2019s work was conducted, and he was ultimately terminated on Jan. 28.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "CNN Sued for Age Discrimination While Layoffs Target 55 and Older", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "CNN Sued for Age Discrimination While Layoffs Target 55 and Older", "title": "CNN Sued for Age Discrimination While Layoffs Target 55 and Older - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2013/CNN/jeff-zucker-afp.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/10/07/cnn-sued-layoffs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CNN Sued for Age Discrimination While Layoffs Target 55 and Older", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2013/CNN/jeff-zucker-afp.jpg", "title": "CNN Sued for Age Discrimination While Layoffs Target 55 and Older - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CNN, Deadline, Twitter,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-10-07T08:40:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e9f\"", "article_summary": "The remainder of the CNN positions, about 170, will be cut through layoffs.\nA buyout program for Turner staffers age 55 and older with ten-plus years at the company was announced in August.\n\u2026The company said about 1,475 positions \u2014 out of 14,000 full-time positions worldwide \u2014 would be eliminated in the coming weeks.\nWithin CNN Worldwide, where the workforce totals roughly 3,500, about 300 positions will be cut, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan, totaling 8.5%.\n\u2026Wilson claims Peter Janos, who was promoted to vice president and bureau chief of the Western region in 2004, was to blame."}
