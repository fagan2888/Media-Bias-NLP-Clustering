Shenoy was Founder, Chairman and CEO of IMC, Inc. (a technology services company), a majority of whose assets were acquired by Calibre Systems in August of 2015. Following the dissolution of IMC, Shenoy folded the remaining portions of the business into Alyx Technologies, a software company at which he currently serves as CEO and chairperson.\n\nShenoy was named one of the Top 25 Most Influential People in the Washington, DC high-tech industry, as well as being awarded the 2004 Executive of the Year by the Northern Virginia GovCon Council, the Professional Services Council, and Washington Technology.\n\nAlong with a dozen other Fortune 500 CEOs, Shenoy was selected for several Presidential trade and development missions to India (1995), Spain (1995), and Berlin (1999). He also serves on the Board of Advisors for George Mason University School of Engineering and was appointed by the Governor of Virginia to the Board of Visitors at this same University.\n\nIn 1998, Governor Jim Gilmore appointed Shenoy to the State of Virginia Technology Commission. He has also been appointed by the governor of Virginia to the Board of Directors of the Innovative Technology Authority as the Chairman of the Center for Innovative Technology.\n\nIn 2000, the Speaker of the Virginia State Legislature appointed Shenoy to a five-member citizens committee on the Virginia Legislative Process. He was also the 2000 Campaign Chairman for the Fairfax-Falls Church United Way. He currently serves on the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nShenoy spoke with The American Bazaar over the phone and offered his perspective on a variety of topics pertaining to his businesses, nonprofits, and how the years have changed the ever-evolving landscape of entrepreneurship.\n\nYou were one of the pioneers in entrepreneurship when it comes to Indian Americans community. How difficult was it to start a business in the late 1970s and early 1980s? What was the climate like at that time?\n\nIt was very difficult. As far as I know there were only one or two others of Indian origin who had started technology businesses. Of course, there were other types of businesses around; there was one grocery store here in Maryland and there were a couple of stores in New York, etcetera but not technology companies per se. So, what can I say? It was pretty risky. I remember some of my friends telling me that I was crazy to start up because no one would give their business to someone from a developing country or an underdeveloped country. I wouldn\u2019t say it was scary, per se, but there was a lot of trepidation, if you will, before jumping into it. But call it craziness, bravado, whatever you want, I decided to do it.\n\nBy the way, when I first started, no banks would give me credit. I probably went to a dozen banks but I had zero assets to offer. I think the idea of private equity and people raising money was not that prevalent in those days. It was very difficult getting a credit line and finding money was extremely difficult. I remember going from bank to bank trying to get a credit line, and I eventually did get one from a small local bank. One of the reasons the banker gave it to me was because I had written a business plan that was a good 75 to a hundred pages. She said anybody could write a business plan with that many pages in it just to get $10,000 was good to go, and she gave it to me.\n\nYou have been a big supporter of a number of nonprofits. In fact, you helped expand the American India Foundation in the DC area. What inspired you to do that?\n\nI\u2019ve always believed we have to give back to the society we live in. I\u2019ve always done that, as a matter of fact, from the time that we started we decided we\u2019d set aside a few percentage points of every year\u2019s profit to give to causes that we believed in or that were worthy. I\u2019ve always been a supporter of giving back to the community that we live in or even to the community that we came from. So, yes, that\u2019s something I strongly believe in.\n\nPan IIT is another organization you been closely involved with. We understand that you will be attending a major IIT Bombay event next month. Can you tell us a little bit about it?\n\nIt\u2019s called a global business forum and it is put up by the IIT Bombay alumni. It\u2019s hosted by Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, who\u2019s an alum of IIT Bombay and I believe there\u2019s close to 2,200 or 2,300 people who have registered. There\u2019s going to be about ten cabinet ministers who will be there at this event. The whole idea is to showcase the technological achievements and capabilities of the technology community and also to showcase what India is capable of doing vis-\u00e0-vis the Make in India and educational programs. So the minister of education is going to be there. It will also showcase what India\u2019s achieved in the recent past. For example, we have a panel discussion with the CEO of Northrop Grumman International and the CEO of Lockheed Martin Asia-Pacific. There\u2019s going to be quite a few very interesting programs that will be put forth over a two-day period.\n\nThe PanIIT initiative does a whole lot of things. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware but there\u2019s a program called Wheels Global Foundation. Wheels stands for for Water, Healthcare, Education, Energy, Lifestyles, and Sustainability. I co-chair this organization and am actively fundraising for it. The whole goal is to improve life in India in those sectors that I talked about. We meet very regular in my company\u2019s office there are some people \u2014 all volunteers who are retired or semi-retired who are giving themselves and their wallets to this program. We are partnered with a few other organizations to dig water wells, to bring energy, to bring communications, and all those kinds of things to remote parts of India, where people basically don\u2019t have access to these kind of things.\n\nYou ran IMC for 35 years. Why did you decide to exit?\n\nWe had three lines of business, basically. One was federal business, which was the vast majority of our work. Mostly in healthcare information technology and data analytics in the healthcare and homeland security areas. And some in the defense areas and also in the State Department.\n\nThe second part of the business was commercial and state and local business. We do a lot of work with financial institutions, with pharmaceutical firms, with hospitals, and other nonprofit institutions. We do a ton of data analytics work and we do it for state and local governments also.\n\nThe third business is our international business, which is primarily handled by my outfit in Pune. I decided that I needed to take some chips off the table.\n\nWe had just won some very large contracts, including a billion dollar contract, and it made sense to go out on a high, rather than a low. It was a definite high for us, so I decided to exit the federal business. I still have the commercial, state, and local and the international business.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that I\u2019ve completely retired, he\u2019s very involved in the technology services business and I\u2019m also involved in a couple of other business that I\u2019m not allowed to talk about and I keep myself busy!\n\nHow did the Affordable Care Act affect your business?\n\nIn terms of winning us more business I don\u2019t think it made much of a difference. However, our healthcare treatments did go up considerably and we had to water down some of the benefits we got. I don\u2019t know if it can be directly attributed to the Affordable Care Act but there certainly were some discernible changes that took place in the care and benefits we were providing to our employees.\n\nIn that respect, I think many medium size companies felt some ramifications from the Affordable Care Act. After all, when you sign up millions of people someone has to pay, and it turns out businesses got his pretty hard. It did impact our cost structure and what kind of care we provided for our employees.\n\nI can\u2019t say that it was directly attributed to the ACA since healthcare costs were going up anyway, but we definitely noticed an impact on that side of the benefits program.\n\nIs there any particular accomplishment you consider the magnum opus of your career to date?\n\nIt\u2019s been one long journey! It\u2019s been a fun journey, and every little bit counts, so I wouldn\u2019t say there was any particular thing that sticks out as being huge. I\u2019ll tell you one thing, though. The business that I sold, we had dozens of people who had been with me for over 20 years, and that is very unusual in the tech industry. The buyer actually noted that and was quite surprised that we had people with such long tenure at one company. In the tech industry, when you\u2019re skilled, you tend to move around quite a bit. We were very lucky in that our people stayed with us for literally two decades or more. I think that makes me really feel good about it because we must have been doing something right if they decided to stick around. From time to time over 35 years I had to ask people to take major pay cuts to help keep the company going, and they willingly did it and I\u2019m very grateful to them for having done that, because otherwise we may not be where we are. But they stuck with us and it was like one big family so it was hard to see the separation. But people realize that sooner or later all good things have to change.\n\nWhat are your future plans? Are you starting anything in the technology sector?\n\nWell I told you about the businesses I\u2019m remaining in, and there are around 140 people remaining in those sectors. We intend to go at it very aggressively. I will still be chairman and CEO of the new entity, which is called Alyx Technologies. We are based in Reston, Virginia, and we just got some spanking new facilities that we\u2019ve moved into. We have a great pipeline and great clients that we\u2019re working with and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing this grow. We\u2019ll be focusing on the commercial and the state and local sectors but not so much on the federal side.\n\nAlyx, in Greek, means \u201cprotector of humanity.\u201d Very aptly, we hope we can use software technologies to bring about that goal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shenoy spoke with The American Bazaar over the phone and offered his perspective on a variety of topics pertaining to his businesses, nonprofits, and how the years have changed the ever-evolving landscape of entrepreneurship.", "og": {"site_name": "The American Bazaar", "description": "Shenoy spoke with The American Bazaar over the phone and offered his perspective on a variety of topics pertaining to his businesses, nonprofits, and how the years have changed the ever-evolving landscape of entrepreneurship.", "title": "When I first started, no bank would give me credit: pioneer Indian American entrepreneur Sudhakar V.
