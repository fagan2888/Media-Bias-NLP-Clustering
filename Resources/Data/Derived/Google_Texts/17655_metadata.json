The consensus still remains that Republicans will retain control of the House, perhaps add a few seats, and have a real shot at making a net gain of six in the Senate which would give them control.\n\nCharlie Cook and Thomas Edsall are respected political prognosticators. Let\u2019s talk first about what Cook said a couple of days ago in \u201cDemocratic Senate Seats Might Prove Hard to Keep: Democrats should brace for the worst in the upcoming midterm elections\u2014then hope to be pleasantly surprised.\u201d\n\nHis argument can be boiled down to this:\n\n\u201cIn the case of Democrats in 2014, it is not so much that they are weak politically\u2014for the most part they aren\u2019t\u2014but rather that they are running in states that are very difficult for their party to hold. These seats only fell into Democratic hands in the first place when Obama was defeating John McCain in 2008. In 1986, Republican exposure was the weakness of the party\u2019s incumbents; in 2014, Democrats\u2019 weakness lies in the location of where their incumbents are running.\u201d\n\nYes and no. Yes, there are states where Democrats who supported ObamaCare are in a heap of trouble. But, no, there are also incumbents who simply aren\u2019t that strong to begin with. Running in \u201cRed\u201d states, with their embrace of ObamaCare wrapped around their ankles only adds to their difficulties.\n\nAnother important insight relates to the impact of ObamaCare. As we\u2019ve posted here several times, there is an unspoken agreement (well, I assume it\u2019s unspoken) between Obama and much of the \u201cMainstream Media\u201d to pretend that Democrats have won out, now that the wholly arbitrary figure of 7 million people signing up for ObamaCare has been met. Cook observes\n\n\u201cDemocrats are popping corks over ACA [ObamaCare] sign-ups hitting the 7 million mark, but consider that this figure is only a bit above 2 percent of the population, and that the 7 million figure may include a decent percentage of people who had coverage either through an employer or through a plan that was canceled. Pretending that the ACA is not going to be a liability this year would be ill-advised. Even considering that some people may like and benefit from the new law, the enthusiasm and intensity in this election is all on the Republican side, and that is very unlikely to change.\u201d\n\nAnd as we have noted, in reality the Obama Administration has not met the 7 million figure. And as we will note tomorrow, there are a fresh round of questions about ObamaCare\u2014fresh in the sense that they are being articulated by the media, but stale in the sense that anyone who followed the debate knew the costs would soar and premiums would go through the roof.\n\nIn late March, Edsall asked, \u201cHow Strong Will the Anti-Democratic Backlash Be?\u201d in an op-ed for the New York Times. It\u2019s an interesting read, in no small part because Edsall asked for input from others who follow political trends closely.\n\nWhat stands out to me is three-fold.\n\n(1) A reminder how much the disastrous open enrollment roll out (Healthcare.gov ) hurt the President and Democrats. Counting on the generic vote to shift back towards Democrats is dicey at best. (The generic vote refers to the outcome when without any names given, people are asked if they would vote for a Democrat or a Republican.)\n\n(2) Given who tends to show up to vote in off-year elections (older, whiter), it wouldn\u2019t take many more of the usual voters\u2013complemented by a decline in those who voted in 2012 because Obama was on the ticket\u2013for Republicans to do very, very well.\n\n(3) Edsall writes, \u201cGoing largely unmentioned in most analyses is the inability of the Obama administration to markedly improve the economy, which could end up playing a big role in the unraveling of the Democratic Party\u2019s electoral fortunes, not only in 2014 but also in 2016.\u201d His point is that because of missteps by Republicans (sometimes egregiously so), Democrats have not had to pay the price for a sluggish economy.\n\nYou can read Cook\u2019s analysis in its entirety at www.nationaljournal.com//off-to-the-races/democratic-senate-seats-might-prove-hard-to-keep-20140407\n\nEdsall\u2019s piece can be found at www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/opinion/edsall-how-strong-will-the-anti-democratic-backlash-be.html\n\nPlease join those who are following me on Twitter at twitter.com/daveha.
