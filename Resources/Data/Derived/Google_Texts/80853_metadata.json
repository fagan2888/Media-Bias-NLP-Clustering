Advocates counter that the legislation will help repel cyberattacks.\n\nThe site features a petition urging Cassin to step down and includes a phone number people can dial to push members of Congress to oppose the legislation. The proposed measure could see action on the Senate floor in the coming weeks.\n\nAn estimated 15 million T-Mobile customers may have become victims of a data breach of encrypted data housed by Experian, a credit agency that processes the telecom carrier\u2019s credit applications, T-Mobile said on Thursday.\n\nExperian did not immediately return a request for comment about the website.\n\nSince CISA was introduced in July 2014, Experian has spent $1.04 million in lobbying fees, including payments to high-powered firms including Venable, DLA Piper and Lincoln Policy Group, the latter run by former Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.).\n\nNot all of the lobbying disclosure forms list CISA as an issue, and the question of how much was spent to lobby specifically on data-sharing bills cannot be easily answered.\n\nIn the first six months of 2015, the company\u2019s political action committee donated $163,000 to federal lawmakers. During the two-year 2014 election cycle, Experian PAC gave $650,100 to candidates \u2013 reaching an all-time high for its federal giving.\n\n\u201cExperian supports legislation that would facilitate greater sharing of cyber threat information among appropriate private and government entities,\u201d an Experian spokeswoman told The Guardian about CISA in August. \u201cSuch sharing arrangements, under parameters set by law, could improve our mutual efforts to better detect and respond to emerging cyber threats.\u201d\n\nFight for the Future has previously waged successful campaigns on cybersecurity policy and net neutrality.\n\nThe group scored its most recent victory on its opposition to CISA after BSA | The Software Alliance, a tech industry group, wrote a letter that seemed to express support for the proposed legislation.\n\nIn retaliation, Fight for the Future threatened a boycott of Salesforce, a member of the industry group and a signatory on the letter.\n\nBSA backed off and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also tweeted his disapproval of the legislation.\n\n\u201cThe letter clearly was a mistake and doesn't imply CISA support,\u201d he wrote on the social media platform. \u201cWe need to clarify. I'm against it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Website highlights lobbying efforts, promotes petition against CEO.", "description": "Website highlights lobbying efforts, promotes petition against CEO.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
