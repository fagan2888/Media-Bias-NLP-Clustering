With Ms. Steinem and two women who had won Nobel Peace Prizes for leading peace campaigns in their respective countries \u2014 Leymah Gbowee of Liberia and Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland \u2014 at the lead, the marchers succeeded in getting attention, but the event was not quite the dramatic feat Ms. Steinem made it out to be.\n\nThe activists had wanted to march across at Panmunjom, where the truce was signed in July 1953, but United States and South Korean officials nixed that and the demonstrators finally came over in a bus along a well-traveled transit route. Still, Ms. Steinem was convinced that the group had broken through \u201cartificial barriers\u201d in their meetings in the North and had scored a \u201ctriumph\u201d for peace and reconciliation.\n\nThe sentiment was not universal, at least in the South. Alongside peace activists who cheered the group were protesters who accused the women of deliberately closing their eyes to the North\u2019s appalling human rights abuses and of playing directly into the hands of the North Korean propaganda machine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, one account issued by the North Korean news agency described how the marchers \u201cpaid tribute\u201d to the despotic Kim dynasty.\n\nThe goal of Ms. Steinem and her group \u2014 to begin a long-term peace-building project with the full involvement of women \u2014 is no doubt worthy. But the question remains whether their approach can help achieve peace. As a correspondent in Moscow in the last years of the Soviet Union, I often met with American peace activists convinced that if only they and similarly minded Russian people could meet and talk, the Cold War would end. The Kremlin happily supplied carefully selected Communist Party interlocutors and used the visitors in propaganda intended to portray the Soviet Union as the victim of militaristic Western leaders. Liberal Russians I knew found these missions amusingly na\u00efve.\n\nThe activists could certainly point to similar movements that helped bring about peace agreements in Northern Ireland and Liberia. But the violence in those lands was between factions who had to be forced to the negotiating table. The Korean Peninsula is divided between a hermetically sealed dictatorship armed with nuclear weapons and a prosperous democracy open to the world. North and South are not equally culpable for the absence of peace, and unification will probably come only with the collapse of the dictatorship in the North.\n\nThat said, Ms. Steinem and her colleagues deserve credit at least for trying. So far, other attempts in recent years to change the behavior of the North on human rights or nuclear weapons, through negotiations or sanctions, have been unsuccessful.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150528032123, "twitter": {"description": "A march across the DMZ into South Korea raises the question of what kinds of peace efforts work.", "title": "Talking About Peace, When Despots Don\u2019t Care", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/opinion/talking-about-peace-when-despots-dont-care.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003703911"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/28/opinion/28thu3web/28thu3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/opinion/talking-about-peace-when-despots-dont-care.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003703911", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/opinion/talking-about-peace-when-despots-dont-care.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Talking About Peace, When Despots Don\u2019t Care", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 28, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Editorials,South Korea,North Korea,Demonstrations  Protests and Riots,Steinem  Gloria,Women's Rights,Panmunjom (South Korea),Kim Jong-un,International Relations", "news_keywords": "Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Serge Schmemann", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/28/opinion/28thu3web/28thu3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Kim Jong-un", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By SERGE SCHMEMANN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A march across the DMZ into South Korea raises the question of what kinds of peace efforts work.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/28/opinion/28thu3web/28thu3web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A march across the DMZ into South Korea raises the question of what kinds of peace efforts work.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 28, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/serge_schmemann/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-06-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "International Relations", "published": "2015-05-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Panmunjom (South Korea)", "slug": "28thu3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150617040001, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/opinion/talking-about-peace-when-despots-dont-care.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/28/opinion/28thu3web/28thu3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A march across the DMZ into South Korea raises the question of what kinds of peace efforts work.", "title": "Talking About Peace, When Despots Don\u2019t Care"}, "pdate": 20150528, "des": "International Relations", "articleid": 100000003703911, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Talking About Peace, When Despots Don\u2019t Care", "col": "Editorial Notebook", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2d4\"", "article_summary": "That said, Ms. Steinem and her colleagues deserve credit at least for trying.\nPhotoThe 30 women arrived on the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone proud and triumphant.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyIndeed, one account issued by the North Korean news agency described how the marchers \u201cpaid tribute\u201d to the despotic Kim dynasty.\nSo far, other attempts in recent years to change the behavior of the North on human rights or nuclear weapons, through negotiations or sanctions, have been unsuccessful.\nStill, Ms. Steinem was convinced that the group had broken through \u201cartificial barriers\u201d in their meetings in the North and had scored a \u201ctriumph\u201d for peace and reconciliation."}
