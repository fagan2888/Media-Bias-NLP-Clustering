Mr. Obama and fellow Democrats had shied away from that during the 2009 and 2010 health care debates, fearing the political consequences.\n\nBut Mr. O'Malley said it\u2019s bad economics to keep them out, because they\u2019ll just end up using emergency rooms for medical care \u2014 often uncompensated costs that leave taxpayers or the rest of the health system footing the bills.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell kind of sense does that make?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley told Fusion network in an interview Tuesday.\n\nFusion anchor Jorge Ramos, a major figure in Spanish-language media and a crusader for legalization, praised Mr. O'Malley\u2019s plan as the broadest yet in the presidential race.\n\nThe Democratic presidential field has made immigration an intense focus this year, with Mr. O'Malley and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton competing to outbid Mr. Obama\u2019s already extensive efforts to win Hispanic supporters.\n\nIn announcing her own immigration plans, Mrs. Clinton had checked off nearly every item on advocates\u2019 wish-lists.\n\nStill, advocates said Mr. O'Malley\u2019s plan set the benchmark for others.\n\n\u201cUnlike other candidates of both parties, Governor O'Malley\u2019s immigration platform is bold and has concrete details, particularly that he will commit to executive action first year of office,\u201d the Dream Action Coalition said in a statement. \u201cBetween his launch and his overall record and rhetoric on immigration, it is heartening to see someone play a pro-immigration counter to the Donald Trumps of the world.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, a businessman running for the Republicans\u2019 presidential nomination, has moved the debate in the GOP the other direction, after his comments that Mexico sends rapists and criminals to the U.S. amid the flow of immigrants.\n\nSome Republicans and most Democrats have blasted Mr. Trump. Mr. O'Malley said the comments are \u201chate speech\u201d and said all candidates have a duty to speak out against them.\n\nBut Mr. Trump says he\u2019s been misunderstood in that he\u2019s not attacking immigrants themselves, but rather the policies that push bad elements from Mexico and draw them to the U.S.\n\nHe said this weekend\u2019s prison escape by Mexico\u2019s most notorious drug cartel chief is proof of corruption in Mexico.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley's new immigration plan would extend Obamacare privileges to illegal immigrants, including those here under President Obama's deportation amnesty, allowing them to use their own money to buy in the health exchanges.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s new immigration plan would extend Obamacare privileges to illegal immigrants, including those here under President Obama\u2019s deportation amnesty, allowing them to use their own money to buy in the health exchanges.", "title": "Martin O\u2019Malley: Give health care to illegals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/15/martin-omalley-give-health-care-illegals/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/DEM_2016_OMalley_Live.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/DEM_2016_OMalley_Live.jpg", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley's new immigration plan would extend Obamacare privileges to illegal immigrants, including those here under President Obama's deportation amnesty, allo", "card": "summary", "title": "Martin O\u2019Malley: Give health care to illegals"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Martin O Malley"}, "article_summary": "Mr. O'Malley said the comments are \u201chate speech\u201d and said all candidates have a duty to speak out against them.\n\u201cWhat the hell kind of sense does that make?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley told Fusion network in an interview Tuesday.\nBut Mr. O'Malley said it\u2019s bad economics to keep them out, because they\u2019ll just end up using emergency rooms for medical care \u2014 often uncompensated costs that leave taxpayers or the rest of the health system footing the bills.\nStill, advocates said Mr. O'Malley\u2019s plan set the benchmark for others.\nAmong the boldest ideas was extending Obamacare access to illegal immigrants."}
