President Barack Obama celebrated the end of 2013 with a low-key foray to buy a cherry and lemon-lime \"shave ice\" in his native Hawaii before retreating to a vacation rental.\n\nIn San Francisco, one of the last major cities in the world to see the clock strike midnight, thousands saw waterfront fireworks illuminate the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nTo the north, in a foggy Seattle, huge crowds gathered for a fireworks display launched from the Space Needle tower.\n\nIn Los Angeles, long notorious for lacking a centralized New Year's Eve celebration befitting its association with glitz and glamour, organizers pulled together a free outdoor arts and music festival in and around downtown's Grand Park.\n\nSYDNEY, DUBAI, LONDON\n\nNineteen hours earlier, a massive fireworks display lit up the sky around the Harbor Bridge and Opera House in Sydney, Australia. In the Middle East, Dubai broke the Guinness World Record for the largest fireworks display, the website Emirates247 reported.\n\nIn London, edible banana confetti and strawberry mist rained from the sky as fireworks along the River Thames lit up Big Ben and other landmarks.\n\nAcross the United States, 2014 ushered in political changes and the official start of a slate of new laws.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Bill de Blasio, was sworn in at midnight in a private ceremony at his home in Brooklyn, succeeding Michael Bloomberg, who left office after 12 years. He was due to be formally inaugurated later at City Hall.\n\nAmericans who have signed up for new healthcare coverage under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act were due to begin receiving benefits on January 1.\n\nBefore ushering in 2014, Sotomayor, the U.S. Supreme Court Justice, granted Roman Catholic-affiliated groups a temporary exemption from a part of the Obamacare healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance policies covering contraception.\n\nAlso starting New Year's Day, Colorado residents were legally permitted to buy an ounce of marijuana at a time from specially regulated retailers.\n\nPossession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year.\n\n\"It will be like people waiting in line for tickets to a Pink Floyd concert,\" said Justin Jones, 39, owner of Dank Colorado in Denver, who has run a medical marijuana shop for four years and now has a recreational pot license.\n\n(Additional reporting by Colleen Jenkins in Winston-Salem, Mary Wisniewski in Chicago, Keith Coffman in Denver and Marina Lopes in New York, Steve Gorman in Los Angeles, and Eric M.
