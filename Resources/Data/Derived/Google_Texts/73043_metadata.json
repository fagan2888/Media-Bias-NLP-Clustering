Mitch McConnell and was squashed like a bug, barely squeaked out of this year\u2019s four-candidate GOP gubernatorial primary with an 83-vote win over James Comer, out of about 214,000 votes cast.\n\nBut, in fact, it\u2019s the only really competitive gubernatorial race in the country, in a year when most of the political junkies around the country are deeply fixated on the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThere really hasn\u2019t been much polling in the race lately. At the end of July, the Bluegrass Poll, conducted for Kentucky\u2019s two largest newspapers and two prominent TV stations, showed Conway up by a slim three percentage points. On June 23, Public Policy Polling, a North Carolina firm, had Bevin up by two percentage points.\n\nBut some time ago, Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a weekly politics newsletter published by Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, moved the Kentucky governor\u2019s race from the \u201ctoss-up\u201d category to \u201cleans Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth national party committees see Kentucky as a winnable race,\u2019\u2019 said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst who is managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball.\n\nBevin, Kondik said, \u201cis not really a great candidate; and it may be a question of how much of his own money he is willing to spend on this.\n\n\u201cBut President Obama is extremely unpopular in Kentucky; and you have the Trump phenomenon going on in the Republican presidential race,\u2019\u2019 Kondik said \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of how nationalized politics has gotten even in state races.\n\nKentucky has, for many years, tended to elect Democrats to statewide offices and Republicans to the presidency and Congressional seats.\n\nA sign that things may be changing in Kentucky politics is the fact that both Bevin and Conway are using President Obama in TV ads. Last week, Bevin released his first TV ad of the general election campaign blasting Conway for supporting Obama policies such as the Affordable Care Act and a plan to limit environmental emissions for businesses.\n\nConway said he never supported the emissions law. He released his own ad saying that, as attorney general, he took on the Obama administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency over proposed limits standards for coal-fired power plants.\n\nNathan Smith, a long-time Democratic political activist and former vice chairman of the state Democratic party is hosting a fundraiser for Conway and his running mate, Sannie Overly, at Smith\u2019s Ft. Mitchell home. Ticket prices range from $100 to $1,000 and it\u2019s being billed as the Conway campaign\u2019s \u201cfinal northern Kentucky fundraising reception.\u201d\n\nSmith is convinced Conway will win, even if it turns out to be a very close election.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, this has been a swing state,\u2019\u2019 Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very Republican in choosing presidents and members of Congress and very Democratic when it comes to choosing governors and state officeholders.\n\n\u201cNow, Jack Conway has done a good job as attorney general of this state; and I think people recognize that,\u2019\u2019 Smith said. \u201cHe has experience that Matt Bevin does not have.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Northern Kentucky counties of Boone, Kenton and Campbell have been heavily Republican for years now, but Smith says he expects a \u201cvery light turnout\u201d in Northern Kentucky because there is no enthusiasm \u2013 especially among Republicans \u2013 for Bevin.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t see him as one of them,\u2019\u2019 Smith said of Northern Kentucky voters. \u201cAnd I do not think that, in the end, people are going to trust Matt Bevin\u2019s ability to run this state.\u201d\n\nAs you might imagine, Greg Schumate, chairman of the Kenton County Republican Party, does not agree with Smith\u2019s analysis.\n\nPresident Obama is extremely unpopular in the Bluegrass State, Schumate said, and Conway is carrying that weight on his back.\n\n\u201cWhat I am seeing in Kentucky is a very stiff, very negative reaction to the President,\u2019\u2019 Schumate said.\n\n\u201cYes, voters in Kentucky have voted for Democrats in state elections, but philosophically, they relate better to Republicans,\u2019\u2019 Schumate said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, if Matt Bevin. He\u2019s the one who seems to have momentum.\u201d\n\nSchumate said Bevin\u2019s acceptance by mainstream Republicans reminds him of 2010, when an upstart tea party-backed candidate for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination named Rand Paul beat the Republican establishment candidate, Trey Grayson.\n\n\u201cRepublicans were deeply divided in that primary, just like they were deeply divided in this year\u2019s gubernatorial primary,\u2019\u2019 Schumate said. \u201cBut, in the end, they came together to elect Rand Paul. And I see the same thing happening for Matt Bevin.\u201d\n\nHard to say. This will probably be a close election. More polling is likely to come soon to give some guidance as to where things stand.\n\nTonight, if the clouds clear, you can look up in the sky and see a total lunar eclipse of a harvest moon \u2013 something pretty rare. Almost as rare as a Republican being elected governor of Kentucky.
