Thousands listened to him speak about his policy views before the upcoming primary election on May 10. See video at wvgazettemail.com.\n\nJust as polls closed in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders took the stage at Big Sandy Superstore Arena to a roar from West Virginians.\n\nWhile Sanders drew a large crowd, voters in Pennsylvania dealt him a loss in what some considered a must-win state.\n\nThe self-professed Democratic-Socialist spoke for almost an hour on the core issue of his campaign\u00ad \u2014 the economy\u00ad\u00ad \u2014specifically referencing West Virginia in examples of income inequality, the opioid epidemic and the fight against climate change.\n\nAround halfway through his speech, Sanders mentioned a West Virginia county for the first time \u2014 McDowell County.\n\n\u201cMcDowell County here in West Virginia is one of the poorest counties in the United States of America,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn McDowell County, 77 percent of the children under 18 are living under poverty. In McDowell County many can only expect to live to the age of 63.\u201d\n\nSanders used McDowell to talk about income inequality, the basis of his campaign. He said that America, as the richest country in the world, should not have counties as poor as McDowell.\n\nTo solve the problem, he talked about raising the minimum wage, making college tuition free, corporate tax reform and creating jobs through investing in infrastructure \u2014 solutions that brought the roughly 6,000 Sanders supporters to the arena.\n\nHe also addressed the opioid crisis, the topic on which he elicited the biggest cheers of the night.\n\n\u201cWe have reached the conclusion that we must deal with the issue of drug addiction as a health issue and not a criminal issue,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of treating drug addiction as a criminal problem, Sanders said it should be treated as a public health crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have got to revolutionize mental health treatment in America,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have got to provide treatment when they need it, not six months from then.\u201d\n\nHe used the crisis to talk about how he felt that the Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t do enough and that America should move to a single payer system.\n\nHe also used the opioid crisis to talk about how marijuana should be decriminalized, which caused the crowd to cheer loudly.\n\nWhen addressing climate change, Sanders acknowledged that it was a divisive issue in the state. He didn\u2019t back down from the position that climate change is real and that the United States needs to put in place a carbon tax.\n\nBut he did say that coal miners and natural gas workers who are put out of work deserve jobs, which mirrors proposals from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe have a moral obligation to protect those workers in the fossil fuel industries,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nFor the most part, Sanders did not attack Clinton. The only thing he challenged her on was her support of trade agreements. Sanders said that trade deals sent American jobs overseas, putting many people out of work.\n\n\u201cOur message to corporate America is, \u2018You want us to buy the products you make? Then make those products here in West Virginia,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking a few minutes away from the Marshall University campus, Sanders stressed his free tuition program. In Scandinavian countries and Germany, he said, people are able to go to college for free.\n\n\u201cThey understand that investing in the young people is investing in the future of their country,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nHe added that student loan debt should be forgiven, because too many Americans are paying too much in student loans.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to buy a car \u2014 to buy a car, to get married, to have kids, because they are paying off that debt,\u201d he said. \u201cFor what crime did they commit? Getting an education? That is nuts.\u201d\n\nSanders did not talk about the polls that closed Tuesday night \u2014 by the time he had finished speaking, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware had been called for Clinton, while Sanders led in Connecticut and Rhode Island. But Connecticut was called for Clinton shortly after he finished speaking. Even with some upset victories Sanders still trails Clinton in the delegate count.\n\n\u201cI hope that on May 10, West Virginia will have the largest voter turnout in the history of the state.\u201d\n\nIn the 2012 primary election, West Virginia had a record low voter turnout of 20 percent, the lowest since 1972.\n\n\u201cI hope very much that West Virginia will join the political revolution,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nReach Andrew Brown at andrew.brown@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-4814 or follow @andy_ed_brown on Twitter.\n\nReach Daniel Desrochers at dan.desrochers@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-4886 or follow @drdesrochers on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160426/sanders-talks-economy-education-at-huntington-rally", "type": "article", "site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Sanders talks economy, education at Huntington rally"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "title": "Sanders talks economy, education at Huntington rally", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 466107013410205}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2988\"", "article_summary": "Around halfway through his speech, Sanders mentioned a West Virginia county for the first time \u2014 McDowell County.\n\u201cMcDowell County here in West Virginia is one of the poorest counties in the United States of America,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cI hope that on May 10, West Virginia will have the largest voter turnout in the history of the state.\u201dIn the 2012 primary election, West Virginia had a record low voter turnout of 20 percent, the lowest since 1972.\nBernie Sanders addresses the crowd Tuesday during the \u201cFuture to Believe In\u201d rally at Big Sandy Superstore Arena in Huntington.\n\u201cWe have got to revolutionize mental health treatment in America,\u201d Sanders said."}
