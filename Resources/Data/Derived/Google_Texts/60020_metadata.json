It was the Catholic Church, more specifically the U.S. Catholic bishops\u2019 conference, that largely engineered Hobby Lobby to block the legitimization of contraception as a standard health insurance benefit\u2014a last ditch effort to prevent by law what it couldn\u2019t prevent from the pulpit: women from using birth control.\n\nThe Catholic bishops\u2019 interest in \u201cconscience clauses\u201d that would allow employers to opt out of reproductive health care services began in earnest in the late 1990s, with the increased viability at the state and national levels of contraceptive equity measures designed to ensure that health plans covered prescription contraceptives like the Pill just like other prescription medications. For years, insurers had omitted contraceptives from prescription drug plans\u2014the only entire class of drugs routinely and explicitly excluded\u2014which made women\u2019s out-of-pocket medical expenses some 70 percent higher than men\u2019s. Measures to ensure contraceptive equity had been stalled by male legislators and social conservatives who asserted that employers and insurers shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay for what they called a \u201clifestyle\u201d choice, not a health care need. Despite that fact that nearly all women use contraceptives at some point in their lives\u201498 percent, according to government surveys\u2014and that at any given moment two-thirds of women of child-bearing age are using a contraceptive method, the implication was that fertility management was frivolous or immoral and that \u201cother people\u201d shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay for it.\n\nWhen Connecticut considered a contraceptive equity measure in 1999, a Catholic priest, the Rev. Joseph Looney of Bethlehem, Connecticut, told the legislature that covering contraceptives would only benefit \u201cplayboys\u201d and would fund \u201ccraziness and irresponsibility.\u201d It was a framework that conservatives had successfully applied to abortion\u2014asserting that it must be segregated from other health services and government funding because it was immoral\u2014and now were trying to apply to birth control.\n\nBut the decision of most health insurers to cover Viagra almost immediately after it was approved by the FDA in 1998 largely negated this argument. Suddenly contraceptive coverage measures were sailing through state legislatures. A national contraceptive equity measure was introduced but failed to make it out of committee. The sponsors retooled the bill and reintroduced it as a measure that required insurance plans participating in the health insurance program for federal employees to cover contraceptives. Even this scaled-down measure would set an important precedent because the federal benefits package is often used as a model for private sector health plans. The bishops and social conservatives worked furiously to derail the measure by claiming that it would force health plans to cover abortifacients\u2014which they now defined as anything that worked post-fertilization. Representatives Christopher Smith (R-NJ), who had a track record of introducing legislation favored by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), and Tom Coburn (R-OK) tried unsuccessfully to insert a provision prohibiting \u201ccoverage for abortifacients,\u201d claiming that newly approved emergency contraceptive pills and the intrauterine device were abortifacients because they could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting.\n\nWhen charges that contraceptives were abortifacients failed to halt the measure, the bishops turned to a new tack: claiming that contraception equity laws violated the religious freedom of insurers and employers who disapproved of contraception and would be forced to subsidize its use. \u201cThey force private health insurance plans and/or employers . . . to cover all \u2018FDA-approved\u2019 methods of contraception. . . regardless of the provider\u2019s conscientious objection or long-standing religious beliefs against such coverage,\u201d wrote Cathy Deeds of the NCCB. It was a stunning claim, suggesting that anyone who administered or paid for an insurance policy should be free to dictate what coverage was provided to policyholders based on their objection to services that they themselves would not be forced to use.\n\nThe Catholic bishops now sought a broad-based conscience clause that would allow any employer or insurer to refuse to cover contraceptives for any religious or moral objection. This represented a major escalation in the grounds for claiming conscience protections. Traditionally so-called conscience clauses, like the 1973 Church Amendment, protected individuals or health care entities like hospitals only from being compelled to directly perform abortions or sterilizations in violation of their moral or religious beliefs. In 1997, the federal government expanded conscience protections to the payers of abortion-related services when it allowed Medicaid and Medicare managed-care plans to refuse to pay providers for abortion counseling or referral services. Now the bishops were attempting to extend conscience protection to any payer who had a \u201cmoral\u201d objection to contraception. Such a measure would make contraceptive coverage mandates useless, because any employer or insurer could opt out. And it would once again leave women\u2019s reproductive health care at the mercy of individual employers and insurers and stigmatize contraceptives, like abortion, as a segregated health service that could be carved out of the continuum of women\u2019s health needs.\n\nThe bishops failed to get a broader conscience clause in the bill mandating coverage of contraceptives for federal employees, but they did manage to get an exemption for the five religiously affiliated plans in the system. Having set the precedent that religious providers would be treated differently concerning the provision of reproductive health care, even in the matter of noncontroversial services such as contraception, the bishops launched a major new effort to create broad conscience exemptions.\n\nThe issue was particularly contentious because the FDA recently had approved the first prepackaged \u201cmorning after\u201d pill\u2014a high dose of oral contraceptives that worked to prevent pregnancy if taken shortly after unprotected intercourse. Like regular oral contraceptives, emergency contraceptives (ECs) work primarily by preventing ovulation; however, at the time it was believed that this early version might in some cases prevent implantation. Public health advocates praised the widespread availability of EC as a major step forward in preventing unwanted pregnancy and reducing abortion. The Catholic bishops, however, were among the earliest and sharpest critics of EC, asserting that it was an abortifacient because it may prevent implantation and \u201cdestroy a developing embryo\u201d despite the fact that the FDA said it could not interrupt an established pregnancy.\n\n\u201cWhat is striking is how hard the bishops worked to conflate abortion and contraception, particularly around EC,\u201d said Lois Uttley, director of MergerWatch, which began tracking religiously based health restrictions in the mid-1990s. \u201cBut they said it over and over enough that they actually managed to convince many people,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the Bush administration, the Catholic bishops found a willing partner in their quest for \u201cconscience clauses.\u201d President George W. Bush\u2019s PEPFAR anti-AIDS program included an exemption for religious providers who didn\u2019t want to distribute condoms, which was custom-made for Catholic agencies like Catholic Relief Services. Bush signed an appropriations bill in 2005 that included the \ufb01rst federal conscience clause. This broadened the abortion exemption to a wide range of health care entities, including HMOs and other insurers, and included the right to refuse to refer for abortions.\n\nBy this time, the issue of conscience refusals was becoming increasingly contentious, as the bishops were joined by elements of the Christian Right in asserting the need for greater conscience protections for health care workers, who they charged were regularly being forced to violate their faith in the provision of certain services. Organizations like Pharmacists for Life campaigned for the right of pharmacists to refuse to dispense or refer for oral contraceptives or EC on the grounds that they were potentially abortifacients. Reports of conscience-based service refusals mushroomed. There were hospital nurses who refused to care for patients before or after emergency abortions, doctors who refused to prescribe the Pill to unmarried women, and infertility clinics that turned away lesbian patients. Conscience exemptions were now being used as a political tool to block access to services to which some objected or to make moral judgments about the provision of care to certain patients.\n\nBy the dawn of the Obama administration, however, the bishops were losing ground on conscience exemptions. They lobbied unsuccessfully in Arizona to broaden that state\u2019s narrow religious exemption to its contraceptive equity law, which covered only churches, to include any religious employer, such as Catholic hospitals and universities. The bishops in Connecticut lost a bruising two-year battle for an exemption to that state\u2019s new \u201cEC in the ER\u201d law despite putting up a \ufb01erce \ufb01ght. The Obama administration undid some sweeping conscience exemptions created during the Bush administration, noting that federal law still protected providers from being compelled to participate in abortions. Then, in August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that all employer-based health plans would be required to provide contraceptives to women at no cost under its proposed rules for the preventive services guaranteed to all individuals under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn deference to the Catholic bishops, HHS proposed a narrow conscience clause that exempted nonpro\ufb01t organizations directly involved in the inculcation of religion that primarily employed individuals of the same religion, like Catholic churches and other houses of worship. However, Catholic-affiliated institutions like universities and hospitals that served the general population and employed non-Catholics would have to provide contraception through their plans. Many of these employers had chosen to self-insure\u2014that is, serve as their own insurers\u2014to circumvent state contraception mandates, but they would be required to comply with federal law.\n\nThe type of narrowly drawn conscience clause proposed by the administration had been sancti\ufb01ed by two closely watched state supreme court decisions in New York and California. The U.S. Supreme Court let both decisions stand, which was seen as a major victory for a limited application of conscience clauses. But in the ensuring years since the 2006 New York decision, not only had the Christian Right become activated on the issue, but the question of conscience clauses had spilled beyond health care as efforts advanced to ensure equality for same-sex couples. Catholic Charities affiliates in Boston and Illinois closed their well-respected adoption agencies rather than comply with state mandates that they provide adoptions to gay and lesbian couples.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While evangelical Christians ultimately brought down the contraception mandate, they had big help from Catholics", "title": "How the Catholic Church masterminded the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby debacle", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "While evangelical Christians ultimately brought down the contraception mandate, they had big help from Catholics", "title": "How the Catholic Church masterminded the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby debacle", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/14/how_the_catholic_church_masterminded_the_supreme_courts_hobby_lobby_debacle/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/dolan_scalia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While evangelical Christians ultimately brought down the contraception mandate, they had big help from Catholics", "title": "How the Catholic Church masterminded the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby debacle", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/dolan_scalia.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patricia Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Birth Control, Catholic Church, Christianity, Hobby Lobby, Supreme Court, Timothy Dolan, War on women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce429\"", "article_summary": "Even this scaled-down measure would set an important precedent because the federal benefits package is often used as a model for private sector health plans.\nThis broadened the abortion exemption to a wide range of health care entities, including HMOs and other insurers, and included the right to refuse to refer for abortions.\nBut while the Green family who filed the Hobby Lobby suit objecting to the mandate are evangelical Christians, the road to Hobby Lobby wasn\u2019t paved by the Christian Right.\nThe Catholic bishops now sought a broad-based conscience clause that would allow any employer or insurer to refuse to cover contraceptives for any religious or moral objection.\nWhen Connecticut considered a contraceptive equity measure in 1999, a Catholic priest, the Rev."}
