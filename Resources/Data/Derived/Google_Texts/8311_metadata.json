Carson, who was the first surgeon to successfully separate conjoined twins attached at the head, stood as stark repudiation of invidious stereotypes about black intellectual capacity. His memoir, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d has been passed through countless black households.\n\nBut the good doctor\u2019s foray into Republican presidential politics threatens to become his epitaph, to overshadow \u2014 perhaps even to overwhelm \u2014 his academic and surgical accomplishments. He will likely be remembered as the GOP\u2019s latest black mascot, a court jester, a minstrel show. He\u2019ll be the Herman Cain of 2016.\n\nClearly, Carson\u2019s chances of winning the Republican nomination for president stand at less than zero. No matter how many cheers he attracts at conservative gab-fests, no matter how many of his bumper stickers appear on the vehicles of true believers, no matter how many Fox News pundits suggest he\u2019s a viable candidate, he won\u2019t come close to becoming the GOP standard-bearer.\n\nNor should he. He is dangerously unqualified for the presidency \u2014 a political novice who is happily ignorant of policy, both foreign and domestic, and contemptuous of religious pluralism and personal liberties.\n\nCarson catapulted to stardom in the ultraconservative firmament in 2013, when he addressed the National Prayer Breakfast and lashed out at the Affordable Care Act as President Barack Obama sat nearby, though the breakfast has a long history of nonpartisanship.\n\nThat was enough to cause conservatives to swoon. Since Obama\u2019s election, Republicans have been sensitive to charges that their small tent of aging voters has become a bastion of white resentment, a cauldron of bigotry, nativism and fear of the other. They want to show that their fierce resistance to all things Obama has nothing to do with race.\n\nThat promotes a special affection for black conservatives who are willing to viciously criticize the president. As with Cain before him, Carson garners the most enthusiastic cheers from conservative audiences when he\u2019s excoriating Obama, the most rapturous applause when he seems to absolve them of charges of bigotry.\n\nI\u2019ve little doubt that Carson\u2019s conservative impulses are genuine. He grew up Seventh-day Adventist, a conservative religious tradition. Moreover, he has adopted a view popular among white conservatives: that black Democrats give short shrift to traditional values such as thrift, hard work and sacrifice. (Hasn\u2019t Carson ever heard any of Obama\u2019s riffs excoriating deadbeat dads and promoting discipline, scholarship and parental involvement in their children\u2019s lives?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Carson hardly represents the long and honorable tradition of black conservatism in America. Starting with the father of that movement, Booker T. Washington, its adherents have had a healthy appreciation for the reality of racism in America. Carson, however, thinks Obamacare \u201creally (is) the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And ... it is slavery in a way.\u201d Washington and his peers, who knew better, would never have countenanced such nonsense.\n\nCarson also has dismissed evolution, has compared homosexuality to bestiality and has spurned the First Amendment\u2019s separation of church and state.\n\nThose extreme positions guarantee that mainstream Republican leaders and their donors will flock elsewhere, seeking to find an experienced, broadly appealing and electable candidate.\n\nCarson can only lose in this campaign \u2014 and more than just the Republican primary. He also stands to lose his place as one of the nation\u2019s most admired men.\n\nCynthia Tucker is a former winner of the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.
