The survey showed female voters still are not receptive to the messaging from the Republican Party.\n\nRespondents characterized the GOP as \u201cintolerant,\u201d \u201clacking in compassion\u201d and \u201cstuck in the past.\u201d A narrow plurality of married women does side with Republicans, but single women of all ages prefer Democrats by roughly a 40-point margin.\n\nFiorina said conservative women need to engage their friends because the case against continuing down the liberal road should be pretty simple.\n\n\u201cWe need to stick with facts and data. The facts are on our side, and this why Democrats continue to hurl what I call shameless, baseless propaganda, because they don\u2019t have the facts,\u201d said Fiorina, noting that the record of the Obama presidency has been anything but beneficial to women.\n\n\u201cMore women are living in poverty than ever before,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are bearing the brunt of the results of Obamacare. Women are not losing access to birth control as the Democrats claim, but they are losing access to their doctors. They\u2019re losing access to their hospitals. They\u2019re losing access to procedures that their doctors may be recommending.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cIt is women and children who are being slaughtered by terrorists. It is women and children who are suffering in addition to soldiers of war. On the question of education, which women care deeply about, it is the teachers unions who are fighting against pay for performance. It is women as parents who lack choices in how to educate their children.\u201d\n\nFiorina added, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is rocket science.\u201d\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Carly Fiorina:\n\nWhy is the Republican Party having such a difficult time connecting with women? Fiorina sees two key reasons.\n\n\u201cI think the Democrats have very successfully used the \u2018War on Women\u2019 rhetoric to play up on women\u2019s fears,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it again this election cycle. They used it very effectively in 2012. Unfortunately, in 2012, we never pushed back. We allowed Democrats to categorize women as single-issue voters, to categorize women as caring only about reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nShe said the other problem is how the right presents its messaging.\n\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t respond well to judgmental kinds of commentary,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cWomen like to be persuaded by other women they know. I think our tone has to be empathetic. I think it has to be non-judgmental. I think we have to engage women in a grassroots effort.\u201d\n\nThe Unlocking Potential Project is focused on getting conservative women to intentionally engage their friends, co-workers and fellow church members in thoughtful discussions of the issues. Fiorina said the 2012 campaign showed that connecting on a personal level is the key to victory.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, Mitt Romney won on every issue the exit polling data shows,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he lost by 62 points on the question of \u2018cares about someone like me.\u2019 Had he lost that question by 30 points he\u2019d be president.\u201d\n\nGet \u201cWhat Women Really Want,\u201d a call to women across this great land to wake up and take a stand against the cultural forces that are fighting tooth-and-nail to destroy their spirit and their families \u2013 at the WND Superstore!\n\nFiorina said one good place to start chipping away at that chasm is to engage women on all the issues they care about.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not an interest group,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re a majority of the country. Women care about every issue. They care about job creation. They care about health care. They care about terrorism. They care about security. They care about education, etc. One of the things we need to do is stop talking at high-level policy and start talking in a way that connects to a personal life.\u201d\n\nShe then used the example of taxation and regulation, suggesting an abstract discussion would do little good but for a woman interested in starting her own business, those issues could be intensely personal.\n\n\u201cIn some states, it\u2019ll take you 472 days to get through all the regulations and the permits. You might give up. That\u2019s more than a year,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cIf you make it through that process, you\u2019re going to confront a tax code that\u2019s extremely complex, thousands of pages. You might give up again because you can\u2019t afford an accountant and a lawyer. That\u2019s the impact at a personal level of over-taxation and over-regulation. That\u2019s the way we have to speak to women, in a way that connects to their lives and their issues.\u201d\n\nFiorina said the perceived lack of personal empathy and the actual lack of an effective ground game are the two biggest impediments for the right in engaging women with conservative ideas. She asserted that the only way for conservatives and Republicans to narrow the gender gap is to change minds one at a time. She said doing the same thing cycle after cycle and hoping for different results is never going to work.\n\n\u201cIf our party talks way up in the air, if our party comes across as judgmental, as lacking in empathy, as lacking in understanding of people\u2019s real issues and problems,\u201d she said, \u201cthen we\u2019re going to lose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Conservatives have facts and logic on their side but will not get anywhere with female voters until those principles are combined with empathy and an explanation of how their ideas would help the lives of individual people, according to former Hewlett-Packard CEO and former U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina.
