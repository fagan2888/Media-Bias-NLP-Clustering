As Mountain State residents are flooded with news of who is throwing a hat in the ring for the governor’s office in 2016, there is another important election gaining attention.

The office of President of the United States is up in 2016, and while it’s unclear who will be the frontrunners — West Virginians are seeing red.

According to a survey by Orion Strategies, a strategic communications firm in Charleston, 58 percent of West Virginians would vote for an unspecified Republican candidate for president in the 2016 General Election.

A telephone survey, 406 “likely voters” responded from 54 counties.

Partisan registration among respondents was 52 percent Democratic, 34 percent Republican and 14 percent Independent, according to Orion.

While the respondents said they’d vote GOP, Donald Trump holds a commanding lead among Republican presidential candidates, according to the Orion Strategies poll. Twenty-nine percent of respondents said they would vote for Trump, compared to just eight percent for his closest challenger, Marco Rubio.

However, according to national polls the Democratic nominee, likely Clinton, would be the frontrunner.

Another poll released Aug. 26 indicated the race for governor in the Democratic primary is almost tied between Senate Minority Leader Jeff Kessler, D-Marshall, and Jim Justice, billionaire coal baron and owner of The Greenbrier Resort.

The poll was conducted by Prism Surveys August 21 of voters who were likely to vote given vote history and who also indicated when asked if they were very likely to vote in next year’s Democratic primary. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.21 percent.

The IVR poll of 900 completed surveys shows the informed vote to be 28 percent for Justice and 26 percent for Kessler. Voters were told that some people were concerned about Kessler’s proposal to raise cigarette taxes and his support of gay marriage and the legalization of medical marijuana. Justice was defined as a coal baron whose mines have dozens of safety violations that are often unpaid as well as vendors and workers not being paid.

“I’m pleased, but not surprised by the poll results,” Kessler said in a news release from his campaign office. “I’ve always known that when given the facts about each candidate, voters wouldn’t be swayed by money and celebrities. As I continue campaigning and talking to people about real issues and real solutions facing real West Virginians my message and support will continue to grow. Our future needs a decisive plan of action, not just meaningless declarations of love for the state.”

Senate President Bill Cole, R-Mercer, is running for governor as the Republican candidate.
