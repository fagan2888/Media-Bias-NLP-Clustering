Advocates launched a series of online ads last week to begin raising awareness. Still, it could take years for the effort to yield any results.\n\n\u201cHaving choice helps me feel I have some control.\u201d\n\nSince the early 1990s, lawmakers and activists have tried and failed several times to pass a death with dignity law in California. Under such a law doctors could prescribe lethal medications to patients who are terminally ill. Oregon and Washington permit the practice.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a large state. It\u2019s a politically complicated state,\u201d says Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion and Choices. Her advocacy group is leading the effort to try again to pass a law through the legislature or ballot proposition that would make aid in dying accessible in California.\n\nCoombs Lee says most people want the prescription not to take the drug \u2014 but just to have it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s having the medication that gives them the sense of comfort and control, peace of mind. They call it their security blanket, their insurance policy,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s what it comes down to for San Mateo resident Jennifer Glass. When she was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, her mind immediately raced to a vision of a messy, chaotic death.\n\n\u201cThe idea that my life is going to end was not so frightening to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea that I might drown in my own lung fluid while my family watches me suffer. That is terrifying.\n\nGlass, 50, says at least having the option of controlling when and how she dies would bring her peace.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can prepare you for when you\u2019re doctor looks you in the eye and tells you, \u2018you have cancer,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut having choice helps me feel I have some control over a situation that is uncontrollable.\u201d\n\nHer cancer is being managed now. But with California\u2019s fraught history over this issue, it will take some time to see results.\n\n\u201cThe time is now,\u201d says Coombs Lee. \u201cWe all together have made a commitment to see aid in dying accessible, transparent, available to Californians within five years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Group trying for passage of law -- in Legislature or via ballot -- to permit physician-assisted suicide.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California 'Death with Dignity' Advocates Launch New Campaign\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/04\\/07\\/death-with-dignity-advocates-launch-new-campaign-for-physician-assisted-suicide-in-california\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-07 09:29:16\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-04-09 12:01:16\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":18553,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"End of Life Care\",\"Physician-assisted Suicide\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/blogs.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/files\\/2014\\/04\\/Jennifer-Glass-March-2013-chemo.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Group trying for passage of law -- in Legislature or via ballot -- to permit physician-assisted suicide.", "title": "California \u2018Death with Dignity\u2019 Advocates Launch New Campaign", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/04/07/death-with-dignity-advocates-launch-new-campaign-for-physician-assisted-suicide-in-california/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/04/Jennifer-Glass-March-2013-chemo-640x529.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "end of life care,physician-assisted suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc09e\"", "article_summary": "When she was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, her mind immediately raced to a vision of a messy, chaotic death.\n\u201cHaving choice helps me feel I have some control.\u201dSince the early 1990s, lawmakers and activists have tried and failed several times to pass a death with dignity law in California.\n\u201cBut having choice helps me feel I have some control over a situation that is uncontrollable.\u201dHer cancer is being managed now.\nA new campaign is underway to legalize physician-assisted suicide in California.\nHer advocacy group is leading the effort to try again to pass a law through the legislature or ballot proposition that would make aid in dying accessible in California."}
