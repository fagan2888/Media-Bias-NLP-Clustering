Since 2011, Dan has taken in 11 motherless, baby squirrels. The first one, (nicknamed \u201cSquirrely\u201d), showed up on a rainy, spring night, barely alive. After O\u2019Connor successfully nursed Squirrely back from the grave, friends and neighbors started bringing Dan any and all orphaned squirrels they found.\n\nOne year, Dan \u2014 who lives in North Hudson, Wisconsin \u2014 woke up to find a box on his deck. Inside were four baby orphaned squirrels along with a note that said, \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor commented on that experience.\n\n\u201cThat was tough. I lost a lot of sleep with them because four is a handful. I\u2019ve never smelled more like spoiled milk in my life.\u201d\n\nThe squirrels that end up with Dan have usually lost their mothers to cars, dogs, power lines, etc. When he receives the squirrels, Dan\u2019s regimen involves keeping them safe in a small cage in his garage. Even though he pulls 12 hour shifts at work, O\u2019Connor figured out a way to bottle feed all the squirrels five times per day. Once they are large enough, Dan switches the squirrels to solid food, and finally coaxes them back into a life in the wild. However, for three of the 11 squirrels, a life in the wild meant living in squirrel-sized tree houses Dan built in his yard.\n\nDan says that he can recognize his former wards when he visits the places where he\u2019s released them. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the squirrels recognize him in turn.\n\n\u201cAfter a week or so of being on their own, they\u2019re completely wild. They\u2019re like \u2018who are you?\u2019 It\u2019s a feel-good story, and it makes me feel good. The first one, Squirrely -\u2013 the day I let him go, he was so scared, and I was so sad. So it\u2019s stressful sometimes, but it\u2019s also rewarding. I know I\u2019ve done the right thing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, untrained individuals who find orphaned animals should never try to rehabilitate them. However, Dan says that every time a squirrel has shown up on his doorstep, he just hasn\u2019t had the heart to turn them away.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t just going to let them die. I don\u2019t collect squirrels, and I don\u2019t have squirrels for pets. I don\u2019t want anybody having squirrels for pets, and I don\u2019t want anybody taking baby squirrels out of their nest. The only thing I did was save their lives. Every baby squirrel I\u2019ve ever had was motherless and headed for the tunnel of light. Every one of them would have died; I\u2019m 100 percent sure of it. The whole idea was to get them out the door.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Should \u201cuntrained\u201d individuals like Dan be taking in orphaned animals to nurse them back to health, or should they leave it to professionals? Or perhaps they shouldn\u2019t get involved at all and let nature takes its course?
