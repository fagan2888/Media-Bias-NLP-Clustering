Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but he is also keenly aware that many in his own party \u2014 and many Americans, frankly \u2014 are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office. Even he is not sure how a deeply divided nation would adjust to the first 100 days of a Trump presidency.\n\nWhat he does know, however, is what he wants to do in those early months. In a series of recent interviews, he sketched out plans that include showdowns with business leaders over jobs and key roles for military generals, executives and possibly even family members in advising him about running the country.\n\nShortly after the Nov. 8 election, President-elect Trump and his vice president \u2014 most likely a governor or member of Congress \u2014 would begin interviewing candidates for the open Supreme Court seat and quickly settle on a nominee in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nHe would start \u201cbuilding a government based on relationships,\u201d perhaps inviting the Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan and Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-a-Lago over golf and two-pound lobsters.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, he would go to a \u201cbeautiful\u201d gala ball or two, but focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and calling up corporate executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd by the end of his first 100 days as the nation\u2019s 45th leader, the wall with Mexico would be designed, the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place, the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion.\n\n\u201cI know people aren\u2019t sure right now what a President Trump will be like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut things will be fine. I\u2019m not running for president to make things unstable for the country.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times interviewed Mr. Trump three times over the past two months, most recently on Saturday, as well as several campaign advisers and Trump confidants.\n\nThe possibility of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 an outcome that once seemed fanciful \u2014 became less remote on Tuesday night when his main challenger, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, quit the race. On Wednesday, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said he would withdraw too.\n\nDespite his radical vision of how to remake America, and all his outrageous talk on juvenile subjects like his anatomy \u2014 to say nothing of the polls showing him behind Hillary Clinton \u2014 Jan. 20 may find the most underestimated politician in America assuming the presidency.\n\nWhile professing some surprise at his success, Mr. Trump increasingly sounds like a man who thinks he knows where he will be eight months from now, and the unrivaled power he will hold. He talked of turning the Oval Office into a high-powered board room, empowering military leaders over foreign affairs specialists in national security debates, and continuing to speak harshly about adversaries. He may post on Twitter less, but everyone will still know what he thinks.\n\n\u201cAs president, I\u2019ll be working from the first day with my vice president and staff to make clear that America will be changing in major ways for the better,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview on Saturday. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to waste time. I want a vice president who will help me have a major impact quickly on Capitol Hill, and the message will be clear to the nation and to people abroad that the American government will be using its power differently.\u201d\n\nBut he also acknowledged that he might face significant and incessant protests \u2014 even thousands of demonstrators massing on the National Mall as he takes the oath of office nearby at the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump said he would try to unite Republicans and disaffected Democrats and independents over the next six months before the November election, and then work in office to show Americans that his chief interest was fighting for their needs. He argued that the fact that he would not have to rely on wealthy donors to finance his campaign would ultimately prove appealing to many voters as they realize he is not \u201cbought and paid for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know everyone won\u2019t like everything I do, but I\u2019m not running to be everyone\u2019s favorite president,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThings are seriously wrong in this country. People are hurting, business is hurting. I\u2019m running to move quickly to make big changes.\u201d\n\nSeveral friends and allies of Mr. Trump said that \u201cnegotiating\u201d was the word he used the most to encapsulate his first 100 days in office. He wants to put strong-willed people \u2014 business executives and generals are mentioned most often \u2014 in charge of cabinet agencies and throughout his senior staff, and direct them to negotiate deals and plans with congressional leaders and state officials, as well as insurance companies and others in the private sector. They say he will accomplish the things he has promised or else keep trying, well aware that his supporters will have his head if he does not.\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to depart from the agenda he\u2019s laid out, not a bit,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime adviser and confidant. Mr. Stone declined to describe details of his private conversations with Mr. Trump, except to say: \u201cHaving gone out a thousand times to say \u2018I\u2019m going to build a wall,\u2019 he has to build a wall. He has said he would scrap trade deals; his voters will demand he scrap trade deals. He knows that.\u201d\n\nModern America has never seen anything like a Trump administration. Business leaders and even entertainment figures new to politics have been elected governors, of course, and insurgents like Newt Gingrich rose to power.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime":
