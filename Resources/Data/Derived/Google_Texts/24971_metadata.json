The GOP will call up the Employee Health Care Protection Act, which would allow companies to continue offering any group market insurance plan through the end of 2018, as long as it existed before Obamacare took effect.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s broken healthcare promises have left millions of Americans with cancelled plans, unaffordable costs, and lost access to trusted doctors,\u201d Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the bill\u2019s sponsor, said Friday. \u201cThe president and Obamacare supporters first didn\u2019t read the bill, and now they continue to ignore these realities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis commonsense bill simply holds the president to his promise that you can keep the health plan you had and liked,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis commonsense bill simply holds the president to his promise\u2026\u201d Share:\n\nCassidy added that while millions of plans have already been canceled, some have warned that small businesses will start to be affected beginning in October.\n\nNext week\u2019s debate and vote will likely be the last chance for Republicans to make their case against Obamacare in Congress before the mid-term election. The GOP has made Obamacare the poster child for government overreach as well as government incompetence in this year\u2019s election.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are likely to argue that Republicans are wasting more time trying to change a law they oppose, in a way the Senate and White House don\u2019t support.\n\nBut Republicans have said Obama\u2019s unwillingness to work with Congress to deal with Obamacare\u2019s many problems is exactly why the House has to work on its own. Obama has made several tweaks to the law unilaterally, angering Republicans who want the chance to make changes through legislation.\n\nJust before leaving for the August break, the House approved a resolution authorizing House Speaker to file a civil suit against the administration over its implementation of the law.\n\n\u2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans next week will pass legislation aimed at making President Barack Obama's famous promise come true: \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\"  That line from Obama was named the political lie of the year in 2013 by PolitiFact, as it quickly became...", "title": "Can Republicans Make Obama\u2019s \u2018If You Like Your Health Care Plan\u2019 Promise Come True?", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/06/can-republicans-make-obamas-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-promise-come-true/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/600x4113.jpg", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "barack, obama, obamacare, health, insurance, congress", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, congress, government, obamacare, the-furnace, the-furnance, author-pete-kasperowicz, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 58, "gplus-count": 1, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/861545", "categories": "barack-obama,congress,obamacare,the-furnance,government,the-furnace", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 96, "description": "House Republicans next week will pass legislation aimed at making President Barack Obama's famous promise come true: \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\"  That line from Obama was named the political lie of the year in 2013 by PolitiFact, as it quickly became...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 1, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "House Republicans next week will pass legislation aimed at making President Barack Obama's famous promise come true: \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\"  That line from Obama was named the political lie of the year in 2013 by PolitiFact, as it quickly became...", "title": "Can Republicans Make Obama\u2019s \u2018If You Like Your Health Care Plan\u2019 Promise Come True?", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/06/can-republicans-make-obamas-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-promise-come-true/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/600x4113.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 411}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-09-06T13:33:22+00:00", "twitter-count": 85}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb06f\"", "article_summary": "Obama has made several tweaks to the law unilaterally, angering Republicans who want the chance to make changes through legislation.\nBut in the House at least, members will have a chance to approve legislation that turns that lie into a true statement.\nBut Republicans have said Obama\u2019s unwillingness to work with Congress to deal with Obamacare\u2019s many problems is exactly why the House has to work on its own.\nThe GOP has made Obamacare the poster child for government overreach as well as government incompetence in this year\u2019s election.\nNext week\u2019s debate and vote will likely be the last chance for Republicans to make their case against Obamacare in Congress before the mid-term election."}
