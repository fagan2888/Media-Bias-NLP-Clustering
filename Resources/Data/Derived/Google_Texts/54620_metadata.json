Fast forward through three years of radiation and chemotherapy treatments, and Mortimer, who goes by his rap name \u201cYoung Jay,\u201d is right where we wants to be: performing with his group \u201cLDL 365\u201d and signing a record deal with Sony.\n\n\"He reminds me every single day to live life to the fullest,\" a children\u2019s specialist with Palm Beach Children\u2019s Hospital, Brittany Williams told WPBF. \u201cJeff comes on the mike and our hearts and our jaws just dropped all of us.\u201d\n\nAlthough he is currently battling a relapse following his three years of radiation and chemo, Mortimer remains positive on his outlook on life and even works to inspire young people in similar situations. He helped pilot a music program at Palm Beach Children\u2019s Hospital to assist young musicians battling cancer with achieving their goals. Now that Mortimer\u2019s doctors are switching him from intravenous chemotherapy treatments to a pill form, he is excited to start touring with \u201cLDL 365,\u201d which stands for \u201cLiving the Life 365 Days A Year.\"\n\n\"Life is too short; you can't stay sad all day,\" Mortimer told WPBF. \"We struggle 365 days of the year, so why not live the life as long as we're struggling 365? Life really don't wait for no one so whatever happens and doors that open, take them, go for it, try it. You learn something new every day.\"\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, spindle cell sarcoma, also known as soft tissue sarcoma, is a type of cancer that develops from certain tissues like bone or muscle.
