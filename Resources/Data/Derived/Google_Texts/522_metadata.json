Counterintuitive, since one of the things we think we know about alcohol is that it provides truly empty calories, which generally speaking cause weight gain (see, for example, soda).\n\nWith seven calories per gram, alcohol is way more caloric than sugar and other carbs, all of which contain four, and less so than fat (nine). But those in alcohol are metabolized differently, and some studies have shown that moderate drinkers ingesting the same level of calories as non-drinkers (and heavy drinkers) may gain less weight over time. Moderate levels of alcohol may also protect against heart disease.\n\nLife is complicated, and drinking for health is a lame rationalization, but drinking itself . . . well, we do it because we like it. Medical discussions about drinking rarely touch on hangovers, an important consequence for serious drinkers, which I\u2019ve had more times than I\u2019d like to think about. The point is that if we\u2019re reasonably responsible individuals, these are private matters whose consequences are borne by ourselves.\n\nWe drink because we want to, not because it\u2019s good for us. Whether or not you believe that alcohol is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy (a paraphrase of a quote usually attributed to Ben Franklin), it\u2019s clear that alcohol can bring both joy and pain.\n\nThis is also true of many other things in life, but with alcohol, many of us forgive the self-indulgence. That\u2019s almost official policy, in one way: A bottle of soda has a nutrition label; a bottle of vodka does not. These are calories you\u2019re probably not counting.\n\nStill, we feel guilty: Two-thirds of us drink, and many of us either underestimate the amount we do or actually lie about it. In Britain, for example, drinking reported to health professionals accounts for only about 60 percent of the alcohol sold. I lie to my doctors about drinking, because by official standards I drink too much and I don\u2019t want to be scolded.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that men drink too much when we consume 15 \u201cdrinks\u201d a week (a drink is a 5-ounce glass of wine, a shot of spirits or a beer); women get to have only eight. (Women generally weigh less than men, and alcohol may have more ill effects on women.) You also drink too much if you consume five drinks within three hours; that\u2019s a binge. And, according to the CDC, one drink is one too many for people younger than 21. Which is absurd, even if it\u2019s the law.\n\nThe CDC flatly says drinking too much is \u201cdangerous,\u201d which is pretty vague, and can \u201clead to heart disease, breast cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, sudden infant death syndrome, motor-vehicle crashes, and violence.\u201d\n\nMany of these dangerous effects are indirect and can be mitigated: If you don\u2019t have sex or get into a car after drinking, you can\u2019t possibly get pregnant or in a car accident. (One thing about drinking alcohol, though: It can cause bad judgment.) The more direct ones, like heart disease and breast cancer, have so many risk factors that drinking may perhaps be discounted, especially in moderation. And there\u2019s evidence that drinking \u201cthe right amount\u201d \u2014 less than \u201ctoo much\u201d \u2014 can be good for you. But that amount varies wildly from one individual to the next.\n\nSo it\u2019s crazy to say, as people do, \u201cI drink red wine because it\u2019s better for you than white,\u201d because mostly people drink to get buzzed, or drunk, because bad judgment is a release or fun or both.\n\nOf course there are people who really drink too much, and we should continue to discourage overconsumption, but once again when it comes to public health we fail to prioritize correctly.\n\nThe CDC says that excessive alcohol consumption causes 88,000 deaths a year and \u201ccosts the economy about $224 billion.\u201d Obesity-related illnesses cause somewhere around 112,000 deaths, and cost maybe a trillion dollars.\n\nYou don\u2019t see the CDC saying that people younger than 21 \u201cdrink too much\u201d if they consume a can of soda. But it should.\n\nMark Bittman is a contributing op-ed writer for The New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/hfnutri23.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "(One thing about drinking alcohol, though: It can cause bad judgment.)\nWhether or not you believe that alcohol is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy (a paraphrase of a quote usually attributed to Ben Franklin), it\u2019s clear that alcohol can bring both joy and pain.\nIn Britain, for example, drinking reported to health professionals accounts for only about 60 percent of the alcohol sold.\nLife is complicated, and drinking for health is a lame rationalization, but drinking itself .\nThis is also true of many other things in life, but with alcohol, many of us forgive the self-indulgence."}
