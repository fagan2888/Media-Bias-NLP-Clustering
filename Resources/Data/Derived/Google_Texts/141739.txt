Infographic: The Ripple Effect of the Hobby Lobby Decision

The U.S. Supreme Court issued a controversial, split decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. on June 30, 2014, that allowed the owners of closely held for-profit corporations to exclude certain types of health care services and products—in this case, contraceptive counseling and methods—from their employees’ health insurance plans. That decision could set in motion a potential landslide of additional lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act, and an increasing number of Americans may be affected.

The Obama administration has issued new rules to ensure that women covered by employer-based insurance are able to access all forms of contraception that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, without cost sharing. However, it is up to Congress to find a broader fix so that this misguided decision does not affect millions more Americans.
