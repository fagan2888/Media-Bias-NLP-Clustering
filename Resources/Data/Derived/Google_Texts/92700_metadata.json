Dem governor Steve Beshear is perhaps the most outspoken defender of the Affordable Care Act in the south. This, in a deep red state where the reform known as \u201cObamacare\u201d is deeply unpopular; where the leading foe of the President\u2019s agenda is on the ballot this year; and where the need for reform is urgent.\n\nIn an interview today, Beshear offered fellow Dems \u2014 red state and otherwise \u2014 some startling advice: Stand up for Obamacare because it\u2019s the right thing to do. What\u2019s more, Beshear insists, Republicans are wrong: the health law will be a political positive for Dems next fall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d Beshear told me. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important point here. The people of America, and the people of Kentucky, deserve access to affordable health care. For the first time in the history of this country, we have a tool that allows us to accomplish this goal.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and some pundits will scoff at the idea that Dems \u2014 particularly in red states \u2014 should stand up for Obamacare. And it\u2019s true that polls show Obamacare \u2014 and the president \u2014 with a woefully low approval rating in Kentucky. Meanwhile, Republicans are banking on continuing headlines about canceled plans and higher premiums \u2014 perhaps followed by other problems.\n\nAsked to respond, Beshear urged a longer view. \u201cThis issue is going to look a lot different in November 2014 than it looks today,\u201d he said. \u201cBy November 2014, these exchanges will be working smoothly, and the world will not have come to an end. The ACA doesn\u2019t affect 80 percent. By November of next year, they are going to know that. Right now some are afraid because of misinformation. By November they will know it\u2019s not going to do anything to them. The other 20 percent are going to be happy, for the most part, with what they find.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general this issue is going to be a winner for Democrats by November of 2014 \u2014 whether you\u2019re in a red state or a blue state,\u201d Beshear said.\n\nIf so, shouldn\u2019t Dems stand up for the law right now? \u201cPeople respond to an office holder or candidate who takes strong positions, even if sometimes they are momentarily controversial,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are looking for folks they can consider leaders even if they don\u2019t agree with them on everything.\u201d\n\nBeshear \u2014 who has presided over successful implementation in Kentucky \u2014 acknowledged that Obama\u2019s unpopularity would remain, but said the law itself could escape that. \u201cJust the phrase \u2018Obamacare\u2019 in states where the president isn\u2019t popular brings a very negative reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you start talking about Kynect, our website here, and the program we\u2019re implementing, those numbers start shifting. I would predict that next November, the phrase \u2018Obamacare\u2019 still won\u2019t be popular. But our local efforts and the health care program itself will not be a defining issue.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell\u2019s opponent \u2014 Alison Lundergran Grimes \u2014 has been far more cautious in defending Obamacare. She doesn\u2019t go out of her way to talk about the law and she embraced a mandate delay, though she does stand up for the need to preserve its expanded coverage to Kentuckians.\n\nBeshear said Grimes\u2019 approach to the law \u2014 her low key \u201ckeep and fix\u201d message, as opposed to the GOP repeal stance \u2014 is more in tune with the state\u2019s desire for the parties to work constructively together. \u201cPeople in Kentucky are tired of shouting matches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one of the unhealthiest populations here in Kentucky. This is our chance to do something about it. Her comments so far have been in that vein: there may be issues here but don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had a message for GOP governors who were still opting out of the Medicaid expansion, Beshear said:\n\n\u201cThis is a moral issue. Every person in the country deserves access to affordable health coverage. The Medicaid expansion is part of the way we can do that. These folks out here without insurance aren\u2019t a group of aliens from another planet. They are our friends and neighbors. They are people we shop and go to church with. They are the farmers out on the tractors. They are our grocery clerks. They are our former classmates. They are people who go to work every morning praying they don\u2019t get sick. No one deserves to live that way.\u201d\n\nBeshear urged fiscally minded governors to have outside analysts conduct studies of how the expansion would impact their states. \u201cGo get objective experts and go find out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll get the same answer I got. I\u2019m confident of that. Don\u2019t just play politics with this issue. We\u2019re playing with the lives of people here and you\u2019ve got to look at it that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most outspoken defender of the Affordable Care Act in the south has some advice.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The most outspoken defender of the Affordable Care Act in the south has some advice.", "title": "Steve Beshear: Don\u2019t fear the politics of Obamacare, Dems", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/08/steve-beshear-dont-fear-the-politics-of-obamacare-dems/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/Images/201312/11342193.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/08/steve-beshear-dont-fear-the-politics-of-obamacare-dems/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "steve beshear, Kentucky, mitch McConnell, Alison lundergan grimes, obamacare, affordable care act, Kentucky senate race,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "steve beshear, Kentucky, mitch McConnell, Alison lundergan grimes, obamacare, affordable care act, Kentucky senate race,"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe57cb\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s more, Beshear insists, Republicans are wrong: the health law will be a political positive for Dems next fall.\nIn an interview today, Beshear offered fellow Dems \u2014 red state and otherwise \u2014 some startling advice: Stand up for Obamacare because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)The rollout of Obamacare in Kentucky may represent the most interesting experiment in the politics of health care in the country right now.\nIf so, shouldn\u2019t Dems stand up for the law right now?\nDem governor Steve Beshear is perhaps the most outspoken defender of the Affordable Care Act in the south."}
