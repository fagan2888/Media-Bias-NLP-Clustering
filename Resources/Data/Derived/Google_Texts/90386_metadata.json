He\u2019s also a member of Lakewood\u2019s SWAT unit.\n\nChavez has run several marathons, as well as the Bolder Boulder and races in San Francisco, Chicago and Istanbul.\n\nIn October, Chavez ran the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Denver Marathon, pushing Luke Olmsted, an Alameda sophomore with cerebral palsy, the length of the route in a three-wheeled carrier.\n\nIn fundraising efforts tied to the April 21 Boston race, Chavez has raised $15,000 locally, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited,\u201d Chavez said of his fundraising and opportunity in Boston, where the 2013 finish was marred by a tragic bombing. \u201cYou can\u2019t set up a better marathon, something you want to be involved with this year, than the Boston Marathon. Running with folks who are affected by the bombing \u2014 how impactful is that?\u201d\n\nChavez said raising money for cancer is a way to pay respect to an old friend and mentor, Philip McClelland, who died of cancer in 2006.\n\nBefore his death, McClelland made Chavez promise to fight cancer.\n\n\u201cCancer beat him. He hoped I would help others fight cancer,\u201d Chavez recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things words can\u2019t describe, the overwhelming feeling\u201d of helping others.\n\nA second promise McClelland, on his death bed, asked Chavez to keep: \u201cThat my tears would dry when the sun rises the next day.\u201d\n\nRunning, raising money and helping others comes easy, Chavez said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing.\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lakewood cop to run Boston Marathon, raise funds to fight cancer", "title": "Lakewood cop to run Boston Marathon, raise funds to fight cancer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/09/lakewood-cop-to-run-boston-marathon-raise-funds-to-fight-cancer/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140409__20140410_A2_CD09MOOSEp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140409__20140410_A2_CD09MOOSEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-09T14:52:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:56:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf29f\"", "article_summary": "A cop from Lakewood will soon be pounding the pavement in Boston when he runs in the 118th Boston Marathon this month.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t set up a better marathon, something you want to be involved with this year, than the Boston Marathon.\nHe hoped I would help others fight cancer,\u201d Chavez recalled.\nIn fundraising efforts tied to the April 21 Boston race, Chavez has raised $15,000 locally, he said.\nLakewood police Officer Jesus \u201cMoose\u201d Chavez, a 13-year veteran of the department, is among 24 officers nationwide running in part to raise funds for Cops for Kids With Cancer."}
