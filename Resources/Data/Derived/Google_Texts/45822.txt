Last week, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services announced the awarding of Affordable Care Act funding of $250,000 to the Arrington-based Blue Ridge Medical Center to establish or expand mental health and substance abuse treatment services.

The money will be used to provide additional counseling personnel and a contractual psychiatrist, according to executive director Peggy Whitehead.

A psychiatric nurse practitioner is “completely booked most of the time,” she said. “We need to create better access and we thought this was a better way to do that.”

Pediatricians at Blue Ridge also are seeing an increased need for pediatric behavioral health services in children, Whitehead said.

The money is in addition to two other awards given to the Blue Ridge Medical Center in the past few months through Affordable Care Act funding. In August, the center was awarded $250,000 to build a patient-education center. In September, the center received about $214,000 to hire a part-time dentist and a nurse practitioner.
