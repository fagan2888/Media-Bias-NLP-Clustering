It combines the medical center and the campus\u2019 current and projected financial plan for the entire $4.14 billion enterprise.\n\nThe good news is that UCSF\u2019s current financial performance exceeds projections that had been made for 2013, and the University continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, with $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and a projected increase over the next decade. Maintaining a strong bottom line allows the University to invest in capital projects and programs, buy new equipment and recruit top faculty.\n\nUCSF is prepared for the challenges ahead and is taking proactive measures to ensure it continues its mission of advancing health worldwide while maintaining its commitment to the highest standards of excellence across research, education and patient care.\n\n\u201cWe are in control. We understand the financial picture and we are in a good position for the future,\u201d says Sam Hawgood, MBBS, dean of the UCSF School of Medicine, who will become interim chancellor of UCSF on April 1, when Chancellor Susan Desmond-Hellmann, MD, MPH, becomes CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe University of California Regents approved the longtime UCSF leader to serve as interim chancellor while a national search is under way for Desmond-Hellmann\u2019s permanent replacement. Hawgood says campus leaders share a common vision that will enable them to confront the challenges ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have the tools, we have the data, and we are well-positioned, provided we make the right strategic decisions,\u201d Hawgood says.\n\nThat strategy is taking shape both for the big picture or long-term planning effort now underway, called UCSF 2.0, which will guide UCSF over the next decade, and the short-term clinical enterprise strategic plan that will require the medical center \u2014 like never before \u2014 to demonstrate its value as a provider of high-quality, cost-effective care.\n\nImportantly, UCSF\u2019s strategic priorities in support of patient care, research and education drive the financial planning process and decisions about how central resources are spent reflects the input from campus leaders and major stakeholders across the University, says John Plotts, senior vice chancellor of Finance and Administration.\n\n\u201cWhat is best for UCSF is paramount,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot let our attention be diverted from our priorities and execution.\u201d\n\nSam Hawgood, MBBS\n\nPlotts says it\u2019s important to be straightforward and transparent when communicating the financial challenges and opportunities ahead to faculty, staff and students.\n\nWithout a doubt, all members of the UCSF community will need to do their part to meet the financial challenges of a dynamic and highly competitive marketplace, Plotts says. Read more.\n\nFacing a Rapidly Changing Landscape\n\nWhile the 10-year operating projections show near-term deficits, they also anticipate recovery in subsequent years as the University adapts to an uncertain marketplace with continued expense control and enterprise-wide solutions that leverage talent, capital, space, and other assets.\n\nAbout 80 percent of UCSF\u2019s $4.14 billion revenue for 2012-2013 comes from or is dependent upon competitive and rapidly changing markets. The financial health of the clinical enterprise (which includes UCSF Medical Center, UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute and outpatient clinics) is extremely important to all of UCSF as it accounts for more than half of all revenues, or $2.164 billion, which includes millions that are invested across the campus every year.\n\nJohn Plotts\n\nAnd while UCSF has been able to trim its operating costs in recent years, 65 percent of UCSF\u2019s costs are personnel related: more than $2 billion in salaries and $543 million in benefits. Personnel costs, in particular the cost of pensions and other retiree benefits, are expected to rise over the next decade, outpacing the relatively modest projected revenue growth.\n\n\u201cWe know what is happening, and we are on it,\u201d Plotts says acknowledging that both the University and individual employees are already sharing the growing costs for benefits. \u201cWe are ahead of things. We are assertively planning.\u201d\n\nThe research enterprise contributes $1.1 billion, or 27 percent of UCSF\u2019s budget. This year, for the first time, all four UCSF schools \u2014 in dentistry, medicine, nursing and pharmacy \u2014 ranked first in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for research. UCSF received more than $517 million in total through contracts and grants in 2013, enabling scientists to continue their pioneering efforts to understand the underlying causes of such diseases as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, and work to develop improved therapies for them. Read the news release.\n\nOnce again, the news cements UCSF\u2019s ranking as the top NIH-funded public university in the country. \u201cIt says something about the confidence of the NIH has in our programs,\u201d Hawgood says. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a celebration of the quality of our science.\u201d\n\nUCSF can credit its relative success in NIH funding to its researchers submitting increasing numbers of grant applications, as well as to the high caliber of UCSF\u2019s research and grant application scores.\n\nBut the political climate in Washington D.C. that led to sequestration in 2013 forced the NIH to cut $1.55 billion from its budget, which was already showing signs that two decades of steady growth had ended. The cuts were felt immediately. Federal research funding overall at UCSF stayed flat in 2013, while the UC system as a whole dropped 12 percent, or $345 million.\n\nSequestration took a toll on faculty and students at UCSF. In a survey of UCSF faculty conducted in July 2013, two-thirds of respondents reported significant cuts to their existing federal award or contract. Additionally, 62 percent instituted hiring freezes in their labs and nearly 30 percent reported layoffs.\n\nEven without sequestration, research universities can no longer count on a steady increase in NIH grants and must look to new sources of funds. Similarly, California\u2019s beleaguered state budget continues to fund a smaller percentage of UCSF\u2019s budget, now just under 4 percent.\n\nChallenges Facing the Clinical Enterprise\n\nUCSF Medical Center, which accounts for more than half of the University\u2019s budget \u2014 $2.2 billion out of $4.1 billion \u2014 must adapt to new forces both internal and external. Implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) will exert pressure on all hospitals, including UCSF\u2019s, to rein in costs and provide increased access to services.\n\nAnd with UCSF opening a new integrated hospital complex for women, children and cancer patients in Mission Bay in February 2015, the medical center is projecting an increase in its operating costs but does not anticipate a corresponding increase in revenue for several years.\n\nWhile campus leaders anticipate the hospital will once again operate in the black in a few years, the medical center has implemented cuts in recent years to prepare for the lean times ahead. Last year, the medical center reduced its full-time equivalent staff by 300 positions, some due to layoffs and others by not filling vacant jobs.\n\n\u201cIt will be hard,\u201d says Mark Laret, chief executive officer of UCSF Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, on balancing the budget. \u201cWe will add new employees at Mission Bay before we have additional patients. That means we'll have additional expenses before we have the revenue to offset it.\u201d\n\nTo prepare for the challenges ahead, Hawgood and Laret are leading a clinical enterprise strategic planning effort, which is a three-pronged approach to managing the medical center in the next few years. The plan involves achieving efficiencies and improving health and safety of patient care; establishing destination centers to market UCSF\u2019s clinical areas of excellence, such as organ transplants; and pursuing relationships to create a broad network of providers, such as its recent affiliation with Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland. Read more.\n\n\u201cWe need to demonstrate our value \u2013 high quality, cost-effective care to the outside world,\u201d Laret says. \u201cWe also need to expand access to care and grow volume and boost our position in the Bay Area marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe UCSF School of Dentistry also is adapting its clinical activities to compete in the ever-changing marketplace. The UCSF Dental Center runs 18 clinics, accounting for 120,000 patient visits each year, and $25 million in revenue, according to UCSF School of Dentistry Dean John D.B. Featherstone, MSc, PhD. While revenue is up 30 percent over the past five years, Featherstone says the clinics are looking at ways to increase those revenue streams.\n\nIncreasing Role of Philanthropy\n\nJohn Ford, vice chancellor of University Development and Alumni Relations, says the financial challenges should not dampen anyone\u2019s spirits, because UCSF has much to be proud of \u2014 including its role as the birthplace of the biotech industry, a faculty that boasts five Nobel laureates among hundreds of renowned researchers and clinicians, and thousands of patients served at its first-rate hospitals, with treatments developed in its research labs, and by graduates of its top-notch educational programs.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely committed to excellence. That\u2019s what has put us in the position we\u2019re in,\u201d Ford says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are the best public university in the health care arena. But we got here in a different age and with a different set of resources at our disposal. We\u2019re now in transition, and those resources are no longer as lucrative as they once were, and maintaining excellence is more expensive.\u201d\n\nPhilanthropy will play a more vital role than ever before in helping UCSF realize its vision of becoming the world's preeminent health sciences innovator. Already the University has raised $450 million towards its $600 million goal for funding the new 289-bed children's, women's and cancer hospital complex at Mission Bay, a $1.5 billion project. That includes $100 million from Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne, and $50 million announced in January from Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and his wife Betty.\n\nIn the past, philanthropy has been important at UCSF, but was more \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d because of such strong support from government sources, Ford says. Now UCSF must join other major public universities, from UC Berkeley and UCLA to those in Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia and Texas, in aggressively seeking large gifts.\n\nHaving established a strong philanthropic track record in many of the capital campaigns in Mission Bay over the past decade, UCSF is now encouraging \u201cmore and more faculty to begin to think of private philanthropy for the funding of their programs,\u201d Ford says.\n\nFor deans, fundraising is part of the job. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever before,\u201d says Featherstone, noting that he spends about 20 percent of his time pursuing philanthropic efforts.\n\nInvesting in the Future\n\nThe UCSF 10-year financial forecast tempers its frank assessment of the challenges of a changing world with positive signs that UCSF is working on multiple fronts to secure new funds to support its public mission.\n\nFor students across the campus, Jeff Bluestone, PhD, executive vice chancellor and provost, says UCSF \u201ccontinues to put our resources into backing up our commitment to provide high quality, effective education at a reasonable cost.\u201d\n\nJeff Bluestone, PhD\n\nA gift of $30 million last fall from Sir Michael Moritz, KBE, and his wife Harriet Heyman, establishing the $60 million UCSF Discovery Fellows Program, exemplifies this commitment. The gift recognizes the critical role doctoral students play in fueling biomedical research and is the largest endowed program for PhD students in the history of the 10-campus University of California.

Whether it\u2019s offering free health screenings or organizing a Bay Area wide science fair, UCSF has a major economic impact on region and the state. In a special report the University commissioned in 2010, Economic & Planning Systems Inc. of Berkeley found that UCSF generated more than 39,000 jobs and produced an estimated $6.2 billion economic impact when including operations, construction, salaries, and local purchases by employees, students and visitors.\n\nThat figure has likely grown dramatically over the past four years, as UCSF continues to invest in the Mission Bay and Parnassus campuses.\n\nOne key fact that is hard to see in a static budget, which amounts to a snapshot in time, is what interim chancellor Hawgood calls \u201cthe ongoing dynamic reinvestment in our missions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to reinvest large amounts of money back into our programs \u2014 educational programs, clinical programs, research programs and community programs \u2014 year after year after year,\u201d Hawgood says. \u201cA single pie chart tells you where your revenues are or where you spend them, but it doesn\u2019t tell you that we\u2019re investing a lot in our future.\u201d\n\nBluestone says that the long-term UCSF 2.0 planning initiative includes a mandate to \u201cbe ecumenical in all areas,\u201d and he points to collaborations not only among the schools, but also between the schools and the medical center to reinforce the \u201cOne UCSF\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge concept, and one we have to build upon more,\u201d says Featherstone.\n\nFeatherstone says the five deans \u2014 he along with Hawgood, Guglielmo, David Vlahov, dean of the School of Nursing, and Elizabeth Watkins, dean of the Graduate Division, \u2014 meet frequently as a group, look for areas of potential collaboration and mutually beneficial faculty recruitment, and help each other out whenever possible.\n\nThe UCSF Program in Craniofacial and Mesenchymal Biology is a prime example; while the program is in the School of Dentistry, its director Ophir Klein, MD, PhD, does not have a degree in dentistry. The Center to Address Disparities in Oral Health \u2014 known as CAN DO \u2014 is a multidisciplinary effort including the schools of dentistry, nursing and medicine. The newly opened Walgreens store on the Parnassus campus is a venture among the School of Pharmacy and UCSF Medical Center.\n\nUCSF\u2019s leadership in advancing the field of precision medicine also figures prominently in this \u201cOne UCSF\u201d effort. Precision medicine is an emerging field that aims to harness technology, science and medical records to better understand the roots of disease, develop targeted therapies and prevent disease.\n\n\u201cAs we go forward in precision medicine, which is going to be a highlight of UCSF 2.0, we will bring all of those resources together,\u201d Bluestone says. \u201cWe will deliver care to individuals that\u2019s more effective for people, both cost-wise and clinically. We will have opportunities for research that we have never had, across disciplines. And there will be a greater chance for people to do research in impactful ways.\u201d\n\nUCSF 2.0 will also look to bring in new sources of revenue, Bluestone says, by \u201ctaking a more innovative approach to working not just with private industry \u2014 biotech, digital and the like \u2014 but also among our different constituent institutions, so we can create a larger impact and bring in more resources. That\u2019s a big idea that can have a big financial impact going forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Mothership (http://mothershipthe.me)", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/02/111891/finance-overview", "image": "https://www.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/styles/2014_news_items_grid/public/field/image/news/iStock_000004313957Medium_0.jpg?itok=JQyi44cB", "site_name": "UC San Francisco", "description": "As the worlds of health care, research and higher education undergo seismic economic shifts, UC San Francisco is uniquely well positioned to excel and even capitalize on the changes, University leaders say.", "title": "UCSF Well Positioned for the Future Amid Financial Challenges"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the worlds of health care, research and higher education undergo seismic economic shifts, UC San Francisco is uniquely well positioned to excel and even capitalize on the changes, University leaders say.", "title": "UCSF Well Positioned for the Future Amid Financial Challenges | UC San Francisco", "url": "https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/02/111891/finance-overview", "image": "https://www.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/styles/2014_news_items_grid/public/field/image/news/iStock_000004313957Medium_0.jpg?itok=JQyi44cB", "site": "@ucsf", "card": "summary"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "google-site-verification": "rSaM6CprJQndLnVGSxg0oZ-oB85lajeVcjE1fQzK1-I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "As the worlds of health care, research and higher education undergo seismic economic shifts, UC San Francisco is uniquely well positioned to excel and even capitalize on the changes, University leaders say."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22aa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt will be hard,\u201d says Mark Laret, chief executive officer of UCSF Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, on balancing the budget.\nThe newly opened Walgreens store on the Parnassus campus is a venture among the School of Pharmacy and UCSF Medical Center.\nIt combines the medical center and the campus\u2019 current and projected financial plan for the entire $4.14 billion enterprise.\nLast year, the medical center reduced its full-time equivalent staff by 300 positions, some due to layoffs and others by not filling vacant jobs.\nUCSF has an increased focus on its long-term financial and business planning, the details of which are spelled out in a new 10-year financial plan prepared by the University."}
