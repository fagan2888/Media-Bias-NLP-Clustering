Neurosurgeon Ben Carson has dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination for president.

Here are some of the greatest hits:

He’s no lightweight, he once pulled a knife on someone. “The person that I tried to stab,” he said in November, “I talked to today and said, ‘Would they want to be revealed?’ They were not anxious to be revealed, and it was a close relative of mine. I didn’t want to put their lives under the spotlight.”

A magic potion will get terrorists to talk. “Well, the average person might understand it as truth serum. But there are ways where you decrease a person’s conscious defenses and they’d be much more willing to give up information.”

Syrian refugees are like rabid dogs. “If there is a rabid dog running around your neighborhood, you’re probably not going to assume something good about that dog, and you’re probably gonna put your children out of the way,” he said, explaining why the U.S. shouldn’t allow Syrian refugees in. “Doesn’t mean that you hate all dogs by any stretch of the imagination.”

Who needs a war crime? “If you’re gonna have rules for war, you should just have a rule that says no war. Other than that, we have to win.”

No Muslims in the Oval. “I’m assuming that if you accept all the tenets of Islam that you would have a very difficult time abiding under the Constitution of the United States.”

If they only had some guns. “I think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.”

Health insurance? Slavery. “Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.”

It’s what’s on the inside. “There is no war on women,” he said. “There may be a war on what’s inside of women, but there is no war on women in this country.”

Being gay is a choice … “[b]ecause a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight— and when they come out, they’re gay.” (Carson later apologized)

Thanks for the memories!
