Matt Bevin\u2019s administration rolled Medicaid signups into the program as part of its efforts to dismantle Kynect, the state\u2019s health care exchange established under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut that process is clogging up the works, a former health cabinet official says, leading to hours-long wait times, overwhelmed state workers and frustrated consumers. Health care advocates are concerned the situation will lead to a drop in the number of Kentuckians signing up for health insurance and other entitlement programs.\n\nBevin blamed the backlogs on former Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s administration, which created the original version of Benefind but hadn\u2019t opened the program to the public before the end of his term.\n\n\u201cWe were told that it was, it had been double-checked, it was user-ready and it was time to unveil it. You have found out firsthand that it\u2019s not exactly as we expected it to be,\u201d Bevin said in a Youtube video addressed to employees of the Department for Community Based Services, which manages the program.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s frankly been scary in some measure, with just the onslaught of people that have been piling up, the amount of work that is at hand,\u201d Bevin said in the video.\n\nBenefind was launched at the end of February. In addition to Medicaid, it is the online portal for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Transitional Assistance Program and others.\n\nRelated Story Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance Programs\n\nThe state is in the process of phasing out Kynectors \u2014 the people whom it hired to help Kentuckians navigate the new health programs. Those workers used to do basic case management and sign up new enrollees to Medicaid and qualified health plans via Kynect.\n\nBut now, those who want help accessing Benefind have to go through the Department for Community Based Services phone bank.\n\nCara Stewart, a law fellow with Equal Justice Center and Kynector, said it takes more than two hours to get through to DCBS over the phone.\n\n\u201cI currently have been on hold for two hours and 43 minutes,\u201d Stewart said on Friday morning. \u201cAnd I\u2019m doing it because my clients don\u2019t have a home phone, they don\u2019t have a phone with unlimited minutes, they can\u2019t do this and they have day jobs that don\u2019t allow them to.\u201d\n\nDCBS phone banks also aren\u2019t open for as many hours under Bevin\u2019s watch.\n\nUnder the Beshear administration, DCBS workers were forced to work overtime to manage calls dealing with Kynect and Medicaid. Bevin rescinded that policy. In his budget address, the governor said the state employees were being overworked.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just limit the actual hours in which you can call in? Have a cut-off time for hours you can call?\u201d Bevin said.\n\nDCBS caseworkers now manage the phone bank between 8:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nFormer Health and Family Services Secretary Audrey Tayse Haynes, who helped establish Kynect as part of the Beshear administration, said Benefind wasn\u2019t designed to be the portal for Medicaid applicants, which is why the system is now overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cIt was never intended to accept Medicaid applications when you walk in the front door,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough Benefind and Kynect shared many eligibility functions, Haynes said Benefind was designed to complement the health insurance exchange. For example, Benefind initially sent users to the Kynect website for any health insurance-related issues.\n\nEmily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, said the Benefind backlogs are the result of the Bevin administration\u2019s decision to roll Medicaid duties into the system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to retrofit Benefind for Medicaid enrollment and it\u2019s not built, it\u2019s not designed for that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\nBeauregard estimated the changes have led to between 6,000 and 7,000 DCBS calls a day going unanswered.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the workforce to provide enrollment assistance, fewer people will have access to coverage, fewer people will be able to complete the application and get through the system and keep their coverage,\u201d she said.\n\nDoug Hogan, a spokesman for Bevin\u2019s Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said the claim that Benefind wasn\u2019t intended for Medicaid enrollment is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cBenefind is a $101.5 million system that was completely engineered by the previous administration,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt was designed to be a one-stop shop for all services, including Medicaid.\u201d\n\nBevin said by the end of this year, those who signed up for health insurance through Kynect would need to re-enroll through the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, if they still want insurance through the program.\n\nBevin is also working on a plan to \u201ctransform\u201d Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which currently makes people up to 138 percent of the poverty line eligible for the program. He has offered few details about his plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A former health cabinet official says the Bevin administration's decision to roll Medicaid into the state's welfare signup system is causing major delays.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "A former health cabinet official says the Bevin administration's decision to roll Medicaid into the state's welfare signup system is causing major delays.", "title": "As Bevin Dismantles Kynect, A Bumpy Rollout For Its Replacement", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1170, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kynect.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2016-03-27T20:07:50-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/bevin-dismantles-kynect-bumpy-rollout-benefind/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A former health cabinet official says the Bevin administration's decision to roll Medicaid into the state's welfare signup system is causing major delays.", "creator": "@RylandKY", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kynect.jpg", "title": "As Bevin Dismantles Kynect, A Bumpy Rollout For Its Replacement", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "steve beshear", "published_time": "2016-03-25T16:19:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-27T20:07:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Although Benefind and Kynect shared many eligibility functions, Haynes said Benefind was designed to complement the health insurance exchange.\nHealth care advocates are concerned the situation will lead to a drop in the number of Kentuckians signing up for health insurance and other entitlement programs.\nIn addition to Medicaid, it is the online portal for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Transitional Assistance Program and others.\nBut now, those who want help accessing Benefind have to go through the Department for Community Based Services phone bank.\nUnder the Beshear administration, DCBS workers were forced to work overtime to manage calls dealing with Kynect and Medicaid."}
