There\u2019s no incentive.\u201d\n\nFrom the insurance companies\u2019 standpoint, the extensions might mess with the complicated forecasting they do to set rates for the next year, but Adams said making the enrollment period longer is actually a boon for them as they get more customers.\n\nEven with the financial ding that some people are going to experience this year as a reminder that they have to sign up for health insurance by law, Adams said she thinks the same extension will happen next year as well.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that every single uninsured American will be in the loop on this information in a year,\u201d Adams said.\n\nWhy not?\n\n\u201cI just know that from dealing with personal finance, so many people are really uneducated about personal finance, insurance and then you layer taxes on top of that. These are not fun topics. People don\u2019t really want to dig into them. \u2026 They\u2019re not being proactive \u2026 [to] find out what [their] obligation is here.\u201d\n\nAccording to a story last month on TheBlaze, an estimated 2 to 4 percent of taxpayers will pay a fine for not having health insurance in 2014.
