In it, he explains how a \u201cvery serious series of facts,\u201d as Gov. Mitt Romney phrased it in his exclusive interview with Salem radio host Hugh Hewitt, is raising unsettling questions about an alleged quid pro quo agreement between the Clintons and the Russians.\n\nWeighing in, the former Republican presidential nominee stated flatly that the scandal is very \u201ctroubling\u201d to him \u2013 and has \u201cevery earmark of bribery.\u201d\n\nMR: Thank you. It\u2019s good to be with you, Hugh.\n\nHH: Governor Romney, I know you\u2019ve had a chance to read, I assume you\u2019ve had a chance to read the Jo Becker/Mike McIntire New York Times piece today about the cash flowing into the Clinton Foundation from the Russians as they got control of Uranium One. What\u2019s your reaction to this story?\n\nMR: You know, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I was stunned by it. I mean, it looks like bribery. I mean, there is every appearance that Hillary Clinton was bribed to grease the sale of, what, 20% of America\u2019s uranium production to Russia, and then it was covered up by lying about a meeting at her home with the principals, and by erasing emails. And you know, I presume we might know for sure whether there was or was not bribery if she hadn\u2019t wiped out thousands of emails. But this is a very, very serious series of facts, and it looks like bribery.\n\nHH: I just asked Senator Lindsey Graham last hour if they would hold hearings into the donors to the Clinton Family Foundation, because if the Russians can give them that much money, is it possible the Iranians have as well, Governor Romney?\n\nMR: Well, we don\u2019t know who gave money, and the IRS apparently is making it known that the filings of the Clinton Foundation did not include the fact that foreign governments were making contributions. And they had misstated their filings over the past several years. This is obviously a very troubling setting. But even what we do know, based on what was written by the New York Times, and is being reported by Fox and others, it has every earmark of bribery. And this is from the office of Secretary of State. This is a very troubling set of facts, and clearly, there\u2019s got to be some kind of investigation to find out what the truth is here, because around the world, people are going to look at Hillary Clinton, a potential candidate for president, a former Secretary of State, and say gosh, is this a person who could be trusted? And I think the American people are asking that question as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hmm..05/25/2016 21:15:07PM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hmm.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Mitt Romney: You Know, It Sure Looks Like Hillary Was Bribed at State", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/04/25/mitt-romney-it-sure-looks-like-hillary-was-bribed-at-state-n1990015", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/306/2014-11-02T170740Z_1_LYNXMPEAA109K_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hmm.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Mitt Romney: You Know, It Sure Looks Like Hillary Was Bribed at State", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/04/25/mitt-romney-it-sure-looks-like-hillary-was-bribed-at-state-n1990015", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/306/2014-11-02T170740Z_1_LYNXMPEAA109K_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Mitt Romney: You Know, It Sure Looks Like Hillary Was Bribed at State, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9469\"", "article_summary": "And you know, I presume we might know for sure whether there was or was not bribery if she hadn\u2019t wiped out thousands of emails.\nMR: Well, we don\u2019t know who gave money, and the IRS apparently is making it known that the filings of the Clinton Foundation did not include the fact that foreign governments were making contributions.\nBut this is a very, very serious series of facts, and it looks like bribery.\nMitt Romney phrased it in his exclusive interview with Salem radio host Hugh Hewitt, is raising unsettling questions about an alleged quid pro quo agreement between the Clintons and the Russians.\nTo get you up to speed, read Guy\u2019s eye-opening and glass-shattering post published earlier this week."}
