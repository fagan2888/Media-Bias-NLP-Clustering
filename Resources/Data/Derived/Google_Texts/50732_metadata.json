He added two steals and a block, displaying flashes of the type of defense he was known for in his two collegiate seasons at Michigan State.\n\n\u201cI liked the fact that he was poised,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt was his first NBA action, in his hometown, and he looked like he belonged. He didn\u2019t look back. He was very aggressive offensively, he was aggressive defensively. It was exactly what we needed. I think he got caught up a couple of times because he was going good, had a couple of heat-checks. But for the most part I was encouraged by his performance.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris is getting this chance mainly because Randy Foye is dealing with a bruised right knee. Foye did not practice on Saturday and will be questionable for Monday\u2019s game at Cleveland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a day-to-day thing,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe just have to kind of wait it out and see how long it will take.\u201d\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brian Shaw,Chris Dempsey,Gary Harris,Michigan State,NBA,Nuggets,Randy Foye,rookie", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Nuggets rookie guard Gary Harris will play for the second time this season, against the New York Knicks.", "title": "Gary Harris to suit up again, vs. Knicks, while Randy Foye rests", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/16/gary-harris-second-straight-game-foye-rests/12071/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/harris-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Nuggets rookie guard Gary Harris will play for the second time this season, against the New York Knicks.", "title": "Gary Harris to suit up again, vs. Knicks, while Randy Foye rests", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/16/gary-harris-second-straight-game-foye-rests/12071/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/harris-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Nuggets rookie guard Gary Harris will play for the second time this season, against the New York Knicks."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6a6\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2013 Gary Harris will suit up for his second straight game, Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said Sunday morning.\nThe rookie impressed in his NBA debut, scoring 13 points on 6-of-10 shooting against the Indiana Pacers on Friday night.\nI think he got caught up a couple of times because he was going good, had a couple of heat-checks.\nBut for the most part I was encouraged by his performance.\u201dHarris is getting this chance mainly because Randy Foye is dealing with a bruised right knee.\nFoye did not practice on Saturday and will be questionable for Monday\u2019s game at Cleveland."}
