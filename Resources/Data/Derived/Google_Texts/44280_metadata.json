Jerry Brown, who was running for president against Bill Clinton, asked perfectly valid questions about the conflict of interest in her family: She represented clients who also had business with her husband, then the state\u2019s governor, in the Whitewater scandal that wound up sending several Clinton cronies to jail.\n\nHer tack was to frame the question as sexist.\n\n\u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.\u201d As if she couldn\u2019t possibly have been the kind of lawyer who did not represent sleazy felons who were lobbying her husband.\n\nThe tactic worked to distract the press, though not the way she intended. As Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon wrote in a column for the liberal group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, stay-at-home-moms were insulted.\n\n\u201cWithin a week, Whitewater was virtually dead as a campaign issue.
