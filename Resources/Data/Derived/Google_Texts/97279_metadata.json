Medical Mutual wants, on average, 14.48 percent more. Aetna wants a 13.2 percent average hike.\n\nBoth companies cite higher health care costs among their reasons, and they point to the planned rollback of a federal reinsurance program that until now helped keep premiums somewhat lower.\n\nYet several other companies competing in the same market, including Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Summa Insurance Co., are seeking smaller hikes, a Northeast Ohio Media Group review of all publicly available rate requests in Ohio shows.\n\nAnthem's average premium would rise by 4.06 percent if approved, and Summa's by 3.69 percent.\n\nThis suggests that, if the rates hold and the Affordable Care Act does not change as a result of a U.S. Supreme Court decision expected in June, Ohioans who get coverage through Healthcare.gov could see a competitive insurance shopping season late this year. Still, Medical Mutual's 2016 rate request comes atop its 7.73 percent average hike in 2015, pushing its two-year average above 20 percent and likely giving fodder for debate to Obamacare critics. Aetna just entered Ohio's marketplace for these policies this year but said its 2015 prices represented a 7.5 percent cut when compared with its similar policies.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, or ACA, passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, required most Americans to get health coverage by 2014 or face fines. More than 234,000 Ohioans were signed up for such coverage by the end of the 2015 open enrollment period, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. Millions more got their health coverage through their employers, and their premiums -- generally a private matter -- will not be the same as those mentioned here.\n\nThe ACA, generally known as \"Obamacare,\" has been controversial from the start. Critics resented the government mandate and the taxpayer subsidies required to help many people pay for premiums. Proponents meantime praised the fact that people with preexisting medical conditions could not be denied coverage and their individual health status could not force them into policies with higher premiums.\n\nThis required insurance companies to rebalance their traditional underwriting and pricing practices. Some Americans in the individual, non-workplace market saw their health premiums fall, especially if they were older, while others, including younger, healthier people, saw premiums rise. HHS and other advocates said that while short-term changes might occur, the ACA in the long run would soften the dramatic peaks and valleys inherent in the old health insurance sector.\n\nThe newest premium requests -- and the explanations for them by insurers -- show how this rebalancing is shaking out. The Ohio Department of Insurance and HHS still must approve the premium requests. The state expects to act in summer, said department spokesman Chris Brock, and HHS by fall. HHS cautioned that while some rate requests suggest big price hikes, they could actually be slashed if state regulators find them unjustified.\n\n\"Proposed rates provide an early look at insurance companies' initial estimates, but rates often decrease significantly before becoming final,\" said HHS spokesman Ben Wakana. \"Because of the Affordable Care Act and rate review processes set up in states, consumers have an opportunity to weigh in on proposed increases of 10 percent or greater before the rates are finalized.\"\n\nThe filings reviewed by the Northeast Ohio Media Group come from eight insurance companies, via a public information computer portal offered by the state insurance department. But the filings do not represent all health insurers in the state. A technical distinction allows some insurers to keep their rate requests private until the state approves them. Furthermore, one of the companies whose filing is public, All Savers Insurance Co., is offering a new line and says its prices therefore do not reflect a hike.\n\nBut one of Ohio's biggest carriers, Medical Mutual of Ohio, wants to raise 2016 premiums in the ACA individual market by an average of 14.48 percent. This could affect 21,909 Medical Mutual policyholders, or 41,110 people altogether, the company's state filing shows.\n\nAetna Life Insurance Co. asking for 13.2 percent more on average. It has 12,212 Ohio policyholders in the Obamacare individual market.\n\nThese are averages, so buyers could face higher or lower premiums depending on the features of their policies. For example, a non-smoker in southwest Ohio covered by Medical Mutual could face as much as a 25.6 percent premium hike -- but that's for a policy covering only catastrophic medical costs, and Medical Mutual has relatively few buyers for those policies.\n\nA more popular plan -- the lowest-priced plan on the \"silver\" or second most-generous tier of benefits -- would cost a 40-year-old non-smoker in Cuyahoga County $338.78 a month, a 12.6 percent increase over 2015. That policy comes with the possibility of the client having to spend up to $4,000 out of pocket for copayments and deductibles.\n\nThe slightly higher 14.48 percent figure is Medical Mutual's weighted average, factoring in all policyholders and policies.\n\nIf that seems high, consider another large player: Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and Blue Shield, with 21,690 policy holders in the ACA marketplace. That's nearly as many buyers as at Medical Mutual.\n\nAnthem wants only a 4.06 percent premium hike. That's an average, but not everyone will be in the average range. A subset of Anthem policyholders could see hikes as large as 27.64 percent, while a small number of others could see cuts of 24.54 percent. The average hike of 4.06 percent follows Anthem's hike of 8.9 percent -- again, an average -- for 2015.\n\nSumma's requested increase is even lower: 3.69 percent. But that's an average, and depending on the policy, someone insured through Summa could realistically face a change a change of anywhere from a 16.7 percent cut -- yes, a cut -- to a price climb of 13.76 percent. The largest cut is for a silver-tier plan that now costs, on average, $497 a month before subsidies, and the reduction would come to $83.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that one company's policies represent a better deal. That depends on the policy features, on the customer's individual needs and on the existing policy's price. A company with a low premium hike for 2016 could have started 2015 with rates already higher than its competitors. Company and policy price comparisons require a more detailed analysis of their products, which is difficult at this early stage of premium proposals.\n\nBut each company provided the state with enough details to better understand the reasons for the individual rate requests. Medical Mutual, for example, reported that it had higher medical claims than expected when entering the new ACA market. That's partly because its clientele turned out to be older than forecast.\n\nLooking toward 2016, Medical Mutual now projects that \"morbidity and demographics are assumed to improve.\"\n\nAnd it said in its filing that it expects new buyers will be somewhat healthier, as the \"pent-up demand\" for health services dissipates. The requested rates for 2016 would have to be even higher, in other words, were it otherwise.\n\nAetna Life Insurance Co., asking to charge 13.2 percent more on average, told Ohio insurance regulators that it expects to have medical costs that go up by 8.6 percent, \"mainly for two reasons \u2013 providers raise their prices and members get more medical care.\"\n\nPhysician costs in Ohio rose by 5 percent in the last year, Aetna said. The cost of pharmacy prescriptions went up 13 percent, the company said. Emergency treatment costs rose by 8 percent.\n\nBut that's not all. There are the ACA's \"enhanced network access standards,\" Aetna said, \"which limit our ability to control the cost and quality of medical care.\" Another way of describing this, according to ACA advocates, is that the ACA requires insurers to provide reasonable access for care, without unreasonable delays in treatment.\n\nFor patients who need treatment, this is good. For insurers, it can preclude placing stricter limits on where to offer treatment, although insurers still control their costs by limiting hospital choices in their networks and requiring higher co-payments for out-of-network hospitals.\n\nFinally, Aetna, like Medical Mutual, mentioned the federal Transitional Reinsurance Program, which has been safeguarding insurers against some of the largest medical bills. The program gets its revenue from a fee charged to all insurance companies and most employers -- $63 per policy -- and reimburses insurers in the ACA individual market for part of their claims if they exceed a certain threshold. The program was created as part of the ACA to stabilize premiums in the startup years, in case insurers guessed wrong about the expensive hospital bills they might have to pay.\n\nIt was a backstop for insurers, although critics said it kept premiums artificially low.\n\nBut the program will be less generous in 2016. This year, it pays for 50 percent of claims between $45,000 and $250,000. The bottom threshold rises to $90,000 in 2016. That means insurers must pay more of their own -- or their clients' -- money for their biggest medical claims. Aetna says this \"will increase rates for plans issued to individuals by 6 percent.\"\n\nPublicly traded, Aetna reported a 17 percent profit increase for the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. It's 2014 profit exceeded $2 billion, its highest ever, reported Modern Healthcare. It is not crying poor in its rate request. But the federal government structured the reinsurance program to ease insurers' transition into the new ACA marketplace -- and Aetna is transitioning by adding the 6 percent to its other premium features, arriving at a 13.2 percent increase when all these costs are totaled.\n\nOther proposed rate hikes from Ohio insurers:\n\nAultCare, 5.5 percent.\n\nInHealth, also known as Coordinated Mutual, 8.2 percent.\n\nAssurant, part of Time Insurance, proposing a new product line whose prices will represents a 37 percent increase. That is not a typo. But Assurant is a small player in Ohio and says in its filing that it offers a broad provider network for customers who want that choice \"without the added requirement to go through a gatekeeper to direct their care.\" Furthermore, the company is trying to sell its health-insurance line or otherwise exit that market. The company said in an email that \"Assurant Health is meeting regulatory requirements in submitting 2016 filings as its parent company pursues a sale of the business.\"\n\nNo matter the size of premiums, a majority of buyers on the individual market -- 84 percent in Ohio, according to HHS -- get tax subsidies to pay part of their premiums. Whether that continues depends on how the U.S. Supreme Court decides a legal challenge to those subsidies. A decision is expected by late June.\n\nA primary question for the court is whether Congress meant for the subsidies to be offered on the federal insurance portal -- Healthcare.gov -- or whether states had to set up their own ACA marketing networks in order to offer them. Challengers to the law saw Congress specified the latter, although that is in contention. Ohio, like 35 other states, chose to use the federal portal.\n\nThe Supreme Court case is titled King v. Burwell, and insurers assumed in their rate requests that HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell and the Obama administration will prevail. However, \"We reserve the right to amend or withdraw this rate filing if the Supreme Court holds otherwise in the pending case of King v. Burwell,\" Aetna's filing said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aetna,affordable-care-act,anthem-blue-cross,medical-mutual,obamacare", "title": "Obamacare premiums could rise, some by double-digits, in 2016, Ohio filings show", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare premiums could rise, some by double-digits, in 2016, Ohio filings show\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/05/obamacare_premiums_could_rise.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/17928300-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16126295\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-05-27T17:34:57Z\", \"author\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"tags\": [\"@frontpage\",\"@zzz\",\"aetna\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"anthem-blue-cross\",\"medical-mutual\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/17928300-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@SteveKoff", "description": "Medical Mutual of Ohio wants a 14.48 percent premium hike.
