(REUTERS/Yuri Gripas)\n\n4404119\n\nObamacare chief Marilyn Tavenner showed up to face a congressional committee Tuesday for the first time since giving them false information, but this time refused over and over to give out much information at all.\n\nTavenner faced the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to answer for putting out falsely boosted Obamacare enrollment numbers. As administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Tavenner testified to the Oversight Committee in September that 7.3 million people were enrolled in Obamacare plans nationwide. But that number was inflated by stand-alone dental plans \u2014 and the \u201cmistake\u201d was only uncovered by the Oversight Committee in November.\n\nTavenner apologized and brushed aside the \u201cinadvertently\u201d boosted numbers, but was tight-lipped about new information. CMS did release 19,000 pages of documents to the Oversight Committee Tuesday morning, just before the hearing \u2014 but did not provide the committee time to read the documents and receive Tavenner\u2019s testimony on the contents.\n\nTavenner\u2019s interactions with the committee have typically been icy, and Tuesday was no different. When asked to confirm the number of uninsured Americans before Obamacare launched last year, Tavenner claimed she didn\u2019t know \u2014 never mind that she touted a drop in the uninsured rate in her written testimony.\n\nAnd when asked about the number of customers whose premiums increased after Obamacare\u2019s first year, the subject of an HHS report just last week, Tavenner also claimed that she didn\u2019t know. (RELATED: Obama Admin Finally Admits Obamacare Premiums Are Rising)\n\nLater on in the hearing, Tavenner again declined to give an enrollment update on the number of sign-ups in this year\u2019s open enrollment period \u2014 although the administration has pledged to be more transparent about Obamacare this year.\n\nShe said she had not been briefed on federal spending on cost-sharing in Obamacare exchanges in 2014 and that she didn\u2019t know the numbers for fiscal year 2015; she did not have information on who negotiated an out for insurers if federal Obamacare subsidies are overturned by the Supreme Court next year. When asked whether she\u2019d provide the contracts, Tavenner said she\u2019d first need to consult an attorney.\n\n\u201cYou and Mr. Gruber don\u2019t need to sit beside each other because it is wearing off,\u201d Collins said, apparently referring to Tavenner\u2019s former request that she not be forced to sit next to non-government officials, including former Obamacare adviser and current pariah Jonathan Gruber, at the hearing.\n\n\u201cYou actually do work for the government. You do work for an agency that is under the jurisdiction of this committee. \u2026 Why would you even have to hesitate to on providing contracts that public money was spent on to this committee?\u201d Collins charged.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I will go back and try to get you the information,\u201d Tavenner tiredly told Rep. Collins \u2014 a refrain she repeated many times throughout the hearing.\n\n\u201cIt seems that when we get here, we only want to answer questions that we want to answer, not questions that are part of your regular job,\u201d Collins said.\n\nTavenner\u2019s silence extended specifically to Obamacare customers as well. Rep. Jim Jordan tackled the issue of the upcoming Supreme Court case on whether Obamacare restricts subsidies to state-run exchanges alone. The Obamacare chief was unconcerned about the King v. Burwell lawsuit, dismissing the challenge because she doesn\u2019t find it \u201ca close case,\u201d despite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to take up the question.\n\nThe Court will rule whether the law bans subsidies to HealthCare.gov customers next June, but the Obama administration is not warning customers who are now purchasing year-long policies that their premiums may skyrocket come June, despite what the federal government is promising today.\n\nTavenner frostily told Jordan that nothing had changed for consumers, refusing outright to inform new customers that it\u2019s possible the prices on HealthCare.gov may not be the same in just six months.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'It seems when we get here, we only want to answer questions that we want to'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare chief Marilyn Tavenner showed up to face a congressional committee Tuesday for the first time since giving them false information, but this time refused over and over to give out much inform", "title": "Obamacare Chief Stays Mum After Giving Congress False Enrollment Totals", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/09/obamacare-chief-stays-mum-after-giving-congress-false-enrollment-totals/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/marilyn.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It seems when we get here, we only want to answer questions that we want to'", "title": "Obamacare Chief Stays Mum After Giving Congress False Enrollment Totals Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/09/obamacare-chief-stays-mum-after-giving-congress-false-enrollment-totals/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/marilyn.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-09 15:04:58", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare Chief Stays Mum After Giving Congress False Enrollment Totals", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "jim-jordan,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jim jordan,marilyn tavenner", "sailthru.description": "Obamacare chief Marilyn Tavenner showed up to face a congressional committee Tuesday for the first time since giving them false information, but this time refused over and over to give out much inform", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/marilyn.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba64\"", "article_summary": "\u2026 Why would you even have to hesitate to on providing contracts that public money was spent on to this committee?\u201d Collins charged.\nBut that number was inflated by stand-alone dental plans \u2014 and the \u201cmistake\u201d was only uncovered by the Oversight Committee in November.\nTavenner faced the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to answer for putting out falsely boosted Obamacare enrollment numbers.\nTavenner\u2019s silence extended specifically to Obamacare customers as well.\nAs administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Tavenner testified to the Oversight Committee in September that 7.3 million people were enrolled in Obamacare plans nationwide."}
