The chambers took different approaches to identifying projects that would receive the OK for congressional funding.The Senate's version of the measure relied on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to make the water project selections, but Republicans in the House argued that doing so would delegate too much responsibility for federal spending away from Congress.The White House has said that it prefers the Senate\u2019s approach, but it has indicated that President Obama would be willing to sign either version of the measure.The administration has sought to amplify pressure on lawmakers to finish the water bill negotiations by having the president, Vice President Biden and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx tour ports around the U.S.Biden and Foxx visited the Panama Canal, which is currently being deepened, last month. Administration officials have often cited the deepening of the Central American channel as a reason Congress should invest more money in U.S. ports and waterways.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The House could hold a final vote on an $8.2 billion bill to boost U.S. ports and waterways this month, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said Friday.
