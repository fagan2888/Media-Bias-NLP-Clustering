Erin Bartko's husband sees another side of his soft-spoken, mild-mannered wife when she walks into a grocery store.

"When she shops, it's like she's going into battle, and usually she comes out victorious," Joe Bartko said.

Her acumen at shaving dollars — lots of them — off her grocery store bill is no accident.

Erin Bartko worked for 22 years at Albertons, up until 2011, as a bookkeeper, checker and assistant front manager.

In those roles, she began understanding more about how store deals work and how the consumer can play the savings game more skillfully.

"It's kind of my adrenaline thing, that I like to save," said Erin Bartko, 45.

Checkers notice.

Every Sunday, Erin Bartko buys two or three newspapers to compare fliers and to clip coupons, which she files in a black Trapper Keeper notebook that holds plastic pages with pockets originally intended for baseball cards. She then organizes those pages according to sections titled "Drinks," "Canned and Frozen," etc. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer)

"I had one lady just stand there and say, 'Wow. You really took it down far,'" she said.

Her process starts with sitting at the kitchen table to plan meals for the next week or two based on what she finds on sale in the weekly store fliers.

Every Sunday, she buys two or three papers to compare those fliers and to clip coupons, which she files in a black Trapper Keeper notebook that holds plastic pages with pockets originally intended for baseball cards. She then organizes those pages according to sections titled "Drinks," "Canned and Frozen," etc.

From there, the Longmont wife and mother of two growing boys plans meals based on the interplay between what is on sale and what she can buy on sale with coupons.

To keep everything straight, Erin Bartko writes her items needed in one color; writes the store offering the best value in another color; and, finally, in another color notes if she can use a coupon with the item and how much the coupon is worth.

She is no impulse shopper.

Before she wheels her cart into the store, she props her Trapper Keeper coupon holder open on the kiddie seat of the grocery cart along with the color-coded lists. She also carries a neon green bag to hold sales fliers from stores around town as a ready reference. Then, she keeps a running ticker of how much she has spent as she shops to prevent sticker shock at the checkout.

That is the front end of her process.

But, like a supercomputer, Erin Bartko's mind processes lots of other money-saving data in the background as she serpentines through the grocery store aisles.

Savvy shopper wannabes do well to remember what she remembers:

•Join store loyalty programs and use digital coupons along with manufacturer coupons — both clipped and printed from online sources — whenever possible in conjunction with in-store sale prices.

•Enroll in manufacturer reward programs, such as www.Kelloggsfamilyrewards.com, to earn free products through repeated purchases.

•Ask for rain checks on sold out sale items.

•"Like" grocery store Facebook sites to get early notification of upcoming sales.

•Remember that you do not need to buy 10 items in "10 for 10" deals to get the price break on one item.

•Shop early on weekdays for better selection and better luck finding deals in the clearance racks at the back of the store.

•Bring your own grocery bags and cash in on the 5-cent discount per bag some stores offer.

•Shop on Wednesdays at Lucky's Market and Sprout's Farmers Market because those stores on that day honor sale prices both from the last week's flier and the next week's flier.

•Be careful to count on a coupon only if it is for a matching brand and the correct size.

•Always read the unit price of products — not just the face value — to get an accurate cost comparison of how "family size" items and store brands versus name brands compare.

Finally, Erin Bartko recommends keeping an eye out for stray coupons — in empty shopping carts, on the back of football tickets, even on the street — and recognizing them for what they are.

"My sons sometimes pick them up off the ground, give them to me, and say, 'Mom, here's some money!'" she said.
