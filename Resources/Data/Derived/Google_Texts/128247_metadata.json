These results are very reassuring - they show us that women using the most effective methods of birth control continue at high rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they work so well, the LARC methods should be the first option considered,\u201d Diedrich told Reuters Health by email.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers looked at data from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, which involved women ages 14 to 45 who were sexually active with a male partner and interested in starting a new method of reversible contraception.\n\nAfter initial counseling on the long- and short-acting reversible contraception options, the women were tested for sexually transmitted infections and were given their birth control method of choice free of charge.\n\nOnce placed by a doctor, the hormonal IUD (Mirena) and copper IUD (Paragard) can remain effective for many years. The Implanon rod is inserted under the skin of the arm and can last up to three years.\n\nShorter-term options included the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate shot (Depo Provera), which is a hormonal injection given by a health provider every three months, or daily birth control pills, the contraceptive patch or the vaginal ring (Nuva Ring).\n\nThe patch should be reapplied three times per month and the ring should be replaced once per month.\n\nThe researchers followed 4,708 women with telephone surveys every six months for three years, including 3,203 who had chosen long-acting contraception.\n\nWomen who decided to stop using contraception because they wanted to get pregnant were not included in the study.\n\nAt the three-year mark, almost 70 percent of women who had chosen the hormonal or copper IUD were still using it, and 56 percent of those with a subdermal implant still had it. Overall, about 30 percent of those who had chosen short-term methods were still using them, as reported in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nWomen who had chosen long-acting contraception tended to be older, were more likely to have public insurance and more often had a history of unintended pregnancy.\n\nWomen appear to be happy with LARC methods and continue them significantly longer than non-LARC methods, Diedrich said.\n\nAn IUD can cost more than $1,000, compared to between $10 and $30 for a one-month pack of birth control pills, Diedrich said.\n\nSome women without insurance are unable to pay for a LARC, some insurers affiliated with religious organizations do not cover contraceptives and others charge a co-pay, all of which makes it harder for women to get the long-acting contraception they would prefer, he said.\n\n\u201cThere may be a higher upfront cost for LARC methods, but they work much better, and people use them longer,\u201d which ultimately makes them cost-effective, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is creating more evidence to support the idea that women who are using IUDs and implants seem to be highly satisfied,\u201d said Megan L. Kavanaugh, senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute in New York, who was not part of the study.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act going into effect, more and more women should have access to these more expensive options, Kavanaugh said.\n\nStill, there is no one best option for everyone, Kavanaugh told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cWe want a diversity of options,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s right for (a woman) when she\u2019s 17 may not be the same when she\u2019s 27 or 37.\u201d\n\nMore than 90 percent of unintended pregnancies in the U.S. are due to contraceptive nonuse or misuse, and LARCs remove that risk, Kavanaugh noted.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH/Pregnancy,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH/Sexual
