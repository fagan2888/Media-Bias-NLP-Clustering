Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order on Sunday, which aims to protect the homeless during weather where temperatures are 32 degrees or below.\n\nRELATED: \u201cDaily nightmare\u201d for families living in NYC shelters, says Stringer\n\nThe order \u2014 which will take effect on Jan. 5 \u2014 will make sure that these individuals are directed to shelter and will also require homeless shelters to extend their hours of operations. The state is expected to help any local communities if they lack facilities, resources or expertise.\n\nIf a homeless individual refuses to go to a shelter, they can also be taken involuntarily to prevent them facing any harm \u2014 such as hypothermia, serious injury or death.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that the state act to ensure that such aid, care and support is provided to address the needs of the state\u2019s homeless population, which need is further heightened during the winter months,\u201d Cuomo said in the executive order.\n\nCuomo also added directed all communities to ensure that facilities used for temporary housing are safe, clean, well maintained and supervised.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, the emergency declaration is just the first part of what will be the governor\u2019s comprehensive plan to address homelessness. He plans to unveil the complete plan during his State of the State address on Jan. 13.\n\nRELATED: Homeless no longer allowed at LaGuardia at night\n\nAs part of the plan, communities will be required to come up with housing and supportive service networks which are created to meet the \u201cspecific needs of each subgroup within the homeless population\u201d \u2014 such as mentally ill individuals or domestic violence victims.\n\nA total of about 58,000 people use homeless shelters in New York City each day. A recent survey showed that over 3,000 are living on the streets, the Daily News reported.\n\nDuring a recent press conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city welcomed help from the state.\n\n\"We certainly welcome resources \u2014 we\u2019ve needed them in this city for quite a while. And I think we can do a lot of good together,\" he said.\n\nDe Blasio added that the city has done a good job on its main focus at first, which was to get individuals out of the shelters and into housing \u2014 with 22,000 out of shelters.\n\nHowever, the city continues to deal with a massive homelessness issue which can be tackled through an increase in affordable housing \u2014 which the city expects to roll out a 200,000-unit plan; more supportive housing; and raising wages and benefits \u2014 especially because a large percentage of the homeless currently have jobs, according to the mayor.\n\n\"It will take time, it will be a long battle but I believe all these pieces will add up and turn the tide,\" de Blasio said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With winter settling in, New York State is enacting rules to protecte the homeless from frigid temperatures.", "author": "Angy Altamirano", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "With winter settling in, New York State is enacting rules to protecte the homeless from frigid temperatures.", "title": "New York State to help get homeless off streets during severe cold weather: Cuomo", "url": "http://www.metro.us/new-york/new-york-state-to-help-get-homeless-off-streets-during-severe-cold-weather-cuomo/zsJpac---bTSLSB2IMtBS/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$bcc93o9m31am40ncneoaij65mztbrar/11974006223_c17de0f64b_k.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "With winter settling in, New York State is enacting rules to protecte the homeless from frigid temperatures.", "title": "New York State to help get homeless off streets during severe cold weather: Cuomo", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$bcc93o9m31am40ncneoaij65mztbrar/11974006223_c17de0f64b_k.jpeg"}, "creator": "Angy Altamirano", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "mediatype": "Article", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "date": "2016-01-03", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "keywords": "homeless, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo, New York State, homelessness, shelter, winter, Executive Order,", "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,New York City,New York State,Top Stories New York,Andrew Cuomo", "section": "/new-york", "published_time": "2016-01-03T20:10:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-03T21:48:10Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "homeless, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo, New York State, homelessness, shelter, winter, Executive Order,"}, "article_summary": "With winter settling in, New York State is enacting rules to protecte the homeless from frigid temperatures.\nA total of about 58,000 people use homeless shelters in New York City each day.\nHe plans to unveil the complete plan during his State of the State address on Jan. 13.\nAccording to the New York Daily News, the emergency declaration is just the first part of what will be the governor\u2019s comprehensive plan to address homelessness.\nAndrew Cuomo issued an executive order on Sunday, which aims to protect the homeless during weather where temperatures are 32 degrees or below."}
