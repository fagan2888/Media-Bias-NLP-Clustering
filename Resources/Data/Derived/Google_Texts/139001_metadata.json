A Landmark Theatre will also be on site.\n\nThe look of the final product won\u2019t necessarily match the design of Atlantic Plumbing\u2019s surrounding homes and businesses. The large buildings will be constructed of mostly glass and steel. But however industrial-looking the buildings may be, architect Morris Adjmi says the intent of his design was to maintain some of the neighborhood\u2019s natural and appealing \u201cgrittiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe typical sort of residential building that was pretty much expected is being challenged. \u2026 It\u2019s a very modern, glassy, airy, light-filled condo and apartment building, but with an industrial edge to it,\u201d Adjmi says.\n\nThe building\u2019s space along 8th Street will feature roll-up garage doors for artist studios, as well as space for retail and restaurants. And the Washington Project for the Arts will move into 1,500 square feet on the first lot of the project.\n\nAdjmi is hiring a Swedish graffiti artist to paint the inside elevator shaft of the building, which will be visible from the outside, and bricks saved from the former Atlantic Plumbing building will be used in the completed building\u2019s lobby.\n\nThe bricks aren\u2019t the only nod to the lot\u2019s former life. The roof decks of the buildings will include overgrown vegetation - a common characteristic on the former site.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of having the industrial character being maintained . but then overlaying this green landscaping on top of it,\u201d Adjmi says.\n\nThe rooftop on both the condo building and the apartment building will offer panoramic, uninterrupted views of the city, thanks to height restrictions south of the project.\n\nBlocher adds, \u201cThe rooftop deck of this building is really going to be the most spectacular element. It\u2019s a beautiful building and the finishes are great . but the roof deck is going to be phenomenal.\u201d\n\nThe apartment building will also feature a resort-style pool, a fitness center, an indoor/outdoor bar and a common lounge area.\n\n\u201cI think the U Street corridor just continues to get stronger and stronger,\u201d Adjmi says. \u201cI think that there are a lot of exciting things happening.\u201d\n\nBoth Atlantic Plumbing A and B are expected to be finished next year; Adjmi predicts the third lot will be complete a year and a half from now.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: WTOP-FM, http://www.wtop.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "What was once referred to as \"the grossest wall in the city\" will soon become one of the District's sleekest.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/20/atlantic-plumbing-redefines-dc-neighborhood/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "What was once referred to as \u201cthe grossest wall in the city\u201d will soon become one of the District\u2019s sleekest.", "title": "Atlantic Plumbing redefines DC neighborhood"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "What was once referred to as \"the grossest wall in the city\" will soon become one of the District's sleekest.", "card": "summary", "title": "Atlantic Plumbing redefines DC neighborhood"}, "Author": "RACHEL NANIA", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The rooftop on both the condo building and the apartment building will offer panoramic, uninterrupted views of the city, thanks to height restrictions south of the project.\nThe building\u2019s space along 8th Street will feature roll-up garage doors for artist studios, as well as space for retail and restaurants.\n\u2026 It\u2019s a very modern, glassy, airy, light-filled condo and apartment building, but with an industrial edge to it,\u201d Adjmi says.\nbut the roof deck is going to be phenomenal.\u201dThe apartment building will also feature a resort-style pool, a fitness center, an indoor/outdoor bar and a common lounge area.\nThe Atlantic Plumbing project will soon bring apartments, condos, restaurants, artists and green space to three formerly dilapidated lots located in one of the most vibrant and fast-growing neighborhoods in the city: 8th and V streets Northwest."}
