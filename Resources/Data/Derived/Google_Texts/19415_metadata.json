It's likely that he may lose it and be required to repay insurance companies for the fraud that he committed.\n\nSeveral patients have sued him over the elaborate fraud.\n\nFBI supervisory special agent Justin Shammot in Cleveland told The Guardian that it was the 'worst kind of health care fraud you can have as he violated his patients trust.\n\nHe said: 'He had convinced his patients to really trust him and he led them to believe that if they had not had these services that it's likely that they could possibly die.\n\n'These procedures do have consequences,' Shammot added. 'When they are appropriate, the risks are outweighed by the benefits, but [if] you are performing nuclear stress tests and giving patients stents that were not medically necessary \u2026 there are all kinds of risks associated with these, including taking medications for the rest of your life.'\n\nDr Persaud denies any wrongdoing and plans to appeal his conviction.\n\nHe said: 'I made some billing errors, but I did not do anything wrong, medically. I never put in a stent or did a procedure that I did not think was necessary. I am appealing the conviction and sentence.'\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Cardiologist,jailed,20,years,forcing,patients,unnecessary,surgeries", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3373323/Cardiologist-jailed-20-years-forcing-patients-unnecessary-surgeries.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Harry Persaud, from Westlake, Ohio, was convicted of persuading patients have major operations like - open heart surgery - when they did not need it - for financial gain.", "title": "Cardiologist jailed for forcing patients to have unnecessary surgeries", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3373323/Cardiologist-jailed-20-years-forcing-patients-unnecessary-surgeries.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/24/15/2F993ED800000578-0-image-a-22_1450970810113.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3373323/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3373323/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "keywords": "Cardiologist,jailed,20,years,forcing,patients,unnecessary,surgeries", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3373323, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-12-24T15:33:21.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Belinda+Robinson+For+Mail+Online", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-12-24T17:41:07.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Cardiologist jailed 20 years forcing patients unnecessary surgeries"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Dr. Harry Persaud, from Westlake, Ohio, was convicted of persuading patients have major operations like - open heart surgery - when they did not need it - for financial gain.", "title": "Cardiologist jailed for forcing patients to have unnecessary surgeries", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3373323/Cardiologist-jailed-20-years-forcing-patients-unnecessary-surgeries.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/24/15/2F993ED800000578-0-image-a-22_1450970810113.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Dr. Harry Persaud, from Westlake, Ohio, was convicted of persuading patients have major operations like - open heart surgery - when they did not need it - for financial gain."}, "article_summary": "Dr Persaud, who had his own private practice also worked at three hospitals in the Westlake area, a suburb of Cleveland where he performed procedures.\nDr Persaud allegedly scammed patients by falsifying the results of their exams which made it seem as though they needed to have specific procedures carried out when they didn't.\nDr Persaud denies any wrongdoing and plans to appeal his conviction.\nDr Persaud has not practiced since 2012 but still has a medical license.\nHe allegedly made over $5.6 million from Medicare and private insurance companies from the medical fraud."}
