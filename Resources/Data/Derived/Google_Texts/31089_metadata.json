Mohammad Omer Safi said 3,000 troops are now battling a well-armed insurgent force of some 2,000 fighters who crashed against the city\u2019s gates late last month at the start of the spring fighting season. He said logistical problems that left troops without food, fuel or ammunition for days on end have been resolved, but that the Taliban have proven tough to dislodge.\n\n\u201cWe have surrounded the enemy everywhere and we will not allow them to advance any further,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cMaybe with the passage of time they will be weakened, run out of ammunition and find themselves moved back. This is not a one day or two days, or one month or two months fight.\u201d\n\nSafi said that in addition to switching from hit-and-run attacks to seizing and holding territory, the Taliban have also been joined by other militants, including from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. The IMU has longstanding ties to the Taliban and al-Qaida, and is believed to have pledged allegiance to the IS group last year.\n\nThere are ominous signs of a growing IS presence in northern Afghanistan. Safi said fighters have raised the group\u2019s black flag in nearby villages, and that foreign fighters from Turkey, Chechnya, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have been found among the dead.\n\nA Western intelligence official said the extent of the IS presence in Afghanistan remains unclear, saying \u201cthere is a lot of self-branding, rather than franchising.\u201d\n\nBut an Afghan intelligence official said the group is present in at least four of the country\u2019s 34 provinces, mainly in the south. He pointed to the beheading of seven Afghan soldiers in northern Badakhshan province last month, noting that the tactic has rarely been used by the Taliban. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Afghan forces struggle as Taliban seeks northern stronghold", "title": "Afghan forces struggle as Taliban seeks northern stronghold", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Afghan forces struggle as Taliban seeks northern stronghold", "title": "Afghan forces struggle as Taliban seeks northern stronghold", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/26/afghan_forces_struggle_as_taliban_seeks_northern_stronghold/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/afghanistan-northern-offensive.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Afghan forces struggle as Taliban seeks northern stronghold", "title": "Afghan forces struggle as Taliban seeks northern stronghold", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/afghanistan-northern-offensive.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynne O'donnell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb974\"", "article_summary": "There are ominous signs of a growing IS presence in northern Afghanistan.\nHe pointed to the beheading of seven Afghan soldiers in northern Badakhshan province last month, noting that the tactic has rarely been used by the Taliban.\nSafi said fighters have raised the group\u2019s black flag in nearby villages, and that foreign fighters from Turkey, Chechnya, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have been found among the dead.\nThe IMU has longstanding ties to the Taliban and al-Qaida, and is believed to have pledged allegiance to the IS group last year.\nBoth officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter."}
