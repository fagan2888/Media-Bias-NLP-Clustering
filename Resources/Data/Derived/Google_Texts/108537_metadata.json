The tax form processing application TSC1099, is a complete cloud-based reporting and compliance solution. It enables businesses to upload data that is quickly processed, printed, mailed and e-filed at our service center each year. The online application is intuitive , secure , cost-effective and easy to implement . We have expanded the application to provide new Affordable Care Act (ACA) reporting for those Applicable Large Employers who have to comply with the requirements.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150915/266800\n\nIn addition to the 1095/1094-C forms the application is also fully equipped to handle the 1095/1094-B health coverage information returns that policy providers will need to distribute and file.\n\nWe serve as cost-effective alternative to the more expensive solutions offered by ADP or Paychex.\n\nThese ALEs who employ 50+ full-time and full-time equivalent workers (FTEs) have to track and report items like employee status, coverage offered, affordability, and dependents covered. They will then have to translate this into Form 1095-C employee statements in the 2015 filing year. ALEs will also have to deal with converting their data to adhere to new IRS e-file specifications and transmit this using the IRS AIR filing system. Since this reporting is so new, many businesses are scrambling to learn how this will affect them and what solutions are available. TSC1099 stands apart from most because of its low cost and ability to effectively handle the complex logic behind employee tracking and ACA code generation.\n\nTSC1099 System Features:\n\nPrint , mail , and e-file the 1095/1094 form series\n\n, , and the 1095/1094 form series Variable Hour Tracking and Reporting\n\nData consolidation into one comprehensive database\n\nElectronic Presentment of employee statements (1095-C)\n\nACA compliance consulting\n\n1095 corrections transmitted directly to IRS\n\nVery intuitive web application with no software to learn\n\nMultiple user environment\n\nContact us today and speak with a representative about how we can make the upcoming filing season less worrisome this year. We can provide customized proposals upon request.\n\nTab Service Company | 310 S Racine Ave, Chicago, IL 60607 | Phone: (312) 527-4306 | info@ts1099.com\n\nSOURCE Tab Service Company", "article_metadata": {"contentUrl": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150915/266800", "geo.region": "illinois", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "CHICAGO, Sept. 16", "description": "CHICAGO, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TSC1099 introduces their new Affordable Care Act (ACA) Reporting & Compliance application.", "author": "Tab Service Company", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tsc1099-introduces-their-new-affordable-care-act-aca-reporting--compliance-application-300143456.html", "image": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150915/266800", "type": "website", "description": "CHICAGO, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tab Service Company has been a leader in 1099 tax form outsourcing services...", "title": "TSC1099 introduces their new Affordable Care Act (ACA) Reporting & Compliance application"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "cf_entity_title": "TSC1099 introduces their new Affordable Care Act (ACA) Reporting & Compliance application", "thumbnail": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150915/266800?max=400", "robots": "index, follow", "Height": 500, "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "Publisher": "PRNewswire", "URL": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tsc1099-introduces-their-new-affordable-care-act-aca-reporting--compliance-application-300143456.html", "keywords": "Tab Service Company, illinois, New Products & Services, Banking & Financial Services, Computer Software, Computer & Electronics", "Width": 500, "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "date": "2015-09-16T07:15:00Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25cd\"", "article_summary": "Tab Service Company | 310 S Racine Ave, Chicago, IL 60607 | Phone: (312) 527-4306 | info@ts1099.comSOURCE Tab Service Company\nThe tax form processing application TSC1099, is a complete cloud-based reporting and compliance solution.\nCHICAGO, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tab Service Company has been a leader in 1099 tax form outsourcing services for decades.\nWe have expanded the application to provide new Affordable Care Act (ACA) reporting for those Applicable Large Employers who have to comply with the requirements.\nTSC1099 stands apart from most because of its low cost and ability to effectively handle the complex logic behind employee tracking and ACA code generation."}
