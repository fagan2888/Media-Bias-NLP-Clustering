James Lankford\u2019s (R-Okla.) new report, \u201cFederal Fumbles: 100 Ways the Government Dropped the Ball.\u201d\n\nThe report contains 100 examples of wasteful government spending and ridiculous regulations. The penalty flags are thrown at agencies, programs, and projects that consistently throw away taxpayer funds, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation. The report not only provides details about each extravagant expenditure, it also reveals \u201chow to recover the ball\u201d with specific proposals to eliminate the waste.\n\n\u201cFederal Fumbles\u201d includes infamous boondoggles such as the $43 million gas station in Afghanistan and failed Obamacare co-operative plans. The report also tackles solar energy subsidies, funding for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Museum, the study of tobacco use in Russia, media ethics training in India, paying Social Security benefits to the dead, duplicative and overlapping programs, and much more.\n\nCAGW President Tom Schatz said, \u201cWith the national debt rushing quickly to $19 trillion, it is clear that wasteful government spending must be eliminated. Sen. Lankford\u2019s report has successfully built on the legacy of his predecessor, Sen. Tom Coburn, who worked for years to bring Washington\u2019s profligate spending habits to public light. Sen. Lankford should be applauded for taking the handoff from Sen. Coburn and moving the ball down the field so that taxpayers can finally score a few touchdowns in the ongoing fight against wasteful spending.\u201d\n\nCitizens Against Government Waste is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating waste, fraud, mismanagement and abuse in government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Citizens Against Government Waste today gave a standing ovation to Sen.
