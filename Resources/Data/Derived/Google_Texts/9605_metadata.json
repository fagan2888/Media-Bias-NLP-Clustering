Maybe he had a few chats.\n\nBut he certainly knew his concerns and opinions meant nothing, changed nothing, accomplished nothing. And then he voted 97% of the time with Mr. Obama and Senate Majority Dictator Harry Reid\n\nReid has kept over 300 bills bottled up, squelched almost all proffered Republican amendments on anything that did move, and used the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to end the longstanding 60-vote rule and wipe out any chance that Republicans could block Obama nominees or prevent the President from packing the vital DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The three new liberal judges on that court can now be counted on to defer to Mr. Obama\u2019s policies and \u201cagency discretion\u201d on future arrogations of power.\n\nDitto for Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu. She bellyached from time to time about offshore drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline. But she also voted with Obama, Reid and their agenda 97% of the time, on everything from ObamaCare to Dodd-Frank to packing the DC Court.\n\nThe tally for other Democratic Senators running for reelection is revealing: Hagan (NC) 96% for the Obama agenda, policies and fiats \u2026 Merkley (OR) 96% \u2026 Pryor (AR) 90% \u2026 Shaheen (NH) 99% \u2026 Udall (CO) 99% \u2026 Warner (VA) 97%\n\nNow they\u2019re telling their constituents, next year will be different. Send me back to Washington, and next year I will stand up to Obama and support letting people keep their doctors and insurance, allowing more domestic drilling and pipelines, promoting economic recovery and fiscal responsibility, curbing the fraud and abuses at the Environmental Protection Agency, tackling Ebola and going after Islamic terrorists.\n\nThe IRS, Benghazi, Ebola and Middle East screw-ups and cover-ups seem to have set the tone. These Senators seem willing to say almost anything to get them past the elections. However, their votes have had real consequences for millions of Americans, especially the poor, minority, elderly and working classes they profess to care so much about. They should not escape accountability so easily.\n\nA recent political ad by black Democrat-turned-Republican Louisiana State Senator Elbert Guillory lays it on the line. \u201cWhile you dig through the couch looking for gas money,\u201d Guillory says, Mary Landrieu \u201cflies around in private jets funded by taxpayer dollars.\u201d To her, \u201cyou are just a vote,\u201d every six years.\n\nNor do liberal stereotypes fit. The four Democratic House and Senate candidates in Northern Virginia are all well-off, middle-age white guys. Republican candidates include one middle-age white dude, plus two working moms and a black man \u2013 who\u2019s also Jewish and an 8-year Marine Corps veteran.\n\nFew of us have any personal animosity toward any of these Democrat Senators. They\u2019re all amiable people. But as President Obama himself says, \u201cmy policies are on the ballot, every single one of them.\u201d Those policies have been dragging this country down, and as long as Harry Reid maintains his iron grip on the Senate, there can be no checks and balances or budgetary constraints on the Obama policies.\n\nMessrs. Reid and Obama have made it clear that they have no interest in working with Republicans. Indeed, the President prefers Saul Alinsky tactics of community agitation and interest group divide-and-conquer. He disdains democratic processes and bipartisan compromises, and much prefers to simply legislate, regulate and dictate from the White House and Executive Branch \u2013 ignoring or rewriting the clear language of laws and our Constitution whenever and however necessary.\n\nThe Train of Abuses and Usurpations gets longer by the week. Environmental Protection Agency actions alone could place virtually all our land, air, water, energy and economy under the control of regulatory ideologues, working closely with radical Big Green activists, billionaires and \u201ccharitable\u201d foundations.\n\nClimate. As the planet refuses to cooperate with computer models and White House fear mongering, the EPA simply ignores all contradictory studies and evidence \u2013 and continues to operate under assumptions that: carbon dioxide levels dictate climate change; natural forces are irrelevant\u2019 America can easily replace the fossil fuels that provide 82% of its energy; skyrocketing energy prices will have no effect on the economy, jobs or human health and welfare; and slashing America\u2019s CO2 emissions will make a difference, even though China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Poland and other nations refuse to do likewise.\n\nOf course, the real goal was never to stop climate change. It was always to control and \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d our nation\u2019s energy, economic, social and legal structure and institutions, regardless of costs.\n\nWater. Proposed rules are so broadly written that they would cover nearly all \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d (WOTUS), based on assertions that they would eventually end up in \u201cnavigable\u201d waters: rivers, rivulets, lakes, groundwater, stock ponds, occasional puddles and dry creek beds. In the process, they would also control land use activities on farms, forests and other private property. Friendly, collusive lawsuits by radical environmentalists would further expand this EPA jurisdiction.\n\nOzone. Almost every US county meets current 2008 ozone standards. Proposed regulations would render the vast majority of them \u201cnonattainment\u201d areas, subject to severe restrictions on economic growth. Even EPA says the rules would cost $100 billion a year. The National Association of Manufacturers puts the cost at $270 billion annually. The impact on people\u2019s jobs, incomes, health and welfare would be huge.\n\nEven bigger ambitions. Clearly not satisfied with these unprecedented usurpations of power, EPA has also launched major \u201csustainable development,\u201d \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d and \u201cclean power\u201d initiatives. These deliberately vague and infinitely malleable terms would further expand the agency\u2019s mission far beyond anything previously imaginable or contemplated by EPA\u2019s authorizing legislation.\n\nOther agencies are busily writing new regulations governing Christmas lights, automobile and refrigerator coolants, endangered species guidelines that would block ranching, drilling and pipeline projects, while giving bird and bat-killing wind and solar projects carte blanche \u2013 and other activities.\n\nCollusion. A recent Senate Minority Staff Report explains in frightening detail how far-left billionaires, foundations and environmentalist groups actively collude with EPA managers and regulators. EPA in turn happily recruits high-level eco-activists, who then help lobby, guide and control agency policies \u2013 and channel millions of taxpayer dollars to pressure groups that promote those policies. The agency also engages in frequent friendly lawsuits with activists, to make policies even more extreme.\n\nA Republican Senate will not guarantee the kind of change needed to end these excesses and get the nation\u2019s economy and employment back on track, especially if certain GOP members remain timid or recalcitrant. (Perhaps DePuy or Stryker could donate some spinal implants?) Presidential vetoes could also pose problems, although strong leadership could often craft bipartisan veto-proof majorities.\n\nHouse and Senate hearings could grill agency heads under oath \u2013 and investigate potential fraud in developing regulations, unethical collusion between agencies and activists, improper agency funding of activist groups, sweetheart lawsuits and other activities. These investigations could form the basis for budget reductions and restrictions, legislation to end mission creep or block specific regulations, and laws requiring congressional approval of \u201cmajor\u201d regulatory actions costing billions of dollars.\n\nSuch actions would also help restore our tripartite system of government. Right now, the Executive Branch is riding roughshod over businesses and citizens alike, and the courts merely rubberstamp agency decisions. Meanwhile, the Legislative Branch is little more than an appendix that writes overly broad laws giving unaccountable bureaucrats unfettered discretion to impose an increasingly intrusive, expensive leftist, centralized government agenda. No wonder our nation is foundering on the rocks.\n\nThe upcoming elections could help get the USS United States back on course. Let\u2019s hope they do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The courts and Senate provide no checks and balances.
