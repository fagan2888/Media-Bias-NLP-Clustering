Part 2 of a three-part series.\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 19, 2015 \u2013 In our previous article, we provided a short history of how the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank has generally dealt with inflationary and deflationary forces after its Great Mistake of 1937. Simply stated, the central bank\u2019s policies after that point dictated easier, cheaper and more available money during hard times (recessions); while bolstering the dollar, raising borrowing costs and draining dollars from the system were employed to cool down an economy that was becoming inflationary.\n\nRead also: The Fed, interest rates and you: A controversial decision\n\nWhile U.S. recessions after 1937 never again achieved the scale or scope of the disastrous Great Depression of the 1930s, some of these recessions were still tough to get through. But government monetary policy generally succeeded in making these cyclic economic contractions far less calamitous than the Great Depression.\n\nBut then, 2007-2009 happened.\n\nThe Great Recession: Background\n\nAside from the 1 percent, most working Americans today understand the Great Recession as the time when their lives changed emotionally, financially, personally and likely permanently. The days of liar loans, unlimited credit and financing upper middle-class living on lower middle-class incomes abruptly came to an end during this period. Today, for most Americans, the razzle-dazzle lifestyles of the 1990s and early 2000s seem gone for good. But the average voter remains puzzled and resentful about this debacle.\n\nSome (like this writer) would argue that the average American worker has yet to emerge from the Great Recession. But that long-evolving, sordid tale is best dealt with in another column. For now, let\u2019s take a brief look at the Great Recession, an event that was actually the result of gradually more reckless lending by the nation\u2019s banks that were encouraged in this undertaking by the government itself.\n\nSince the time of President Nixon\u2019s resignation, it has been the tendency of Congress, particularly when a Democrat is president, to buy votes by making money\u2014particularly in the form of real estate loans\u2014easier and easier to borrow for more and more individuals, without much regard to their ability to pay it back.\n\nBy means of this cynical ploy, congressional Democrats could attribute the resulting \u201caffluence\u201d of their constituents to their own enlightened control of the government\u2019s money spigots.\n\nTo keep the good times rolling, proclaimed congressional incumbents, you need to keep re-electing us. And that generally seemed to be the case, despite the nasty recessions of 1979-81, 1987-88, and 1999-2001. Those events were actually the harbingers of worse economic times to come. But no one paid much heed to these early warnings.\n\nSo successful was the Democrats\u2019 redistributionist sleight-of-hand that even most Republicans got on board, evolving into \u201cDemocrat-Lites\u201d in the process, a situation that clearly persists even today.\n\nThe reckless, relentless loosening of lending standards governing consumer real estate loans eventually got completely out of hand by the turn of the new century. Under the Clinton administration, Democrats operatives took control of Fannie Mae and lobbied banks to continue liberalizing loan writing standards\u2013a tactic that was taken to absurd ends by independent loan organizations like the notorious Countrywide.\n\nRead also: Friday\u2019s Quadruple Witching trade trashes U.S. stock markets\n\nBy 2003-2005, real estate loans could be easily obtained in many states by individuals who, in saner times, would never have remotely qualified for a housing loan in the first place. In many cases, lenders didn\u2019t even require documentation of a borrower\u2019s income. The term \u201cliar loans\u201d evolved as an apt description of this activity, and many a liar loan was granted to individuals and families clearly unqualified to carry a mortgage even under the best of circumstances. But Democrats, and Republicans as well, wanted to crow about \u201cincreasing American home ownership\u201d at every election cycle and this was one way to do it.\n\nExacerbating the problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which bought far too many substandard loans), was an increasingly accommodating Federal Reserve monetary policy. Acting in concert, these government players succeeded in creating a monstrous \u201cbubble\u201d in real estate prices. The cost of housing in most markets nationwide, along with the massive loans that supported housing price inflation rapidly ballooned out of control. It was a problem so immense that, when the bubble began to burst in late 2007, few realized the magnitude of the disaster that would soon to unfold.\n\nThe Great Recession erupts\n\nAs more and more lower- and lower-middle class homeowners began to default on the mortgages they never should have had in the first place, the plague of foreclosures began to spread across the country with a rapidity and shock that was the economic equivalent of the Black Death in medieval Europe.\n\nAs housing contracted, the hapless holders of liar loans were laid off their jobs, creating successive waves of new foreclosures, rapidly driving aggressive lenders toward bankruptcy.\n\nWorse, the whole financial ecosystem began to erode, largely as a result of something no one had apparently ever heard of before, loan resale packages called \u201cderivatives.\u201d It seems that huge amounts of defaulting home loans had been sliced, diced and put into packages or \u201ctranches\u201d of bond-like instruments, which were then sold as AAA-quality loan packages to eager but often unsuspecting clients, customers and institutions. It had been going on for years. But now the problem quickly came to a head.\n\nYou know the rest. From September of 2008, the successive waves of foreclosures and the resulting relative worthlessness of the mass of mis-rated derivatives and loans that sat on the books of countless banks, insurance companies, corporations and whomever and whatever had acquired these derivatives\u2014nearly killed the financial system.\n\n2009-2010: The Eve of Destruction as Washington goes off the rails\n\nFor better or worse, the government and the Fed reacted swiftly and forcefully to the ongoing financial disaster once the magnitude of the issue was grasped, taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their massive pile of worthless derivatives into federal receivership; folding major financial institutions, most notably Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers into receivership and dissolution; forcing the closure, sale or merger of banks in serious trouble for their loose lending standards; and putting other \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial institutions, like insurance giant AIG, on taxpayer-backed life support. Collectively, this massive bailout was known as the TARP program.\n\nThe Fed also rapidly reduced interest rates in the banking system to near zero while printing mass quantities of dollars \u2014 ultimately trillions \u2014 in the hopes of halting a deflationary disaster that threatened to equal or exceed the Great Depression.\n\nAll this was done with the new Fed policy tools we discussed in a general way in Part I. But this time, the Fed actions were running on steroids. Fortunately for the nation, the Fed\u2019s unprecedented interventionism worked to a great extent, at least in terms of economic triage.\n\nGovernment assistance\u2013for the wealthy\n\nUnfortunately, both Congress, which is usually a partner with the Fed in solving such disasters, as well as a new Obama administration that proved willfully ignorant of and even disdainful towards the trappings of capitalism, chose this moment to pay off their political supporters.\n\nWorse yet, without any way to pay for it and before anything resembling economic recovery had begun to take hold, congressional and administration Democrats who were entirely in control of the government at the time, also chose to add a massive new federal \u201centitlement\u201d\u2014Obamacare\u2014to the Great Recession\u2019s witches\u2019 brew. Measures to stimulate actual employment could come later if at all. \u201cGifts\u201d of free medical insurance to largely Democrat constituencies would come first.\n\nA significant percentage of the trillions of new dollars ordered up by the Fed wound up either distributed to union constituencies, sitting in bank vaults\u2014courtesy of the massively flawed Dodd-Frank bank cure-all bill\u2014or in the pockets of wealthy corporations and individuals who supported Democratic candidates.\n\nFavored corporations and individuals could now obtain fresh money via cheap loans (in the case of individuals) or by selling bonds (IBM, Apple and the like) at historically low interest rates. The proceeds of many of these new bond issues were then used to buy back shares of a company\u2019s stock, effectively inflating earnings per share and boosting share prices to above-average levels.\n\nBut at the same time that large corporations were gorging themselves on cheap money, John Q. Public\u2014indebted to the max via previous ruinous government policies that encouraged over-borrowing and overspending\u2014failed to qualify for any loans at all. When approaching their bank for a new housing loan or a much-needed refinancing of an existing loan, they soon ran up against draconian new lending rules that disqualified all but a few borrowers from qualifying for anything more than a high-interest rate credit card.\n\nThe result: a prolonged, unplanned buyers\u2019 strike in both retail and real estate alike that\u2019s only begun to life in recent years due to a loosening in auto loan standards, which, in a way takes us back to the future.\n\nRead also: 1937 d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? A turning point for Federal Reserve policy\n\nHome loans have been somewhat easier to get over the past year. But refinancing home loans still remains difficult, particularly via major lenders like Wells Fargo, which are still constrained by standards imposed courtesy of Dodd-Frank\u2019s evolving rules. Since most consumers and homeowners not already foreclosed upon are saddled with older, high-interest loans they haven\u2019t been able to refinance, it will take them a very long time to pay them off. That means they won\u2019t be doing a lot of \u201cconsuming\u201d anytime soon.\n\nMeanwhile, the companies and institutions that could obtain essentially billions and perhaps trillions of dollars at nearly zero interest rates were using essentially free money to raise their compensation packages, snatch up huge chunks of prime corporate real estate and, not surprisingly, also buy back billions of dollars of their own company\u2019s shares. All of this helped those still in the stock market\u2014like themselves\u2014enjoy outsized profits as the stock market staged a massive, taxpayer-financed recovery from its 2009 bottom.\n\nIn one sense, this was precisely the Fed\u2019s purpose for keeping interest rates so low for so long. The Fed wanted to see the value of all assets\u2014particularly stocks\u2014increase again, at least back to previous, pre-recession values. On the surface at least, this would help restore the \u201cwealth effect\u201d that had been lost between 2007-2009. But while institutions and the wealthy benefited, no one else really did.\n\nAs it\u2019s pump-priming money printing regime began to lose its power, it became increasingly obvious that the Fed would have to end the zero interest rate environment and start boosting interest rates back to normal levels at some point. They\u2019d already effectively lost their standard \u201cdraining\u201d and \u201cinjecting\u201d strategies (Part I) in the Great Recession, leaving themselves with little on hand with which to intervene should the economy suffer another recession.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s baffling new paradox\n\nBy the time period spanning 2013-2015, the Fed found it was trapped inside an economic dilemma they\u2019d never anticipated or seen, at least not publicly. Having never managed, largely due to a feckless Congress and president, to get even a fraction of the cheap money they\u2019d printed back into the hands of those who really needed it\u2014the average U.S. taxpayer and consumer\u2014the Fed found itself forced to start applying the kind of economic medicine heretofore only used in an inflationary environment\u2014the hiking of interest rates and the draining of money from the system.\n\nUnaided by either Congress or the president, they\u2019d actually succeeded in creating the inflation they sought to counteract the deflationary effects of the Great Recession. But that inflation was limited to the stock and bond markets and, belatedly, to real estate, at least if one managed to live in New York or San Francisco or a few other cities where the wealthy once again recklessly drove up the price of local real estate. Other areas of the country weren\u2019t nearly so lucky.\n\nAddressing this weirdly selective inflation is truly uncharted territory for the Fed, particularly in the current environment where commodities like oil are, in fact, rapidly deflating in price. No one at this point, including the Fed knows how things will turn out for the economy as the nation\u2019s central bank begins to hike interest rates during a weak recovery, conjuring up the ghosts of 1937.\n\nNext: 1937 all over again?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Great Recession and its aftermath take the Federal Reserve into uncharted territory, leaving few ways out of the government's self-inflicted economic mess.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Terry Ponick", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "WASHINGTON, Dec. 19, 2015 \u2013 In our previous article, we provided a short history of how the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank has generally dealt with inflationary and deflationary forces after its Great M\u2026", "title": "The Great Recession: End game for poor government policies", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/business-2/the-great-recession-end-game-for-poor-government-policies-54064/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bears_on_wall_street_1907_800B.jpg", "height": 534}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Great Recession and its aftermath take the Federal Reserve into uncharted territory, leaving few ways out of the government's self-inflicted economic mess.", "title": "The Great Recession: End game for poor government policies", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bears_on_wall_street_1907_800B.jpg", "creator": "@terryp17", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "1937 recession,great recession,derivatives,interest rates,inflation,federal reserve,terry ponick", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T17:25:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-19T19:31:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "1937 Recession, Derivatives, Federal Reserve, Great Recession, inflation, interest rates, Terry Ponick"}, "article_summary": "The Great Recession: BackgroundAside from the 1 percent, most working Americans today understand the Great Recession as the time when their lives changed emotionally, financially, personally and likely permanently.\nSome (like this writer) would argue that the average American worker has yet to emerge from the Great Recession.\nThe Great Recession and its aftermath take the Federal Reserve into uncharted territory, leaving few ways out of the government's self-inflicted economic catastrophe.\nUnaided by either Congress or the president, they\u2019d actually succeeded in creating the inflation they sought to counteract the deflationary effects of the Great Recession.\nThey\u2019d already effectively lost their standard \u201cdraining\u201d and \u201cinjecting\u201d strategies (Part I) in the Great Recession, leaving themselves with little on hand with which to intervene should the economy suffer another recession."}
