The National Health Service, which is funded by taxes and payroll deductions but has faced years of financial strain, delivers most treatment without charge. Despite regular funding crises, there has been no similar strike since 1975.\n\nMr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party has always found it hard to make changes to the health service, which was created by the Labour Party in the 1940s and is now creaking under the strain of an aging population and tightened budgets.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his memoirs, Nigel Lawson, a chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wrote that health practitioners regarded themselves as \u201ca priesthood,\u201d making the sector \u201cextraordinarily difficult to reform.\u201d\n\nThe National Health Service, he wrote, \u201cis the closest thing the English have to a religion.\u201d\n\nIt is also a significant presence in national life, employing 1.6 million people which, it says, puts it in the top five of the world\u2019s largest work forces, alongside the United States Defense Department, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nWeekend shifts are at the heart of the current dispute. A proposed new contract would increase basic pay but would reduce the number of hours for which junior doctors receive added compensation for work, particularly on Saturdays.\n\nThe government argues that this would improve treatment by creating a genuine seven-day service, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Tuesday highlighted the elevated mortality rates recorded for some medical conditions on weekends, when hospitals have fewer staff.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr. Hunt compared the situation of a hospital doctor to that of an airline pilot\u2019s being told, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but as it\u2019s Sunday you don\u2019t have a co-pilot, but off you go to New York.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe doctors counter that their stand against excessive working, and the strain it puts on them, makes them the guardians of safety in hospitals.\n\nOfficially, junior doctors are required to work a 48-hour week, but that is calculated over a 26-week period, and they can end up working long stretches, particularly over weekends.\n\nThe Strike at a Glance\n\nThe government insists that doctors would not be worse off under the new contract, but that is disputed by the British Medical Association, which represents more than 37,000 of the country\u2019s 55,000 junior doctors and which describes the proposed conditions as \u201cunsafe and unfair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe dispute has crystallized a broader set of worries and frustrations felt by many doctors working in a system in which demand for health care sometimes seems infinite, but for which resources are definitely not. When junior doctors were asked to authorize a strike last year, 98 percent voted in favor.\n\nSome opinion surveys have suggested that public support lies with the medical professionals, at least in the initial phase of the walkout. The doctors are planning two more protests in the coming weeks: a 48-hour strike that would also affect nonurgent care, and another day\u2019s walkout in which they would withdraw all treatment.\n\nSeveral opposition politicians sided with the strikers on Tuesday. Justin Madders, who speaks for the Labour Party on health issues, said that junior doctors had been left with \u201cno choice but to take this action,\u201d while the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, visited a London hospital picket line.\n\nThe dispute highlights a crucial distinction between the government-administered British health care system and the market-driven American approach to health care.\n\nThe National Health Service has been praised for providing universal access while being cost-effective, while the American system, despite the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, is still so expensive that many people cannot afford treatment.\n\nAlthough British doctors can operate private practices, most participate in the National Health Service, making them subject to the government workplace rules that the junior doctors are now protesting.\n\nIn the United States, doctors are more likely to work in for-profit practices, with health insurers\u2019 payment menus setting the rules.\n\nWhatever the comparison, the British system is well regarded internationally by some measures, despite its stretched resources. A 2013 survey of 11 industrialized nations by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan health policy research group in the United States, ranked Britain No. 1 over all and at the top in categories including quality of care, patient access and efficiency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States was ranked at the bottom over all, despite having the costliest care per capita ($8,508), compared with Britain\u2019s lowest cost by this measure ($3,405).\n\nThe National Health Service fared less well compared with other European countries, however. A 2014 survey by the Health Consumer Powerhouse, which is based in Sweden, ranked England\u2019s health service 14th out of 36.\n\nLike other aspects of the dispute, the scale of the strike in England was contested on Tuesday. The British Medical Association said that \u201ctens of thousands of junior doctors\u201d were striking, but N.H.S. England, which leads the health service, said that 39 percent of junior doctors, out of a possible 26,000, had reported for duty on the day shift. The current action is scheduled to end Wednesday morning.\n\nJohann Malawana, who leads the medical association\u2019s junior doctors\u2019 committee, said that his members felt that they had no alternative but to strike, and appealed to ministers to address \u201cconcerns around safe working patterns and ensure the contract recognizes the long, intense and unsocial hours which junior doctors do.\u201d\n\nAnne Rainsberry, the national incident director for N.H.S. England, apologized to all patients affected. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough day,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the N.H.S. is pulling out all the stops, with senior doctors and nurses often stepping in to provide cover.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160112060856, "twitter": {"description": "The first strike by medical doctors in the country in four decades heightened tensions
