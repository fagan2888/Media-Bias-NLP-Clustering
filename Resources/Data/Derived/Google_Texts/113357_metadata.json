Sales for the current quarter are expected to range from $65 million to $70 million, lower than Wall Street consensus estimates.\n\nBottom-line results weren\u2019t particularly encouraging either: the company\u2019s loss widened to $15.1 million from a year-earlier loss of $3.1 million, as operating expenses jumped 50%.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not happy with where we are,\u201d Chief Executive Michael Barrett said in an earnings call with analysts. \u201cWe believe in time you\u2019ll see a substantial re-acceleration of revenue growth,\u201d he added.\n\nMillennial Media\u2019s shares tanked 12% to $2.95 in recent after hours trading, a far cry from its $13 a share IPO price in 2012.\n\nThe latest period marks Millennial\u2019s first full quarter under Mr. Barrett, an advertising veteran who took over the reins of Millennial in January from co-founder Paul Palmieri. Mr. Barrett previously served as Yahoo\u2019s chief revenue officer and CEO of programmatic ad company AdMeld, which was acquired by Google in 2011.\n\nRevenue in Millennial\u2019s business that focuses on \u201cperformance\u201d advertisers, marketers that seek to get viewers to perform an action when they view an ad such as downloading an app or registering their email address, took a big hit in the latest period.\n\nMillennial attributed the \u201cvery significant drop-off\u201d in the performance business due to a small number of large app download advertisers spending \u201cfar less\u201d with Millennial than they were a year ago. Meanwhile, growth in the business that focuses on \u201cbrand\u201d advertisers, or marketers that seek to promote the awareness of their brand and persuade consumers to make a purchase over time, didn\u2019t grow as much as the company had expected.\n\n\u201cClearly a few big players entering the mobile space are taking significant chunks of the app download business,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. \u201cWe need improvement here.\u201d\n\nFacebook, for example, has seen huge growth in its mobile advertising business, particularly from app advertisers.\n\nMillennial has been building up its programmatic platforms, a move that the company sees as key to its future growth as more advertisers move their ad dollars to automated ad buying systems.\n\nMobile advertising is an increasingly competitive and fast-growing sector, with ad spending expected to explode 83% this year, according to research firm eMarketer. Still, Millennial Media has incurred losses since its inception and operating expenses have continued to climb. In the second quarter, its gross margin narrowed to 40.2% from 42.4%. Millennial expects gross margins in the near-term of about 40%, though margins may fall below that level as it expands its exchange business.\n\nMillennial disclosed in a securities filing on Monday said Mr. Barrett would add principal financial officer to his title. Chief financial officer Michael Avon in May said he would step down from the role at the end of the second quarter. Millennial also disclosed that its head of sales and operations Molly Spillman is leaving the company at the end of the week.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Mobile ad network [wsj-ticker ticker=\"MM\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Millennial Media\" postfix=\"'s\"] revenue growth didn't live up to its expectations in the second quarter as the company faced increased competition from rivals such as Google and [wsj-ticker ticker=\"FB\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Facebook\" postfix=\"\"].
