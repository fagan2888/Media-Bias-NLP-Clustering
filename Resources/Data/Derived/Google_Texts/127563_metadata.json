NBC Chicago's Mary Ann Ahern reports. (Published Thursday, April 23, 2015)\n\nTop elected officials, clergy members and area Catholics said final goodbyes to the late Cardinal Francis George during Thursday's packed funeral Mass for the Chicago leader, who was remembered as a vigorous defender of Roman Catholic orthodoxy.\n\nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel were among the roughly 1,200 people attending services at the city's Holy Name Cathedral near downtown. The Mass followed three days of visitation, including overnight hours on Wednesday.\n\n\"Francis George lived a life grounded in conviction,\" Seattle Archbishop J. Peter Sartain, a friend, said during the homily. \"He was so utterly a Christian that no circumstance seemed inappropriate for him to give witness to Christ.\"\n\nGeorge, a Chicago native, died Friday at age 78 after a long fight with cancer.

(Published Thursday, April 23, 2015)\n\nDozens of Chicago Catholics gathered throughout the overnight hours Thursday to pay their respects during a vigil at the cathedral.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t miss it,\" said Sandy Stoll. \"He\u2019s just, he\u2019s someone that you meet one time and then you see him again and he remembers you.\"\n\nThe procession to All Saints Catholic Cemetery & Mausoleum, where George was interred, took him past St. Pascal's Church in Portage Park, where George's spiritual journey began when he was known as Frannie.\n\n\"It was cool that he went to school here,\" said fourth-grader Samantha Young. \"My priest was saying yesterday to think about it: he walked the same halls. He went to the same lunchroom. And he was in the same classes.\"\n\nThe parish is also where George was ordained as priest in 1963. Parishioner John Gora said his family members recalled playing cards with George's mother in the gymnasium.\n\n\"His mother said, 'One day my son's going to be Bishop, then Cardinal, then Pope!' Gora recalled. \"Every mother thinks highly of their son, but you know what, he came close.\"\n\nGeorge would return to St. Pascal's on occassion, and church leaders still refer to him as the church's favorite son.\n\n\"Anytime you went up to talk to him, ... and said, 'Cardinal, I'm from St. Pascal's,' his face would just light up,\" said Deacon Gene Dorgan.\n\nGeorge had a reputation for being an intellectual leader in the church and a leading figure in some of the most prominent events in the U.S. church. He played a key role in the church's response to the clergy sex abuse scandal and led the U.S. bishops' fight against the Affordable Care Act, arguing that President Barack Obama's health insurance law would allow taxpayer money to fund abortion.\n\nPope John Paul II appointed George to lead the nation's third-largest archdiocese in 1997.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC Chicago", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top elected officials, clergy members and area Catholics said final goodbyes to the late Cardinal Francis George during Thursday's packed funeral Mass.", "title": "Faithful Say Final Farewell to Cardinal George", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Chicago", "description": "Top elected officials, clergy members and area Catholics said final goodbyes to the late Cardinal Francis George during Thursday's packed funeral Mass.", "title": "Faithful Say Final Farewell to Cardinal George", "url": "http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/I-Wouldnt-Miss-It-Mourners-Gather-Ahead-of-Funeral-for-George-301042131.html", "image": "http://media.nbcchicago.com/images/1200*675/Cardinal-George-Burial-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Top elected officials, clergy members and area Catholics said final goodbyes to the late Cardinal Francis George during Thursday's packed funeral Mass.", "title": "Faithful Say Final Farewell to Cardinal George", "url": "http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/I-Wouldnt-Miss-It-Mourners-Gather-Ahead-of-Funeral-for-George-301042131.html", "image": "http://media.nbcchicago.com/images/1200*675/Cardinal-George-Burial-1.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcchicago", "site": "@nbcchicago", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 187516345314}, "keywords": "Cardinal Francis George, Cardinal George Services,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcchicago"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Cardinal Francis George, Cardinal George Services,"}, "article_summary": "Mourners Gather for Third Day of Services for Cardinal GeorgeMourners will say their final goodbyes to Cardinal Francis George Thursday.\nGeorge would return to St. Pascal's on occassion, and church leaders still refer to him as the church's favorite son.\n\"Anytime you went up to talk to him, ... and said, 'Cardinal, I'm from St. Pascal's,' his face would just light up,\" said Deacon Gene Dorgan.\nGeorge, a Chicago native, died Friday at age 78 after a long fight with cancer.\n\"Francis George lived a life grounded in conviction,\" Seattle Archbishop J.
