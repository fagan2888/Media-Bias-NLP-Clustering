Will their patients still turn to the clinic once they have coverage?\n\nCBS 2\u2019s Derrick Blakley takes a look at the impact on clinics for low-income patients in this original report.\n\nMatthew Langer has been unemployed and uninsured for three years. That\u2019s why he\u2019s a patient at Chicago Family Health Center.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re pretty competent here. I like the service I\u2019ve had,\u201d said Langer.\n\nBut when Langer signs up for Obamacare, he could go to Rush or University of Chicago or anywhere. That\u2019s the new challenge for clinics that traditionally serve the poor.\n\n\u201cToday, community health centers, like all providers, must compete in the marketplace to retain patients,\u201d said Warren Brodine, CEO of Chicago Family Health Center.\n\nToday, 44 percent of Chicago family\u2019s patients are uninsured, but with health coverage comes new options.\n\n\u201cThey will have the opportunity to try out or select a different provider for their primary care and other services,\u201d said Brodine.\n\nThe other challenge: dealing with a flood of newly-insured patients. A $6 million Obamacare grant allowed Chicago Family to build a new, expanded clinic in Pullman, but the patients CBS 2 spoke with, like Cynthia Jeffries, insist they\u2019re staying put.\n\nJeffries first came to Chicago Family when she didn\u2019t have insurance, but still comes even though she is now insured.\n\n\u201cI like the doctors here. I like how they take care of me here,\u201d said Jeffries.\n\nChicago family is expanding facilities and adding doctors as it gears up to expand the number of patients its handles from 30,000 today to as many as 42,000 next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health clinics that serve the poor could become an unintended casualty of the Affordable Care Act.
