Last week, former Fox News host Glenn Beck returned for a guest appearance with Megyn Kelly and created a bit of buzz saying he wished he'd have been more positive and less divisive during his days on the cable channel.

Some call it an apology. I don't.

He left Fox News in 2011 under a cloud of controversy. And I celebrated his leaving, because it meant one of the most divisive, reckless and polarizing figures I had ever covered was being marginalized.

I remain convinced that mainstream TV and the country are much better off with him in the margins instead of having an audience of 1.8 million viewers a night as he did on Fox.
