It jumped to almost 65 percent in the last week in March.The increase came because of major policy shifts decided upon in January. Latinos made up about 60 percent of California's uninsured before open enrollment began on January 1 this year.\u201cThere was a dramatic improvement in Latino enrollment,\u201d noted Peter Lee, executive director of the state\u2019s online marketplace health care exchange, Covered California, which served as the portal for enrollment in both individual private insurance coverage and Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s name for the low-cost or no-cost health insurance program for low-income people, known as Medicaid in the rest of the nation.Lee was among five state health care exchange directors who reviewed for the media in an April 10 teleconference the successes of their final push for enrollment in March and lessons learned in enrolling people. At approximately 3 million and 926,000, respectively, California and New York had the highest enrollment numbers. Thursday\u2019s teleconference was sponsored by Families USA, the national non-profit organization for health care consumers.Because a sudden uptick of unique visitors slowed the system at the end of March and may have prevented some consumers from meeting the deadline, Covered California is allowing consumers until April 15 to contact an enrollment expert and complete their application for May 1 health coverage, Lee said. They can find free, confidential help by visiting the website at www.CoveredCA.com Enrollment for low-cost or no-cost Medi-Cal insurance through the Covered California website will not be affected by the deadline, as it continues year-round.Enrollment in Covered California private health insurance plans hit 1,221,727 through March 31. In fact, March was the highest single month of enrollment, with more than 416,000 people signing up for a health insurance plan.Lee said enhanced outreach boosted enrollment among Latinos and among Californians 18-34 years old. Additionally, Covered California more than doubled the base projection for Asian enrollment and has met the base projection for African- American enrollment.Prior to the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, 7 million of the nation\u2019s 47 uninsured people resided in California.Between the two health insurance programs, more than 3 million state residents have enrolled, said Lee.Lee said one of the reasons the state saw a last-minute surge in Latino enrollment and among Californians 18 to 34 years old was that Covered California boosted its marketing, as well as increased the number of bilingual certified enrollment counselors and certified insurance agents to help people across the finish line. There are currently more than 5,000 of those in the state who speak Spanish.He said Covered California would continue its e-mail outreach until April 15, when the grace period for the first open enrollment ends.One of the lessons learned from this year\u2019s enrollment efforts is \u201cgetting out of the gate as early as possible,\u201d Lee said, especially because in 2015, open enrollment will last only three months instead of the six months all states were given this year.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "coveredcalifornia, latinohealth, acadeadline, obamacare", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
