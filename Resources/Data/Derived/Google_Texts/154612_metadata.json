Linda Greenstein, was approved 4-1 by the Senate Environment and Energy Committee Monday. Only Republican Sen. Sam Thompson was opposed.\n\nIt\u2019s proposed that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and South Jersey Turnpike Authority install electric vehicle charging stations at rest stops, with costs recovered through charging fees set by the Board of Public Utilities.\n\n\u201cElectric vehicle sales doubled last year (nationally) compared to 2012. We\u2019re expecting more and more people to be driving these environmentally friendly cars,\u2019\u2019 said Greenstein, a panel member. \u201cWithout charging stations, this technology will not be effective.\u2019\u2019\n\nRepublican Sen. Kip Bateman noted the mixed signals makers of electric cars are receiving from New Jersey policy makers. Tesla\u2019s direct-sales program was recently put on hold by the state Motor Vehicle Commission, though several lawmakers have begun efforts to implement rule changes that would allow Tesla to resume those operations.\n\n\u201cI find it somewhat ironic that we\u2019re directing them to install these charging stations but yet we have companies like Tesla trying to sell their electric vehicles in New Jersey but having obviously the whole issue,\u2019\u2019 Bateman said.\n\nIn the 2012-2013 legislative session, both houses had similar bills that never reached committee votes, despite the Assembly\u2019s version having nine sponsors.\n\nBob Jordan Statehouse Reporter: Bob Jordan has been writing about New Jersey politics and Gov.
