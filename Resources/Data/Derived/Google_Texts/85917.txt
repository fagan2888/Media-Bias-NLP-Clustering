Fox News’ “Your World” host Neil Cavuto answered an attack Barack Obama directed to Fox News, and told the president in no uncertain terms that Fox isn’t the root of the president’s problems, but that Obamacare is.

Obama blamed Fox News for the Affordable Care Act’s unpopularity Thursday in a speech he delivered at Prince George’s Community College. Cavuto wasn’t about to let this go unanswered.

“Mr. President, we at Fox News are not the problem,” he said. “I hate to break it to you, sir. You are. Your words are. Your promises are. We didn’t sell this healthcare law. Sir, you did. Remember this?”

He then listed a long litany of promises Obama made to sell his signature healthcare law to a gullible public — every one of them broken.

“I know you hate us at Fox,” Cavuto concludes. “But please take a look in a mirror, and fast. You think we’re the skunk at your picnic. But that doesn’t mean we’re the ones that stink. Because that smell isn’t coming from the folks reporting on your law. Mr. President, that smell is your law.”
