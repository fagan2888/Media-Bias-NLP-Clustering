RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — World leaders and top dignitaries are heading to Saudi Arabia to give their condolences following the death of King Abdullah.

The king, who presided over Saudi Arabia for around two decades, died early Friday and was buried that same afternoon in the capital Riyadh. In line with Islamic tradition, there was no memorial service and instead leaders from around the world will begin visits to Saudi Arabia starting Saturday to pay their respects.

The newly enthroned King Salman is expected to receive U.S. President Barack Obama, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Japan’s Crown Prince Naruhito, Spain’s King Felipe, Jordan’s King Abdullah, Dutch King Willem-Alexander and the United Kingdom’s Prince Charles.

Despite deep tensions and rivalries, Iran’s IRNA news agency says Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is also heading to the kingdom.
