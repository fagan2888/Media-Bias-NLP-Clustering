Like a man-sized chess match, the odds change with every move.\n\nThe game may look simple \u2013 the athletes seem like everyday people \u2013 but there\u2019s a lot more to the sport than what meets the eye. Even though the competitors don\u2019t have professional careers in the sport, they are fully committed when it comes to the Olympics.\n\nA newbie to curling? Look here for Curling 101.\n\nview photo essay Sochi on view: Scenes from the Winter Games Images from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\n\u201cMy dad still curls, in beer leagues,\u201d Minnesota native John Shuster, who is in his third Olympic Games, joked. He manages a restaurant when he\u2019s not competing for the Red, White and Blue. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to get a chance to represent our sport and our country,\u201d he said.\n\nShuster lives a pretty anonymous life for three years and 11 months, only to be approached before and during the Olympics. But he doesn\u2019t mind. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have the attention and share the sport because we love this game,\u201d Shuster said.\n\nThe Americans may not be favored to win at this year\u2019s Games, but it certainly hasn\u2019t killed the team\u2019s spirit. \u201cWe may surprise some people who see us eighth out of 10 teams,\u201d Shuster said.\n\nOn Monday, the men\u2019s team will face fourth-ranked Norway and the women face Switzerland, also ranked fourth. \u201cThey look awesome,\u201d Shuster said of the Norwegian team. \u201cTheir front-end guys have visited us in Duluth. It\u2019s always fun to play them.\u201d\n\nSportsmanship is key during curling, especially since it\u2019s a game without referees. The athletes call penalties on themselves, including when someone swears. \u201cPeople can hear you talking because we\u2019re mic\u2019ed up all the time,\u201d Shuster said.\n\nAnd people will be listening \u2026 and watching.\n\nFollow Brian A.
