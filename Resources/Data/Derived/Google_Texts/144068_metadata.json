They even demanded that the review period be bumped from 30 to 60 days if the negotiations went past the point when a 30-day period would conflict with lawmakers\u2019 August recess.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iran\u2019s parliament one-upped Congress, declaring that it will not vote on the deal for at least 80 days, during which time a panel of experts will review it.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Iran Deal 10 Years Later \u2013 How It Could Change the World\n\nThe announcement was widely seen as a strategic move by the Islamic Republic, which stands to gain substantially from the deal in terms of the lifting of economic sanctions but which cannot be seen by its own people as being pushed around by Western powers, particularly the U.S.\n\nWere opponents of the deal in the U.S. Congress able to derail it \u2013 and they have only a slim chance of doing so \u2013 Iran\u2019s leadership might look weak if they had already approved it. Under the 80-day review standard, by contrast, they won\u2019t have to take a position on the deal until they know what Congress has done.\n\nThat means that in the unlikely event of Congress rejecting the deal, they could claim that it was never acceptable to them in the first place. If Congress does accept the deal, Iranian lawmakers can approve it while putting the best possible spin on it \u2013 likely including rhetorical abuse of U.S. policies \u2013 without concern that their rhetoric endangers the agreement.\n\nThe announcement came just a day after the United Nations Security Council, all of whose permanent members were parties to the negotiation, approved the deal.\n\nRelated: The Long, Confusing History of Iran\u2019s Frozen Assets\n\nBarring unexpected Democratic opposition in Congress, the deal will be approved in the U.S. as well, though there\u2019s a chance it will require a presidential veto of a congressional vote of disapproval.\n\nOn the whole, the current status of the Iran deal appears to be that it\u2019s done except for the political posturing that will allow Iran to sell it to its people \u2013 a sales job that will involve a lot of boasting about how its negotiators got the best of the agreement while giving up the least.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s all over but the shouting.\n\nAnd there will be shouting. Iranian chief negotiator Javad Zarif appeared before members of Congress Tuesday and assured them that, regardless of what happens with their nation\u2019s nuclear program, the sanctions being lifted under the agreement will be exceedingly difficult to re-impose once international business interests begin reinvesting in Iran\u2019s starved markets.\n\nRelated: After Obama\u2019s Nuke Deal, What Happens If Israel Attacks Iran?\n\nIndeed, on Monday, just days after the agreement was finalized, German diplomats were leading a delegation of business representatives to Tehran to meet with Iranian officials.\n\nAlso this week, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the U.S. an \u201carrogant\u201d nation, toward which Iran would not change its policies.\n\nAsked about the religious leader\u2019s comments, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was arguably the driving force behind the deal, said, \u201cIf it is the policy, it\u2019s very disturbing, it\u2019s very troubling, and we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Tuesday, Iran\u2019s parliament one-upped Congress, declaring that it will not vote on the recently concluded deal for at least 80 days, during which time a panel of experts will review it.", "title": "Iranian Parliament to U.S. Congress: You First", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/22/Iranian-Parliament-US-Congress-You-First", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08072013_Iranian_Nuclear_Plant_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/22/Iranian-Parliament-US-Congress-You-First", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08072013_Iranian_Nuclear_Plant_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On Tuesday, Iran\u2019s parliament one-upped Congress, declaring that it will not vote on the recently concluded deal for at least 80 days, during which time a panel of experts will review it.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday, Iran\u2019s parliament one-upped Congress, declaring that it will not vote on the deal for at least 80 days, during which time a panel of experts will review it.\nIf Congress does accept the deal, Iranian lawmakers can approve it while putting the best possible spin on it \u2013 likely including rhetorical abuse of U.S. policies \u2013 without concern that their rhetoric endangers the agreement.\nUnder the 80-day review standard, by contrast, they won\u2019t have to take a position on the deal until they know what Congress has done.\nThat means that in the unlikely event of Congress rejecting the deal, they could claim that it was never acceptable to them in the first place.\nIndeed, on Monday, just days after the agreement was finalized, German diplomats were leading a delegation of business representatives to Tehran to meet with Iranian officials."}
