A woman was found dead in a bathtub Sunday afternoon.

Emergency crews were called to a home in the 2500 block of North Brandon Circle, near K-96 and Greenwich. When they got there, they found a 41-year-old woman dead in a bathtub.

Police believe that she died of natural causes, not drowning. The call for help came from a family member around noon.

It is not known how long the woman was in the bathtub before she was discovered, but police said it was possible she died sometime overnight.

Neighbors in the area said she had two teenage sons.

Police are still investigating.
