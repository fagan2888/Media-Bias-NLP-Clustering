He alleges Aerojet Rocketdyne, a unit of GenCorp Inc. Rocketdyne, hired a former US Air Force acquisitions official in return for a big contract.\n\nThe 42-year-old billionaire is referring to a story on the \u2018National Legal and Policy Center\u2019 [NLPC] website about Pentagon\u2019s former high-ranking Air Force program officer Roger \u201cScott\u201d Correll, who was responsible for procuring launch services from private companies.\n\nMusk says that Aerojet Rocketdyne, which supplies rocket engines to United Launch Alliance [ULA] \u2014 a joint venture between government-contracting heavyweights Boeing Co. (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) \u2014 hired Correll in May. One of Correll\u2019s last official acts before \u2018retiring\u2019 in January was to award a massive contract for 36 future space rocket launches without any competition to ULA.\n\nBut Correll didn\u2019t exactly retire. In fact, after leaving Pentagon he ended up as Rocketdyne\u2019s Vice President for Government Acquisition and Policy, which as NLPC notes, is \u201cseemingly more than befitting of his role.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Thursday, Musk wrote, \u201cV likely AF official Correll was told by ULA/Rocketdyne that a rich VP job was his if he gave them a sole source contract.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Musk wrote: \u201cReason I believe this is likely is that Correll first tried to work at SpaceX, but we turned him down. Our competitor, it seems, did not.\u201d\n\nIn an other tweet Musk, who\u2019s also CEO of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA), called for action, saying \u201cEither way, this case certainly deserves close examination by the DoD Inspector General per @SenJohnMcCain\u2019s request\u201d.\n\nAerojet Rocketdyne denied Musk\u2019s accusations, calling them \u201ccompletely without merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident of the process that we followed in hiring Mr. Correll,\u201d Glenn Mahone, Rocketdyne\u2019s spokesman said in a phone interview with the LA Times.\n\nCorrell received \u201cthe necessary clearances and approvals\u201d from the Defense Department, Mahone said. \u201cHis duties and actions on behalf of Aerojet Rocketdyne are consistent with those clearances and approvals.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Wall Street Pit", "description": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk went on Twitter (TWTR) to suggest that one of his rivals won a no-bid defense contract ...", "title": "Elon Musk Suspects One of His Rivals of Corruption", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wallstreetpit.com/wp-content/uploads/news/tesla-elon_musk.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-24T12:43:29+00:00", "url": "http://wallstreetpit.com/104142-elon-musk-suspects-one-of-his-rivals-of-corruption-tesla-tsla/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wallstreetpit", "section": "Business", "tag": "TSLA", "published_time": "2014-05-24T12:30:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-24T12:43:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk went on Twitter (TWTR) to suggest that one of his rivals won a no-bid defense contract ...", "creator": "@wallstreetpit", "image": "http://wallstreetpit.com/wp-content/uploads/news/tesla-elon_musk.jpg", "title": "Elon Musk Suspects One of His Rivals of Corruption", "site": "@wallstreetpit", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk went on Twitter (TWTR) to suggest that one of his rivals won a no-bid defense contract because of corruption.\n\u201cHis duties and actions on behalf of Aerojet Rocketdyne are consistent with those clearances and approvals.\u201d\nHe alleges Aerojet Rocketdyne, a unit of GenCorp Inc.
