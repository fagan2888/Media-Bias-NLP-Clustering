President Ronald Reagan was the first to do so in 1982 and acknowledge the guests, who sit with the first lady, during the speech. Every president since has continued the tradition.\n\nThe year\u2019s group includes astronaut Scott Kelly, the president and CEO of CVS Health and eight people who wrote letters to Obama, including four he spent time with last year.\n\nGross is a former federal subcontractor who was arrested in Cuba in 2009. His wife and others said he was there to set up Internet access for the small Jewish community on the communist island. He was released last month as part of a historic announcement by Obama that the U.S. would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba after five decades.\n\nKelly, of Houston, is preparing to blast off in March on a yearlong space mission, longer than any other U.S. astronaut. His identical twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, is married to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz. She was gravely wounded four years ago during a shooting at a political event she held in Tucson. Six people were killed and 13 were injured. Scientists will compare medical data from the brothers to understand how the human body responds to longer durations in space.\n\nCVS Health pulled cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products from its store shelves last year, a move that was applauded by Obama, a former smoker often seen chewing nicotine gum. The decision by CVS Health earned Larry Merlo, the drugstore chain\u2019s top executive, a seat in the first lady\u2019s box.\n\nThe other guests, as identified by the White House, are:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Maryland man who spent five years imprisoned in Cuba will sit next to first lady Michelle Obama for the president's State of the Union address.", "pubdate": 20150119, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A Maryland man who spent five years imprisoned in Cuba will sit next to first lady Michelle Obama for the president's State of the Union address.", "title": "Maryland man freed from Cuba on State of Union guest list", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RTXX2RV.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/whos-on-the-state-of-the-union-guest-list/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A Maryland man who spent five years imprisoned in Cuba will sit next to first lady Michelle Obama for the president's State of the Union address.", "title": "Maryland man freed from Cuba on State of Union guest list", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RTXX2RV.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "state of the union"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "2015 state of the union, Alan Gross, Barack Obama, cvs, Gabrielle Giffords, Mark Kelly, Michelle Obama, Ronald Reagan, Scott Kelly, SOTU, state of the union"}, "article_summary": "Alan Gross and his wife, Judy, are among 22 special guests the White House invited to Tuesday night\u2019s speech.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A Maryland man who returned home last month after spending five years imprisoned in Cuba will have a prime viewing spot for President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address: a seat near first lady Michelle Obama.\nThe decision by CVS Health earned Larry Merlo, the drugstore chain\u2019s top executive, a seat in the first lady\u2019s box.\nRELATED LINKSIt\u2019s become tradition for presidents to invite people whose stories of tragedy or triumph highlight an issue or public policy.\nHe was released last month as part of a historic announcement by Obama that the U.S. would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba after five decades."}
