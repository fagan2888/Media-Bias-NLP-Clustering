TITUSVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Parrish Medical Center has been recognized by The SafeCare Group for excellence in quality, patient safety and efficiency in its 2014-15 “100 SafeCare Hospitals” listing.

PMC ranked a full three standard deviations above the national average in patient safety, placing it within the top two percent of hospitals nationwide, and had the top score in Florida for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital-Acquired Conditions Reduction Program (HACRP).

The “100 SafeCare Hospitals” listing recognizes hospitals that excel in evidence-based areas required under the Affordable Care Act.

The SafeCare Group analyzed hospital data for 40 Affordable Care Act measures for the 2014-2015 hospital ratings. The analysis identified hospitals with comparatively lowest risk- standardized 30-day mortality rates, lowest 30-day readmissions, lowest complications rates in medical and surgical care, lowest in-hospital medical and surgical infections, highest medical and surgical processes of care measures for AMI, HF, PN, and SCIP, and highest patient satisfaction scores.

Only the 100 hospitals between 100-400 beds with the highest scores made the 100 SafeCare Hospitals® list. If all U.S. hospitals attained the 100 SafeCare Hospitals® level, there would be improvement in the more than 400,000 preventable patient deaths and millions of preventable complications that occur each year, according to The SafeCare Group.

“Much too often, hospital reputation and performance on quality measures are divergent. We believe that a listing of outstanding hospitals in the areas of the Affordable Care Act would promote strong incentives to improve care, treatments, and services,” says Dr. Yisrael Safeek, MD, MBA, Founder and Chairman of The SafeCare Group®.
