And Rafael Cruz, the conservative pastor and father of Sen. Ted Cruz, appeared as well, telling a reporter that he was backing Pierson.\n\nBut as Pierson, a well-known tea party activist, and her supporters hammer Sessions and call for an all-out war against Republican incumbents they charge are too comfortable in office, it\u2019s unclear whether the furor will translate into voters showing up in the March 4 primary. For all the attention in conservative circles, Pierson appears to lack the money and name recognition she\u2019ll need to turn out enough votes against a strong incumbent.\n\nThe race for the 32nd Congressional District, the first of contests across the country that pit tea party conservatives against incumbent conservatives, will test whether tea party challengers can duplicate Ted Cruz\u2019s stunning 2012 victory.\n\n\u201cYou in Texas did it with Ted Cruz,\u201d Malkin said last Monday. \u201cIt can be done.\u201d\n\nPolitical celebrities add spice to an otherwise under-the-radar campaign, but political analysts say Pierson lacks the extra time and outside resources that helped Cruz against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the Republican primary and runoff.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems that these insurgents have is they don\u2019t have the visibility, the credibility, the seriousness and the outside backing and the national money to take on incumbents,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Washington-based Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cAnd Pete Sessions doesn\u2019t have the reputation as some kind of squish.\u201d\n\nFor a traditional campaign, Pierson, all by March, will have to raise money for campaign mailers, radio spots and maybe some television. She\u2019ll also have to pay a campaign team and advisers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very long and tough road to do that,\u201d Rothenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to get visibility, particularly in a House race.\u201d\n\n\u2018Part of the deal\u2019\n\nSessions, a nine-term veteran, has declined to discuss Pierson\u2019s challenge directly. Asked about Rafael Cruz\u2019s endorsement of his opponent, he said cryptically: \u201cIt\u2019s part of the deal.\u201d He declined to elaborate.\n\nPierson and her supporters acknowledge the challenges but say she\u2019s not running a traditional campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sugar coat this,\u201d she told supporters last Monday. \u201cThis is an uphill battle. I\u2019m not your typical Republican candidate. I\u2019m not from one those ZIP codes. I don\u2019t have that pedigree. I\u2019m not a multi-millionaire. But the good news is, I\u2019m not your typical Republican candidate.\u201d\n\nIn an interview afterward, Pierson said it was important to provide voters with an alternative to Sessions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to practice what we preach,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give voters a choice.\u201d\n\nThe 32nd Congressional District includes North Dallas, parts of Garland and several other cities, and a small piece of Collin County. It\u2019s heavily Republican, and the primary winner will be strongly favored to defeat Democrat Frank Perez, a Dallas lawyer, in the fall.\n\nTea party leadership\n\nBefore running for Congress, Pierson was a Garland-based leader in the tea party movement, lending her voice and support to candidates and causes that reflected her views.\n\nA single mother born in Kansas to a 15-year-old mother, Pierson takes a no-compromise approach to issues like repealing the Affordable Care Act, slashing government spending and halting illegal immigration.\n\nBefore getting fully involved in the tea party movement, she worked 10 years in the health care industry.\n\nShe says Sessions has sold out the conservative movement and could have had stronger positions on the issues conservatives care most about. Sessions has said that his critics have good hearts but don\u2019t grasp the differences between activism and leadership.\n\nPierson deliberated for much of the summer before deciding to challenge Sessions, who chairs the powerful House Rules Committee.\n\n\u201cI have not lost my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I\u2019m running against the career politician. We\u2019re going to win. I\u2019m running for liberty.\u201d\n\nPierson has been endorsed by the political arm of FreedomWorks, a group that was instrumental in Cruz\u2019s Senate campaign.\n\nBut so far, the group\u2019s political action committee has not given any money to Pierson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to run this race like we\u2019re in this on our own,\u201d she said. Pierson expects to report at least $70,000 in fundraising when campaign finance reports are due later this month. Sessions had more than $1.3 million on hand in his most recent report, last fall.\n\nMalkin agrees that Pierson has to be \u201csavvy at using alternative resources to defeat\u201d establishment power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s open warfare,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cThe incumbency protection racket will draw on huge resources to stifle the voices of dissent.\u201d\n\nMalkin, a syndicated columnist who frequently appears on Fox News, clarified the split among the GOP, saying: \u201cThe people on the left are dirty. The incumbents in power on the right are dirtier.\u201d\n\nPierson said she\u2019s made personal contact with 6,000 voters and has events planned for the rest of the campaign. She\u2019ll also use social media to push her message.\n\nPierson says she\u2019s enjoying meeting voters and activists in the district.\n\nAnd wryly retrofitting a line President Barack Obama used when pushing the Affordable Care Act, Pierson said: \u201cIf you like your congressman, you can keep him.\u201d\n\nFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To unseat Pete Sessions, Katrina Pierson would need money and a strong organization that she appears to lack.", "og": {"description": "To unseat Pete Sessions, Katrina Pierson would need money and a strong organization that she appears to lack.", "title": "Pierson draws conservative stars in battle against Sessions", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140112-pierson-draws-conservative-stars-in-battle-against-sessions.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140112-pierson_0110met.ece/BINARY/original/pierson_0110met", "height": 526}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-01-13T15:03:32Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-01-13T05:21:24Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Pierson draws conservative stars in battle against Sessions\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140112-pierson-draws-conservative-stars-in-battle-against-sessions.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140112-pierson_0110met.ece/BINARY/original/pierson_0110met\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1382532\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-13T05:21:24Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"GROMER JEFFERS Jr.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140112-pierson_0110met.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/pierson_0110met", "publishtime": "2014-01-13T05:21:24Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5886\"", "article_summary": "The race for the 32nd Congressional District, the first of contests across the country that pit tea party conservatives against incumbent conservatives, will test whether tea party challengers can duplicate Ted Cruz\u2019s stunning 2012 victory.\nTea party leadershipBefore running for Congress, Pierson was a Garland-based leader in the tea party movement, lending her voice and support to candidates and causes that reflected her views.\nBefore getting fully involved in the tea party movement, she worked 10 years in the health care industry.\n\u201cAnd Pete Sessions doesn\u2019t have the reputation as some kind of squish.\u201dFor a traditional campaign, Pierson, all by March, will have to raise money for campaign mailers, radio spots and maybe some television.\nPierson deliberated for much of the summer before deciding to challenge Sessions, who chairs the powerful House Rules Committee."}
