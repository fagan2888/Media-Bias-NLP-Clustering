What's In It?\n\nThe troubled payment formula for Medicare physicians is one step closer to repeal.\n\nThe House Thursday overwhelmingly passed legislation to scrap Medicare\u2019s troubled physician payment formula, just days before a March 31 deadline when doctors who treat Medicare patients will see a 21 percent payment cut. Senate action could come this week as well, but probably not until the chamber completes a lengthy series of votes on the GOP\u2019s fiscal 2016 budget package.\n\nAccording to a summary of the bill, unveiled by Republican and Democratic committee leaders earlier this week, the current system would be scrapped and replaced with payment increases for doctors for the next five years as Medicare transitions to a new system focused \u201con quality, value and accountability.\u201d\n\nHundreds of state and national physician groups are urging Senate passage.\n\n\u201cIt will relieve many years of frustration and uncertainty for all physicians by eliminating that sword of Damocles, that\u2019s been hanging over our heads with regards to cuts and replacing it with a predictable albeit small increase in fees over the next four to five years,\u201d said the Massachusetts Medical Society\u2019s president-elect, Dr. Dennis Dimitri.\n\nThere\u2019s enough in the wide-ranging deal for both sides to love or hate.\n\nSenate Democrats have pressed to add to the proposal four years of funding for an unrelated program, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. The House package extends CHIP for two years. In a statement Saturday, Senate Finance Democrats said they were \u201cunited by the necessity of extending CHIP funding for another four years\u201d but others have suggested they may support the package.\n\nSome Democratic allies said the CHIP disagreement should not undermine the proposal. After the House approved the package by a vote of 392-37, Ron Pollack, executive director of the consumers group Families USA, urged the Senate to \u201cadopt a CHIP funding bill as soon as possible. Families USA believes that a four-year extension is preferable to two years. We also know that time is of the essence, and it is crucial that the Senate act quickly.\u201d\n\nSome senators have also raised concerns about asking Medicare beneficiaries to pay for more of their medical care, the impact of the package on women\u2019s health services and cuts to Medicare providers.\n\nIn a letter to House members before Thursday\u2019s vote, the seniors group AARP said the legislation places \u201cunfair burdens on beneficiaries. AARP and other consumer and aging organizations remain concerned that beneficiaries account for the largest portion of budget offsets (roughly $35 billion) through greater out-of-pocket expenses\u201d on top of higher Part B premiums that beneficiaries will pay to prevent the scheduled cut in Medicare physician payments.\n\nHospitals, nursing homes and rehabilitation centers would see lower rates of increase, but are largely backing the legislation.\n\n\u201cAlthough nothing\u2019s perfect, at a time when it\u2019s so difficult to reach accord on really complicated issues, broad support for this solution is really impressive,\u201d said Tim Gens, executive vice president at the Massachusetts Hospital Association. \u201cAnd if it fails, we go back to these temporary patches that only solve the problem in a very expensive way for months at a time.\u201d\n\nSome GOP conservatives and Democrats are unhappy that the package isn\u2019t fully paid for, with policy changes governing Medicare beneficiaries and providers paying for only about $70 billion of the approximately $200 billion package. The Congressional Budget Office Wednesday said the bill would add $141 billion to the federal deficit.\n\nFor doctors, the package offers an end to a familiar but frustrating rite. Lawmakers have invariably deferred the cuts prescribed by a 1997 reimbursement formula, which everyone agrees is broken beyond repair. But the deferrals have always been temporary because Congress has not agreed to offsetting cuts to pay for a permanent fix. In 2010, Congress delayed scheduled cuts five times. In a statement Sunday, the American Medical Association urged Congress \u201cto seize the moment\u201d to enact the changes.\n\nHere are some answers to frequently asked questions about the proposal and the congressional ritual known as the doc fix.\n\nQ: How did this become an issue?\n\nToday\u2019s problem is a result of efforts years ago to control federal spending \u2013 a 1997 deficit reduction law that called for setting Medicare physician payment rates through a formula based on economic growth, known as the \u201csustainable growth rate\u201d (SGR). For the first few years, Medicare expenditures did not exceed the target and doctors received modest pay increases. But in 2002, doctors were furious when their payments were reduced 4.8 percent. Every year since, Congress has staved off the scheduled cuts. But each deferral just increased the size of the fix needed the next time.\n\nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which advises Congress, says the SGR is \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and has called for its repeal. The SGR provides \u201cno incentive for providers to restrain volume,\u201d the agency said.\n\nQ. Why haven\u2019t lawmakers simply eliminated the formula before?\n\nMoney is the biggest problem. An earlier bipartisan, bicameral SGR overhaul plan produced jointly by three key congressional committees would cost $175 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. While that\u2019s far less than previous estimates for SGR repeal, it is difficult to find consensus on how to finance a fix.\n\nFor physicians, the prospect of facing big payment cuts is a source of mounting frustration. Some say the uncertainty has led them to quit the program, while others are threatening to do so. Still, defections have not been significant to date, according to MedPAC.\n\nIn a March 2014 report, the panel stated that beneficiaries\u2019 access to physician services is \u201cstable and similar to (or better than) access among privately insured individuals ages 50 to 64.\u201d Those findings could change, however, if the full force of SGR cuts were ever implemented.\n\n\u201cThe flawed Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and the cycle of patches to keep it from going into effect have created an unstable environment that hinders physicians\u2019 ability to implement new models of care delivery that could improve care for patients,\u201d said Dr. Robert M. Wah, president of the American Medical Association. \u201cWe support the policy to permanently eliminate the SGR and call on Congress to seize the moment and finally put in place reforms that will foster innovation and put us on a path towards a more sustainable Medicare program.\u201d\n\nQ: What are the options that Congress is looking at?\n\nThe House package would scrap the SGR and give doctors a 0.5 percent bump for each of the next five years as Medicare transitions to a payment system designed to reward physicians based on the quality of care provided, rather than the quantity of procedures performed, as the current payment formula does.\n\nThe measure, which builds upon last year\u2019s legislation from the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees and the Senate Finance Committee, would encourage better care coordination and chronic care management, ideas that experts have said are needed in the Medicare program. It would give a 5 percent payment bonus to providers who receive a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of their revenue from an \u201calternative payment model\u201d or patient-centered medical home. It would also allow broader use of Medicare data for \u201ctransparency and quality improvement\u201d purposes.\n\n\u201cThe SGR has generated repeated crises for nearly two decades,\u201d Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., one of the bill\u2019s drafters, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a historic opportunity to finally move to a system that promotes quality over quantity and begins the important work of addressing Medicare\u2019s structural issues.\u201d\n\nThe package, which House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., began negotiating weeks ago, also includes an additional $7.2 billion for community health centers over the next two years. NARAL Pro-Choice America denounced the deal because the health center funding would be subject to the Hyde Amendment, a common legislative provision that says federal money can be used for abortions only when a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\n\nIn a letter to Democratic colleagues, Pelosi said the funding would occur \u201cunder the same terms that Members have previously supported and voted on almost every year since 1979.\u201d In a statement, the National Association of Community Health Centers said the proposal \u201crepresents no change in current policy for Health Centers, and would not change anything about how Health Centers operate today.\u201d\n\nA summary of the House plan says the package also includes other health measures \u2013 known as extenders \u2013 that Congress has renewed each year during the SGR debate. The list includes funding for therapy services, ambulance services and rural hospitals, as well as continuing a program that allows low-income people to keep their Medicaid coverage as they transition into employment and earn more money. The deal also would permanently extend the Qualifying Individual, or QI program, which helps low-income seniors pay their Medicare premiums.\n\nQ. What is the plan for CHIP?\n\nThe House plan would add two years of funding for CHIP, a federal-state program that provides insurance for low-income children whose families earned too much money to qualify for Medicaid. While the health law continues CHIP authorization through 2019, funding for the program has not been extended beyond the end of September.\n\nThe length of the proposed extension could cause strains with Senate Democrats beyond those on the Finance panel who have raised objections to the House package. Last month, the Senate Democratic caucus signed on to legislation from Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, calling for a four-year extension of the current CHIP program.\n\nQ: How would Congress pay for all of that?\n\nThe measure the House passed does not. That is a major departure from the GOP\u2019s mantra that all legislation must be financed. Tired of the yearly SGR battle, veteran members in both chambers may be willing to repeal the SGR on the basis that it\u2019s a budget gimmick \u2013 the cuts are never made \u2013 and therefore financing is unnecessary. But that strategy could run into stiff opposition from Republican lawmakers and some Democrats.\n\nMost lawmakers feel the need to find financing for the Medicare extenders, the CHIP extension and any increase in physician payments over the current pay schedule. Those items account for about $70 billion of financing in the approximately $200 billion package.\n\nConservative groups are urging Republicans to fully finance any SGR repeal. \u201cAmericans didn\u2019t hand Republicans a historic House majority to engage in more deficit spending and budget gimmickry,\u201d Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action for America, said earlier this month.\n\nQ. Will seniors and Medicare providers have to help pay for the plan?\n\nStarting in 2018, wealthier Medicare beneficiaries (individuals with incomes between $133,500 to $214,000, with thresholds likely higher for couples) would pay more for their Medicare coverage, a provision impacting just 2 percent of beneficiaries, according to the summary.\n\nStarting in 2020, \u201cfirst-dollar\u201d supplemental Medicare insurance known as \u201cMedigap\u201d would not be able to cover the Part B deductible for new beneficiaries, which is currently$147 per year but has increased in past years.\n\nBut the effect of that change may be mitigated, according to one analysis.\n\n\u201cBecause Medigap policies would no longer pay the Part B deductible, Medigap premiums for the affected policies would go down. Most affected beneficiaries would come out ahead \u2014 the drop in their Medigap premiums would exceed the increase in their cost sharing for health services,\u201d according to an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cSome others would come out behind. In both cases, the effect would be small \u2014 generally no more than $100 a year.\u201d\n\nExperts contend that the \u201cfirst-dollar\u201d plans, which cover nearly all deductibles and co-payments, keep beneficiaries from being judicious when making medical decisions. According to lobbyists and aides, an earlier version of the \u201cdoc fix\u201d legislation that negotiators considered would have prohibited \u201cfirst dollar\u201d plans from covering the first $250 in costs for new beneficiaries.\n\nPost-acute providers, such as long-term care and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health and hospice organizations, would help finance the repeal, receiving base pay increases of 1 percent in 2018, about half of what was previously expected.\n\nOther changes include phasing in a one-time 3.2 percentage-point boost in the base payment rate for hospitals currently scheduled to take effect in fiscal 2018. The number of years of the phase-in isn\u2019t specified in the bill summary.\n\nScheduled reductions in Medicaid \u201cdisproportionate share\u201d payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of people who are uninsured or covered by Medicaid would be delayed by one year to fiscal 2018 but extended for an additional year to fiscal 2025.\n\nQ. How quickly could the Senate act?\n\nThe wide margin of passage in the House, plus the Obama administration\u2019s support of the measure, may put pressure on senators to pass the bill once they conclude work on the chamber\u2019s fiscal 2016 budget resolution later Thursday or early Friday morning. But Senate Democrats and Republicans may want to offer amendments to the House bill, which could mean that the chamber does not resolve the SGR issue before the Senate\u2019s two-week break, which is scheduled to begin March 30.\n\nIf the SGR issue can\u2019t be resolved by March 31, Congress could pass a temporary patch as negotiations continue or ask the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Medicare, to hold the claims in order to avoid physicians seeing their payments cut 21 percent. However, Speaker Boehner has said the House will not consider a temporary patch before leaving for its break Thursday.\n\nWBUR\u2019s Martha Bebinger contributed to this report, which a version of originally appeared in Kaiser Health News (KHN), a nonprofit national health policy news service.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The troubled payment formula for Medicare physicians is one step closer to repeal.
