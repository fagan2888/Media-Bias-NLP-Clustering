Iran agreed to limit the program in exchange for the lifting of crippling international sanctions on the country.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper has told Congress about Iran\u2019s shifting strategy in several closed-door briefings, explaining that the country\u2019s hackers are not concentrating on major cyberattacks, according to The Times.\n\nIn recent years, Iran has displayed an increasingly sophisticated cyber program with a series of high-profile attacks around the globe.\n\nIn 2012, Iranian hackers reportedly targeted oil giant Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s most valuable company, and deleted the contents of 30,000 computers. The same virus later hit Qatar-based liquid petroleum gas firm RasGas.\n\nAnd in February of last year, Iranian hackers were blamed for taking down the computer system of gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson\u2019s casino empire, wiping all data from hard drives shutting down email.\n\nAdelson was likely targeted because of his hawkish stance on the Middle East. Adelson, who is Jewish, contributes heavily to Republican causes and owns three news outlets in Israel.\n\nThen late last year, a report revealed that Iran had infiltrated the critical infrastructure networks in over a dozen countries, possibly setting up for future cyberattacks on targets such as energy companies, defense contractors and military installations.\n\nBut around the culmination of the nuclear talks this summer, those efforts stopped altogether, according to security experts.\n\nWhen the country\u2019s cyber activity resumed following the deal, the efforts were centered more on espionage.\n\nEspionage typically does not trigger the same sort of retaliation that a destructive cyberattack on a company or government agency might.\n\nFor example, the White House slapped North Korea with sanctions over a destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment but declined to respond to the suspected Chinese hack of the Office of Personnel Management, in part because the OPM was deemed a legitimate espionage target.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Hackers are infiltrating State Department officials' social media accounts.", "description": "Hackers are infiltrating State Department officials' social media accounts.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Hackers are infiltrating State Department officials' social media accounts.", "title": "Iran launches cyber offensive after nuclear deal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261190-iran-switches-to-cyber-espionage-after-nuclear-deal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/iranianmissle10120215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261190-iran-switches-to-cyber-espionage-after-nuclear-deal", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-24T12:04-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-24T12:04:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261190-iran-switches-to-cyber-espionage-after-nuclear-deal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Hackers are infiltrating State Department officials' social media accounts.", "card": "summary", "title": "Iran launches cyber offensive after nuclear deal"}, "dcterms.title": "Iran launches cyber offensive after nuclear deal"}, "article_summary": "In recent years, Iran has displayed an increasingly sophisticated cyber program with a series of high-profile attacks around the globe.\n\u201cIt was subtle.\u201dThe hacking represents a dramatic shift in cyber strategy for Iran, from a focus on destructive cyberattacks to digital espionage.\nAmerican officials believe the change is an attempt to counteract the diminished global influence the country may experience by curbing its nuclear program.\nIran has ramped up its cyber espionage, targeting State Department officials in the four months since the U.S. concluded a watershed nuclear agreement with Tehran, The New York Times reported.\nADVERTISEMENTThe State Department only became aware of the strategy after Facebook told the victims that state-backed hackers had infiltrated their accounts."}
