Earlier this year, researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico published a formal breakdown of the absolutely ridiculous physics behind his breathtaking 9.58-second world record sprint \u2013\u2013 a feat some hold to be one of the greatest athletic performances ever recorded. Now, the Jamaican runner is poised to break another set of records with the publication of his new autobiography, in which he reminisces about women, bolting, and the time he ate 1,000 Chicken McNuggets in 10 days.\n\nThe fast food feat reportedly took place during the 2008 Bejing Olympics, where the then 22-year-old athlete would eventually shatter the competition by breaking his own world record. When Bolt discovered that he was weirded out by Chinese food, he decided to keep it simple and base his Olympic diet on America\u2019s favorite food: the Chicken McNugget. As with most things in Bolt\u2019s life, the situation soon took a turn for the extreme.\n\n\u201cAt first I ate a box of 20 for lunch, then another for dinner. The next day I had two boxes for breakfast, one for lunch and then another couple in the evening. I even grabbed some fries and an apple pie to go with it,\u201d he writes in his biography, Faster Than Lightning. \u201cMan, I should have gotten a gold medal for all that chowing down.\u201d\n\nAccording to The New York Post, the 200-lbs athlete estimates that over the 10 days he spent in the Chinese capital, he averaged 100 nuggets per day \u2013\u2013 1,000 pieces in total. That means that Bolt scarfed about 59,000 calories, 3,000 grams of protein, and 4,000 grams of fat during the tournament. Each day, he consumed 2220 mg of sodium, or about five times the daily recommended intake.\n\nWhy Eating 1,000 Chicken McNuggets Is Not A Good Idea\n\nBolt\u2019s chicken McNugget stunt recalls the Olympic diet of Michael Phelps, whose 12,000-calorie-a-day meal plan made headlines a few years ago. Like Bolt, Phelps has no truck with lettuce-wrapped tofu dogs or steamed greens, and relies primarily on one-pound bowls of pasta and entire pizzas to get him through the day. A typical Phelps breakfast, for example, consists of three fried-egg sandwiches loaded with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, fried onions and mayonnaise; two cups of coffee; one five-egg omelet; one bowl of grits; three slices of French toast topped with powdered sugar; and three chocolate-chip pancakes for good measure.\n\nWhy, then, are so many people freaking out about exceeding their daily calorie intake? If two Olympic athletes can subsist entirely on foods that 99 percent of all diets ban, why can\u2019t everyone else do it? Why do we even have diets? According to Mark Klion, a sport medicine physician and orthopedic surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, extreme eating ultimately comes down to basic math. Once you take into account Phelps\u2019 equally extreme training regimen, you will find that the vertiginous calorie-count is rapidly offset by the pull-ups, deadlifts, squats, and 1,600 Olympic pool lengths he records every week.\n\n\u201cI think for him, because of his caloric demands, he can probably eat whatever he wants to,\u201d Klion said, speaking to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got to eat that much, it better be enjoyable, or you won\u2019t be able to keep up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "usain bolt chicken mcnuggets, michael phelps diet, usain bolt diet, michael phelps training regimen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "World-record holder and gold-medal winning Olympian Usain Bolt reportedly ate 1,000 Chicken McNuggets during the 2008 Olympics.
