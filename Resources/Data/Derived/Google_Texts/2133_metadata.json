On this 25th annual World AIDS Day, health officials urge testing and education to stop new cases from developing.\n\n17,000 people in Ohio are known to be HIV positive, but that number doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. It\u2019s estimated that 1 in 5 people with HIV don\u2019t even know they\u2019re infected, so the problem is much worse.\n\nThat would raise Ohio's HIV infection rate to more than 20,000. Bill Hardy with AIDS Resource Center Ohio says \u201c66% of all new infections continue to be among young, gay, and bisexual males, and even more young, gay, bisexual males of color.\"\n\nMedical professionals are still pinning their hopes on developing an HIV prevention drug, if not an outright cure, but Hardy says science has come a long way in managing the disease.\n\n\"With the treatment we have now,\u201d he says, \u201cthere's a very good chance that HIV positive Americans will have a near normal life expectancy, and if we get them into care and get the virus under control, the chance or likelihood of transmitting the virus is almost zero, it's reduced by up to 96%.\"\n\nBut getting that treatment has not been easy for patients. A Kaiser Family Foundation study finds that 30% of HIV infected people are uninsured. Hardy says he hopes the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion will fill the gap in services. Meanwhile, he says awareness is key; get tested.\n\nARC Ohio provides more than 4,000 free HIV tests every year.\n\nHIV Testing Sites - Locations & Hours (Compiled by Public Health Dayton and Montgomery County.\n\nAIDS Resource Center Ohio\n\n15 W.
