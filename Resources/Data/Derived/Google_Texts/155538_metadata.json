Diafra Sakho scored on a header for the Hammers in the 37th.\n\nRooney was ejected by referee Lee Mason in the 59th minute for kicking Stewart Downing high on the leg, which would result in a three-game suspension if the ejection is deemed to be violent conduct by the English Football Association. That would cause the United captain to miss games against Everton, West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea.\n\n\u201cI could imagine why he did it, but I think you have to do it more friendly,\u201d United manager Louis van Gaal said.\n\nRooney had not been ejected from a Premier League match since receiving two yellow cards against Fulham on March 21, 2009.\n\nUnited (2-2-2) won for the second time in seven matches overall under Van Gaal.There were the two sides of Wayne Rooney, scoring before being sent off for a reckless challenge as Manchester United held on to beat West Ham 2-1.\n\nFirst-place Chelsea (5-0-1) defeated Aston Villa and American goalkeeper Brad Guzan 3-0, with Diego Costa heading in his eighth goal in six league games for his new club between goals by Oscar and Willian.\n\nFrank Lampard made it four goals in three games for third-place Manchester City (3-1-2) to complete a 4-2 win at Hull after the defending champions wasted a 2-0 lead.\n\nIn the day\u2019s derbies, Arsenal and Tottenham tied 1-1, as did Liverpool and Everton. Nacer Chadli scored in the 56th minute for visiting Spurs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain six minutes later for the Gunners. At Anfield, Everton\u2019s Phil Jagielka scored on a half-volley from outside the penalty area in second-half stoppage time after Steven Gerrard put the Reds ahead on a 65th-minute free kick that went in off a hand of diving American goalkeeper Tim Howard.\n\nSouthampton (4-1-1) beat Queens Park Rangers 2-1 on second-half goals by Ryan Bertrand and Graziano Pelle to remain three points behind Chelsea. Sunderland remains winless after drawing 0-0 with Swansea, while Crystal Palace beat Leicester 2-0.\n\n___\n\nSPAIN\n\nNeymar scored his first Spanish league hat trick in a 6-0 rout of Granada, and Lionel Messi got two goals to raise his total for club and country to 40 \u2014 359 for Barcelona and 42 for Argentina.
