Some Santa-tracking callers to NORAD Wednesday got a surprise when Michelle Obama picked up on the other end to let them know when St. Nick would be coming down their chimneys.

It is the fifth consecutive year that the First Lady took calls during her family’s vacation in Hawaii. She answered children’s questions about Santa’s exact location using the global Santa Tracker located at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.

The NORAD Tracks Santa program began in 1955 after a phone call was made to the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center in Colorado Springs.

The call was from a local youngster who dialed a misprinted telephone number in a local newspaper advertisement. The commander on duty who answered the phone that night gave the child the information requested – the whereabouts of Santa. This began the tradition of tracking Santa, a tradition that was carried on by NORAD when it was formed in 1958.

The NORAD Tracks Santa program has grown immensely since first presented on the Internet in 1997. The website, www.noradsanta.org, receives millions of unique visitors from hundreds of countries and territories around the world. In addition, a live Operations Center is occupied for 23 hours with more than 1,200 volunteers each year who receive hundreds of thousands of phone calls and emails from families around the world.
