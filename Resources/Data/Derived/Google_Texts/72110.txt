Federal health officials have extended two more days the deadline for consumers to sign up for health insurance on the federal Affordable Care Act site until 11:59 PM Dec. 17, due to unprecedented demand."We're extending the deadline to sign up for January 1 coverage until 11:59 p.m. PST on December 17," a statement from the Department of Health and Human Services read. According to the HHS, traffic on the website rise to an “all-time high” of 185,000 simultaneous customers Monday night, and demand continued to increase Tuesday morning.

The decision by the federal health agency came as several state-run marketplaces, including Minnesota and New York, also extended their time for picking 2016 plans."Hundreds of thousands have already selected plans over the last two days and approximately 1 million consumers have left their contact information to hold their place in line," said Healthcare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan in a statement. "Our goal is to provide access to affordable coverage, and the additional 48 hours will give consumers an opportunity to come back and complete their enrollment for January 1 coverage." People who want insurance coverage that starts later in 2016 will be able to enroll any time before Jan. 31.
