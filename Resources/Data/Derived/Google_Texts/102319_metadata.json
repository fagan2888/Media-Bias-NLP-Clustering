Each bathroom takes about an hour-and-a-half to complete.\n\nThe participants think of themselves as lavatory combatants, given the club\u2019s name \u2014 Benjyo Soujer \u2014 is a combination of the Japanese word for \u2018lavatory\u2019 and the English word for \u2018soldier.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain if this transcendence-meets-public-health project will be able to tackle all of Tokyo\u2019s public bathrooms, which are believed to number in the thousands, but for Masayuki Magome, a 45-year-old architect who founded Benjyo Soujer on Facebook, that\u2019s not really the goal.\n\nMagome claims that adults enjoy the activity because it offers a spiritual cleansing that rivals the training that many Buddhist monks undergo to find inner peace. The idea is to be as hands-on as possible. Each member begins the day by mixing their own cocktail of chemical cleaners, and some prefer to work without gloves.\n\n\"We do not think of this as volunteer work,\" computer programmer and group member Satoshi Oda told the Associated Press. \"We get together and do this for our own good. Or at least, I used to. Now, I come mostly because it's a lot of fun.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "public health, tokyo, social club, urinal, toilet, benjyo soujer, japan", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A toilet cleaning club in Tokyo boasts a spiritual cleansing via the scrubbing of public urinals.", "title": "This Social Club Cleans Public Urinals For Fun And Spiritual Enlightment: Want To Join?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tokyos-toilet-cleaning-social-club-members-benjyo-soujer-clean-public-urinals-fun-255395", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/benjyo-soujer-group-550x298_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A toilet cleaning club in Tokyo boasts a spiritual cleansing via the scrubbing of public urinals.", "title": "This Social Club Cleans Public Urinals For Fun And Spiritual Enlightment: Want To Join?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tokyos-toilet-cleaning-social-club-members-benjyo-soujer-clean-public-urinals-fun-255395", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/benjyo-soujer-group-550x298_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/benjyo-soujer-group-550x298_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-04T09:57:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T09:57:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A toilet cleaning club in Tokyo boasts a spiritual cleansing via the scrubbing of public urinals."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8d0\"", "article_summary": "Cleaning public toilets marks the path to spiritual enlightenment \u2014 or at least that\u2019s the mantra of Benjyo Soujer, a new social club in Japan.\n\"We do not think of this as volunteer work,\" computer programmer and group member Satoshi Oda told the Associated Press.\nEach member begins the day by mixing their own cocktail of chemical cleaners, and some prefer to work without gloves.\nThe 35-member group gathers every Sunday morning at 6 a.m. to visit, mop, and rinse the urinals and toilets of Tokyo, including the facilities\u2019 walls and floors.\nNow, I come mostly because it's a lot of fun.\""}
