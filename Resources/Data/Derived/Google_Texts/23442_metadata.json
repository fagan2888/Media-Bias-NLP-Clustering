Bob Casey\n\nSen. Bob Casey Jr. on Wednesday lent his support to legislation that would expand preschool education across the country, long a legislative priority of President Obama, but admitted that Democrats had a long road ahead in the battle to pass the bill.\n\nThe so-called universal preschool bill, the Strong Start for America\u2019s Children Act, is a 10-year initiative to expand and improve early learning opportunities for children from birth to age five. The bill would fund preschool for 4-year old children from families earning below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe proposed legislation, Casey said, is based on the \u201cirrefutable\u201d evidence that early learning determines a child\u2019s economic future as well as job creation and the country\u2019s ability to compete in the global economy.\n\n\u201cChildren in every state need to learn at an early age, need to learn to read,\u201d said Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, who has pushed the idea since his 2007 arrival in Congress. \u201cThe circumstances of birth should not determine whether a child can read or learn.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which was authored by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), would accelerate states efforts to provide early learning and would build upon already existing initiatives. The program would be completely voluntary for states and local communities.\n\nExisting funds would be used to fund the program, Casey said.\n\n\u201cEven if that is not completely successful, I think this issue is of such great consequence, we have to find money,\u201d he said.\n\nCasey said the the question should not be \u201ccan we afford it,\u201d but rather can the country afford not to take the opportunity to invest in it\u2019s economic future.\n\nWith little to no Republican appetite at the moment for this type of mandate, Casey acknowledged that Democrats would have an uphill battle shoring up bipartisan support for the bill.\n\nCasey said that even Republicans who \u201cbelieved in the commitment to early learning\u201d may not support the bill for other reasons. Indeed, in the wake of the launching of the Affordable Care Act, which has been plagued by widespread problems, Republicans are not likely to show any tolerance for the education initiative.\n\nCasey urged his GOP colleagues to go beyond the \u201cusual Washington reaction\u201d of just talking to staff or other members of Congress on the issue, but rather engage leaders from the business sector on the merits of early childhood education.\n\n\u201cMost will tell you that if we don\u2019t have this kind of commitment to early learning, it\u2019s going to be difficult to provide a skilled workforce that the economy not just needs but demands,\u201d he said.\n\nThe proposed legislation focuses on four key goals: boosting funding for high-quality preschool programs serving low- and moderate-income families; increasing the quality of infant and toddler care offered by providers; supporting broad-scale quality improvements to child care programs; and encouraging continued support for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program.\n\nUnder the bill\u2019s provisions, states would be held accountable to provide measurable evidence that children were learning.\n\n\u201cUnless you have good results and results you can measure, I think support for an initiative like this might diminish over time if people don\u2019t see you are measuring results,\u201d Casey said.\n\nAsked if whether that measurement would be assessed via standardized testing, Casey said some measuring tools used in grade school would likely apply.\n\nIn his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama called for the creation of a new universal preschool initiative for low-income children. Education advocates have widely applauded the initiative.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@topstories','bob casey','education','politics','universal preschool'", "title": "Sen.
