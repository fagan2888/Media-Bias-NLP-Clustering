The Hill's 12:30 Report Mark Mellman: Parsing the primary processes MORE (D-Iowa), who authored the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), bid farewell to the Senate after 30 years of service.\n\nHarkin said government is about \u201cgiving hope to the hopeless.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI believe when I make it to the top, one of our government\u2019s prime responsibilities is to leave the ladder down for others to follow,\u201d Harkin said on the Senate floor Friday. \u201cThere needs to be rungs in that ladder, and that\u2019s what government is for.\n\nHarkin said no matter how hard some people tried, they still weren\u2019t able to make it up that ladder, so Congress \u201cbuilt them a ramp\u201d called the ADA.\n\nThe chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has been the leading advocate in the Senate for people with disabilities, especially since Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) passed away.\n\n\"His legacy is secure,\" ranking member Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said. \"It will be a long time until there is a greater champion for Americans with disabilities.\"\n\nThe senator used the sign language symbol for \u201cI love you\u201d to describe how he felt about the Senate. He also said he wanted to leave the Senate by teaching everyone the sign for \"America.\" Harkin\u2019s brother is deaf.\n\n\"Put your fingers together like that and move it in circles in front of your body. That's it pages, you've got it,\" Harkin said. \"This is the sign for America.\"\n\nHarkin announced his retirement nearly two years ago. Since then, he pushed the Senate to vote on an increase in the federal minimum wage, student loan reforms and the authorization of a U.N. disability treaty. Republicans blocked those efforts. He said Congress should still work on these issues, in addition to increasing employment for people with disabilities, expanding Social Security and creating a public exchange as part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
