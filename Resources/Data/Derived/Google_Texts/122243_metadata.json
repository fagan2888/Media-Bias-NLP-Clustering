Ofri admitted that she failed to report an error she made while training to be a physician. If the healthcare culture doesn't change, Ofri said, fear of repercussions for errors will continue to drive doctors to hide medical mistakes rather than report them.\n\nHospital medical errors are now the United States' third-leading cause of death, costing as many as 400,000 lives a year, far higher than the numbers in the seminal 1999 report \"To Err is Human,\" FierceHealthcare previously reported. These numbers should drive demand for \"overdue changes and increased vigilance in medical care to address the problem of harm to patients who come to a hospital seeking only to be healed,\" wrote researcher John T. James, Ph.D., of Patient Safety America.\n\nIn April, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) released a report putting the annual number of deaths from medical errors at 325,000 and asked more than 200 Golden State acute care hospitals what steps they take to reduce these errors. In July, she released an update indicating progress on this front, due to strategies that encourage transparency, such as peer review committees for individual errors and weekly \"harm reports,\" FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nFear of inviting malpractice suits is a major obstacle to changing this culture, according to the MedCityNews article. Individual states attempt to solve the problem by establishing best practices for adverse events. For example, Pennsylvania established a Patient Safety Authority, while other states passed laws to allow doctors to express condolences for adverse outcomes without an admission of guilt.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nUpdated medical errors report shows progress\n\nCA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errors\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice risk\n\nBetter handoff communication reduces medical errors\n\nNew hospital protocols make EDs more efficient, safe", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reducing medical errors means rethinking a culture that encourages doctors to conceal them, argues a doctor at Bellevue Hospital Center at New York University, according to MedCityNews.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Reducing medical errors means rethinking a culture that encourages doctors to conceal them, argues a doctor at Bellevue Hospital Center at New York University, according to MedCityNews.", "title": "Physician \"culture of perfection\" keeps medical errors high", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/physician-culture-perfection-keeps-medical-errors-high/2014-09-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Danielle Ofri,healthcare transparency,hospital culture,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,malpractice,MedCity News,medical errors,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient deaths,patient safety", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf553\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:Updated medical errors report shows progressCA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errorsHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice riskBetter handoff communication reduces medical errorsNew hospital protocols make EDs more efficient, safe\nReducing medical errors means rethinking a culture that encourages doctors to conceal them, argues a doctor at Bellevue Hospital Center at New York University, MedCityNews reports.\nIf the healthcare culture doesn't change, Ofri said, fear of repercussions for errors will continue to drive doctors to hide medical mistakes rather than report them.\nIn April, Sen.
