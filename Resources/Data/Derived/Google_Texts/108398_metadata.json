John McCain's voting record.\n\nANALYSIS: In the fundraising e-mail, Ward, R-Lake Havasu City, who is running against McCain, R-Ariz., in the 2016 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, blasts McCain\u2019s conservative record, citing his legislative history on topics from immigration to spending and Planned Parenthood. Ward's e-mail was prompted by a statement by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said McCain was a Republican he could work with during MSNBC's First in the South Democratic Candidates Forum Nov. 6.\n\nAZ Fact Check will look at each claim individually and assign different ratings for each. Both the McCain and Ward campaigns responded to our requests for comment and provided background information that was used to check the statements. Neither provided official comment on the statements or the findings.\n\n\"McCain authored the McCain-Kennedy amnesty bills for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nWard correctly points out that McCain co-authored a bill with former Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., that offered a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the bill did provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, they would have had to meet specific requirements and pay a fine, something that may not mean true amnesty to all people. However, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 had similar provisions and many refer to that as amnesty.\n\nMcCain was also part of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d congressmen that drafted a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill that featured many of the same components.\n\nTHE FINDING: Four stars: True\n\n\"McCain voted for the bailouts, and voted to raise the debt ceiling for 30 years.\"\n\nWard makes two claims here: one, that McCain voted for the bailouts during the Great Recession, and another, that he has voted to raise the debt ceiling for 30 years.\n\nThe first claim is fairly easy to check. Based on ProPublica\u2019s list of government bailouts, there were two that required congressional approval: the first auto industry bailout ($25 billion and part of a larger spending bill) and the Troubled Asset Relief Program ($700 billion), which funded the larger auto industry bailout.\n\nMcCain didn\u2019t vote on the first auto industry bailout and voted for TARP, according to GovTrack, a government-transparency website.\n\nMcCain\u2019s voting record on raising the debt ceiling is slightly more complicated. Congress must raise the country\u2019s debt ceiling to allow it to pay the debts the federal government has already accrued.\n\nUsing a list of debt ceiling votes published by the Congressional Research Service and voting records from GovTrack, AZ Fact Check determined that during his time in Congress, McCain has voted to raise the debt ceiling 15 of the 42 times it has been raised and against it 10 times. The other 17 votes McCain either did not cast a vote or there is no official record of individual votes. While he was in the Senate, he voted to raise the debt ceiling nine times and against it nine times as well.\n\nThe picture doesn\u2019t change much when removing votes in which raising the debt ceiling were part of a larger spending bill. In instances when raising the debt ceiling was stand-alone legislation, McCain voted for an increase in the debt ceiling eight times, against it seven times and didn\u2019t vote one time. When raising the debt ceiling was part of a larger spending bill, McCain voted for the bill seven times, against it three times and didn\u2019t vote once.\n\nSo while Ward got it right that McCain voted for the biggest bailout during the financial crisis, she misses the mark on the debt ceiling. McCain\u2019s voting record on the debt ceiling isn\u2019t complete, and based on official vote counts he has a fairly mixed history on the issue.\n\nTHE FINDING: Two stars: Somewhat true, somewhat false\n\n\"McCain voted to fund 'Obamacare.' \"\n\nWard mostly misses the mark on this one. McCain has voted for spending bills that have funded portions of the Affordable Care Act. However, he has a long and well-established record opposing the legislation and voted for legislation to repeal the law as recently as July. Furthermore, McCain has co-sponsored four bills to repeal the act.\n\n\u201cI will never waiver in my dedication to cutting wasteful government spending or in my opposition to Obamacare, an economic disaster that is already beginning to collapse under its own weight,\u201d McCain wrote in a 2013 op-ed for The Arizona Republic. \u201cBut shutting down the federal government was a worthless strategy from the start.\u201d\n\nTHE FINDING: One star: Mostly false\n\n\"McCain refuses to stand up for the sanctity of human life by defunding Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nThis is the most inaccurate claim that Ward makes in her fundraising e-mail. Not only has McCain voiced his support for defunding Planned Parenthood, including a vote to move a spending bill that defunded Planned Parenthood earlier this year, but he also has a long-established record of supporting pro-life positions.\n\n\"It is long past time we stop sending American tax dollars to this scandal-plagued group and start doing more to protect the health and well-being of women, mothers, and their families,\" McCain said in a statement released in July.\n\nTHE FINDING: Zero starts: False\n\n\"McCain was censured by the Arizona Republican Party for being too liberal.\"\n\nArizona and Maricopa County Republicans both voted to censure McCain in 2014.\n\nThe vote, while having no practical impact, did serve to show that a portion of the state\u2019s Republican Party doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s conservative enough.\n\n\n\nTHE FINDING: Four stars: True\n\nSources: \"Bill Summary & Status, 109th Congress (2005 - 2006), S.1033,\" Library of Congress;
