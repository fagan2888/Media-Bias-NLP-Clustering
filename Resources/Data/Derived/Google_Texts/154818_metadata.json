The reporting requirements we currently face will pale in comparison, and they're onerous and complicated enough, and we're hopeful that they'll recognize that.\u201d\n\nMs. Young said it was possible that ERIC's requests could be rendered moot by the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court's review of premium subsidies provided by the government for health care coverage purchased through federally run public insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf that ruling goes against the government, I think it definitely opens up the whole of the (Affordable Care Act) to a lot of changes,\u201d Ms. Young said.\n\nAlternately, Ms. Young said legislation introduced last month in the U.S. House of Representatives that would effectively repeal the excise tax would likely be a boon for employers but might be less viable as a solution, given the tax's financial importance to the overall health care reform law.\n\n\u201cHowever and whenever Congress chooses to act on this issue \u2014 and we clearly hope that they do \u2014 there are a number of important considerations,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the biggest ones is the question of how you would pay for a repeal of the tax.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Employer advocates and benefits consultants this week asked the Internal Revenue Service to delay implementation of the federal health care reform law's so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high cost health care plans, due to take effect in 2018.On Monday, New York-based benefits consultant...", "title": "Employer, benefits groups lobby IRS for changes to Cadillac tax - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150520/NEWS03/150529982", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20150520/NEWS03/150529982/AR/0/cadillac-tax.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Employer advocates and benefits consultants this week asked the Internal Revenue Service to delay implementation of the federal health care reform law's so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high cost health care plans, due to take effect in 2018.On Monday, New York-based benefits consultant...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Employer, benefits groups lobby IRS for changes to Cadillac tax - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "Employer advocates and benefits consultants this week asked the Internal Revenue Service to delay implementation of the federal health care reform law's so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high cost health care plans, due to take effect in 2018.\nThird-party claims administrators will pay the excise tax for self-funded employers, while health insurers will pay the tax for fully insured employers, with both expected to seek reimbursement from employers.\nThe group also asked the IRS for a \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision in the forthcoming rules for determining the actuarial cost of their health plans.\nMercer's letter to the IRS closely mirrored public comments submitted to the agency on Friday by the ERISA Industry Committee, a Washington-based employer benefits lobbying group.\n\u201cOne of the biggest ones is the question of how you would pay for a repeal of the tax.\u201d"}
