The primary sources of the increased expenses are the F-35, the Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) and the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker.\n\nRelated: The Navy Hunts for Its Next-Generation Nuclear Submarine\n\nBy comparison, the Army\u2019s top acquisition programs will rise a more modest 28 percent between fiscal 2015 and 2022.\n\nThe U.S. has spent nearly $400 billion to develop the F-35, making it the country\u2019s most expensive weapons program. The Air Force wants to purchase 100 Long Range-Strike Bombers, which are expected to cost somewhere around $560 million per plane, and the program\u2019s total price tag could exceed $100 billion over the next few decades. The cost of the tanker program is expected to come it at around $49 billion.\n\nAdding to the pressure is the fact that the Air Force \"is not only funding these three programs simultaneously but also funding the other major aircraft acquisitions planned for the same period,\" like starting production of a new combat helicopter, replacing ground surveillance aircraft and the VC-25, the military version of the 747 (a.k.a Air Force One), the new report states.\n\nThe study suggest the next administration could chip away at the enormous tab by either increasing the defense budget, which is expected to exceed $580 billion in fiscal 2017, cut military force structure like combat brigades and air wings, or eliminate or delay large acquisition programs.\n\nEven then, it would take several of the proposed cost-savings measures, like cutting the Pentagon\u2019s $10 to $15 billion in science and technology budget by a third to recoup $4 billion annually, to level out the scales.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Decides How Many Budget-Busting Bombers It Wants\n\n\"None of these choices are easy, and the future remains as uncertain as ever; but making hard choices among weapon systems is the essence of peacetime defense strategy,\" the report\u2019s authors write.\n\nThat warning is likely to be drowned about by the din of the presidential campaign, where most of the candidates on both sides have called for beefing up the military after years of budget cuts due to sequestration.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The push by the U.S. Air Force to modernize its equipment, while still pursuing big-ticket items like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and its next-generation bomber, are setting up the Defense Department for a budgetary flood of costly bills, according to a new think-tank study.", "title": "How the Air Force\u2019s New Planes Could Bankrupt the Pentagon", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/27/How-Air-Force-s-New-Planes-Could-Bankrupt-Pentagon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/27/How-Air-Force-s-New-Planes-Could-Bankrupt-Pentagon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The push by the U.S. Air Force to modernize its equipment, while still pursuing big-ticket items like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and its next-generation bomber, are setting up the Defense Department for a budgetary flood of costly bills, according to a new think-tank study.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, funding for major Air Force acquisition programs is \u201cprojected to grow by 73 percent in real terms from FY 2015 to its projected peak in FY 2023,\" according to CSIS.\nRelated: The Navy Hunts for Its Next-Generation Nuclear SubmarineBy comparison, the Army\u2019s top acquisition programs will rise a more modest 28 percent between fiscal 2015 and 2022.\nThe U.S. has spent nearly $400 billion to develop the F-35, making it the country\u2019s most expensive weapons program.\nThe primary sources of the increased expenses are the F-35, the Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) and the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker.\nThe Air Force wants to purchase 100 Long Range-Strike Bombers, which are expected to cost somewhere around $560 million per plane, and the program\u2019s total price tag could exceed $100 billion over the next few decades."}
