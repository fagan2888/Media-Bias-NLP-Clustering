Once a system is in place, the focus should turn to optimization.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what has happened at 80 Emory Healthcare outpatient sites this year, where the Atlanta-based academic health system built or redesigned 37 specialty workflows in order to improve its Cerner EHR installation. \u201cWe knew that we needed to enable providers to leverage health IT as a way to better take care of patients,\u201d said CMIO Dr. Julie Hollberg.\n\nThe results have been impressive. Emory reported cutting the number of clicks physicians had to go through in the EHR by a third.\n\nIn redesigning and optimizing EHR workflow, Emory looked at four aspects of the system: chart review; documentation; diagnosis and medication reconciliation; and orders and billing. \u201cWe really looked at the workflow more holistically,\u201d Hollberg said. Among four of the most EHR-savvy physicians that Emory and Cerner enlisted to test old and new workflows, they averaged 36 fewer clicks while going through the four phases of EHR usage after the workflow changes, Cerner reported.\n\nThe billing part was rather key, since Emory tied the workflow project into preparation for ICD-10 coding, which became mandatory nationwide on Oct. 1. The health system redesigned workflows as it moved to electronic billing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really going to be feasible to have all the [ICD-10] codes on paper,\u201d Hollberg said.\n\n\u201cICD-10 was a hook to engage physicians,\u201d Hollberg continued. \u201cICD-10 was a heavy motivation.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the only factor. Leadership, including Hollberg, tried to deliver a consistent message that the project would make clinicians more efficient and enable them to provide better care.\n\nPrior to the project, there was a \u201cgeneric\u201d login screen, according to Hollberg. Now, the login screen is specialty-specific, and individual users can customize the order of various elements of the display, she said.\n\nCerner gave Hollberg data on how long it took each provider to go though the charting process. The vendor then offered classes for the medical staff on how to use the redesigned EHR implementation.\n\nYes, the changes slowed them down initially, but that faded in a hurry. \u201cThere was a spike the first week\u201d in time needed to chart each case, Hollberg reported. \u201cAs they got used to it, that time dropped significantly.\u201d\n\nAmong the metrics Cerner measured for Emory was \u201cpajama time\u201d: time physicians spent working in the EHR outside of the hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday-Friday. After eight weeks, that pajama time fell by 36 percent, Hollberg said. \u201cIt was one of our ways to increase physician satisfaction.\u201d\n\nFor charting, Emory adopted a Cerner tool called Dynamic Documentation that works with Nuance Communications\u2018 Dragon Medical Edition speech recognition. \u201cOne of our goals was to make it easier to get back to telling the patient story,\u201d Hollberg said.\n\nEight weeks into the effort, 71 percent of physicians at Emory clinics had moved to the new documentation system, computerized order entry increased by 74 percent and the need for transcription fell by 29 percent, according to Cerner.\n\nAnd since an EHR implementation never truly ends, the work continues. \u201cThis is phase one,\u201d Hollberg said. \u201cWe are by no means done.\u201d Future plans include improving patient handoffs and expanding electronic billing on the inpatient side, she said.\n\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons", "article_metadata": {"description": "The results of Emory's workflow redesign have been impressive.
