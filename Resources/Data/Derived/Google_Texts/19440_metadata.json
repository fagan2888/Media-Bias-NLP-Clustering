In it, Putin proposed \"urgent measures for the cessation of mutual shelling, and also the rapid withdrawal by the sides in the conflict of means of destruction with a calibre higher than 100 mm\".\n\nA Poroshenko spokesman said the Ukrainian president would not comment on the letter this evening.\n\nOTHER VIOLENCE\n\nElsewhere in the region, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said two brothers aged 7 and 16 had been killed and their 8-year-old sister injured when a shell struck a house in the government-controlled town of Vuhlehirsk, 60 km (40 miles) from Donetsk.\n\nSpokesman Vyacheslav Abroskin said the shelling had come from the direction of Yenakiieve, controlled by the rebels.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko addressed several thousand people in Kiev late Sunday at a peace march in memory of those killed on the passenger bus.\n\n\"We will not give away one scrap of Ukrainian land. We will get back the Donbass ... and show that a very important aspect of our victory is our unity,\" he said.\n\nRebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko blamed the shelling around Donetsk on the Ukrainian army. \"We're talking about Kiev trying to unleash war again,\" Interfax quoted him as saying.\n\nA ceasefire agreed in Minsk in early September has been regularly violated since the start by both sides, and fighting has flared up again since plans for peace talks last week were abandoned.\n\nDONETSK FIGHTING\n\nIn Donetsk, a coal-and-steel city with a pre-war population of almost a million, residents reported a sharp upturn in fighting.\n\n\"It was impossible to sleep - explosions, the walls were shaking. It seemed like they were firing from near the building ... The DNR (rebel) army were firing from our district,\" 53-year-old advertising executive Alla said by telephone.\n\nForty-year-old plumber Andrey Tkachenko, who lives in the southern part of Donetsk, said the shelling had become noticeably worse in the past 24 hours.\n\n\"By now we can tell from the sound what's flying. We're used to the GRAD missiles, but now something heavier is firing all night and all day,\" he said.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says more than 4,800 people have been killed in the conflict.\n\nDespite what Kiev and the West says is incontrovertible proof, Russia denies its troops are involved or that it is funnelling military equipment to the separatists.\n\nWith its runways pitted and cratered, Donetsk airport has long since ceased to function.\n\nBut its control tower and extensive outbuildings, battered by shelling and gunfire, have taken on symbolic value, with government soldiers and separatists hunting each other, often at close range, in a deadly cat-and-mouse game among the ruins.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jason Bush and Pavel Polityuk; Writing by Alessandra Prentice; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Tom Heneghan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops recaptured almost all the territory of Donetsk airpo", "title": "Ukrainian troops retake most of Donetsk airport from rebels", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/01/18/Ukraines-military-says-troops-retake-most-Donetsk-airport-rebels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ukraine-crisis-airport_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/01/18/Ukraines-military-says-troops-retake-most-Donetsk-airport-rebels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ukraine-crisis-airport_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops recaptured almost all the territory of Donetsk airpo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe428b\"", "article_summary": "With its runways pitted and cratered, Donetsk airport has long since ceased to function.\nDONETSK FIGHTINGIn Donetsk, a coal-and-steel city with a pre-war population of almost a million, residents reported a sharp upturn in fighting.\nKIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops recaptured almost all the territory of Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine they had lost to separatists in recent weeks, as thousands gathered in Kiev for a state-sponsored peace march on Sunday.\nHe later said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had rejected a peace plan contained in a letter Russian President Vladimir Putin sent him on Thursday.\nA Poroshenko spokesman said the Ukrainian president would not comment on the letter this evening."}
