Officials emphasized they didn\u2019t know what set off the attack and weren\u2019t ready to call it terrorism \u2022 The couple\u2019s extensive arsenal, their recent Middle East travel and evidence that one of them had been in touch with people with Islamist extremist views, both in the U.S. and abroad, all contributed to the decision to refocus the investigation (could be potential terrorists, he got ticked at something at work and lashed out \u2013 so a combo sort of thing \u2013 we don\u2019t know yet \u2013 read on) \u2022 The suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, fired as many as 150 bullets inside the Inland Regional Center at a holiday party and then at a shootout with the police that left the couple dead, officials said. Fourteen people died and 21 were wounded at the party \u2022 With the FBI examining Farook\u2019s electronic devices, analysts and agents have found evidence that at least a day before the attack, he began deleting data leading investigators to believe that he was planning the attack (so that goes against spontaneous) &&& \u2022 Farook went to the holiday luncheon for employees of the county health dept, where he worked, left early \u2013 agitated, according to witnesses \u2013 and returned a short time later with his wife, both in tactical gear and with an arsenal to mow down his co-workers. But Chief Jarrod Burguan of San Bernardino PD said, \u201cThere appears to be a degree of planning that goes into this.\u201d \u2022 The suspects were armed with two .223-caliber assault rifles and two 9-mm semiautomatic pistols \u2013 all obtained legally \u2013 and they left behind at the center an explosive that didn\u2019t detonate, made of three pipe bombs, Burguan said \u2022 In an SUV, the couple had 1,400 rounds for the rifles and 200 for the handguns with them at the time of the shootout. At the small townhouse where they apparently lived in nearby Redlands, officers found more than 2,500 rounds for the rifles, more than 2,000 for the pistols, several hundred for a .22 rifle and 12 pipe bombs. Plus supplies for making more bombs \u2022 \u201cClearly they were equipped and could have done another attack,\u201d Burguan said. \u201cWe intercepted them before that happened, obviously.\u201d Looking for possible clues, law enforcement officials raided the apt of Syed Raheel Farook, the dead suspect\u2019s brother. The FBI also combed the background of the suspects &&& \u2022 The FBI uncovered evidence that Farook communicated with extremists domestically and abroad, a few years ago, but not recently, according to congressional officials who were briefed \u2022 They said he had contacts with five people whom the FBI investigated for possible terrorist activities \u2013 including one associated with the Shabab, the Islamist movement in Somallia, and another associated with the Nusra Front, the wing of al Qaeda in Syria. In all five cases, the investigations were closed and no charges were filed \u2022 Authorities collected several electronic devices from the home, including a computer, cellphones, a music player and thumb drives. Law enforcement officials said they had begun reviewing Farook\u2019s emails, while other items were being sent to the FBI\u2019s investigative labs in Quantico. Two phones and at least one other devices were severely damaged \u2013 to hinder recovery? \u2022 A cellphone Malik had with her on Wed had almost nothing on it \u2013 no social media or encrypted apps \u2013 prompting investigators to suspect that it might have been a \u201cburner phone,\u201d meant to be used and discarded &&& \u2022 Asked if the design of the explosive devices had come from Inspire, an online magazine published by an arm of al Qaeda, David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s LA office, said investigators were looking into that possibility \u2022 Farook was a U.S. citizen, born in Illinois to Pakistani immigrant parents. Family members said he had been an observant Sunni Muslim. He had gone to Saudi Arabia for brief trips several times, including in 2013 for the annual hajj to Mecca, that all Muslims are expected to complete at least once, if they are able to, federal officials said \u2022 Malik entered the U.S. on a K-1 fiance visa and a Pakistani passport. Farook traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet his wife and returned with her. The couple applied in Sept 2014 for a resident green card for Malik, which requires passing criminal and national security background checks using FBI and Homeland Security databases \u2013 granted conditional green card in July 2015\n\n\u2022 Mass shootings since Sandy Hook in one map \u2013 there have been at least 1,044 mass shootings, with shooters killing at least 1,327 people and wounding at least 3,784 more (Vox)\n\nVictims: Some Profiles (AP, me)\n\n\u2022 Nicholas Thalasinos, 52: He identified as a Messianic Jew and passionately defended Israel, actively debating about religion in online forums and in person, friends said. Two weeks ago, he had a heated on-the-job discussion about the nature of Islam with Syed Rizwan Farook. Unknown whether that factored into the shooting (can bet it\u2019s being looked into as a trigger)\n\n\u2022 Bennetta Betbadal, 46: Born in Iran and came to the U.S. at age 18 to escape the persecution of Christians after the Iranian revolution, according to a family statement. Married to police officer husband in 1997, three children, 10, 12 and 15 Health inspector with San Bernardino County. Recently decorated the family\u2019s Christmas tree\n\n\u2022 Sierra Clayborn, 27: Friends say she stood out as someone who always had an encouraging word. She inspected restaurants for the county. \u201cShe was one of the nicest health inspectors we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Matthew Peairs, a manager at Red Baron Pizza, said. \u201cShe talked to us like normal people, not just doing her job.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Robert Adams, 40: The Yucaipa resident was known as a loving father and husband who married his high school sweetheart, friends said\n\n\u2022 Damien Meins, 58: He was passionate about serving his community, a message he took from the priests at his Catholic high school in Riverside. \u201cFunny and smart and tall. A real quick smile, very friendly and outgoing,\u201d said Walter Hackett, who met Meins 40 years ago in high school. \u201cService to others, helping others.\u201d\n\nMass Shootings: Guns vs Prayers (Politico, Hill , P olitic o, Hill, TRNS , me)\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe\u2019ve had far too many moments of silence on the floor of the House,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) said in a presser in the Capitol Thursday . \u201d And while it is right to respectfully acknowledge the losses, we can no longer remain silent. What gives us the right to hold moments of silence when we do nothing to act upon the cause of the grief?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Pelosi singled out three reforms: an expansion of mandatory background checks preceding gun sales; Congress to adopt legislation barring those on the terrorism watch list from buying or owning guns; she urged Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis) to create a special committee charged with studying gun violence and proposing policies for reining it in (soo not going to happen)\n\n\u2022 Republicans called for \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d following the shooting. But: \u201cYour \u2018thoughts\u2019 should be about steps to take to stop this carnage. Your \u2018prayers\u2019 should be for forgiveness if you do nothing \u2013 again,\u201d tweeted Sen Chris Murphy (D-Conn) Wed. Murphy\u2019s state is approaching the three-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre and he\u2019s livid\n\n\u2022 The Senate voted (predictably, pathetically) Thursday 50-47 against expanding background checks for more gun purchases. The measure would require checks for all gun purchases online and at gun shows. It was co-authored by Sen Joe Manchin (R-WVa) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa). Also failed: denying people on the terrorism watch list the ability to buy guns (stunnnning)\n\n\u2022 Earlier, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) railed on the Senate floor: \u201cThe NRA once called mandatory background checks \u2018reasonable.\u2019 But now, its leadership and organization have transformed into a quasi militant wing of the Republican party.\u201d Meanwhile, President Obama is weighing executive action on gun control \u2022 Interactive: How they got their guns \u2013 the guns in 15 recent mass shootings, including San Bernardino, were bought legally (NYT)\n\n\u2022 Ryan called for a moment of silence Wed evening as he kicked off a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. On CBS Thursday morning, Ryan said, \u201cWhat we have seen is the theme of mental illness, and we need to fix our mental illness laws, our policies. They\u2019re outdated, and that is something that we are working on right now.\u201d (Farook doesn\u2019t sound ill \u2013 sounds quite sane)\n\n\u2022 As GOP 2016ers and conservative lawmakers tweeted their prayers after the shooting, Igor Volsky, a contributing editor at Think Progress, started tweeting back how much each had received in campaign contributions from the NRA, which opposes tighter gun laws. A Twitterstorn ensued\n\n\u2022 The New York Daily News\u2019s front page blared: \u201cGod Isn\u2019t Fixing This\u201d coupled with images of tweets about prayers from GOP 2016ers Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham and Ryan. Paul tweeted that the cover was \u201cdeplorable.\u201d (no, it was blunt. God isn\u2019t fixing it. Human beings have to fix it)\n\n\u2022 Obama opened his remarks on the shooting Thursday by offering \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d for those affected by the shooting. Then: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be important for all of us \u2013 including our legislatures \u2013 to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide that they want to do somebody harm, we\u2019re making it a little harder for them to do it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 NRA spox Jennifer Baker said Thursday the group hadn\u2019t issued any statement about the San Bernardino shootings. (laying low \u2013 for now) Asked if there was any gun control legislation currently proposed in Congress that the NRA could support, Baker offered no response (there\u2019s no gun control legislation the NRA supports \u2013 so-called \u201cmental health\u201d \u2013 maybe)\n\n\u2022 Watch House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis) drop his mic during a live interview and say, \u201caw crap\u201d (CNN, MSNBC)\n\nNovember Jobs Report: Things to Watch Today (WSJ, me)\n\n\u2022 Today\u2019s jobs report from the Labor Dept will offer the final key piece of economic data for Federal Reserve officials before they decide whether to raise short-term interest rates this month. Economists surveyed by WSJ estimate payroll growth of 205,000 and the unemployment rate holding steady at 5%\n\n\u2022 Sustained rebound: After two months of lackluster job gains, October jobs report offered the healthiest number so far this year: 271,000 jobs, which helped boost the monthly average to 206,000. Economists don\u2019t think employers kept the pace last month, but even if payrolls disappoint, they\u2019d have to be bad to dissuade Fed officials from a rate increase\n\n\u2022 Waxing wages: Hourly compensation grew 3.4% in the third quarter forma year earlier, the second biggest increase since the third quarter of 2009. And last month\u2019s jobs report showed a 2.5% pickup in average hourly earnings compared with Oct 2014. Today\u2019s report should offer more clues of any sustained pickup\n\n\u2022 Unemployment rate: The headline unemployment rate has fallen sharply from a 10% peak during the recession to 5% in Oct. A dip this month could push the rate below 5% for the first time since before the recession. At 4.9%, the figure would also be in line with where Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to stand in the long run\n\nHidden slack: Still, many Fed officials believe the headline unemployment number may be underestimating slack in the labor market. A big reason the number fell so swiftly in recent years was that people gave up on their job searches.

Carter said that the general supported the move. \u201cHe will be a full part of implementation.\u201d (whether he likes it or not)\n\n\u2022 The Marine Corps conducted a study earlier this year that found mixed-gender teams were less effective at combat tasks than male-only units. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus dismissed the study as \u201cflawed.\u201d Mabus, who has also served as service secretary for the Marine Corps, praised Carter\u2019s decision (other studies have found opposite results from the Marine Corps study)\n\n\u2022 In the military, serving in combat positions like the infantry remains crucial to career advancement, and women have long said that by not recognizing their real service, the military has unfairly held them back. The military services have 30 days to implement the decision, per a congressional waiting period (GOP committee members might have something to say)\n\n\u2022 \u201cAs commander in chief, I know that this change, like others before it, will again make our military even stronger,\u201d President Obama said in a statement about the Pentagon\u2019s decision to open combat roles to women. (how about we open seats globally, at all tables where peace talks are being negotiated, to women? major deficit in that arena)\n\nHighway Bill: Done (AP, Hill, Hill, me)\n\n\u2022 The Senate approved 83-16 a five-year, $305 billion highway bill Thursday , sending it to President Obama with one day to spare before the expiration of the nation\u2019s road and transit spending. The bill sailed through the House earlier on a 359-64 vote. Obama is expected to sign the measure today\n\n\u2022 The 1,300-page bill \u201cproves to the American people that we can get big things done,\u201d said Rep Bill Shuster (R-Pa), chair of the House Transportation Committee. The committee\u2019s senior Democrat, Rep Peter DeFazio (Ore), called the measure \u201chistoric,\u201d but cautioned that \u201cit is a starting point, not the end.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A hallmark of the bill is the creation of new programs to focus federal aid on eliminating bottlenecks and increasing the capacity of highways designated as major freight corridors. The Transportation Dept estimates the volume of freight traffic will increase 45% over the next 30 years. The bill includes a renewal of the Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter\n\n\u2022 A big shortcoming is how the bill is financed. The main source of revenue for transportation is the trust fund, which comes mostly from the 18.4 cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. That tax hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993 even though transportation spending has increased. But raising the gas tax is viewed by many lawmakers as too politically risky (grow up)\n\n\u2022 To make up the shortfall, the bill uses $70 billion in mostly budget gimmicks, including one that would move $53 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s capital account to the general treasury. It\u2019s counted as new money on paper, but is actually just a transfer of funds from one govt account to another, federal budget experts said\n\n\u2022 President Obama \u201cabsolutely\u201d retains confidence in Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy despite a new report from the House Oversight Committee claiming the agency faces a crisis over security lapses and staffing shortages, WH spox Josh Earnest said Thursday (so nothing\u2019s going to get done, basically) (Hill, me)\n\nHouse Passes Obamacare Repeal Bill ( WaP o, NYT , Re alClearPoliti cs, me)\n\n\u2022 House conservatives moved one step closer to forcing President Obama to veto a bill that would repeal large portions of the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood, but the legislation could still be defeated in the Senate (yes, let\u2019s take health insurance away from millions of people \u2013 when we\u2019ve nothing to offer them \u2013 good plan, GOP)\n\n\u2022 The House voted 240-189 to to pass a budget reconciliation bill that seeks to gut Obamacare by repealing key sections of the law, including the individual and employer mandate and the so-called \u201ccadillac\u201d tax. In addition, it would block funding for Planned Parenthood for one year and divert that spending to other women\u2019s health programs\n\n\u2022 Seven House Republicans voted against the bill after the plan ran into resistance from conservatives this week because it wouldn\u2019t fully repeal Obamacare. Reconciliation bills are considered under special rules that require only a simple majority for passage, meaning the bill can\u2019t be filibustered in the Senate\n\n\u2022 House leaders were forced to scale back the legislation in recent weeks to ensure that it conformed with parliamentary rules governing reconciliation bills. That frustrated conservatives who said they were promised a bill that fully repealed Obamacare\n\nThursday , 2016ers Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla) joined their Senate colleague Mike Lee (R-Utah) in announcing they would oppose the legislation if it comes up in the Senate because it wouldn\u2019t wipe Obamacare entirely off the books , 2016ers Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla) joined their Senate colleague Mike Lee (R-Utah) in announcing they would oppose the legislation if it comes up in the Senate because it wouldn\u2019t wipe Obamacare entirely off the books \u2022 Watch Game of Thrones season 6 tease \u2013 season 6 isn\u2019t until April, but this is intriguing \u2013 who\u2019s dead \u2013 or not\u2026..

I think he\u2019s a wonderful man \u2026 But he\u2019s totally vapid.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Carson read from a prepared text and took no questions. That, and his repeated mispronunciations of \u201cHamas\u201d as if it were the chickpea spread hummus, only hardened the perceptions of those in the hall that he doesn\u2019t fully grasp the complicated dynamics of the Middle East\n\n\u2022 Ted Cruz called President Obama \u201can apologist for radical Islamic terrorists,\u201d vowed to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and promised to \u201crip the Iran nuclear deal to shreds\u201d as he sought to win over the 700 security-minded Republicans\n\n\u2022 Marco Rubio looked like a man on a mission. He\u2019s rumored to be the favorite of RJC founder Sheldon Adelson. Rubio vowed to fight anti-Semitism, which many politically active members of the American Jewish community think is growing worldwide. He outlined a plan to fight ISIS, and he spoke with greater depth and conviction on specific issues affecting Israel\n\n\u2022 Whoa \u2013 way too young \u2013 RIP Scott Weiland: Grammy-winning front man for Stone Temple Pilots and a string of prominent rock bands, including Velvet Revolver.
