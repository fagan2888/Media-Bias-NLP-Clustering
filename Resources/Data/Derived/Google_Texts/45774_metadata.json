The national park was excluded from the 2013 contest, which drew 1,600 participants but netted only 68 pythons.\n\nPark Superintendent Pedro Ramos said in a statement Tuesday that authorities hope the expanded access prompts more people to participate in programs that would allow them to remove pythons year-round from the park and state lands.\n\nTraining events are planned to teach registered participants how to identify and capture pythons. State wildlife commissioner Ron Bergeron said officials hope the hunt increases python sightings and removals in the wetlands.\n\nScientists say thousands of pythons are to blame for the decline of native wildlife across Florida's Everglades.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Snake-hunters take note: Authorities are expanding Florida's next public hunt for invasive Burmese pythons into Everglades National Park.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/python-challenge-comes-everglades", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201301/fl-python-hunt-20130104-001.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Snake-hunters take note: Authorities are expanding Florida's next public hunt for invasive Burmese pythons into Everglades National Park.", "title": "\u2018Python Challenge' Comes To Everglades"}, "story_id": 432849680, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "\u2018Python Challenge&#039; Comes To Everglades"}, "nid": 11673, "datePublished": "2015-08-19", "keywords": "python hunt, \"Python Challelnge\", Burmese python, Everglades National Park", "wordCount": 142, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb83c\"", "article_summary": "Snake-hunters take note: Authorities are expanding Florida's next public hunt for invasive Burmese pythons into Everglades National Park.\nState wildlife commissioner Ron Bergeron said officials hope the hunt increases python sightings and removals in the wetlands.\nScientists say thousands of pythons are to blame for the decline of native wildlife across Florida's Everglades.\nThe national park was excluded from the 2013 contest, which drew 1,600 participants but netted only 68 pythons.\nThe \"Python Challenge\" will run from Jan. 16 through Feb. 14."}
