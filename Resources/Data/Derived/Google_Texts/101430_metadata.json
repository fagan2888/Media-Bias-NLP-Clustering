By that measure, over 93% of all imports into the U.S. are invoiced in dollars.\n\nAlso read: Where every Fed member stands on raising interest rates\n\nThis means that U.S. inflation is more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other countries are highly sensitive to it, Gopinath said.\n\nSo a U.S. rate hike would create important inflationary concerns for a country like Turkey where only a small fraction of their imports is denominated in lira.\n\nThe flip side is that efforts by the Fed to raise inflation via easier monetary policy receives much less support from the exchange rate than it does for other countries.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The U.S. economy is \u2018insulated\u2019 from overseas inflation because the overwhelming percentage of our trade is invoiced in dollars, according to new research presented at the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole conference.", "creator": "@grobb2000", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BQ218_99_cen_MG_20131203142141.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Greg Robb", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The U.S. economy is \u2018insulated\u2019 from overseas inflation because the overwhelming percentage of our trade is invoiced in dollars, according to new research presented at the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole conference.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-prices-largely-insulated-from-overseas-currency-shocks-jackson-hole-research-paper-2015-08-28", "author": "Greg Robb", "parsely-title": "U.S. prices largely \u2018insulated\u2019 from overseas currency shocks: Jackson Hole research paper", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-28T13:44:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The U.S. economy is \u2018insulated\u2019 from overseas inflation because the overwhelming percentage of our trade is invoiced in dollars, according to new research presented at the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole conference.", "title": "U.S. prices largely \u2018insulated\u2019 from overseas currency shocks: Jackson Hole research paper", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-prices-largely-insulated-from-overseas-currency-shocks-jackson-hole-research-paper-2015-08-28", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BQ218_99_cen_MG_20131203142141.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BQ218_99_cen_MG_20131203142141.jpg"}, "article.id": "149AD892-4D11-11E5-8CCF-4D632E5A8638", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02e2\"", "article_summary": "If true, this would ease one concern surrounding prospective Fed rate hikes.\nShe added that a good proxy for inflation sensitivity to exchange rate movements is the fraction of its imports invoiced in a foreign currency.\nGita Gopinath, an economist professor at Harvard University, presented research showing international prices, in their currency of invoicing, are not very sensitive to exchange rates for up to two years.\nAlso read: Where every Fed member stands on raising interest ratesThis means that U.S. inflation is more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other countries are highly sensitive to it, Gopinath said.\nThe flip side is that efforts by the Fed to raise inflation via easier monetary policy receives much less support from the exchange rate than it does for other countries."}
