A group dedicated to the daily care of the physically and mentally disabled is wondering who would steal from them.

Monday morning, the Oklahoma Foundation for the Disabled (OKFD) discovered thieves had stolen one of their buses from their facility in the 8400 block of N. Walker.

“We got routes we can’t run today,” said Guy Francis, who is in charge of transportation for the foundation, which cares for about 85 people each day.

Surveillance cameras show two men hopping the a barbwire fence at 6:45 a.m. Sunday to get into the parking lot where the passenger vans are located.

The video also shows the thieves driving through the gate of the parking lot, but not before swiping two other OKFD vehicles on the way out.

“It’s just disturbing,” Francis said.

Workers found a sweatshirt belonging to the thieves. They believe the men used it to help get over the fence.

The men in the video are seen with hooded sweatshirts, so getting a suspect description could be challenging.

Workers don’t think this was in inside job. The don’t believe any current or former employee would want to cause this kind of pain for the foundation.

“All the way around, it hurt,” Francis said.

Anyone with information about the theft is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 235-7300.
