One person was shot, according to the Huffington Post\u2019s Ryan J. Reilly, who has been reporting and tweeting from Ferguson. It was also reported that seven people were arrested, and that several canisters of tear gas were deployed against protesters.\n\nThe protests are in response to the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer on Saturday, Aug. 9. Details of the shooting have yet to be released, including how many times Brown was shot.\n\nThe shape of the protests has changed each night: variations of peaceful protesting, looting, heavy militarized police response, violence and calm. After Friday night\u2019s looting, Gov. Jay Nixon imposed an emergency curfew from midnight to 5:00 a.m.\n\nAccording to reports, community leaders and rain helped enforce the curfew, and the crowds mostly dispersed. However, there was a \u201chardcore\u201d contingent as Alderman Antonio French described them to the Los Angeles Times, who remained in the streets.\n\nThere were reports of gunfire, and according to Capt. Ronald Johnson, a Ferguson native and member of the state\u2019s highway patrol put in charge of the police efforts by Gov. Nixon, a police car was shot at.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,\u201d Johnson told reporters on the scene. However, he said they were successful in protecting previously looted businesses.\n\n\u201cIt was effective,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe sustained the health of those businesses, and we also sustained the safety of the protesters that were out [and] around tonight.\u201d\n\nCapt. Johnson also confirmed that tear gas was deployed, but insisted it was in order to reach the unidentified male who had been shot. The man was driven to the hospital in a civilian car, and Capt. Johnson stated he was in critical condition and \u201cmay lose their life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just over a week after Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer, protesters still don't have answers", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Just over a week after Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer, protesters still don't have answers", "title": "Violence erupts in Ferguson on first night of state-imposed curfew: One shot, seven arrested", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/in_ferguson_violence_erupts_after_state_imposed_curfew_one_shot_seven_arrested/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/police-shooting-missouri.jpeg77-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just over a week after Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer, protesters still don't have answers", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/police-shooting-missouri.jpeg77-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Violence erupts in Ferguson on first night of state-imposed curfew: One shot, seven arrested", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Violence erupts in Ferguson on first night of state-imposed curfew: One shot, seven arrested", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, don't shoot, Ferguson, Ferguson police shooting, hands up, michael brown, protesters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8d3\"", "article_summary": "Topics: don't shoot, Ferguson, Ferguson police shooting, hands up, michael brown, protesters, News, Politics NewsTensions in Ferguson, Missouri, gave way to scattered violence early Sunday morning, on the first night of a state-imposed midnight to 5:00 a.m. curfew.\nDetails of the shooting have yet to be released, including how many times Brown was shot.\nIt was also reported that seven people were arrested, and that several canisters of tear gas were deployed against protesters.\nOne person was shot, according to the Huffington Post\u2019s Ryan J.
