Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott has never even tried to hide his disdain of LGBT people or women. And he just proved it again.

Greg Abbott has made his positions very clear. He is anti-LGBT, anti-women, anti-voting rights, anti-immigration, anti-Obamacare, and anti-separation of church and state. Last year he was elected to his first gubernatorial term with nearly 60 percent of the vote from the citizens of Texas.

Today, Gov. Abbott fired off a multi-purpose tweet, attacking Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) and Hillary Clinton. HERO will be voted on by Houston residents tomorrow, Election Day, and is virulently opposed by the religious right, despite the fact that it actually reinforces religious protections.

HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms. — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) November 2, 2015

"Hillary Clinton values"? "No men in women's bathrooms"? How much ugly rhetoric can Abbott squeeze into 140 characters? Apparently, a lot.

Of course, Abbott is dead wrong about "men in women's bathrooms" anyway. It's a lie that conservatives love to use to scare people into voting against nondiscrimination ordinances. Houston is the fourth largest city in the U.S. and the largest without a nondiscrimination law.

(ThinkProgress has an excellent explanation of what HERO really does – and does not do.)

UPDATE:

Abbott also posted this to Facebook on Friday:
