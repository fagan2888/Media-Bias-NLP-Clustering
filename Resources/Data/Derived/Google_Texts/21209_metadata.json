Last month, it attacked a police post, killing two people. The rebels kidnapped a French family in February 2013.\n\nWest African leaders meet in Paris on Saturday to try to improve cooperation in their fight against Boko Haram.\n\nOutrage over the kidnapping has prompted Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, criticized at home for his government's slow response, to accept U.S., British and French intelligence help in the hunt for the girls.\n\n(Reporting by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Bate Felix;
