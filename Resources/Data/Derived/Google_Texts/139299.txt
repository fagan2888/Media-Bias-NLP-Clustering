Valerie Jewett is leaving PhRMA to join the public affairs firm Washington2Advocates, according to a farewell email sent on Monday.

Jewett had been with the drug lobby for more than seven years, most recently serving as director of federal affairs. She departs on Sept. 27 and begins her new gig on Oct. 1, her note says.



“I’ve truly appreciated all the opportunities PhRMA has given me and being able to know and work with you all,” she wrote in the email.



“As some of you already know, after a really wonderful 7 and a half year run here at PhRMA, I’ve been offered a really exciting new opportunity,” Jewett said. “At the end of the month I will be leaving here to help lead the federal shop at Washington2Advocates.”



PhRMA runs a $17.9 million lobbying operation, complete with more than 40 lobby firms on retainer — including Washington2Advocates.



Washington2Advocates had just more than $2.36 million in revenue last year, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
