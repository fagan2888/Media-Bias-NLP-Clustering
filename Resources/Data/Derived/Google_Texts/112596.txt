Republican presidential candidates promise to continue their fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act

The reactions to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Obamacare subsidies were predictable across political party lines.

While Democrats and liberals praised Thursday’s 6-3 decision, Republicans flew off the handle over the SCOTUS ruling in favor of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act for the second time.

Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to celebrate health care remaining “affordable and available to all,” but most of the Republican presidential contenders have chimed in to express their disappointment.

It is outrageous that the Supreme Court once again rewrote ObamaCare to save this deeply flawed law https://t.co/NBAnohFTW7 - Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) June 25, 2015

This decision turns both the rule of law and common sense on its head. #KingvBurwell - Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 25, 2015

Justice Scalia got it right! “Words no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is “established by the State.” - Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 25, 2015

Today’s Supreme Court ruling is another reminder that if we want to get rid of #Obamacare, we must elect a conservative President #RICK2016 - Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) June 25, 2015

I am disappointed in the Burwell decision, but this is not the end of the fight against ObamaCare. http://t.co/3yaEVF1TaW - Jeb Bush (@JebBush) June 25, 2015

Today’s #SCOTUScare ruling means Republicans must redouble their efforts to repeal and replace this destructive & costly law. -SKW - Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) June 25, 2015

#SCOTUS has NO authority to rescue Congress from creating bad law. #Burwell ruling is an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny. #ObamaCare - Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015

Outside of the presidential race, other conservatives were displeased.

It is my gut feeling that someone has compromising photos of Justice Roberts involving high heels, lipstick, and farm animals. #SCOTUS - J.R. Salzman (@jrsalzman) June 25, 2015

In a press conference on Thursday, President Obama called on politicians on both sides to move forward now that the law is here to stay.

“Part of what’s bizarre about this whole thing is we haven’t had a lot of conversation about the horrors of Obamacare because none of them have come to pass,” Obama added. “You’ve got 16 million people who have gotten health insurance. The overwhelming majority of them are satisfied with the health insurance.”
