This change is more about how I can be most effective at the things that I am not only best at, but that I am most passionate about. This will help me keep my focus as sharp as possible on those things.\u201d\n\nTreuer says that in addition to revitalizing his passion for working directly with students in the classroom, he also looks forward to participating in the university\u2019s increasing efforts to reach beyond campus and engage students in the broader northern Minnesota region.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of change here, and through some of the grants we\u2019ve had and some of the partnerships we\u2019ve forged, the Ojibwe program is going to be growing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, Red Lake has just launched an Ojibwe immersion program and they have need for teachers with language skills and teaching credentials. The question becomes, how can we provide that? This is the kind of thing BSU can do to meet the needs of our greater community as a regional university.\u201d\n\nTreuer will continue to be extensively involved in the center\u2019s primary projects, including work done as part of the university\u2019s Imagine Tomorrow campaign, exploration of an Ojibwe teacher training program, and continuation of work that has begun on equity and truth-and-reconciliation efforts both at BSU and in the Bemidji community.\n\n\u201cI believe in what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d he said. \u201cI will give extra time and effort there even if it\u2019s beyond the normal expectations for faculty.\u201d\n\nAbout Dr. Anton \u201cTony\u201d Treuer\n\nAn internationally renowned expert on issues such as cultural and language preservation, Dr. Anton Treuer has written 13 books, is a regular presenter at conferences and workshops.
