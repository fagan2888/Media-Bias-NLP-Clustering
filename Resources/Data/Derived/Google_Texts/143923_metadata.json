[The segment will air at 4 p.m. on his WABC radio, 770 AM.] Her daughter, Johanna, 17, has undergone 86 surgeries since she was diagnosed at three months old with a rare genetic neurological disease that causes tumors to grow in her brain. Her parents\u2019 insurance plan has always covered her care, soaring to at least $100,000 per year in medical expenses.\n\nWith the new rules and surrounding confusion, that coverage hangs in the balance.\n\n\u201cI was in my daughter\u2019s hospital room when I was on the phone with the insurance company and they told me our plan would be terminated,\u201d Benthal said. Johanna was recovering from her latest brain surgery, a stay Benthal expects to cost around $30,000. Benthal started crying.\n\nShe and her husband have had a plan they purchase as a sole proprietorship, she being a freelance writer and he a marketer. Under one of the act\u2019s provisions, according to their provider, Oxford, they are no longer eligible for the plan.\n\nTheir only feasible option appears to be entry into the New York State Health Exchange, which Benthal\u2019s insurance agent said would cut Johanna\u2019s access to her current hospital in NYC and the other premium hospitals in the region, most of which do not participate in the plans available on the exchange. If they were to purchase another plan from Oxford for Johanna, it would be as an individual and would include a $6,000 deductible with copays. Their current plan has a $4,000 deductible without copays.\n\nThe shift also leaves the family\u2019s Medicaid assistance in the lurch, Benthal said. They had received reimbursements for their premiums, but the future of that arrangement is uncertain.\n\n\u201cAll these offices are in chaos and no one knows anything,\u201d she said of Medicaid and other agencies she\u2019s dealt with. \u201cWe had a relationship with New York State that worked. With our medically fragile child we can\u2019t afford to be without health insurance for a single day.\u201d\n\nBenthal said she is confident she will \u201cfigure something out,\u201d but says she fears the federal government will be less efficient at delivering the level of care she was used to receiving for her daughter. She feels the act lacks in practicability, having more to do with control of healthcare than its improvement.\n\nAnother concern is the potential loss of Johanna\u2019s doctor, Mt. Sinai pediatrician Roberta Nataloni, who has been her primary care physician since she was born.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s breaking my heart that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to care for Johanna next year,\u201d Nataloni said in an interview today.\n\nShe said she fears for all her special-needs patients, as she is seeing more and more plan cancellations leave the most vulnerable with limited and expensive options.\n\n\u201cThe most needy of our patients shouldn\u2019t have this happening to them,\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cI wish I could help Johanna but I can\u2019t do anything. That\u2019s the other thing. With Medicaid or other insurance you can fight back, talk to the insurance company\u2019s medical director to advocate for your patient\u201d Nataloni said, adding there is no similar recourse within the new system.\n\nShe said she fears her patient population will decrease significantly next year if patients aren\u2019t able to continue the coverage they\u2019ve been using, possibly threatening her office\u2019s viability.\n\nBenthal said she reached out to the conservative talk show host\u2019s producers and they were interested in her story. Both she and Nataloni will be interviewed by Hannity.\n\nBenthal said she isn\u2019t interested in slamming the Obama administration, but wants to bring attention to the crack that Johanna might fall through due to the legislation.\n\n\u201cThey could at least have things more together,\u201d she said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Eileen Benthal writes a column for RiverheadLOCAL, \u201cLife on Purpose,\u201d which is published every Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jamesport family's health insurance will no longer be available after implementation of Affordable Care Act and they're not sure what's going to happen after Jan. 1.", "wot-verification": "15191109ecd7f772357e", "og": {"site_name": "RiverheadLOCAL", "description": "Jamesport family's health insurance will no longer be available after implementation of Affordable Care Act and they're not sure what's going to happen after Jan. 1.", "title": "Cancellation of health insurance leaves local family with special-needs child 'in the lurch' | RiverheadLOCAL", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 497, "identifier": "http://riverheadlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013_11_2013_1122_benthal_eileen_jo.png", "height": 335}, "url": "http://riverheadlocal.com/2013/11/22/jamesport-riverhead-woman-and-doctor-speak-out-on-sean-hannity-show/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://riverheadlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013_11_2013_1122_benthal_eileen_jo.png", "description": "Jamesport family's health insurance will no longer be available after implementation of Affordable Care Act and they're not sure what's going to happen after Jan. 1.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cancellation of health insurance leaves local family with special-needs child 'in the lurch' | RiverheadLOCAL"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 10155830199385492, "app_id": 105130769527571}, "google-site-verification": "M6EraiexRI8YB8fDKzJbnztQ2_4haJxd0OvUC4dVIcE", "keywords": "Sean Hannity, affordable care act, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/riverheadlocal2", "section": "Local News", "published_time": "2013-11-22T20:30:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=1220"}, "article_summary": "Her parents\u2019 insurance plan has always covered her care, soaring to at least $100,000 per year in medical expenses.\nThe troubled implementation of the Affordable Care Act is threatening one local family with the loss of coverage they\u2019ve relied upon for years.\nThe shift also leaves the family\u2019s Medicaid assistance in the lurch, Benthal said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s breaking my heart that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to care for Johanna next year,\u201d Nataloni said in an interview today.\nBenthal said she reached out to the conservative talk show host\u2019s producers and they were interested in her story."}
