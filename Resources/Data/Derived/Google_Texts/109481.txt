Vice President Joe Biden, looking more like a contender for the 2016 presidential race, was introduced as such at a Memorial Day wounded warriors event.

At the Road 2 Recovery Memorial Challenge kickoff on Monday, the announcer introduced him by saying, “At some point in the future Joe is going to run for president again,” according to CNN.

The man who introduced the vice president described the Road 2 Recovery race, featuring 200 cyclists riding 325 miles between Washington and Virginia Beach, the same way Biden described the passage of Obamacare.

“For those of you who don’t know, Joe is famous for some of his one-liners,” the speaker said. “There was a bill signing at the White House…and he said it was a big f-ing deal. And that was a quote…If I may say, sir, Ride 2 Recovery is a big f-ing deal.”

When he took the microphone, Biden said, “Piece of advice about that BFD stuff: Assume every microphone is on.”

Then he qualifed that infamous quote.

“I just want you to know, I didn’t intentionally say that,” he said. “I actually turned and I said, ‘Mr. President,’ and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips – not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips. Thank God my mother was gone, or I’d have been one dead vice president.”

To round out Memorial Day, Biden took a narcissistic cue from the boss, posting this on Twitter:
