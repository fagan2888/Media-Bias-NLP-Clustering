This was also claimed by the ultra-hardline Sunni group that controls vast swathes of territory in Iraq and in Syria.\n\nThe escalation in Islamic State bombings suggests that Iraqi government forces are being stretched thin after their recent gains against the group in the western and northern provinces.\n\nResponsibility for the bombing in Hilla, 117 kilometers (73 miles) south of Baghdad, was claimed in a posting on the website of the Amaq news agency, which supports Islamic State.\n\n\"A martyr's operation with a truck bomb hit the Babylon Ruins checkpoint at the entrance of the city of Hilla, killing and wounding dozens,\" the statement on the Amaq website said.\n\nHilla is the capital of Babylon province, a predominantly Shi'ite region with some Sunnis.\n\n\"It's the largest bombing in the province to date,\" Falah al-Radhi, the head of the provincial security committee, told Reuters. \"The checkpoint, the nearby police station were destroyed as well as some houses and dozens of cars.\"\n\nA provincial hospital official confirmed the number of casualties, adding that 23 of them were members of the police and other security forces that were manning the check point located at the northern entrance of the city. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to a coalition fighting Islamic State, on Saturday told a news conference in Baghdad that Islamic State was losing the battle against forces arraigned against it from many sides in Iraq and Syria. He said the focus would turn to stabilizing cities seized back from them.\n\n(Reporting by Ali al-Rubaie and Saif Hameed; Writing by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by David Goodman and Stephen Powell)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The suicide attack, involving an explosive-laden fuel tanker, is the second deadliest", "title": "Islamic State truck bomb kills at least 60 people south of Baghdad", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/06/Islamic-State-truck-bomb-kills-least-60-people-south-Baghdad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-blast_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/06/Islamic-State-truck-bomb-kills-least-60-people-south-Baghdad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-blast_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The suicide attack, involving an explosive-laden fuel tanker, is the second deadliest", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to a coalition fighting Islamic State, on Saturday told a news conference in Baghdad that Islamic State was losing the battle against forces arraigned against it from many sides in Iraq and Syria.\n\"It's the largest bombing in the province to date,\" Falah al-Radhi, the head of the provincial security committee, told Reuters.\nResponsibility for the bombing in Hilla, 117 kilometers (73 miles) south of Baghdad, was claimed in a posting on the website of the Amaq news agency, which supports Islamic State.\nThe escalation in Islamic State bombings suggests that Iraqi government forces are being stretched thin after their recent gains against the group in the western and northern provinces.\nThis was also claimed by the ultra-hardline Sunni group that controls vast swathes of territory in Iraq and in Syria."}
