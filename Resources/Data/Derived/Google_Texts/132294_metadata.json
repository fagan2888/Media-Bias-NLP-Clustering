The sisters have a convent in the city. The pontiff made the visit to show support for the sisters, who are suing the federal government over the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJust in: Vatican spokesman says Pope Francis has met with Little Sisters of the Poor, who are suing over ACA contraceptive mandate #PopeInDC \u2014 Steven Portnoy (@stevenportnoy) September 24, 2015\n\nPope Francis just met w/ the Little Sisters of the Poor as a \u201csign of support\u201d for their opposition against a federal contraception mandate. \u2014 Stephanie Ramos (@sramosABC) September 24, 2015\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor is a religious order that was founded to serve the elderly poor. As the Little Sisters do not exclusively employ or serve Catholics, (which would violate their vow of hospitality) they are not considered to be a \"religious employer\" and are subjected to the HHS Contraception Mandate. The sisters filed suit in September 2013.\n\nPope Francis made special mention of the need to preserve religious liberty during his remarks this morning outside the White House. While he didn't name the Little Sisters explicitly, it was fairly obvious what he was talking about. Good on Pope Francis for making a surprise visit to provide moral support the Little Sisters in their fight against the federal government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Very nice. .05/26/2016 18:43:14PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Very nice.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Pope Francis Makes Unscheduled Visit to Little Sisters of the Poor", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/09/23/pope-francis-makes-unscheduled-visit-to-little-sisters-of-the-poor-n2056198", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/267/6842580b-fa7d-41aa-956a-9f889547368c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Very nice.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Pope Francis Makes Unscheduled Visit to Little Sisters of the Poor", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/09/23/pope-francis-makes-unscheduled-visit-to-little-sisters-of-the-poor-n2056198", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/267/6842580b-fa7d-41aa-956a-9f889547368c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Pope Francis Makes Unscheduled Visit to Little Sisters of the Poor, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "On day two of his trip to Washington, Pope Francis made an unscheduled surprise visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor following his canonization Mass.\nGood on Pope Francis for making a surprise visit to provide moral support the Little Sisters in their fight against the federal government.\n\u2014 Stephanie Ramos (@sramosABC) September 24, 2015The Little Sisters of the Poor is a religious order that was founded to serve the elderly poor.\nWhile he didn't name the Little Sisters explicitly, it was fairly obvious what he was talking about.\nPope Francis made special mention of the need to preserve religious liberty during his remarks this morning outside the White House."}
