And we have a good audience; they\u2019re embracing it more and more.\u201d\n\nThe drama, written by a playwright from Austin, Texas, dropped viewers into the middle of the last phone conversation between a gay couple before one jumped to his death from one of the smoldering Twin Towers.\n\nThe West Coast Players have earned a reputation for not shying away from potentially controversial material, said Salerno, a retired ballroom dance instructor. Salerno was on a six person board that chose the 10 one act plays from about 140 scripts mailed in from across the nation.\n\nWhile some patrons have been shocked by the players\u2019 controversial shows, most have embraced the theater, said show producer Rick Kastle, a retired hearing aid specialist from Clearwater. As the theater has grown, community organizations like the St. Petersburg Pride Festival have also reached out for events and partnerships. Thirty local actors participated in this year\u2019s festival, most novice actors with a flair for the unusual.\n\nThe troupe had just about two months to prepare for their performances for an audience of about 400, Kastle said. The one-act shows are the perfect breeding ground for new community actors looking to try their hand at the stage, he said, though the theater recruits year-round.\n\n\u201cDoing plays like this is a little hard, because you have to connect with the audience in so little time,\u201d said Brad Brady, the theater director at East Lake High School. \u201cI do maybe one show a year hear, and every year the audience has grown. A few of my students have even performed here or helped build sets, and I love that this exposes them to so many great works.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 17:52:42 -0400", "Description": "Hidden behind an unassuming strip mall storefront, lawyers, college kids, retirees and children as young as 9 brought their dreams to life Sunday afternoon, performing for their final sold out fundra", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Hidden behind an unassuming strip mall storefront, lawyers, college kids, retirees and children as young as 9 brought their dreams to life Sunday afternoon, performing for their final sold out fundra", "title": "West Coast Players festival packs entertainment into one act", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pinellas-county/west-coast-players-festival-packs-entertainment-into-one-act-20140720/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140720/ARTICLE/140729926/EP/1/4/EP-140729926.jpg", "height": 2667}, "updated_time": "2014-07-20T18:31:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Hidden behind an unassuming strip mall storefront, lawyers, college kids, retirees and children as young as 9 brought their dreams to life Sunday afternoon, performing for their final sold out fund", "title": "West Coast Players festival packs entertainment into one act", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140720/ARTICLE/140729926/AR/0/AR-140729926.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-20T17:52:42Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-20T18:31:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa09\"", "article_summary": "Clearwater\u2019s West Coast Players community theater group closed out its fifth annual One Act Plays Festival on Sunday, but the 10 one-act shows were a far cry from grandma\u2019s community theater.\nThe West Coast Players have earned a reputation for not shying away from potentially controversial material, said Salerno, a retired ballroom dance instructor.\nAs the theater has grown, community organizations like the St. Petersburg Pride Festival have also reached out for events and partnerships.\nThirty local actors participated in this year\u2019s festival, most novice actors with a flair for the unusual.\nThe one-act shows are the perfect breeding ground for new community actors looking to try their hand at the stage, he said, though the theater recruits year-round."}
