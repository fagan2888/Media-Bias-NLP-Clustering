A 20-year-old Wichita man avoids a prison sentence in a child sex case in Reno County.

Samuel Peterson was originally charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a child. The Hutch Post reports the charge stems from his sexual acts with a 12-year-old girl.

As part of a plea agreement, Peterson pleaded no contest aggravated indecent solicitation. A judge sentenced him to 32 months in prison, but suspended the prison sentence and granted him three years probation under Community Corrections.

Peterson made contact with the girl through an internet site called “Hot or Not” and then met up with her in September of 2014, when the alleged sexual encounter occurred.

The Post reports the girl indicated on the website that she was older and didn't tell Peterson her real age. She reportedly punched him and ran away from him after the incident.

Peterson has already registered as a sex offender in Sedgwick County where he lives.
