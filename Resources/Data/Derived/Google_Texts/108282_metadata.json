If it were, it would be easier to dismiss it. But the Amazon Studios comedy, which debuted today, is executed with a lot of flair and sophistication\u2013a nearly deceptive amount of sophistication, really. One of the biggest tells of prestige television is just how much money has been spent on the production, and \u201cRed Oaks\u201d has the recognizable names and high production values to prove its pedigree. Richard Kind, Jennifer Grey, and Paul Reiser are in the main cast; attached producers and directors include Steven Soderbergh and Amy Heckerling. And the setting\u2014Red Oaks, a Jewish country club in suburban New Jersey in 1985\u2014is meticulously rendered, with the kind of attention to detail that only the familiar view of hindsight can deliver. Walkmen, VHS tapes, big hair, blue eyeshadow, aerobics and a thorough misunderstanding of the dangers of date rape: \u201cRed Oaks\u201d offers the whole nine yards of \u201980s minutiae, in an appealing and approachable format.\n\nThe problem is that \u201cRed Oaks\u201d is only minutiae, really. It\u2019s a love letter to the \u201980s, with all the aimless sentimentality and wishful thinking that the medium implies. Because the Amazon Studios model is to drop every episode at once, the 10 episodes of \u201cRed Oaks\u201d are less like a traditional sitcom and more like a long, meandering movie, split into bite-sized chunks. This feeds into \u201cRed Oaks\u2019\u201d backwards glances, too; \u201cRed Oaks\u201d feels like mash-up of \u201cDirty Dancing,\u201d \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d \u201cSay Anything\u201d and \u201cPretty in Pink.\u201d Just to seal the deal, Jennifer Grey\u2014a star of two of those films\u2014is a series regular for \u201cRed Oaks,\u201d and Alexandra Socha, another regular, is a dead ringer for Ally Sheedy in \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d(albeit playing a role that is essentially Molly Ringwald\u2019s character in \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d). Music rights for the era appear to have been too expensive to purchase, but otherwise \u201cRed Oaks\u201d is pitched and lobbed directly to whatever algorithm suggests John Hughes movies, in rapid succession, as you comb through streaming options.\n\nThe series follows David Myers (Craig Roberts), an awkward-but-not-too-awkward NYU sophomore who has taken a summer job teaching tennis at Red Oaks. His girlfriend Karen (Gage Golightly) leads the aerobics classes; his stoner friend Wheeler (Oliver Cooper) works valet. It being a country club\u2014and David still being quite young\u2014\u201cRed Oaks\u201d is populated with weirdos of every stripe. Such as: the \u201cartist\u201d who takes an interest in \u201cphotographing\u201d Karen; David\u2019s out-of-touch mom and dad; the filthy-rich club president; and, of course, the club president\u2019s untouchable, damaged and alluring daughter, Skye. [This is Socha\u2014who in addition to behaving like Claire from \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d and looking like Sheedy, has a name that sounds awfully familiar to fans of \u201cSay Anything.\u201d]\n\nRoberts as David is a serviceable hero, in that he\u2019s mostly a blank slate; the only characteristic he seems to have, besides being good at tennis, is being interested in filmmaking. (I wonder if any of the show\u2019s producers identify with David.) The narrative, such as it is, follows the arc of the summer, as David fools around with Karen, falls for Skye, wins the respect of Skye\u2019s father (Paul Reiser) and comes to terms with his parents\u2019 loveless marriage (played with typical dramedy by Richard Kind and Grey). There are times where the sophistication of the show creates sublime little juxtapositions\u2014for example, there\u2019s an episode where two different sets of people go on dates, and the half-hour offers us two parallel nights on the town without making much of a fuss about the device. And especially with some of the minor characters, like Wheeler, Karen, and Nash (Ennis Esmer), \u201cRed Oaks\u201d offers a rich sympathy that neither apologizes for nor judges them as they go on adventures David barely knows about.\n\nBut mostly, the story is scattered and unfulfilling\u2014a portrait of youth that doesn\u2019t quite go anywhere, a collection of disjointed vignettes that follow nearly every predictable story beat in cinema. It has a lived-in quality that draws in the viewer\u2014but once there, the furniture turns out to be covered in plastic, shrink-wrapped against the encroaching forces of time. \u201cRed Oaks\u201d is mired in nostalgia, both carefully rendered and just as carefully unconsidered. It\u2019s comfort food for a certain class of individuals\u2014the individuals, probably, that Amazon hopes to reach with \u201cRed Oaks.\u201d But the show offers merely an airless hall full of mirrors; there is no vision or thematic content to this show aside from scene-setting. \u201cRed Oaks\u201d is just reflected memories and the vague outlines of coming-of-age movies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walkmen, VHS tapes, big hair, characters out of \"Breakfast Club\": \"Red Oaks\" gets details right, but politics wrong", "title": "We get it, you love the \u201980s!
