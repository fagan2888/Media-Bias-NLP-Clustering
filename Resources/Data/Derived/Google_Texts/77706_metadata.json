Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the 16-day partial shutdown of the U.S. government.\n\nBut now that the government has been reopened and a potentially disastrous default avoided, it seems Reid is feeling free to sound off on his colleague whom many say is responsible for the shutdown.\n\nRepublicans have been \u201churt irreparably\u201d by the \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d gambit, an attempt to tie President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law to a bill to keep the government funded, Reid told the Huffington Post in an interview Thursday.\n\nThe majority leader said that in his 30 years in Congress, he\u2019s never seen a freshman senator inject himself into the House\u2019s affairs quite like Cruz did.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, well, he proved he has a great fundraising operation,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to have Harry Reid criticizing him. Republicans criticized him. What do you think that vote was last night from Republicans?\u201d\n\nTed Cruz \u201ccan\u2019t legislate better than I can\u201d \u2014 Harry Reid. Share:\n\n\u201cThat was a message to Ted Cruz: \u2018What the hell are you doing?\u2019 \u2026 He is a laughingstock to everybody but him. What has he accomplished other than raising some money for president? And if this man can get the nomination to be the Republican nominee for president, I pity the Republican Party,\u201d Reid said.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is smart,\u201d Reid added. \u201cHe has always been able to talk down to people. He is now in the Senate. People are as smart as he is. He can\u2019t talk down to anyone anymore. But he has still not accepted that in his own head. He still thinks he\u2019s smarter than everybody else. He might be able to work a calculus problem better than I can. But he can\u2019t legislate better than I can.\u201d\n\nReid then turned his attention to the story behind the failed \u201cdefund\u201d Obamacare strategy.\n\n\u201cThey kept trying to legislate from hour to hour,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even day to day.\u201d\n\nThe majority leader recalled how Republicans constantly changed their proposals, the final one including a provision that would have required all members of Congress, their staff and the White House staff enroll in Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAll of us who worked with him on this [were saying], \u2018John, what is the matter with you?\u2019\u2019\u2019 Reid said, referring to House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cOK. Go after members of Congress. But even doing that. Now, I can handle if I have to buy insurance without employer contribution. But some of my senators can\u2019t. Forget about that. Forget about senators. They can do okay. But staff \u2014 we have staff people of [Sen.] Susan Collins.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has people who work in Maine and make $25,000 a year. One of the reasons you can get somebody like that is that you give them health care. I don\u2019t mean to ramble on here, but I just can\u2019t imagine the thought process of John Boehner. \u2026 How in good conscience could you do something like that?\u201d he asked.\n\nIn fact, Reid\u2019s office was so annoyed that Boehner tried to include lawmakers in President Obama\u2019s signature health care law that its chief of staff leaked a handful of emails to Politico showing that the speaker may have actually coordinated with the Senate majority leader to exempt Congress from Obamacare\n\n\u201cThe speaker doesn\u2019t want any staffer -\u2013 or any American \u2013- to be subject to Obamacare,\u201d Boehner\u2019s spokesman, Brendan Buck, told the Huffington Post on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s fought tirelessly to repeal the entire law.\u201d\n\n(H/T: Washington Examiner)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was apparently holding back a lot of his criticism of Sen.
