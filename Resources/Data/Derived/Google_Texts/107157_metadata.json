Chris Christie may have gotten bumped to undercard debate, but that didn\u2019t deter him from aiming above the GOP field and targeting the other side instead.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about his fellow Republican rivals, Christie said, worry about the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, who is \"coming for your wallet.\"\n\n\"If anybody believes the stuff they heard from that Democratic debate a few weeks ago, there\u2019s nothing for free,\" Christie said. \"What they forgot to tell was that they\u2019re going to raise your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent in order to provide all of that stuff.\"\n\nSeveral of you asked us to look into whether Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley want to hike up taxes to 70 or 80 percent.\n\nThe Christie camp told us that it\u2019s been widely reported that Sanders \"doesn\u2019t flinch\" over returning to a 90 percent top marginal tax rate. But that\u2019s not the same thing as a tax increase of 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer (Christie earned a Pants on Fire for his statement last debate that Sanders wants a 90 percent rate for ordinary Americans). Nor does that prove that Clinton and O\u2019Malley also want a tax rate, top marginal or otherwise, of 70, 80 or 90 percent.\n\nNone of the three Democrats have released formal tax plans, but spokespeople for Clinton and Sanders said Christie\u2019s statement is \"ridiculous\" and \"completely false.\" Tax analysts also told us that there\u2019s nothing in what Clinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley have said so far that suggest rates that high.\n\nThe tax plans\n\nHere\u2019s what each candidate has proposed so far, according to analysis by the free market-oriented Tax Foundation and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, as well as our own research:\n\nClinton\u2019s tax plan Sanders\u2019 tax plan O\u2019Malley\u2019s tax plan \u2022 Makes the higher education tax credit permanent and creates a credit for out-of-pocket health care costs \u2022 Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act \u2022 Creates medium-term capital gains rates between 24 and 39.6 percent (current short-term rate is 39.6 percent and long-term rate is 20 percent) \u2022 Creates a 15 percent tax credit for companies that share profits with workers \u2022 Creates a high-frequency trading tax \u2022 Eliminates carried interest loopholes \u2022 Raises the top marginal income tax rate from 39.6 percent to above 50 percent \u2022 Creates a net investment income surtax of 10 percent \u2022 Raises capital gains and dividends tax rates to the level of income taxes \u2022 Raises the top estate tax rate from 40 percent to 65 percent (estates under $3.5 million would be exempt) \u2022 Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act \u2022 Raises the payroll tax of 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent \u2022 Eliminates deferral on foreign income \u2022 Creates a $20 per ton carbon tax \u2022 Creates a financial transaction tax \u2022 Creates a Wall Street speculation tax \u2022 Eliminates the cap on Social Security taxes \u2022 Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act \u2022 Creates a financial transaction tax\n\nCompared to the Republicans\u2019 tax plans, the Democrats\u2019 proposals are less detailed and make minor changes to the current system, said the Tax Policy Center\u2019s Roberton Williams. He and other experts emphasized that no Democrat has offered a detailed tax plan with specific rates, let alone rates as high as Christie says.\n\n\"It does not seem likely that the Democratic candidates intend to levy very high rates on the median American household,\" said Scott Greenberg, an analyst with the Tax Foundation.\n\n\"Christie\u2019s claim is more of a statement of \u2018there\u2019s no such thing as free lunch,\u2019 \" observed Bill Smith, the managing director of the tax consulting firm CBIZ MHM, adding, \"But I don\u2019t think any of one of (the Democrats) in their wildest dreams would raise taxes to 70 or 80 percent across the board.\"\n\nNot exactly \u2018your tax rates\u2019\n\nBoth Greenberg and the Williams pointed out that it\u2019s plausible that the Democratic candidates would increase the rate on top earners. But that\u2019s not the same thing as raising \"your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent.\"\n\n\"It may be necessary to raise top individual tax rates to levels such as 70 or 80 percent to fund Democratic candidates\u2019 spending proposals without increasing the deficit or taxing middle- and low-income Americans,\" he said, referring us to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the price tag of Sanders\u2019 proposals.\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously noted, Sanders has said he doesn\u2019t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent would be too high. And he\u2019s specifically proposed to raise the top rate from its current rate of 39.6 percent to above 50 percent. In other words, for individuals making more than $400,000 a year (roughly the threshold for the top 1 percent of incomes), any amount they make above $400,000 would be taxed at 50 percent. The income earned below $400,000 is taxed at lower rates.\n\nSanders has also proposed to raise the top estate tax to 65 percent, which would affect estates worth more than $1 billion (there are 537 individuals with that much wealth in the United States today).\n\nAgain, both of those top rates would affect just a tiny fraction of Americans. Sanders\u2019 proposal to increase the federal payroll tax from 12.4 to 12.8 percent would hit everyone \u2014 but that\u2019s nowhere near 70 or 80 percent.\n\nClinton and O\u2019Malley, for their parts, haven\u2019t said anything specific about raising income or estate tax rates. But like Sanders, their proposals would mostly affect the wealthy and still not at the levels Christie is suggesting.\n\nTake for example, Clinton\u2019s proposal to raise taxes on capital gains, the profits that come from selling an asset like a stock or property. In 2014, 42 percent of these investments, about $305 billion out of $722 billion, came from the top 0.1 percent, reported PolitiFact Virginia.\n\nCurrently, the short-term rate is 39.6 percent (the same as income), but it decreases to 20 percent once you\u2019ve held on to that stock for longer than a year. Clinton\u2019s plans adds four additional brackets for investments held between one and six years. The highest rate proposed by Clinton, 39.6 percent, still doesn\u2019t come close to Christie\u2019s purported 70 or 80 percent.\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said the Democrats plan \"to raise your tax rates to 70 to 80 percent.\"\n\nWe understand the spirit of Christie\u2019s statement, but that doesn\u2019t make it accurate. None of the three Democrats running have proposed raising rates to 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer or is it likely that they will. Christie is exaggerating the rate hikes proposed by the Democrats, the amount of people they\u2019ll affect or both.\n\nWe rate Christie\u2019s claim False.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey Gov.
