The 34.6 percent rate increase is an average, ranging from 5 percent to 42 percent depending on the customer and type of coverage.\n\nMost customers will not pay the entire rate increase, as the majority of residents enrolled in Obamacare receive federal subsidies to offset healthcare costs.\n\nAccording to Blue Cross chief actuary Patrick Getzen, the health insurer has seen large shares of individuals with pre-existing conditions sign up for coverage since Obamacare took effect two years ago. The number has not been offset by younger, healthier individuals signing up for coverage, despite the Obama administration\u2019s hopes.\n\nIn fact, about 6.6 million taxpayers nationwide elected to pay a penalty for not having health insurance imposed this year under Obamacare, which exceeded the administration\u2019s estimate by 10 percent.\n\nGetzen also explained that the company\u2019s 2014 healthcare costs in North Carolina amounted to $123 million more than its revenue, even as Blue Cross received $343 million in reinsurance and assistance from the federal government to help ease Obamacare expenses.\n\nIn addition to requesting rate hikes, Blue Cross is also eliminating plans in parts of the state, a move that will effect coverage of 55,000 residents come January.\n\nHealth spending endured a notable increase in 2014 because of Obamacare, growing by 5.5 percent to $3.1 trillion\u2013or $9,695 per person, on average\u2013according to a report published by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 Office of the Actuary (OACT) this week.\n\nHealth care spending is expected to increase by 5.8 percent on average from 2014 to 2024.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The largest health insurance provider in North Carolina is requesting a 34.6 percent rate increase for customers on individual policies under Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The largest health insurance provider in the state of North Carolina is requesting a 34.6 percent rate increase for customers in the state\u00a0on individual policies under Obamacare.
