I\u2019m looking out for her, whispering tactics in her ear. Today, for example, I\u2019ve got a word for her. That word is:\n\nPhotographs.\n\nNot as a cure-all, not as a one-size-fits-all, but as a let\u2019s-have-a-think-about-this. Somebody doubting the \u201cfacts\u201d of the tale? Why not a little un-Photoshopped proof? Somebody wishing the narrative would grow a tad larger than itself? Why not the metaphors that are born of a camera\u2019s snap? Somebody thinking there are no new stories to tell? Photographs, I say. There are precedents.\n\nWe have, for example, Dorothy Allison, who writes in her memoir: \u201cTwo or three things I know for sure, and one of them is what it means to have no loved version of your life but the one you make.\u201d\n\nAllison is, she says, \u201ca storyteller.\u201d Someone who will:\n\n\u2026 work to make you believe me. Throw in some real stuff, change a few details, add the certainty of outrage. I know the use of fiction in a world of hard truths. The story of what happened, or what did not happen but should have\u2014that story can become a curtain drawn shut, a piece of insulation, a disguise, a razor, a tool that changes every time it is used and sometimes becomes something other than we intended.\n\nThe story becomes the thing needed. (3)\n\nSince Allison\u2019s story has been sold to us as memoir, we want to believe that it is true, that it is sure. She may have cautioned us\u2014\u201ca few details\u201d changed\u2014but we are consoled by that rage (it\u2019s absolute) and by the photographs (yes!: black and white, soft-edged) that live like substrate among Allison\u2019s words. We have, thanks to rescued albums and ink dots, something we hold to as truth.\n\nSo that Allison will write:\n\nThe women of my family? We are the ones in all those photographs taken at mining disasters, floods, fires. We are the ones in the background with our mouths open, in print dresses or drawstring pants and collarless smocks, ugly and old and exhausted. Solid, stolid, wide-hipped baby machines. We were all wide-hipped and predestined. Wide-faced meant stupid. (33)\n\n\u2026 and there they are, the women, staring back at us from the page. Wide feet. Wide hands. Their thoughts too big for the camera, maybe, but their expressions wholly telling. \u201cTwo or Three Things\u201c speaks of a life radically investigated and partially known. It is poetry, documentary, and persistent caution, which makes for stunning memoir. Language may be fallible, Allison suggests, and memory inexpert, but here they are, these photographs, as signposts, symbols, sighs.\n\nWhen Calvin Trillin writes, in \u201cMessages from My Father,\u201d that his dad \u201cdid not make a strong first impression,\u201d we can see that for ourselves, thanks to the wrinkled attire of the slouching man whose eyes rumble back at us over the captions. When David Carr writes, in \u201cThe Night of the Gun: A Reporter Investigates The Darkest Story of His Life. His Own,\u201d that \u201cthe cops had run out of adjectives\u201d\u2014\u201cMy speech was \u2018regional\u2019 and \u2018obscene,\u2019 I was \u2018married\u2019 and \u2018single,\u2019 my eyes were \u2018blue\u2019 and \u2018brown,\u2019 I was \u2018stocky\u2019 and \u2018obese,\u2019 I lived on \u2018Garfield,\u2019 no \u2018Oliver,\u2019 no, I was homeless\u201d (148)\u2014the accompanying photographs suggest a fluctuating, tormented man. Likewise the photographs provided of Geoffrey Wolff\u2019s father and Alexandra Fuller\u2019s mother in \u201cDuke of Deception\u201c and \u201cDon\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight,\u201d respectively. They shuffle the words to the side for just a moment, because we need time to see.\n\nBut what is Patti Smith up to, in her showstopping \u201cJust Kids,\u201d a book whose primary subjects\u2014Patti and Robert Mapplethorpe\u2014are poets, performers, and photographers? Is it possible that Smith offers her photographs not just as evidence of a time and a friendship, but also as texture and performance\u2014as extensions of the artists themselves? That she uses them to buttress the words Smith remembers Mapplethorpe saying: \u201cPatti, nobody sees as we do.\u201d (80) Smith\u2019s photographs do more than suggest, congeal, and authenticate. They stand in for that which cannot be said.\n\nAnd what about all the ways that photographs can operate, in memoir, as metaphor and counterweight, as tease and opposition, as the other half of a parenthesis? In \u201cRunning in the Family,\u201c for example, the photographs don\u2019t necessarily, or primarily, prove Michael Ondaatje\u2019s unbounded tales of growing up in Sri Lanka. Instead they deepen the ambiguities, foreshadow the dualities, put a bit more acknowledged tremble into the delicate business of remembering. Late in the book, for example, we find ourselves looking down upon the image of Ondaatje\u2019s parents, people about whom Ondaatje has already shared ample myths and rumors.\n\nThe photograph appears under the section heading \u201cWhat We Think of Married Life.\u201d Ondaatje\u2019s parents are elegantly dressed. But they are also aping for the camera\u2014the father crossing his eyes, the mother thrusting her jaw\u2014and it\u2019s a little strange; it\u2019s uncomfortable. We expect a caption or two, an instant explanation, but in the pages immediately following, we find not the prank but this whispered assertion: \u201cThe roads weave and whorl away\u2014bright yellow under the grey sky. The sun, invisible, struggles up somewhere. This is the colour of landscape, this is the silence, that surrounded my parents\u2019 marriage.\u201d (167)\n\nBy juxtaposing the raucous image with the infused topography, the visual noise and the linguistic stillness, Ondaatje reaffirms the complexity of parents. He prepares us for this sentence: \u201cThey were a world to themselves, genial with everyone but sharing a code of humour.\u201d (170) His photography assures reader\u2014and writer\u2014that Ondaatje\u2019s family cannot be reduced.\n\nPerhaps few memoirists are as overtly drawn to the photograph as both evidence and riddle as Orhan Pamuk in \u201cIstanbul: Memories and the City.\u201d This tale of a boy growing up/grown up launches with this opening salvo: \u201cFrom a very young age, I suspected there was more to my world than I could see: Somewhere in the streets of Istanbul, in a house resembling ours, there lived another Orhan so much like me that he could pass for my twin, even my double.\u201d (3)\n\nA memoir about twins, then, about doubles and hallucinatory life, about history that is both personal and cultural, domestic and geographic. Some of the photographs that accompany this text are drawn from Pamuk\u2019s family archives. But the vast majority were taken by the photographer Ara Guler. Pamuk explains:\n\n\u2026 during my time searching in his home-studio-archive-museum \u2026 I came across many treasured but long-forgotten images\u2026 as beguilingly familiar to my adult eye as they were strange. When I happened on the view of the snow-covered Galata Bridge on 316 it was as if my own memory had been projected onto a screen; there were other moments like that, when I would be seized by a frenzy to capture and preserve this dreamscape or to write about it. (374)\n\nWithin the frame of Pamuk\u2019s memoir, Guler\u2019s photographs do not operate as proof of a specific life lived. Instead they suggest how memory works, how history is held and not held, how memoir, like photography, is about perspective, cropping, research, imagination.\n\nIt\u2019s about the gaps\u2014and how we fill them. With ink, with dots, with ambiguity and grammar, and sometimes\u2014sometimes\u2014with photographs. That\u2019s my word, on this fine day, to the memoir in my family.\n\nBeth Kephart is the author of sixteen books, including five memoirs, and a teacher of memoir at the University of Pennsylvania.
