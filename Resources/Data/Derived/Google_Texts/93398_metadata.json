He is shown engaged in what we today might call Donald Trumpism. In the novel, Finch\u2019s daughter, now 26 and visiting her small-town Alabama home from New York City, cries \u201cI looked up to you, Atticus, like I never looked up to anybody in my life and never will again.\u201d\n\nFinch, similar to Lee\u2019s real father, is a prominent lawyer who served for many years in the Alabama House of Representatives. In \u201cMockingbird,\u201d he is a paragon of decency and integrity who teaches his children to understand other people and transcend prejudice.\n\nIn \u201cWatchman,\u201d the Honorable Mr. Finch is a member of a local White Citizen\u2019s Council dedicated to preserving segregation and fighting the NAACP and recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, especially Brown vs. Board of Education (1954).\n\nIf the idealized Atticus Finch was almost too perfect to be true in \u201cMockingbird,\u201d the Atticus Finch of \u201cWatchman\u201d is disconcertingly human.\n\nJean Louise \u201cScout\u201d Finch is appalled by her father\u2019s seemingly new racism. His political views, in Lee\u2019s telling, may be even more backward than those of Scarlett O\u2019Hara (Margaret Mitchell\u2019s heroine in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d).\n\n\u201cDo you want Negroes by the carload in our schools and churches and theaters?\u201d he asks.\n\nFinch wants the feds, the courts and Northern liberals to leave them alone. \u201cWhat would happen if all the Negroes in the South were suddenly given full civil rights? There\u2019d be another Reconstruction.\u201d\n\nHe says the feds are trampling on the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, adding the blacks \u201cdown here are still in their childhood as a people.\u201d\n\nScout becomes outraged and calls him out as a coward and tyrant, almost like Sophocles\u2019 Antigone rails against King Creon of Thebes. But Scout\u2019s aunt, uncle and longtime boyfriend share Finch\u2019s hardened political views. She asks her boyfriend, Henry Clinton \u2014 a young law associate in her dad\u2019s law firm who aspires to run for the state legislature \u2014 why he is in league with the segregationists.\n\nHenry, echoing Atticus Finch\u2019s sentiments, says it was expedient and perhaps the necessary thing to do. \u201cHave you ever considered that men, especially men, must conform to certain demands of the community they live in simply so they can be of service of it?\u201d\n\nShe responds: \u201cyou\u2019re a goddamned hypocrite.\u201d\n\nNelle Harper Lee, now 89, has long since settled back into her old Alabama hometown of Monroeville, the model for the novel\u2019s town of Maycomb. \u201cWatchman\u201d was written in the late 1950s, around the same time as her best-selling and much-loved \u201cMockingbird,\u201d which was set in the 1930s.\n\n\u201cWatchman\u201d is more political than \u201cMockingbird.\u201d It probes the political values of the white community, and puts under a microscope the \u201cpay-to-play\u201d politics of the courthouse political cabal.\n\n\u201cWatchman\u201d is not as endearing, charming or redemptive as the earlier novel. It suffers from being narrated in the third person and lacks the riveting courtroom drama of \u201cMockingbird.\u201d It has some good stories in it, yet it is less entertaining and less lyrical. In fact, it is occasionally boring. But it builds slowly and then explodes in almost Shakespearean ways (like \u201cKing Lear\u201d and \u201cOthello\u201d).\n\nAt one point, Scout \u2014 who is obviously the stand-in for the author \u2014 considers whether the South and her family have changed or whether she herself has changed. Her family implies that the African-American community has changed. Her dad says it\u2019s the feds who have changed. Doubtless, a lot had changed.\n\nLike Harriet Beecher Stowe of \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d fame, Scout asks, \u201cHow can they devoutly believe everything they hear in church and then say the things they do and listen to things they hear without throwing up?\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s grown-up and now \u201cYankee-fied\u201d Scout assumes the role of \u201cwatchman\u201d \u2014 or conscience \u2014 yet is treated as the bearer of unwanted criticism, like Ibsen\u2019s Dr. Stockmann (\u201cEnemy of the People\u201d) or Joan of Arc, or Antigone.\n\nAlabama famously voted for Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond in the presidential election of 1948 as a response to civil rights platforms of the Democratic Party that year. It had voted into office some Klan-supported governors in these same decades and, a few years later, would elect George C. Wallace, who pledged in January 1963 to be \u201cfor segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\u201d\n\nAlthough \u201cWatchman\u201d doesn\u2019t tell their story, large numbers of Americans from South Texas to South Boston similarly feared and opposed the federal government\u2019s initiatives in the 1940s and 1950s to enfranchise and empower blacks and poor whites around the country.\n\nPublic policy initiatives that alter the status quo, regardless of which branch of government is acting, invariably meet resistance. Backlash to affirmative action, busing and empowering minorities to vote is still apparent.\n\nLee\u2019s \u201cWatchman\u201d may be about her small town in southern Alabama, but it is also instructive political anthropology. She helps explain political realities of our darker past and the reasons local political elites often act the way they do. Whereas \u201cMockingbird\u201d was a consciousness-raising inspiration about how we can overcome intolerance, \u201cWatchman: is a frank examination and analysis of the realities of the time.\n\nBut Lee conveys little or no understanding in either book of the leadership and politics in the African-American community. The novel\u2019s fictional town (and Lee\u2019s real hometown) were at least 50 percent African-American.\n\nThe great student of Southern politics, V.O. Key Jr., summed it up in 1949 in \u201cSouthern Politics\u201d, in which he wrote, \u201ca rural agricultural people views with distrust the urban, laboring classes of the North. The almost indelible memories of occupation by a conqueror create a sense of hostility toward the outsider.\u201d\n\nCourt decisions and the evolving civil rights movement unsettled Harper Lee\u2019s hometown and triggered a transformational political realignment in American politics. These effects are still being felt today.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cronin: Say it ain\u2019t so, Atticus", "title": "Cronin: Say it ain\u2019t so, Atticus", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/17/cronin-say-it-aint-so-atticus/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__20150719_Z00_OP19P_CRONINp2.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__20150719_Z00_OP19P_CRONINp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T11:46:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:23:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cce\"", "article_summary": "If the idealized Atticus Finch was almost too perfect to be true in \u201cMockingbird,\u201d the Atticus Finch of \u201cWatchman\u201d is disconcertingly human.\nJean Louise \u201cScout\u201d Finch is appalled by her father\u2019s seemingly new racism.\nLee\u2019s \u201cWatchman\u201d may be about her small town in southern Alabama, but it is also instructive political anthropology.\nHenry, echoing Atticus Finch\u2019s sentiments, says it was expedient and perhaps the necessary thing to do.\nIn \u201cMockingbird,\u201d he is a paragon of decency and integrity who teaches his children to understand other people and transcend prejudice."}
