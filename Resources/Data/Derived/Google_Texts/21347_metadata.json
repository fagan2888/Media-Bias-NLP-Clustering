He said he wouldn't have bid more than his original $90 million \"stalking horse\" bid that set the floor price for the auction if he knew about what he described as \"significant and numerous improprieties\" in the bidding process.\n\nHe also wants a federal judge to deduct a $3 million breakup fee he was originally promised because Revel is keeping Brookfield's $11 million deposit.\n\nThe filing said Revel should be put up for auction again and he should get his deposit back if the judge finds that \"the auction process was deficient to the extent the auction significantly and adversely affected\" Revel's ability to receive the highest bid.\n\nThe judge is scheduled to consider Revel's plans to sell the casino to Straub on Jan. 5.\n\nStraub has proposed several uses for the former casino resort. One of them was a so-called genius academy at which the world's best minds would look for solutions to society's problems.\n\nThe $2.4 billion Revel opened in April 2012 with high hopes of helping turn around Atlantic City's struggling casino market. But it never turned a profit, filed for bankruptcy twice and closed Sept. 2.\n\nIt was one of four Atlantic City casinos to shut down this year amid growing competition in the saturated Northeastern U.S. market. A fifth, the Trump Tal Mahal, averted being closed this year after investor Carl Icahn put up $20 million to keep it running through bankruptcy.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@am-newsletter','@atlantic-county','@news','@river','atlantic-city'", "title": "Potential Revel casino buyer wants discount", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Potential Revel casino buyer wants discount \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/12/potential_revel_casino_buyer_wants_discount.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/business_impact/photo/15600917-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14828898\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-25T18:25:09Z\", \"author\": \"The Associated Press\", \"tags\": [\"@am-newsletter\",\"@atlantic-county\",\"@news\",\"@river\",\"atlantic-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/business_impact/photo/15600917-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The Florida developer in line to purchase the former Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City says in court filings that the auction for the property wasn't run fairly and he wants an $8 million discount.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, December 26, 2014,  8:40 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/business_impact/photo/reveljpg-1f638c6f62d8e7fa.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njoapnews\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Associated Press\", \"author_id\": \"1828075\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Florida developer in line to purchase the former Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City says in court filings that the auction for the property wasn't run fairly and he wants an $8 million discount.", "title": "Potential Revel casino buyer wants discount", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/12/potential_revel_casino_buyer_wants_discount.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, December 25, 2014,  1:24 PM", "article_author": "The Associated Press", "Description": "The Florida developer in line to purchase the former Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City says in court filings that the auction for the property wasn't run fairly and he wants an $8 million discount."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaaba\"", "article_summary": "ATLANTIC CITY \u2014 The Florida developer in line to purchase the former Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City says in court filings that the auction for the property wasn't run fairly and he wants an $8 million discount.\nIt was one of four Atlantic City casinos to shut down this year amid growing competition in the saturated Northeastern U.S. market.\nThe $2.4 billion Revel opened in April 2012 with high hopes of helping turn around Atlantic City's struggling casino market.\nHe also wants a federal judge to deduct a $3 million breakup fee he was originally promised because Revel is keeping Brookfield's $11 million deposit.\nThe judge is scheduled to consider Revel's plans to sell the casino to Straub on Jan. 5."}
