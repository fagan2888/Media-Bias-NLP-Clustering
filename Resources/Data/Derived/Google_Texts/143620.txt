Megyn Kelly poked fun at herself and longtime Fox News colleague Mike Huckabee last night while giving the former Arkansas governor a chance to rebut reports that he criticized women at the cable network as routinely dropping the “f-bomb.”

Huckabee recently left his own Fox show to promote his new book, “God, Guns, Grits and Gravy” while considering making a second run for the Republican nomination for president.

He came under fire Tuesday in news reports in Politico and elsewhere because of an interview with an Iowa radio host in which he used the word “trashy” to describe men and women who use “inappropriate” language in professional settings.

“I never said anything about the women at Fox News,” Huckabee told Kelly.

Kelly playfully opened the segment by replaying an infamous on-air introduction in which she pronounces the name of his show, “Huckabee,” as if it began with the letter F.

Huckabee’s book describes “a cultural divide” between Americans who live in the “bubbles” of New York, Washington and Hollywood and those who live in more rural areas.

A chapter called “The Culture of Crude,” he said, “is not directed to any particular person, but to the general culture.” He added: “Most of the people who criticize have never read it.”
