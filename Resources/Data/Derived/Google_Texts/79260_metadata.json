In fact, when the economists eliminated the long-term unemployed from their equations, the predictions snapped right back to what the models would have predicted.\n\nRelated: Unemployment Insurance Plan Shot Down by Boehner\n\nEconomists warn that this is no small concern. In a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Janet Yellen said that the rate of long-term unemployment remains \u201cimmensely high.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. labor market is fundamentally different than it has ever been before in our history. For the first time ever, we have a huge problem with long-term unemployment,\u201d said economist Justin Wolfers, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings.\n\nThe authors of the paper, former White House Council of Economic Advisers chair Alan B. Kreuger, Judd Cramer, and David Cho, also studied outcomes for the long-term jobless, and the results were not encouraging. Using data from 2008 through 2012, they determined that given a sample of unemployed workers, only 11 percent could expect to have found good, long-term employment within the next fifteen months. (See chart.) Another 25 percent could expect to find short-term or part-time work during that time period. But after 15 months, 64 percent could expect to remain jobless.\n\n\u201cThe decline in job vacancies during the Great Recession set in motion a dynamic that led to unprecedented long-term unemployment and a rise in the unemployment rate,\u201d the authors write. They find that the characteristics of the long-term jobless point to a diverse population that is spread across the country, and not limited to specific groups or regions.\n\nRelated: Retroactive Unemployment Checks Are Cold Comfort to Some\n\nTheir research found that the personal characteristics of an individual, such as education, industry sector, and occupation, have little predictive value when measuring the likelihood of someone\u2019s being jobless.\n\n\u201cThe portrait of the long-term unemployed in the U.S. that emerges here suggests that, to a considerable extent, they are an unlucky subset of the unemployed,\u201d the authors find.\n\nReintegrating them into the working world, they said, will pose multiple challenges.\n\n\u201cOvercoming the obstacles that prevent many of the long-term unemployed from finding gainful employment, even in good times, will likely require a concerted effort by policy makers, social organizations, communities and families, in addition to appropriate monetary policy,\u201d they write.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study finds that the long-term unemployed are now so marginalized that they have little impact on wages and inflation.
