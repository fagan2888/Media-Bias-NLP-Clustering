BOULDER — The city of Boulder has decided to hold off on participating in the statewide “Don’t Be a Lab Rat” campaign after the Boulder Valley School District said it opposed the use of a giant metal cage to educate teens about the effects of marijuana on the developing brain.

The 12-foot-wide, 8-foot-high cage, complete with a scale version of the kind of water bottle hamsters drink from, was scheduled to be installed at the corner of 13th Street and Arapahoe Avenue as part of the state Department of Public Health’s campaign.

Boulder officials said after the school district opposed the installation, the city is putting the cage on hold.

“We’re trying to determine whether there is enough support now based on BVSD’s concerns about the installment,” said Karen Rahn, director of human services for the city. “We’re taking a step back and trying to address that.”
