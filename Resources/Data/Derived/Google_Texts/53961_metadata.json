The sometimes suffocatingly hot warehouse in Palo Alto, Calif., is a far cry from the beautifully appointed Google campus in nearby Mountain View, with its radiant cooling system.\n\nBut Ca\u0301rdenas doesn\u2019t work for Google. He works for Adecco, a staffing company that provides contract labor to Google and other tech firms. He\u2019s part of the teeming support workforce of janitors, bus drivers, food service workers, security guards and other low-paid workers who keep Silicon Valley running. Though they report to work every day alongside coders, developers and other mid-level staff, they are cut out of the famously high salaries and benefits of the tech elite. The wage differential is about much more than a difference in skill sets or qualifications. Relying on outside staffing firms saves tech companies money, as they don\u2019t need to give sub-contracted workers access to the same benefits (such as health care and paid leave) that direct employees receive. Staffing agencies offer low bids and make workers pay the price in limited\u2014or nonexistent\u2014benefits.\n\nEmployees of staffing companies are starting to revolt, however, ushering in what may be a new era of higher labor standards in the famous tech hub. These workers are organizing, voting for union membership and the power of collective bargaining, and publicly exposing their working conditions\u2014namechecking the companies that contract their services\u2014in the hopes of stirring up popular support. \u201cAdecco\u201d may not mean anything to the average consumer, but \u201cGoogle\u201d certainly does\u2014and many Google customers care about corporate accountability. If workers succeed, they could have a huge influence on newer tech hubs like New York and Chicago.\n\nValley of plenty, for a few\n\nSilicon Valley stretches across 1,854 square miles of former fruit trees and includes some of the most highly valued land\u2014and companies\u2014in the United States. Apple is worth $1 trillion; Google $383 billion; Facebook $250 billion. Tech professionals at such companies make a mean annual wage of $112,610, according to a 2014 survey by technology-career website Dice.com.\n\nSupport workers say they want the slice they\u2019ve earned of this highly profitable pie. Ca\u0301rdenas got the idea to organize his coworkers during a fall 2014 sociology course at Evergreen Valley College in San Jose, where he is earning his associate degree. Describing labor confrontations with employers, instructor Frank Espinoza told Ca\u0301rdenas, \u201cWhen you go up against a Goliath like that, you\u2019ve got to have a lot of Davids.\u201d The message that workers have tremendous power in numbers had a profound influence on Ca\u0301rdenas. He began talking to fellow Adecco employees at Google Express about whether they needed a union. There were numerous labor issues at the warehouse: a two-year limit on employment; dangerous working conditions, like cracked floors and damaged electrical systems; the stifling heat; low hourly wages of $13 to $14.\n\nAdecco responded to the rumblings in the workforce with a combination of pacification\u2014ventilation was improved, Ca\u0301rdenas says\u2014and union-busting. Teamsters Vice President Rome Aloise tells In These Times that the company brought in Jackson Lewis, the notorious anti-union law firm, and used \u201cevery trick in the book to scare and intimidate the workers.\u201d Ca\u0301rdenas and Aloise say lawyers walked the floor and managers pulled workers aside or held lengthy \u201ccaptive audience\u201d meetings to preach the pitfalls of unionization. Ironically, Adecco also suspended Ca\u0301rdenas for a day and a half on charges that he was bullying coworkers in the course of his labor organizing, which he denies. (Aloise tells In These Times that the Teamsters will be filing an NLRB complaint on behalf of Ca\u0301rdenas, along with two employees who believe their firings were retaliatory.)\n\nAsked for comment on workers\u2019 claims of labor problems and union-busting, an Adecco spokesperson said, \u201cThere have been a number of false claims made throughout this election process; we're not able to comment on active legal matters but objections were filed with the NLRB around the election process. \u2026 We will fully cooperate with the NLRB\u2019s investigation and the upcoming hearing.\u201d She added that the company is \u201csupportive of any direction freely chosen by our associates\u201d but \u201cbelieve[s] that our associates are better off directly dealing with us as their employer rather than involving a union.\u201d\n\nApparently, workers didn\u2019t share that belief. Adecco employees voted on August 21 to join the Teamsters, yet another milestone in what might be considered tech\u2019s comeuppance\u2014the moment when labor organizing spread like wildfire across Silicon Valley.\n\nThe first major stirrings began in May 2014, when venerable civil rights organizer Jesse Jackson launched a campaign focusing on racial and class disparities in the Valley with a bang, rallying for better working conditions for security guards at the offices of semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom. In September 2014, security guards mobbed an Apple store to chant, \u201cApple, Apple, you\u2019re no good, treat your workers like you should.\u201d Unite Here protesters gathered at Intel's Santa Clara offices in November 2014 to hold the firm accountable for unfair treatment of food service workers employed by a catering company. In a December 2014 protest, Jackson led a crowd of security guards and food service workers\u2014the majority of whom, like other contract workers, were people of color\u2014in a rally at Apple\u2019s Bay Area campus in an \u201cApple dodges taxes, we pay the price\u201d chant.\n\nThe Teamsters have seen four union victories in 2015: the warehouse workers at Google Express, waste disposal workers at Genentech, and workers at two transportation companies that collectively serve Apple, Genentech, Yahoo, eBay, Zynga, Evernote and Amtrak. These are the drivers of the infamous symbols of Silicon Valley\u2019s burgeoning class war: the elite private buses from San Francisco and environs to Silicon Valley. (In recent years, the buses, which are exclusive to tech employees, have attracted considerable contro- versy over their use of city bus stops.) According to Aloise, the new contracts cover more than 200 drivers and guarantee wages of roughly $60,000 and affordable health insurance.\n\nIn addition to the Teamsters and Unite Here, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has begun organizing workers with the help of the South Bay AFL-CIO Labor Council. SEIU campaigns are underway at two of the largest Silicon Valley security staffing companies, Universal Protection Service and Security Industry Specialists.\n\nNorman Meeks is a Universal Protection Service guard who is working with SEIU to organize his coworkers. Guards, he says, make $10 to $12 an hour with no benefits, except an option to buy into an expensive health insurance plan. Like the other workers keeping Silicon Valley afloat, they earn these near-minimum wages while working in the third-most expensive location in the country.\n\nA tale of two valleys\n\nHousing costs are shooting up in the Bay Area; San Jose\u2019s rents, for example, rose 12 percent in 2014 alone. Even far-flung and once-affordable regions of the Bay Area, like Richmond and Walnut Creek, are growing too expensive for many working-class people. Plan Bay Area, a regional development plan, found that Silicon Valley janitors earn an average of $25,000 a year and spend more than half on housing and transit. Unionizing and negotiating for better pay, Aloise says, may enable some workers to afford to live in Silicon Valley and build lives in the communities where they work.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s income gap also falls along stark racial lines, which is one reason Jesse Jackson has become involved in labor organizing there. Derecka Mehrens of community-labor coalition Working Partnerships USA describes the situation as one of \u201coccupational segregation.\u201d Black and Latino workers are heavily underrepresented among programmers and other top-paid tech personnel, and they\u2019re heavily overrepresented on the flip side of the coin: that is, the people who drive these staffers to work, clean up after them, feed them in lavish corporate cafeterias, and keep them safe. White and Asian workers account for 21 percent of janitorial staff in Silicon Valley, but 91 percent of personnel at Google, according to statistics the company released in 2014\u2014a good barometer for the industry as a whole, as many tech firms are reluctant to disclose diversity data.\n\nThe tech industry defends itself by arguing that it needs to attract skilled coders. With an abundance of jobs to choose from, programmers are enticed by companies with the best packages, including famous perks like Google\u2019s in-house massage therapists.\n\nBut notably, the programming labor force is starting to grow, thanks to numerous tech training programs and the foreign workers brought in on H-1B visas (who are often under-paid and housed in cramped company quarters while they churn out code). Already, software engineers write the bulk of new code, while a large pool of programmers act more like assembly line workers, snapping together lines of pre-existing code. Wages in some sectors of software development are starting to fall as a result of a flooded labor market and a trend of hiring fresh, younger workers who cost less than their experienced counterparts. The infamous brogrammers of Silicon Valley, in other words, may want to consider whether they should be look- ing into union petitions of their own.\n\nReal employees, please stand up\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, some high-profile tech companies are tak- ing steps to improve standards for the workers they hire through staffing agencies. In May, perhaps feeling the heat from the Fight for 15 movement, Facebook announced that it would be mandating a $15 minimum wage and various benefits at contractors and vendors that perform \u201ca substantial amount of work\u201d for Facebook. Other companies are bringing formerly sub-contracted employees in-house, as Google did in October 2014 with its security services and Apple did in March 2015 with its security guards.\n\nBut relying on tech firms to voluntarily promote better working conditions is unwise, says Derecka Mehrens of Working Partnerships USA. Once support workers are moved in-house, tech companies aren\u2019t obliged to meet the terms of the union contracts negotiated with staffing firms, and it\u2019s vanishingly rare for tech firms themselves to be unionized.\n\nLabor lawyer Moshe Marvit also notes that voluntary initiatives like Facebook\u2019s don\u2019t include an oversight mechanism. Indeed, Facebook has yet to give details on whether it has implemented its plan. Unions provide more surety; workers have a contract and a system for reporting violations and filing grievances.\n\nAn NLRB ruling in late August may introduce such oversight mechanisms, whether tech firms like it or not. In Browning-Ferris, the NLRB clarified its standard for whether two companies constitute \u201cjoint employers.\u201d Previously, staffing firms and their clients were only considered joint employers if clients exercised a degree of control over workers, such as requiring background checks or setting hours. Now, the NLRB says, if a client could theoretically exercise control\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s considered a joint employer.\n\nMarvit believes this ruling could have a huge impact on Silicon Valley. Now, companies cannot look the other way on wages and working conditions, and when subcontracted workers unionize, staffing agencies and the firms that use them both have to come to the bargaining table.\n\nAs union campaigns proliferate, the warehouses, breakrooms and cleaning closets of Silicon Valley could be the breeding grounds for something larger. Silicon Valley is the standard-setter in one of the few booming sectors of the economy. The region is a test case for how profits are shared in the 21st century. Will a hugely lucrative industry distribute the wealth to the many who make its success possible, from star visionaries to janitors, or will it continue to concentrate its profits in the hands of the few?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/18367/silicon-valleys-labor-uprising", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/GettyImages-486234020_500_400_s.jpg", "description": "Unions are spreading like wildfire through tech's low-wage workforce", "title": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Labor Uprising"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb54\"", "article_summary": "These are the drivers of the infamous symbols of Silicon Valley\u2019s burgeoning class war: the elite private buses from San Francisco and environs to Silicon Valley.\nAs union campaigns proliferate, the warehouses, breakrooms and cleaning closets of Silicon Valley could be the breeding grounds for something larger.\nSEIU campaigns are underway at two of the largest Silicon Valley security staffing companies, Universal Protection Service and Security Industry Specialists.\nSilicon Valley is the standard-setter in one of the few booming sectors of the economy.\nMarvit believes this ruling could have a huge impact on Silicon Valley."}
