According to one scientist, the decision to significantly cut down would have a bigger impact on our carbon footprints than giving up cars. Now more than ever, the world needs more vegetarians.\n\nBut no one wanted it to happen like this.\n\nMeet the lone star tick, an aggressive species that seeks out its victims and whose bite, scientists believe, can make people severely allergic to red meat. Really. At least 1,500 people in the U.S. have developed the allergy, rarely if ever seen in the general population, to alpha-gal, a sugar found in the organ tissues of pigs, sheep and cows (not to mention deer, squirrels and beavers \u2014 according to a story last year in Al Jazeera, those affected basically have to avoid everything containing or contaminated by mammal products). It can cause hives and swelling, at minimum, along with more severe symptoms of anaphylaxis, like \u201cvomiting, diarrhea, trouble breathing and a drop in blood pressure.\u201d Enough, in other words, to get patients to swear off red meat forever (although in some people, the condition appears to not be permanent).\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new phenomenon, but according to Popular Science, experts believe it\u2019s on the rise \u2014 and moving north. A number of environmental factors could be behind the uptick (sorry) in cases. According to the CDC, the \u201cdistribution, range and abundance\u201d of the lone star tick itself has increased over the past 20 to 30 years.
