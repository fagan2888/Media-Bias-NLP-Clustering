The plaintiff, Alan Lyle Howe, says the state offered heath plans force him to include a fee for abortion coverage even though he is against abortion and will never obtain one. Vermont, along with Rhode Island, New Jersey, Hawaii, don\u2019t allow citizens to opt out of coverage for elective abortion in Obamacare.\n\nHowe refused to enroll and instead filed suit because he believes paying the fee would undermine his public opposition to abortion. His lawyer, Casey Mattox, said, \u201cWe\u2019re putting together legal arguments and we\u2019ll be filing, we expect, in a week. When government is imposing burdens like that on people \u2026 that\u2019s a violation of free exercise, and that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s happening here.\u201d She added that she and her clients were working \u201cin good faith\u201d with all other parties to work toward an outcome other than litigation.\n\nAdditionally, Howe\u2019s lawyers are asking for a solution for Howe and others like him who would be abandoning their beliefs to obtain health care. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), in September 2014, 15 states offered some health insurance options without the elective abortion payment, and eight other states offer plans that do not cover elective abortions.\n\nAs LifeNews previously reported, in 2010 President Obama promised the American people that the Obamacare bill maintained the Hyde Amendment, which ensured that no public funding went to abortion. However, last year the GAO found that taxpayers are funding over a thousand Obamacare health plans that subsidize abortion on demand\u2014even late-term abortion\u2014in defiance of the Hyde Amendment Obama publicly said he would honor.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nHere\u2019s more on Howe\u2019s case:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vermont Man Sues Obama Admin, Forced to Purchase Obamacare Plan Paying for Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "In Vermont, a man has filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Department of Vermont Health Access after they forced him to choose between his pro-life beli", "title": "Vermont Man Sues Obama Admin, Forced to Purchase Obamacare Plan Paying for Abortions", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/02/24/vermont-man-sues-obama-admin-forced-to-purchase-obamacare-plan-paying-for-abortions/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/obamacare14.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "vermont man sues obama admin,forced to purchase obamacare plan paying for abortions", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1db2\"", "article_summary": "Vermont, along with Rhode Island, New Jersey, Hawaii, don\u2019t allow citizens to opt out of coverage for elective abortion in Obamacare.\nIn Vermont, a man has filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Department of Vermont Health Access after they forced him to choose between his pro-life beliefs and insurance coverage.\nHowe refused to enroll and instead filed suit because he believes paying the fee would undermine his public opposition to abortion.\nThe plaintiff, Alan Lyle Howe, says the state offered heath plans force him to include a fee for abortion coverage even though he is against abortion and will never obtain one.\nHowever, last year the GAO found that taxpayers are funding over a thousand Obamacare health plans that subsidize abortion on demand\u2014even late-term abortion\u2014in defiance of the Hyde Amendment Obama publicly said he would honor."}
