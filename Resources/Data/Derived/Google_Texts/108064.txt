Sarah Palin used the classic children's book Green Eggs and Ham that was used last year in a marathon speech by Texas Senator Ted Cruz to protest President Obama's Affordable Care Act.

Ms Palin mocked President Obama saying, "I do not like this, Uncle Sam. I do not like his health care scam."

She also took aim at politicians on Capitol Hill. "I do not like when Congress steals. I do not like their crony deals," she said.

Not content, she also had a few choice words for her opponents in the media.

"I do not like reporters' smug replies when I complain about their lies," she added.

Ms Palin urged women to turn away from the Democratic party and embrace the Republican party's emphasis on small government.



" Women, don't let them use you unless you choose to be their political pawn, or just their piece of accessory on their arm.

"Honey, that's not liberation, that's subjection, and this sisterhood fights against that," she said.
