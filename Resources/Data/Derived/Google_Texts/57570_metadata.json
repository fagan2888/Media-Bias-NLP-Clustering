As U.S. influence in the Middle East diminishes and violence, sectarian strife, economic stagnation and persecution of women and minorities become the tragic reality in most of the region, that relationship increases in value over time. The meeting on Friday between the king of Morocco and President Obama \u2014 in a week dominated by abysmal polling, the Obamacare debacle and the demolition of Senate rules \u2014 gave the White House some positive images and material for upbeat statements. The visit suggests the United States may reap as much from the relationship as does Morocco.\n\nPresident Obama and Moroccan King Mohammed VI at the White House (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nI spoke by phone Friday afternoon with Salaheddine Mezouar, Morocco\u2019s foreign minister. Speaking in French with the aid of a translator, Mezouar told me, \u201cThe purpose of the visit was to chart a new course for our relationship and deepen our relationship.\u201d In the security realm that entails not only \u201ccoordination and sharing of intelligence but also promoting economic development so as to promote more stability\u201d in the region. At a time when isolationist voices in the United States are cheering U.S. retrenchment, Mezouar makes the case for a larger U.S. presence. In Libya, for example, he sees the United States as a critical player in helping \u201cthe central government assert its authority and fight armed factions.\u201d Morocco, plagued by a violent separatist group the Polisario Front, is pleased the United States supports its autonomy plan for the Western Sahara as \u201cserious, credible and realistic\u201d and instrumental in combating the noxious intersection of terrorism, drug and human trafficking.\n\nMorocco, which is undergoing peaceful transformation under the auspices of a reformist king, recently enacted a new constitution designed to solidify rights of women and minorities, bolster an independent judiciary and devolve power back to local governments. Progress is slow, and recent incidents such as the arrest and trial of a journalist for speaking ill of the king, should dispel the notion that transitioning from a traditional society to a modern, constitutional monarchy will be easy. That said, Morocco is one of the few countries moving steadily and peacefully in the right direction while undergoing rapid economic development. Mezouar told me, \u201cThe experience of Morocco as a role model may also serve the U.S. to reach its objectives.\u201d He explained that \u201cMorocco positions itself as a hub, a gateway to Africa,\u201d and therefore a partner for the U.S. in everything from economic development to infrastructure building to improvement in \u201chuman capital.\u201d\n\nIt is an interesting proposition, namely that the United States can promote modernization, greater civil liberties and pro-Western sentiments by helping to make Morocco a success story and in turn partnering with Morocco on areas of common interest. If we lack the wherewithal or ability to influence directly war-torn, impoverished and repressive regimes, we can at the least insure that there is a success story for others to emulate.\n\nMorocco\u2019s constitution, for example, guarantees rights of women, who in Morocco, Mezouar pointed out, have a strong presence in government, the business community and among the entrepreneurial class. \u201cThe challenge for developing counties, \u201d he said, \u201cis to make sure the role of women grows stronger. It [happens] through a network of women and NGO\u2019s and institutions.\u201d Likewise Morocco has made a push for education and training with an emphasis on preparation for the workforce. It has thereby been able to make a dent in unemployment (from 15 to 9 percent) and specifically address youth unemployment (down from 18 to 13 percent).\n\nThere are, I\u2019d suggest, a few lessons to be learned here that apply to the wider Middle East. First, the U.S. presence is essential and must be sustained over time to have any real impact politically and economically. Second, modernization and democratization are long-term propositions; there are no easy, quick and full-proof fixes for countries with sectarian, political, security, economic and social challenges. Third, if we retrench, we diminish our influence and thereby slow progress of countries on the right track; without success stories the ability to improve the lot of those still mired in violence and poverty diminishes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A ray of sunshine in the bleak Middle East, and a rare good-news story for the White House.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A ray of sunshine in the bleak Middle East, and a rare good-news story for the White House.", "title": "Promoting success in the Middle East", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/11/24/promoting-success-in-the-middle-east/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://gdb.voanews.com/381935F3-BA4F-492A-A8C6-023BA9426321_w640_r1_s_cx0_cy3_cw0.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/11/24/promoting-success-in-the-middle-east/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "morocco king and Obama, morocco king visits white house, morocco model of middle east, morocco economy, morocco white house, morocco united states,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "morocco king and Obama, morocco king visits white house, morocco model of middle east, morocco economy, morocco white house, morocco united states,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce09c\"", "article_summary": "There are, I\u2019d suggest, a few lessons to be learned here that apply to the wider Middle East.\nThe visit suggests the United States may reap as much from the relationship as does Morocco.\nAt a time when isolationist voices in the United States are cheering U.S. retrenchment, Mezouar makes the case for a larger U.S. presence.\nThat said, Morocco is one of the few countries moving steadily and peacefully in the right direction while undergoing rapid economic development.\nMorocco\u2019s constitution, for example, guarantees rights of women, who in Morocco, Mezouar pointed out, have a strong presence in government, the business community and among the entrepreneurial class."}
