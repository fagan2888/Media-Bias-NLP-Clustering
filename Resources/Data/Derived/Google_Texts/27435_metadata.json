(AP) - Ken Ensminger is going into this spring with 8.4 million fewer friends.\n\nSince January, the Concordia Parish, Louisiana, beekeeper has seen 42 of his 144 hives die, losing 200,000 bees with each failed hive.\n\n\u201cPesticides are my thinking on what caused it,\u201d Ensminger said. \u201cOne theory is they get out there and get into some kind of chemical, bring it in and put it in our hives where they live with it, and when you look up, they are dead.\u201d\n\nThe deaths highlight increasing challenges for beekeepers, whose industry not only includes cottage operations but often loaning bees to other parts of the country during slow months of the year at home.\n\nFor example, Ensminger ships some of his hives to California every year to help pollinate in the almond groves because of a shortage of bees there.\n\n\u201cEvery bee from the U.S. - everybody - ships to California and it requires two hives per acre,\u201d Ensminger said. \u201cWithout bees, they would make about $600 per acre, whereas with two hives of bees they can make $1,200 to $1,400 per acre.\u201d\n\nThe almond farmers will pay $160 a hive, and it costs approximately $40 to ship it there and back, Ensminger said.\n\nWhile there\u2019s money to be made in renting out bees, there\u2019s also risk, Adams County beekeeper Mac Metcalfe said.\n\n\u201cWhen you go out to California, you are bringing your diseases, and they are bringing their diseases, and you are getting everybody\u2019s diseases from across the United States all flying around in those orchards,\u201d he said.\n\nThe key is getting bees in to do the work and then getting them out, Ensminger said.\n\n\u201cThe ones that don\u2019t get out of there fast, the almond producers go out and spray a fungicide that makes them sick,\u201d he said.\n\nThe value of the bees work in pollination at home - not including their cross-country contributions - can hardly be exaggerated.\n\nAccording to the Mississippi State University Extension Service, honeybees contribute a value to pollination of fruits, berries, vegetables, sunflowers, cotton, soybeans and other plants of more than $200 million annually.\n\nThe bees are likewise important to the pollination of noncommercial plants, making them a key component of the overall ecosystem.\n\nThey\u2019re also facing population challenges. According to the MSU extension service, tracheal and varroa mites have killed thousands of colonies in the last 30 years, and feral bee colonies have seen reductions as well.\n\nWhile pesticides can help keep the mites in check, the fight is getting more difficult as the mite has adapted to overuse of the chemicals, Metcalfe said.\n\n\u201cMost all commercial bee keepers fight these mites with different pesticides, but we have developed and bred and created this super mite that most pesticides won\u2019t kill anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis mite vectors at least 28 viruses, and the one it is most famous for is called deformed wing virus, where when the bees hatch out they have twisted, deformed, gnarly wings that are a third smaller than they should be, and in some occasions the bee will be born with no wings at all, and so what you have is all this effort and resources that have gone into producing and making this bee that can\u2019t perform, so it makes your worker force diminish rather than improve.\u201d\n\nEnsminger and Metcalfe both said commercial corn production likewise presents a challenge for bees.\n\n\u201cCorn and soybeans don\u2019t require bees, but corn is our biggest enemy because they put a pesticide on the seed of the corn, and when it tassels out it has that insecticide on top of the tassel,\u201d Ensminger said. \u201cThey feed it to the larvae in the hive and they die.\u201d\n\nConcordia and Tensas Parishes in Louisiana have a million acres of corn, which self-pollinates, Metcalfe said.\n\nBut - in addition to carrying traces of pesticides - the corn pollen doesn\u2019t provide what the bees need even though they like it, he said.\n\n\u201cCorn pollen can travel for miles and miles and miles,\u201d Metcalfe said, \u201cThese honeybees, their body and the hair follicles on their bodies are static electrically charged like a magnet, so them just flying through the air while the corn pollen is there pick a lot of it up.\n\n\u201cThey take it back to the hive and feed it to the larvae, and as these bees hatch out they basically don\u2019t have the vigor that my bees have right now.\u201d\n\nNationwide, bee losses in recent years have been at 30 percent, Metcalfe said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said.\n\nGood management can help stem losses.\n\nEnsminger said he should be able to split his remaining hives and end the year with 245 hives.\n\nMetcalfe said he\u2019s started the year strong with sustainable hives - and that\u2019s a good thing, not only for the bees but for production.\n\n\u201cYou want your hives strong as they can be around the first of April,\u201d he said. \u201cThe major honey flow runs to about the end of July, and under ideal circumstances you can start pulling honey at the end of April, again at the end of May, the end of June and one last time at the end of September if your bees are strong.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Natchez Democrat, http://www.natchezdemocrat.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ken Ensminger is going into this spring with 8.4 million fewer friends.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/7/mississippi-louisiana-beekeepers-face-big-challeng/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Ken Ensminger is going into this spring with 8.4 million fewer friends.", "title": "Mississippi, Louisiana beekeepers face big challenges"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ken Ensminger is going into this spring with 8.4 million fewer friends.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mississippi, Louisiana beekeepers face big challenges"}, "Author": "VERSHAL HOGAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb40c\"", "article_summary": "The key is getting bees in to do the work and then getting them out, Ensminger said.\nSince January, the Concordia Parish, Louisiana, beekeeper has seen 42 of his 144 hives die, losing 200,000 bees with each failed hive.\nEnsminger said he should be able to split his remaining hives and end the year with 245 hives.\n\u201cEvery bee from the U.S. - everybody - ships to California and it requires two hives per acre,\u201d Ensminger said.\nWhile there\u2019s money to be made in renting out bees, there\u2019s also risk, Adams County beekeeper Mac Metcalfe said."}
