Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, and Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said Boehner won\u2019t be back next year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he runs,\u201d Labrador said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to come back as speaker either,\u201d Salmon added.\n\nBoehner\u2019s spokesman told The Daily Signal that\u2019s not true. \u201cThe speaker has said\u2014publicly and privately\u2014that he intends to be speaker again next year,\u201d Michael Steel said. \u201cThat has not changed.\u201d\n\nBoehner was first elected speaker in 2011 and, despite some opposition, was re-elected in 2013. A recent Politico report revealed some of Boehner\u2019s closest allies already are maneuvering to ensure he has the support if he decides to return in 2015.\n\n\u201cBoehner\u2019s friends are trying to make sure that a small pocket of tea party-aligned Republicans won\u2019t have a chance to derail his speakership next year. And if they try, they could be punished,\u201d Politico\u2019s Jake Sherman reported.\n\nSalmon addressed the report at today\u2019s event: \u201cI think that would be the most boneheaded move. Even making that kind of threat is a boneheaded move.\u201d\n\nBoehner wasn\u2019t the only politician whose future was discussed at Conversations with Conservatives. Asked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s possible presidential candidacy in 2016, Labrador predicted she won\u2019t run. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can win\u2014either in a primary or in a general election.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two outspoken conservative lawmakers predicted John Boehner\u2019s days as House speaker are numbered -- despite an assurance from Boehner that he will return.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two outspoken conservative lawmakers predicted John Boehner\u2019s days as House speaker are numbered -- despite an assurance from Boehner that he will return.", "title": "Conservatives Predict Boehner Won't Be Back as Speaker Next Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-10-SpeakerBoehner-Bluey.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-10T16:15:28+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1hMbTG2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two outspoken conservative lawmakers predicted John Boehner\u2019s days as House speaker are numbered -- despite an assurance from Boehner that he will return.", "creator": "@RobertBluey", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-10-SpeakerBoehner-Bluey.jpg"}, "title": "Conservatives Predict Boehner Won't Be Back as Speaker Next Year", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections", "published_time": "2014-06-10T13:17:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T16:15:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8ec\"", "article_summary": "Asked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s possible presidential candidacy in 2016, Labrador predicted she won\u2019t run.\nIn response to a question at today\u2019s Conversations with Conservatives event on Capitol Hill, Reps.
