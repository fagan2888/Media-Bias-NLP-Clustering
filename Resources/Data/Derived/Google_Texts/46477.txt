CANTON, Mass. (AP) — After going for a walk, a German shepherd puppy owned by a Massachusetts man decided to go for a drive — straight into a pond.

John Costello tells WFXT-TV (http://bit.ly/1pLU4WS ) that his 12-week-old puppy, Rosie, was so excited Sunday after going for a walk at Bolivar Pond in Canton that she jumped in his running car, hit the gear stick and shifted into drive, before falling onto the gas pedal and sending the car careening into the water.

A couple of passers-by saw the commotion and helped Costello rescue Rosie. Nobody was injured, but Costello says the Dodge Neon is a total loss.

The 911 call surprised even police. Officer Robert Quirk says he has never heard of a dog driving into a pond.
