In February 2014, Anheuser-Busch announced the purchase of Blue Point Brewing in Patchogue, New York, for an undisclosed amount (estimated to be about $24 million). Eight months later, it purchased Bend, Oregon's 10 Barrel Brewing, again not disclosing the terms, but with some industry insiders pegging the cost at about $50 million.



The company opened its wallet again in January of this year, this time buying Seattle's Elysian Brewing, for an undisclosed amount.

The purchase of Elysian gave a slight pause to many who thought there may be a regional craft acquisition strategy at work, with the presumption being Anheuser-Busch was looking for a craft brewing presence in each region.

For Steinman, the purchases of 10 Barrel and Elysian went beyond just giving Anheuser Busch a beachhead in the Pacific Northwest.



"They've both been very weak markets for Anheuser-Busch, they have a very low market share there," he said. "If you look at the IRI data, the hottest craft brewer last year was 10 Barrel in Portland, and in Seattle, it was Elysian. So they can get a couple share points and hot brands in markets where they are struggling."



The spending spree has certainly gotten the attention of the beer business, with craft breweries looking at Anheuser-Busch's involvement with trepidationâ€”a fear Goeler says is misguided.

"The number one principle is to make sure that we let them maintain their culture, their authenticity, so we're not buying them to make them into Anheuser-Busch companies," he said. "We're buying them for who they are and what they've achieved and what they've done in the world of beer."

Goeler said his company's activity in the craft space benefits both the craft beer segment and the beer business as a whole.



"We are getting craft beers to more consumers than probably anybody in the U.S.," said Goeler. "We are able to bring resources to these companies and help them reach and get more people interested in the industry."
