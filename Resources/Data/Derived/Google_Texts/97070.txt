The relationship eventually led to an ugly lawsuit, but the Dixie Chicks’ big break was being signed to Sony Music Entertainment, so it’s no wonder singer Natalie Maines can joke that the North Koreans would have made a great manager for the band.

With Sony now pulling “The Interview” from release in the face of alleged terrorist threats from hackers working for North Korea, Maines is trolling Sony hard.
