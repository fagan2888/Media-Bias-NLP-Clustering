Nearly 19 years later, creator Bill Watterson has brought his work back to the funny pages. The best part? Millions of readers had no idea.\n\nThis week, Watterson was a secret guest artist on the comic strip Pearls Before Swine, written and illustrated by Stephan Pastis. In the series, Pastis, as a character in his own strip, meets a second-grader named Libby, who thinks Pastis draws like crap and offers to take over Pearls for a while.\n\nThen, like one of Calvin\u2019s fantasies, a random martian robot attack interrupts the narrative. Alligators eat the cartoonist. Libby gets bored and leaves. \u201cThere\u2019s a magical world out there,\u201d she says.\n\nFans, of course, started to get suspicious. \u201cThere are definitely some Wattersonian touches \u2026 and the complaint about the lack of space in modern comic strips that serves as the punchline sure does sound like Watterson,\u201d Paul Constant analyzed on the Stranger Friday.\n\nThat \u201cmagical world\u201d line is how Calvin signed off, too. Libby\u2019s complaint about needing more space to work within reflects Watterson\u2019s push to have his series printed in full size on Sundays. And Libby, or Lib, is \u201cBill\u201d backward.\n\nWatterson made Pastis promise not to reveal anything until the project was over. But on Monday, the younger cartoonist couldn\u2019t help but tease something incredible. On Saturday morning, he finally revealed all on his blog.\n\nPastis reveals how the project came together:\n\nI \u2026 thanked [Watterson] for all his great work and the influence he\u2019d had on me. And never expected to get a reply. And what do you know, he wrote back. Let me tell you. Just getting an email from Bill Watterson is one of the most mind-blowing, surreal experiences I have ever had. Bill Watterson really exists? And he sends email? And he\u2019s communicating with me? But he was. And he had a great sense of humor about the strip I had done, and was very funny, and oh yeah\u2026. \u2026He had a comic strip idea he wanted to run by me. Now if you had asked me the odds of Bill Watterson ever saying that line to me, I\u2019d say it had about the same likelihood as Jimi Hendrix telling me he had a new guitar riff. And yes, I\u2019m aware Hendrix is dead. So I wrote back to Bill. \u201cDear Bill, I will do whatever you want, including setting my hair on fire.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The remarkable story of the unremarkable fan letter that lured the elusive \"Calvin and Hobbes\" genius out of hiding", "author": "Cooper Fleishman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The remarkable story of the unremarkable fan letter that lured the elusive \"Calvin and Hobbes\" genius out of hiding", "title": "How Bill Watterson made his secret return to comics", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/12/how_bill_watterson_made_his_secret_return_to_comics_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dear_mr_watterson2-620x412.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The remarkable story of the unremarkable fan letter that lured the elusive \"Calvin and Hobbes\" genius out of hiding", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dear_mr_watterson2-620x412.jpg", "title": "How Bill Watterson made his secret return to comics", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How Bill Watterson made his secret return to comics", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bill watterson, Calvin and Hobbes, Comics, Fantasy, the daily dot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4409\"", "article_summary": "Topics: bill watterson, Calvin and Hobbes, Comics, Fantasy, the daily dotThis article originally appeared on The Daily DotOn Dec. 31, 1995, Calvin and Hobbes rode off on a sled.\nJust getting an email from Bill Watterson is one of the most mind-blowing, surreal experiences I have ever had.\nThis week, Watterson was a secret guest artist on the comic strip Pearls Before Swine, written and illustrated by Stephan Pastis.\nNearly 19 years later, creator Bill Watterson has brought his work back to the funny pages.\nBill Watterson really exists?"}
