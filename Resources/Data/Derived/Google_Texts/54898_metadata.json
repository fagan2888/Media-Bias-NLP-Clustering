And it all centered around the pitcher who mowed down the Rockies over eight elite innings Saturday.\n\nThe Reds on Sunday traded Cueto, after some apparent fits and starts, to the Kansas City Royals for three left-handed pitching prospects: Brandon Finnegan, John Lamb and Cody Reed. Finnegan and Lamb will report to Cincy\u2019s Triple-A affiliate in Nashville. Reed heads to the Double-A Pensacola Blue Wahoos.\n\nWalt Jocketty, the Reds\u2019 president and general manager, stood in front of Rockies logo wallpaper in a last-minute press conference before Sunday\u2019s game, explaining the trade and how it went down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough trade to make. Johnny\u2019s been a part of the organization a long time. We have great affection for him. So it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Jocketty said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in a position where this is the best thing for our franchise right now. We got three quality left-handed pitchers we think very highly of.\u201d\n\nLike Troy Tulowitzki with the Rockies, Cueto has only ever played for the Reds in his eight big-league seasons. But Cincinnati, with Cueto\u2019s contract up at the end of the year, found an option to, they hope, rebuild their rotation with young arms. They didn\u2019t hesitate trading their ace with less than a week to go before baseball\u2019s trade deadline.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of interest in Johnny. We felt this was the best value we could get for him,\u201d Jocketty said. \u201cAnd Johnny is going to a great situation there. He\u2019s got a team that has a chance to go to a World Series.\u201d\n\nJocketty said the Reds were talking to two other clubs, beyond the Royals, until late last night, after Cueto threw eight four-hit innings against the Rockies.\n\nCueto told the Cincinnati Enquirer \u2014 in a fascinating behind-the-scenes account \u2014 that he thought he\u2019d been traded before Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIt was really bad the way I found out what happened. My head went around the whole way. My thoughts were all over the place,\u201d Cueto told the Enquirer. \u201cIt was something really bad.\u201d\n\nReds manager Bryan Price on Sunday tried to quell the confusion, insisting that at no time was Cueto told by management that he\u2019d been traded.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to talk about this stuff,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt\u2019s the sick underbelly of the trade deadline, especially in the last week.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday at Coors Field, outside the visitors clubhouse, Cueto had part of himself in Denver, in Cincinnati and in Kansas City.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a good trade. But I\u2019m very sad,\u201d said Cueto, who will join the Royals on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI understand it\u2019s part of the game. I\u2019m excited about my next step\u2026 (The Royals) have a great team. I know they play baseball very well. It\u2019s going to be good for my career and for the team.\u201d\n\nThe Royals, already among the World Series contenders, added a top-line pitcher.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best pitchers in the game,\u201d Tulowitzki said Saturday.\n\nThe Rockies, meanwhile, have remained quiet with the trade deadline nearing. All-star third baseman Nolan Arenado told The Denver Post:\n\n\u201cI truly believe we need to go get someone. We need a big dude, I think. We need a certified ace.\u201d\n\nWith no Cueto-level pitchers on their way to Colorado, here\u2019s how the Rockies rotation shapes up for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cincinnati Reds,Coors Field,Johnny Cueto,Kansas City Royals,Royals,Troy Tulowitzki", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Johnny Cueto walked into the Cincinnati Reds clubhouse Sunday morning at Coors Field and said: \"Have I been traded yet?\" He then put on his Reds uniform.", "title": "Johnny Cueto traded from Reds to Royals in strange scene at Coors Field", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/07/26/johnny-cueto-traded-from-reds-to-royals-in-strange-scene-at-coors-field/20512/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/07/johnny-cueto-495x358.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Johnny Cueto walked into the Cincinnati Reds clubhouse Sunday morning at Coors Field and said: \"Have I been traded yet?\" He then put on his Reds uniform.", "title": "Johnny Cueto traded from Reds to Royals in strange scene at Coors Field", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/07/26/johnny-cueto-traded-from-reds-to-royals-in-strange-scene-at-coors-field/20512/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/07/johnny-cueto-495x358.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Johnny Cueto walked into the Cincinnati Reds clubhouse Sunday morning at Coors Field and said: \"Have I been traded yet?\" He then put on his Reds uniform."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdca6\"", "article_summary": "Johnny Cueto walked into the Cincinnati Reds clubhouse Sunday morning at Coors Field and said: \u201cHave I been traded yet?\u201d He then put on his Reds uniform.\nThe Reds on Sunday traded Cueto, after some apparent fits and starts, to the Kansas City Royals for three left-handed pitching prospects: Brandon Finnegan, John Lamb and Cody Reed.\nCueto told the Cincinnati Enquirer \u2014 in a fascinating behind-the-scenes account \u2014 that he thought he\u2019d been traded before Saturday\u2019s game.\nMy thoughts were all over the place,\u201d Cueto told the Enquirer.\nA strange scene unfolded in Denver before the Rockies and Reds finished a three-game series."}
