Only one person raised their hand.\n\nBut when asked who had seen their premiums or deductibles increased, many did. Bachmann said her family\u2019s premiums and deductibles had quadrupled.\n\nShe said the GOP\u2019s success in winning a special congressional election this month in Florida proves that opposition to Obamacare can be a winning message. \u201cThat was a bellwether,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nBlasts Clinton, calls for GOP to oppose any immigration bill\n\nBachmann emphasized her support for any lawsuit aimed at blocking some of Obama\u2019s actions and called for Congress to stand firm against any immigration bill \u2014 which she said would amount to granting \u201camnesty\u2019\u2019 for illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe last thing Republicans should be doing is helping this president pass the signature issue of his second term, which is amnesty,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is craziness for Republicans to be doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t work is combining open borders with a welfare state,\u201d she said.\n\nBachmann also took aim at the perceived Democratic front-runner for president in 2016 \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 and predicted that the former senator and secretary of state will find that her bid won\u2019t \u201cbe quite the cakewalk\u2019\u2019 that Democrats believe.\n\nAmong other things, Bachmann declared that Clinton is \u201cthe godmother of Obamacare\u2019\u2019 because of her unsuccessful effort in the 1990s, to help her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, revamp the nation\u2019s health insurance system.\n\nBachmann asserted that Clinton should shoulder some of the blame for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to seize Crimea from neighboring Ukraine. \u201cWho is it who handed the Russian president the \u2018reset button?\u2019 \u201d asked Bachmann, contending that Clinton had been too accommodating to Putin.\n\nAnd most of all, in Bachmann's opinion, Clinton deserves much of the blame for the violence at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012 that resulted in the death of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.\n\nBachmann repeated the longstanding GOP contention that Clinton had ignored requests for more security at the Benghazi compound.\n\nAs for herself, Bachmann \u2014 a devout Christian \u2014 said she was praying to God about what her political future should be. She has decided not to run for re-election this fall, saying the Lord told her it was time for her to leave Congress.\n\nStill, Bachmann plans to remain in the political arena. \"I'm not done, I want to stay fully engaged in the national marketplace of ideas,'' she said.\n\nIn response to audience questions, Bachmann recounted at length her concerns about religious violence around the world. She asserted that \"the persecution of Christian and Jews across the world today is higher than ever.\"\n\nBachmann added that the religious threats weren't just overseas. \"You see a tremendous rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses across the United States,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann \u2014 a favorite of the national tea party movement \u2014 was in the St. Louis area Saturday to exhort fellow social", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/bachmann-calls-gop-repeal-obamacare-block-immigration-changes", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201403/Bachmann2014.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann \u2014 a favorite of the national tea party movement \u2014 was in the St. Louis area Saturday to exhort fellow social", "title": "Bachmann Calls For GOP To Repeal Obamacare, Block Immigration Changes"}, "story_id": 293229640, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Bachmann Calls For GOP To Repeal Obamacare, Block Immigration Changes"}, "nid": 34656, "datePublished": "2014-03-23", "keywords": "Michele Bachmann", "wordCount": 856, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act \u201cis not sustainable, it is redistribution of wealth,\u2019\u2019 Bachmann said, citing the program\u2019s subsidies for low- and moderate-income people.\nAt the luncheon, held at the Deer Creek Club, Bachmann asked if anyone in the room had lost their insurance because of Obamacare.\nBachmann repeated the longstanding GOP contention that Clinton had ignored requests for more security at the Benghazi compound.\n\u201cWho is it who handed the Russian president the \u2018reset button?\u2019 \u201d asked Bachmann, contending that Clinton had been too accommodating to Putin.\nBachmann asserted that Clinton should shoulder some of the blame for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to seize Crimea from neighboring Ukraine."}
