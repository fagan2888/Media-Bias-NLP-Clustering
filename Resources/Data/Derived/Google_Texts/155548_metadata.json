The economic recovery that followed the Great Recession and continued strong job growth may have combined to shield Americans from some unpleasant truths about the country\u2019s fiscal future.\n\nUniversity of California-Berkeley economist Alan J. Auerbach and Brookings Institution economist William G. Gale have published a new paper that runs the numbers on the federal debt and deficit over the medium-term and long-term. Not only is the picture they paint not a pretty one but it has become dramatically worse in just the past few months.\n\nRelated: Trump-onomics Would Blow a Huge Hole in the Federal Budget\n\n\u201cOver the past year\u2026the medium- and long-term fiscal outlooks have deteriorated,\u201d they write. \u201cPart of this is due to legislative changes, part to changes in economic and technical factors and a small part to changes in assumptions. This deterioration has happened without much fanfare and, even with a fall in projected interest rates working in the other direction, the estimated changes are large.\u201d\n\nFor instance, looking at the same data in September, Gale and Auerbach predicted that the country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from 76.6 percent to 81 percent by the year 2025 \u2013 the end of the 10-year \u201cbudget window\u201d used for most analyses of federal spending. Revisiting the data today, they find that the projected ratio in 2025 has jumped to 91 percent.\n\n\u201cThe trends underlying the 10\u2013year projections are familiar,\u201d they write. \u201cRevenues hover at about 18 percent of GDP. Total spending is projected to rise by almost 3 percentage points of GDP\u2014with entitlements accounting for about 1.7 percentage points of the increase and net interest for 1.9 percentage points, with discretionary spending declining by about 0.6 percent of GDP.\u201d\n\nEven recent signs that the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee is recalibrating its approach to normalizing interest rates doesn\u2019t hold much promise for improvement, they found.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan\u2019s Three Perilous Paths to a Budget Deal\n\n\u201cLower interest rates, of course, reduce net interest payments, but even with flat interest rates, the fiscal situation is headed in the wrong direction,\u201d they said. Even after adjusting their model to consider the impact of flat interest rates for the next 25 years, the gap between projected spending and revenue needed just to maintain the status quo on debt-to-GDP is 1.8 percent of GDP.\n\n\u201cThus, while low interest rates may reduce net interest payments in the near term, they do not put federal debt on a sustainable path,\u201d Auerbach and Gale write.\n\nLong term, the trend is even worse. \u201cThe debt-to GDP ratio rises from 93.6 percent in 2026, hits 100 percent in 2028, exceeds the previous all-time high of 106 percent in 2030, and rises to 156 percent by 2041\u2014 25 years from now.\u201d\n\nFixing the problem, they point out, will require a legislative effort unlike anything Congress has been willing or able to accomplish in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe necessary adjustments will be large relative to those adopted under recent legislation,\u201d they write. \u201cMoreover, the most optimistic long-run projections already incorporate the effects of success at \u2018bending the curve\u2019 of health care cost growth, so further measures will clearly be needed.\u201d\n\nThey conclude the paper with the note, \u201cThese changes, however, relate to the medium- and long-term deficits, not the short-term deficit.\u201d\n\nWhile innocuous at first glance, that little aside points to one of the biggest obstacles in the way of serious fiscal reform right now: in a political environment in which Congress consistently avoids acting on problems until the last possible moment, marshalling the legislative firepower necessary to solve major problems whose impact won\u2019t be felt for years seems to be beyond the abilities of our lawmakers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As presidential candidates focus on border walls, dirty tricks and massive increases i", "title": "Presidential Candidates are Ignoring the Economy's Most Ominous Statistic", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/23/Here-s-Real-Problem-Candidates-Could-Address-Our-Fiscal-Meltdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07292013_Dollar_Signs_Map_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/23/Here-s-Real-Problem-Candidates-Could-Address-Our-Fiscal-Meltdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07292013_Dollar_Signs_Map_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As presidential candidates focus on border walls, dirty tricks and massive increases i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Paul Ryan\u2019s Three Perilous Paths to a Budget Deal\u201cLower interest rates, of course, reduce net interest payments, but even with flat interest rates, the fiscal situation is headed in the wrong direction,\u201d they said.\n\u201cPart of this is due to legislative changes, part to changes in economic and technical factors and a small part to changes in assumptions.\n\u201cThus, while low interest rates may reduce net interest payments in the near term, they do not put federal debt on a sustainable path,\u201d Auerbach and Gale write.\nRelated: Trump-onomics Would Blow a Huge Hole in the Federal Budget\u201cOver the past year\u2026the medium- and long-term fiscal outlooks have deteriorated,\u201d they write.\n\u201cThe necessary adjustments will be large relative to those adopted under recent legislation,\u201d they write."}
