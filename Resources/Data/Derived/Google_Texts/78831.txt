Four years after an unprecedented EF5 tornado leveled its hospital in Joplin, Missouri, Mercy Health System is on the verge of once again operating on the site.

The $335 million Mercy Hospital Joplin is slated to open on March 22, replacing the former St. John's hospital that was destroyed by the 2011 storm. The tornado left St. John's unusable due to the extent of the damage: Windows were blown out, walls crumbled and tons of equipment was destroyed. However, the new hospital was built to resist that kind of damage, with a stronger concrete shell, storm-resistant windows and power generators to keep it running in the event of another disaster. Owners said the new 875,00-square-foot hospital could withstand a hit from an EF3 tornado or greater.

"The bold commitment by Mercy leaders to rebuild the hospital and keep co-workers employed inspired Joplin residents and businesses and helped spur a city-wide recovery," the operators wrote in an announcement posted on their website. "Mercy has exceeded its commitment with a hospital that builds on the ministry's tradition of compassion with advances available only through Mercy's forward thinking health care system."
