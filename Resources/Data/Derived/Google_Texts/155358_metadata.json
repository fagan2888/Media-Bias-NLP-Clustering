We\u2019ll have two good days of practice (Saturday) and Monday to kind of figure that out. Definitely (we) are going to have to inject some more energy to start out the games.\u201d\n\nFaried has not started either of the Nuggets\u2019 first two games as he worked his way back from a hamstring injury and got caught up on learning the offensive sets he missed while sitting out practice. Faried has said he\u2019s been ready to go since he was cleared to play by team doctors before the season opener at Sacramento.\n\nFriday night, however, he showed he was at least back to his old self from an energy standpoint as he and Nate Robinson helped spark a comeback that shaved a 26-point Portland lead down to seven before the Nuggets fell to their second defeat.\n\n\u201cHe showed that he\u2019s back up to speed, and that\u2019s one of the positions I\u2019ll look at over the next two days of maybe making a change,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nThe other position where Shaw might consider a change is small forward, where Anthony Randolph has started each of the first two games. But options there are limited. That\u2019s the position Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari play. Both are out with injuries, but Chandler is eyeing a possible return late this week.\n\nOther than that, ironing out the details is the Nuggets\u2019 charge going into a tough Tuesday matchup against San Antonio.\n\nThe team talked about that in a Saturday morning film session.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the perfection of minor details, and once again when we did things the way we were supposed to do them, then we usually got a pretty good result,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cAnd when we didn\u2019t and went off on our own or kind of did our own thing, we didn\u2019t get a good result.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kenneth Faried may return to Nuggets\u2019 starting lineup", "title": "Kenneth Faried may return to Nuggets\u2019 starting lineup", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/02/kenneth-faried-may-return-to-nuggets-starting-lineup/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131102__20131103_CC6_SP03BKNNUGGSp1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131102__20131103_CC6_SP03BKNNUGGSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-02T20:03:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:40:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd732c\"", "article_summary": "After two games and seemingly a million lineups, player combinations and headaches that have accompanied it all, Nuggets coach Brian Shaw is considering, well, another lineup change.\nOther than that, ironing out the details is the Nuggets\u2019 charge going into a tough Tuesday matchup against San Antonio.\nFaried has said he\u2019s been ready to go since he was cleared to play by team doctors before the season opener at Sacramento.\nThis one deals with the starters, and mostly boils down to the power forward spot, where he\u2019s pondering whether it\u2019s time to get Kenneth Faried back among the opening five.\nThe other position where Shaw might consider a change is small forward, where Anthony Randolph has started each of the first two games."}
