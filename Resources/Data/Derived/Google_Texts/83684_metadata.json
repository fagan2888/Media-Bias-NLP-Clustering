To this day, they haven\u2019t been able to get a collection agency off their back.\n\n\n\nMartinez, one of five children, said that when she went to the Ventura County Human Services Agency a few months ago to apply for Medi-Cal -- the state\u2019s name for the health insurance program for low-income people known as Medicaid in the rest of the nation -- she was told that she only qualified for restricted Medi-Cal because of her DACA status. Restricted Medi-Cal covers only emergency and pregnancy-related care and is given to most anyone who applies for Medi-Cal.\n\n\n\nSacramento DACA student Bernardina Garcia said she\u2019s been on tenterhooks for months because she\u2019s waiting to learn if she\u2019s approved for Medi-Cal. She applied for it back in January with help from a children\u2019s health care advocacy worker. The 21-year-old Sacramento State student said she\u2019s tired of trying home remedies for her recurring ear infection because they only provide her temporary relief.\n\n\n\nMartinez and Garcia are among an estimated 125,000 young people between 15 and 30 years old in California who became eligible for Medi-Cal when they were granted temporary legal presence and work authorization under a 2012 presidential initiative known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\n\n\nA slew of challenges has kept hundreds of thousands of DACA students like Martinez and Garcia from getting a coveted Medi-Cal card. Obstacles include onerous paperwork requirements, ignorance among many county eligibility workers that DACA beneficiaries are eligible for state-funded Medi-Cal and the state\u2019s new consumer-oriented web portal known as CalHEERS.\n\n\n\nUndocumented immigrants are legally prohibited from enrolling in the Affordable Care Act. But California\u2019s Medi-Cal program authorizes coverage for certain groups of people who are lawfully present in the United States such as those approved for the DACA program. The cost is funded not by federal resources, but through state funds. Even so, a DACA applicant must meet the income eligibility stipulated in traditional Medi-Cal: the individual\u2019s annual income should be less than $15,856, or $26,951 for a family of three.\n\n\n\nCalifornia currently has a backlog of 900,000 Medi-Cal applications waiting to be processed. No one knows how many of those have been filed by DACA beneficiaries. And scores of DACA youth themselves still don\u2019t know they even qualify for Medi-Cal, according to a University of California study published in March this year. The study shows that Latinos make up about 82 percent of DACA recipients and about 60 percent of the 7 million uninsured Californians.\n\n\n\nObstacles in getting Medi-Cal\n\n\n\nMaria Romero-Mora, a program coordinator with California Coverage and Health Initiatives (CCHI), has been helping DACA beneficiaries in seven of California\u2019s 58 counties to apply for Medi-Cal. She said the new, complex 35-page paper form (it was six pages long earlier) intimidates many first time applicants, who also have to fill out an accompanying so-called MC 13 form that asks, among other things, for the applicant\u2019s social security number and tax filing status of the parents -- if the applicant is filing as a dependent.\n\n\n\nCCHI\u2019s Executive Director Suzie Shupe said parents who file a Medi-Cal application on behalf of their DACA children are understandably nervous when they go before county officials.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that people are leery of revealing their status in an official setting,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine how it must be for them,\u201d Romero-Mora observed, \u201cthey don\u2019t speak the language. They are very shy and nervous about authority. If they say anything wrong, their application won\u2019t be processed. Or their immigration status might be jeopardized.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe said that her clients worry that anything they say might come back to bite them even though the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency said in a memorandum issued last October that information provided by individuals for health coverage will not be used for purposes other than \u201cverifying certain eligible determinations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if she had been afraid of revealing her immigration status on her Medi-Cal application form, Garcia, a client of Romero-Mora\u2019s, responded: \u201cThere\u2019s always that fear deep down that immigration officials might come after my parents.\u201d\n\n\n\nCounty workers in the dark about eligibility\n\n\n\nExacerbating the problem for DACA students is that many county eligibility workers are not aware that DACA beneficiaries are eligible for state-funded Medi-Cal.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard reports from several counties that information has not gotten out to them,\u201d asserted Shupe, noting: \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a problem here and there.\u201d\n\n\n\nRomero-Mora cited her own experience last April when she got a call from a Solano County worker, who said that while she and her peers became aware through the CCHI website that DACA recipients were eligible for Medi-Cal, \u201cour supervisors are telling us they are not.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a result, scores of DACA beneficiaries in a number of counties are being notified that they would only get restricted Medi-Cal benefits.\n\n\n\nTanya Broder, a staff attorney with the National Immigrant Law Center said she was not surprised that this was happening. Counties, she said, need to be educated.\n\n\n\nBetzebel Estudillo, health policy coordinator with the California Immigrant Policy Center, said that she has heard from health care advocates that a number of DACA students in the Inland Empire were turned away by eligibility workers from applying for Medi-Cal when they went on their own.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has been an issue for many months and has yet to be resolved,\u201d noted Frank Mecca, executive director of County Welfare Director\u2019s Association (CWDA) of California. He said the state\u2019s new computer system, known as CALHEERS, \u201cdoes not recognize the DACA status and is only providing restricted Medi-Cal benefits rather than full-scope benefits.\u201d\n\n\n\nMecca said that given how quickly \u201cthe landscape for implementing the Affordable Care Act has evolved,\u201d his agency has been providing guidance and technical information to counties.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut often times,\u201d he lamented, \u201cspecific implementation direction has not been released in a timely manner to allow counties to serve clients to the best of (the) counties\u2019 ability. To date, the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) has not issued formal policy on Medi-Cal eligibility for DACA youth.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnthony Cava, a spokesman with the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), acknowledged that such technological problems as the \u201cneeded interfaces\u201d between the state and county computer systems did contribute to the delays. He said the DHCS is \u201cworking actively\u201d to improve the system.\n\n\n\nHe added that counties are allowed 45 days to process applications.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable for the state and the county to not have the capacity to process Medi-Cal applications,\u201d asserted CCHI\u2019s Shupe.\n\n\n\nDACA student Martinez meanwhile said she is so discouraged by her experience at Ventura County that she doesn\u2019t plan to reapply any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "daca, medical, undocumented health care, immigrant health care", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
