His reasoning cleanly framed the alternative to the moral code endorsed by Swartz, Manning and Snowden. \"For society to function well,\" he wrote, \"there have to be basic levels of trust and cooperation, a respect for institutions and deference to common procedures. By deciding to unilaterally leak secret N.S.A. documents, Snowden has betrayed all of these things.\"...The former United States ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, argued that Snowden \"thinks he's smarter and has a higher morality than the rest of us...that he can see clearer than other 299,999,999 of us, and therefore he can do what he wants. I say that is the worst form of treason.\"\n\n\n\nFor the leaker and whistleblower the answer to Bolton is that there can be no expectation that the system will act morally of its own accord. Systems are optimized for their own survival and preventing the system from doing evil may well require breaking with organizational niceties, protocols or laws. It requires stepping outside of one\u2019s assigned organizational role. The chief executive is not in a better position to recognize systemic evil than is a middle level manager or, for that matter, an IT contractor. Recognizing systemic evil does not require rank or intelligence, just honesty of vision.\n\nBonus link: Ludlow starred in this old Reason story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The necessity of civil disobedience.", "title": "The Individual's Moral Code vs. the Bureaucracy's Moral Code", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/09/16/the-individuals-moral-code-vs-the-bureau", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2013_09/bolton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Peter Ludlow has a \nfine essay in The New York Times about whistleblowing,\ncivil disobedience, the logic of large bureaucracies, and what he\ncalls \"attempts to condemn, support, demonize, psychoanalyze and in\nsome cases canonize figures like Aaron Swartz, Jeremy Hammond,\nChelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.\" You should read the whole\nthing, but here's an excerpt:", "title": "The Individual's Moral Code vs. the Bureaucracy's Moral Code", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2013_09/bolton.jpg", "creator": "@notjessewalker", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2013-09-16T16:09:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/jesse-walker"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d8a\"", "article_summary": "His reasoning cleanly framed the alternative to the moral code endorsed by Swartz, Manning and Snowden.\nThe chief executive is not in a better position to recognize systemic evil than is a middle level manager or, for that matter, an IT contractor.\nRecognizing systemic evil does not require rank or intelligence, just honesty of vision.\nSystems are optimized for their own survival and preventing the system from doing evil may well require breaking with organizational niceties, protocols or laws.\n\"For society to function well,\" he wrote, \"there have to be basic levels of trust and cooperation, a respect for institutions and deference to common procedures."}
