SAN DIEGO (AP) — “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” launched a full-scale assault on Comic-Con.

The cast and crew from the final installment of “The Hobbit” trilogy showed off the first trailer for the fantasy film at the pop-culture convention, as well as a blooper reel from both “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” movies.

Stephen Colbert, dressed as the shaggy-haired character he cameoed as in “The Hobbit,” enthusiastically moderated Friday’s panel at the San Diego Convention Center.

The trailer conjured up for the audience of 6,500 attendees gathered inside Hall H showed the dragon Smaug setting Lake-town ablaze, Cate Blanchett’s royal elf Galadriel kissing the forehead of Ian McKellen’s beleaguered wizard Gandalf and legions of elves and orcs racing into battle.

“That was really just for you, Stephen,” filmmaker Peter Jackson said to the talk show host and J.R.R. Tolkien super-fan. “I mean, these other people are here, as well.”

Jackson was joined by several cast members for Friday’s celebration of all things “Hobbit,” including Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, Evangeline Lilly, Luke Evans and Lee Pace.
