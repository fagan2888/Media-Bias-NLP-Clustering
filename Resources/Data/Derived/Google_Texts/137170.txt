Arctic air swept across New Jersey overnight, putting the state into a deep freeze. Today will be a bit warmer – but it will take another day to get above the freezing mark.

Forecasters and officials have warned everybody to stay warm, stay inside and take precautions as a polar vortex – a system which normally keeps the harshest cold air in Siberia – has enveloped the continental United States.

So far, the state has weathered the cold blast. A scattered handful of accidents are reported by the state Department of Transportation this morning.

The three metro airports, including Newark Liberty International, are all “playing catch-up” today, said Ron Marsico, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

NJ Transit is running almost entirely back on schedule, said John Durso, Jr., an agency spokesman. Up to 30-minute delays are in effect on Atlantic City-line trains, because of switching problems – and to the north, overnight trains were unable to stop at the Newark Airport stop because a water main break had frozen over the platform, D’Urso said. Travelers were diverted to Newark Penn Station, where they hopped a bus for the airport, he said.

Power outages have been few. PSE&G, the state's largest utility, is reporting scattered outages throughout its system as of 8 a.m., with the biggest concentration in Burlington County, which has more than 100, according to the company’s online listing of outages. JCP&L was reporting between 500 and 1,500 outages in Toms River this morning, and the cause was still being investigated, the company said.

Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency during the winter storm - and that remains in place this morning.

High temperatures are expected to rise into the 20s today, with further warming above freezing predicted for Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. However, another shock of cold is expected to drive temperatures down into the single-digits again Monday night.
