It\u2019s unfortunate because it\u2019s an update on protections for Americans of all stripes. It lays out the administration\u2019s plan and it deserves more attention.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese regulations include provisions for EPA greenhouse emissions standards, FDA tobacco regulations on distribution and advertising, furniture flammability standards (yeah\u2026), and many others.\n\nThis is not the first time this year that this has happened, as the administration released their spring 2014 regulatory agenda right before Memorial Day.\n\nAlso, just recently, amid all the fuss over immigration, the Obama administration released an executive order, which extends direct combat roles of troops in Afghanistan through to 2015, despite the President\u2019s promises to pull out combat troops this year.\n\nUnfortunately, this type of secretive and surprising behavior has been typical of this administration.
