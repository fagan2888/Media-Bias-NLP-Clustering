Then, anyone found to harbor any alleged mental disorder, including children as young as eight, should undergo \u201ctherapy,\u201d often including powerful psychotropic medications that experts say have dubious value but often come with well-documented and highly dangerous side effects.\n\nYour ObamaCare plan will be forced to pay for it, whether you want it or not, thanks to the federal government's commandeering of the health-insurance industry under the so-called Affordable Care Act. And eventually, younger and younger children will be in Big Brother's crosshairs for mental and behavioral health \u201cservices,\u201d whether parents want it or not. School teachers, social workers, and more are all already being enlisted in the federal government's search for supposed \u201cmental and behavioral health\u201d issues \u2014 a list that is perpetually expanding as psychiatrists invent new \u201cillnesses.\u201d The outcry against the federal government's obsession with your mind and the minds of America's children, though, is growing louder, as critics call the agenda \u201cdepressing\u201d and worry whether it is another scheme to disarm more Americans.\n\nThe controversial \u201crecommendations\u201d include screening all Americans between the ages of 12 and 18 for depression. A separate but related recommendation seeks to have all U.S. adults checked for \u201cmental illness,\u201d too. And consider that the list of \u201cillnesses\u201d is subjective (homosexuality was a mental disorder a few decades ago) and is constantly expanding as psychiatrists vote to create new ones, literally, as part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \u2014 the \u201cBible\u201d of psychiatry that has been widely criticized, even by leading psychiatrists.\n\nThe latest demands come from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF. The influential outfit, appointed by the Obama administration's increasingly radical Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recommends various unconstitutional federal health policies for Big Brother to decree into pseudo-law via regulation.\n\nIts latest recommendations for children and adolescents 12 and older were published earlier this month in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \u201cThe USPSTF recommends screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years,\u201d the HHS task force said in the summary of its position. \u201cScreening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up.\u201d Why the federal government believes it has any business coming between patients and doctors \u2014 or where it believes the constitutional authority for such meddling is found \u2014 was not immediately clear.\n\nThe outfit also left the door open for recommending such \u201cscreening\u201d for children under 12, too. \u201cThe USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for MDD in children aged 11 years and younger,\u201d the Obama HHS panel wrote. The recommendations also call for using controversial medications such as Prozac to drug children between 12 and 17, while advocating powerful psychotropic substances such as Lexapro for children as young as eight.\n\nAlready, about one in 10 American school-aged boys has been labeled and drugged under the guise of \u201cAttention Deficit Disorder\u201d (ADD) and \u201cAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\u201d (ADHD). However, even the late Dr. Leon Eisenberg, often described as the \u201cfather\u201d or \u201cinventor\u201d of the diagnosis, said before his death in an interview with German magazine Der Spiegel that the alleged disease was \u201ca prime example of a fabricated disorder.\u201d With the list of \u201cdisorders\u201d expanding rapidly, and with that list labeling more and more normal behaviors as symptoms of alleged illness, critics have warned that the trend is deeply troubling.\n\nWhen it comes to adults, the advisory panel, which purports to be independent, wants to cast an even broader net. \u201cThe USPSTF recommends screening for depression in the general adult population, including pregnant and postpartum women,\u201d said the outfit, which adds that its views should not be construed as the official position of the \u201cAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u201d or Obama's HHS. \u201cScreening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up.\u201d\n\nIn its \u201crationale\u201d for recommending that all U.S. adults be screened for depression, the panel claims that the \u201cillness\u201d is \u201ccommon in patients seeking care in the primary care setting.\u201d It also cites \u201cadequate evidence\u201d allegedly showing some \u201cimprovements\u201d if its advice is followed.\n\nThen, unsurprisingly, the outfit downplays the very serious risks documented by The New American magazine and many other sources \u2014 including government and Big Pharma itself. For instance, the panel admits that antidepressants are \u201cassociated\u201d with harms, including an increase in suicidal behavior, an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, fetal harm, and more. But despite that, the task force \u201cconcludes with at least moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit\u201d to screening all American adults. And by all, the task force means all: \u201cThe USPSTF recommends screening in all adults regardless of risk factors,\u201d it said.\n\nBig Pharma and Big Government were no doubt pleased with the conclusion. But not everyone was. Among those expressing concerns was Dr. Ron Paul, the liberty-minded former congressman from Texas and GOP presidential contender, who called the proposed mandatory screenings a \u201cdepressing thought\u201d in his weekly column. \u201cBasic economics, as well as the Obamacare disaster, should have shown this task force that government health insurance mandates harm Americans,\u201d wrote Paul, a medical doctor. He warned that, among other problems, the scheme would raise insurance costs. Even more troubling is that it would likely result in new federal databases containing the results of the screenings, which would be used to deny even more Americans their right to keep and bear arms.\n\n\u201cToday, some mental health professionals think that those who believe in limited government, free-market economics, or traditional values suffer from mental disorders,\u201d Paul explained, echoing growing concerns among watchdogs monitoring the psychiatric industry. \u201cIf mandatory depression screening becomes a reality, it is likely this mental health screening will be expanded to cover screening for other mental illnesses. This could result in anyone with an unpopular political belief or lifestyle choice being labeled as 'mentally ill.'\u201d\n\nOther commentators also directly suggested that the new demands for more \u201cmental health\u201d screening may be related to Obama's agenda to infringe on gun rights. \u201cWith executive actions aimed at getting guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, the timing of this report's release is rather curious,\u201d wrote Trey Sanchez with Truth Revolt, a conservative-leaning outlet. \u201cIt seems reasonable to assume that mass screenings will produce more diagnoses of depression, even for those patients who showed up a little blue that day. But maybe that's the point: the more people there are that can be labeled 'mentally ill' (indeed a disservice to those suffering from actual mental illnesses), the less gun permits approved.\u201d\n\nIt is hardly the first time in recent memory that Obama's HHS has demanded extreme and anti-constitutional intrusions under the guise of \u201chealth.\u201d Indeed, the HHS has become increasingly bold in its demands for totalitarianism. Last year, for example, it unveiled a push to target American adults with vaccine mandates. In collaboration with Big Business and special interests, bureaucrats outlined the \u201cNational Adult Immunization Plan\u201d (NAIP) to track Americans' vaccination records, wage a massive propaganda campaign to \u201cencourage\u201d more inoculations, and foist more controversial vaccines on adults against their will. Critics noted that the agenda includes eventually imposing vaccines at gunpoint.\n\nMore recently, HHS, in partnership with the increasingly radical U.S. Department of Education, unveiled a draft policy statement in which families are referred to as Big Brother's \u201cequal partners\u201d in child rearing. As if that was not enough, the document called for expanding \u201chome visitation\u201d programs. \u201cHome visits by a nurse, social worker, or early childhood educator during pregnancy and in the first years of life can make a tremendous difference in the lives of many children and their families,\u201d argued Obama's HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell last year in announcing more \u201cgrants\u201d to send government workers to family homes.\n\nThe \u201cequal partners\u201d scheme also comes with important \u201cmental health\u201d implications, as the policy statement makes clear. \u201cEnsure constant monitoring and communication regarding children\u2019s social-emotional and behavioral health,\u201d the document demands. \u201cEnsure that children\u2019s social-emotional and behavioral needs are met and that families and staff are connected with relevant community partners, such as early childhood mental health consultants and children\u2019s medical homes.\u201d In the policy statement's \u201crecommendations\u201d for states \u2014 much of which will be imposed through federal bribes \u2014 state governments are told to \u201cexpand early childhood mental health consultation efforts.\u201d\n\nOf course, there is no constitutional authority for federally mandated \u201cmental health\u201d exams or any other meddling in healthcare or family life. Nor is there authority for a Department of \u201cHealth and Human Services\u201d to exist. As HHS and other unconstitutional agencies continue to expand, so does the threat they pose to the liberties, well-being, and prosperity of the American people. It is time for the public to demand that Congress defund and shut down all unconstitutional agencies before the lawlessness and totalitarianism become even more extreme.\n\nAlex Newman is a correspondent for The New American, covering economics, education, politics, and more.
