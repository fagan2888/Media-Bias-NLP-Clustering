Analysts said it could bring a renewed emphasis on increasing sanctions against Russia.\n\n\u201c(This) will refocus attention on the fact that Russia does not seem to be doing very much to moderate the insurgency (or) the cross-border resupply of separatists,\u201d said Timothy Ash, an analyst at Standard Bank PLC. \u201cI would expect the focus to return to sanctions next week.\u201d\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko spoke firmly to glum-faced security officials at a televised emergency meeting Saturday, scolding the head of the country\u2019s SBU security service for \u201comissions\u201d in measures to protect military aircraft.\n\nPoroshenko called for \u201ca detailed analysis of the reasons\u201d for the lapse and hinted that personnel changes were imminent. His office said he vowed to punish \u201cthose responsible for the tragedy in Luhansk.\u201d\n\nIn a conversation with French President Francois Hollande, Poroshenko expressed hope that the European Union would decide on further sanctions against Russia if what he called the illegal border crossings and the supply of weapons did not cease.\n\nNine crew members and 40 troops were aboard the Il-76 troop transport when it went down early Saturday as it approached the airport at Luhansk, the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office said.\n\nThe plane\u2019s tail section and other pieces of scorched wreckage lay in a field near the village of Novohannivka, 12 miles south of Luhansk. An Associated Press reporter saw a dozen or more armed separatists inspecting the crash site.\n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Bohdan Senyk said the rebels used anti-aircraft guns and a heavy machine gun to down the plane, while the prosecutor general\u2019s office said rebels used an anti-aircraft missile.\n\nLuhansk, a city near the border with Russia, is one of two eastern areas where separatists have seized government buildings and declared independence. Ukrainian forces still control the Luhansk airport.\n\nIn other fighting, five border guards were killed and seven wounded Saturday in the southern port of Mariupol when their column of vehicles was ambushed, the guards service said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ukraine vows to punish rebels who downed plane", "title": "Ukraine vows to punish rebels who downed plane", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/14/ukraine-vows-to-punish-rebels-who-downed-plane/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140614__20140615_A14_ND15UKRAINE1p2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140614__20140615_A14_ND15UKRAINE1p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-14T16:58:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:56:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The downing of the plane drew condemnation and concern from the White House and European leaders.\nNOVOHANNIVKA, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s new president declared Sunday a day of mourning and vowed to punish those responsible after pro-Russia separatists shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane, killing all 49 crew members and troops aboard.\nLuhansk, a city near the border with Russia, is one of two eastern areas where separatists have seized government buildings and declared independence.\nAnalysts said it could bring a renewed emphasis on increasing sanctions against Russia.\nDefense Ministry spokesman Bohdan Senyk said the rebels used anti-aircraft guns and a heavy machine gun to down the plane, while the prosecutor general\u2019s office said rebels used an anti-aircraft missile."}
