Some other tongue-in-cheek submissions include It\u2019s bloody cold here, Usain Bolt, Ice Ice Baby and Notthetitanic. The \u00a3200 million polar research vessel, which will be operational in 2019, is set to sail the waters of Antarctica and the Arctic carrying a team of 90 scientists and support staff.\n\nTo NERC's credit, they're taking it in stride, and have been using the attention to promote the mission of its polar research vessels, as well as other information about the organization's mission.\n\nDespite the overwhelming public response for the name, it's highly unlikely that the actual ship will be named the RRS Boaty McBoatface. The contest's fine print says that the name will actually be decided by NERC, regardless of public vote.\n\nThe ship will be launched in 2019.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hahahaha..05/27/2016 8:05:47AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hahahaha.", "title": "Look at the Outrageous Name the British Public Wants to Give a Ship", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/20/boaty-mcboatface-n2136786", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/137/eedec3d9-9d76-4697-af8a-e8e2ef09ead9.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hahahaha.", "title": "Look at the Outrageous Name the British Public Wants to Give a Ship", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/20/boaty-mcboatface-n2136786", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/137/eedec3d9-9d76-4697-af8a-e8e2ef09ead9.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The UK Might Name a Ship \"Boaty McBoatface\" , Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Despite the overwhelming public response for the name, it's highly unlikely that the actual ship will be named the RRS Boaty McBoatface.\nWe're building a new research ship and we need a name for her!\nSteaming ahead of its rivals, RRS Boaty McBoatface is outstripping the likes of Endeavour, Henry Worsley, David Attenborough, Falcon and many more offerings.\nThe United Kingdom's Natural Environment Research Council announced a contest on Twitter to name its newest \u00a3200 million polar research vessel, and let's just say things aren't going according to plan.\nThe \u00a3200 million polar research vessel, which will be operational in 2019, is set to sail the waters of Antarctica and the Arctic carrying a team of 90 scientists and support staff."}
