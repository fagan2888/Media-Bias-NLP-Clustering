BOISE, Idaho (KBOI) -- U.S. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois came to Boise in February 2008 as an underdog Democratic candidate for president.



And he quickly played on the success of the Boise State football team.



"Some were quite skeptical of my prospects, the same way folks were skeptical of Boise State, the Broncos," Obama told a cheering crowd estimated at 15,000 jammed in Taco Bell Arena.



Back then, candidate Obama promised an improved economy, affordable health care, better education, and an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.



Above all, he offered change.



"You and I together we will remake this country and we will remake the world," Obama said back in 2008 in Boise.



America has changed under President Obama, the country's first African-American president.



But supporters and critics still argue if the change is for the better or worse.



Many believe he helped guide the country to better economic times.

Combat operations in both Iraq and Aghanistan have ended.



In 2011, Obama ordered the raid in Pakistan that killed Osama Bin Laden.



When Obama was inaugurated in 2009, gay marriage was legal in only two states. Now it's legal in 24 states.



In 2010, Congress passed the president's signature Affordable Care Act, arguably the most controversial political issue in the land.



President Obama is no longer an unknown quantity. Some argue he's too passive, indecisive -- almost aloof.



But as a lame duck president, Barack Obama wields his veto power defiantly and suggests he plans not to go gentle into that good night.
