As head of Michigan Hematology Oncology, until recently the state\u2019s largest private cancer network, Fata was accused to running a fraud scheme that involved administering unnecessary chemotherapy to 553 patients -- including some who were intentionally misdiagnosed with cancer -- and illegally billing Medicare and private insurers some $34 million in false claims.\n\nIn 2010, warning signs came from an oncology nurse, Angela Swantek, who considered taking a job with Fata\u2019s practice and observed what she described to TV station WDIV as a \u201cchemo mill\u201d\u2014with more than dozen patients getting chemotherapy at any given time and apparently not in compliance with best practices for infusion. She declined the job and filed a complaint with the Michigan licensing regulators, but the state later determined that nothing was out of compliance.\n\nThree years later, the FBI stepped in on a tip from George Karadsheh, who managed the office of Crittenton Cancer Center in Rochester Hills. Karadsheh grew suspicious after clinical staff and other doctors were leaving the practice; one doctor told him Fata kept insisting on aggressive chemotherapy regimens, even for patients who didn\u2019t need it. In August, 2013 Fata was arrested.\n\n[Also: Running list of notable 2015 healthcare frauds]\n\n\u201cHealthcare fraud has been a serious problem in Michigan, but no case has been as egregious as the conduct of Dr. Farid Fata,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade of the Eastern District of Michigan. \u201cDr. Fata did not care for patients; he exploited them as commodities. He over-treated, under-treated and outright lied to patients about whether they had cancer so that he could maximize his own profits.\u201d\n\nLast September, Fata plead guilty to 13 counts of healthcare fraud, one count of conspiracy involving kickbacks and two counts of money laundering. He also admitted to soliciting kickbacks from Guardian Angel Hospice and Guardian Angel Home Health Care in exchange for patient referrals. U.S. District Judge Paul Borman of the Eastern District of Michigan imposed the sentence of 45 years in prison, after which Fata would be 95 years old, and ordered him forfeit $17.6 million.\n\nOriginally from Lebanon, Fata came to the U.S. in the 1990s to complete a hematology-oncology fellowship at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center\u2014training at a prestigious institution that he allegedly used to manipulate patients and family members questioning treatment decisions.\n\n[Also: Attorney General announces 'largest Medicare fraud takedown in history']\n\nMichelle Mannarino said in a patient impact statement that Fata diagnosed her mom with breast cancer, and convinced her that she \u201chad a very aggressive cancer that would become untreatable if she stopped chemo,\u201d including at one point 24-hour-drip with a chemo drug more commonly used in colon cancers. \u201cSeveral times when I had researched and questioned his treatment, he asked if I had fellowshipped at Sloan Kettering like he had,\u201d Mannarino said.\n\nOne patient, according to the FBI, fell and hit his head during an office visit. Fata insisted that the patient complete a chemotherapy infusion before going to the hospital, and the man later died with a head injury.\n\nAnother patient, whose family testified anonymously, was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and then urged by Fata to pursue an aggressive treatment strategy at the expense of her personal finances.\n\n\u201cFata had instilled so much false hope of a cure over the months of seeing him,\u201d they wrote in a statement to the court. \u201cFarid reminded [her] that she would die without him. We were wondering if there was any reason to file bankruptcy, questioning her life expectancy. He indicated again that he was trying a new therapy and we should definitely file bankruptcy on her behalf.\u201d\n\nWhen the family asked about hospice, Fata apparently told them the end-of-life palliative option was unnecessary and their mother \u201cwould be around for a long time,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHe then held her hand, looked straight into her eyes and gently said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I will not let them stop the treatments you need.\u2019 She was very angry at us for the discussion that had just taken place\u2026 She was never able to accept that she was dying because Fata convinced her she was not. We never had the benefit of the final conversation we should have been able to have, to say the things we wanted to say.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nFata's criminal forfeiture includes, according to court records: rights to $1,035,304.61 from a Cor Clearing bank account in the name of Farid Fata Michigan Hematology Oncology, P.C.
