John Boozman, R-Ark., drew a primary challenge Monday from businessman Curtis Coleman of Little Rock, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP nominations for Senate in 2010 and governor in 2014.\n\nBoozman, of Rogers, and Coleman both filed candidate papers at the state Capitol on the final day of the week-long filing period for state, federal and nonpartisan judicial offices. Next year\u2019s primary election will be March 1.\n\nDemocrat Conner Eldridge of Fayetteville, a former U.S. district attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, and Libertarian Frank Gilbert of Tull filed last week to run for Boozman\u2019s Senate seat.\n\nColeman, the retired founding president and CEO of Safe Foods of North Little Rock, recently founded an Internet television station called AR1.TV. He told reporters Arkansas needs a more conservative vote than Boozman\u2019s in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe seven votes to raise the debt ceiling, for which John voted, increased the nation\u2019s indebtedness by $6.3 trillion. That\u2019s not a conservative Republican vote in the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\nColeman said supporters encouraged him to run and donated enough money to cover his $20,000 filing fee. He also said his decision was influenced by a University of Arkansas poll that found 38 percent of respondents said they approve of Boozman\u2019s job performance. Among very likely voters, Boozman\u2019s approval rating was 44 percent.\n\nBoozman\u2019s disapproval rating was 18 percent among both groups. Forty-four percent of respondents, and 38 percent of very likely voters, did not know or declined to answer.\n\n\u201cWhat really struck me is that 44 percent of Arkansans didn\u2019t know enough about him to have an opinion, which I thought was remarkable given the fact that he\u2019s been in Congress for 14 years and almost half the state doesn\u2019t recognize John Boozman or know enough to have an opinion,\u201d Coleman said.\n\nColeman also mentioned a report last week by CNN that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has had a talk with Boozman about his fundraising and that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has told Boozman it will not bail him out financially if he gets in trouble. Boozman\u2019s third-quarter fundraising was outstripped by that of Eldridge, who raised funds for only 21 days during the quarter.\n\n\u201cI think it shows not only a lack of support from Arkansans, but it shows a significant concern with John\u2019s performance from the Republican National Committee that I think is indicative of an overall dissatisfaction with John\u2019s performance,\u201d Coleman said.\n\nBoozman, a former optometrist who served in the U.S. House for 10 years before being elected to the Senate in 2010, filed earlier Monday. He told reporters his approval rating among very likely voters \u201cis very, very good, considering my low disapproval numbers.\u201d\n\nRegarding the meeting with McConnell, Boozman said, \u201cWhat Mitch McConnell said was, \u2018How are you doing with your fundraising?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Not as well as I\u2019d like,\u2019 because until then I really didn\u2019t have an opponent. I\u2019d just acquired an opponent. It\u2019s difficult when everybody feels like you\u2019re in great shape in Arkansas, and everybody feels like you\u2019re in great shape in Washington. Arkansas has turned very red, and so as a result \u2026 the feeling is you don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d\n\nBoozman said he will raise enough money to get his message to voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been out-raised in my races. I\u2019m not concerned about that,\u201d he said.\n\nBoozman said that if elected to a second Senate term, he will work to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ease regulations on businesses and create an environment in which employers want to hire more workers. He said his voting record \u201cmatches up very, very well with the people of Arkansas.\u201d\n\nVincent Insalaco, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a statement Monday that the state Republican Party \u201cis more divided today than ever before.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator John Boozman will face a primary opponent because he is part of the \u2018insider Congress\u2019 that gets nothing done for the people of Arkansas,\u201d Insalaco said. \u201cDuring his 15 years in Congress, John Boozman has voted to shut down the government and remains in lockstep with Washington special interests. Arkansans want change. Arkansans deserve a new voice in Washington, which is why Conner Eldridge has so much momentum right out of the gate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 U.S. Sen.
