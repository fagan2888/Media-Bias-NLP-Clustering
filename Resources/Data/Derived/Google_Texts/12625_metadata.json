But there were no more children up there any more, she had chased them all away.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the plot, such as it is, of \u201cThe Green Road,\u201d Anne Enright\u2019s brilliant new novel. In the beginning, all four of Rosaleen\u2019s children went away from her. In the end, they all came back, or at least tried to, hoping to make better sense of her life and their own. They were not totally successful, which should come as no great surprise, this being, don\u2019t you know, a novel by an Irish writer about an Irish family.\n\nWe meet the family Madigan in 1980 in their little house in their little town in County Clare. Rosaleen Considine Madigan and her husband Dan have two girls and two boys. First is Constance, then Dan, then Emmett and the baby Hanna. Each will grow up to be someone very different than their mother \u2014 and probably they \u2014 expected or wanted.\n\nLife is not brutal on Ireland\u2019s Atlantic coast, but it is hard. Birth control is still illegal, and the Celtic Tiger has yet to come and go. But life in the Madigan household is made more difficult as each child sees his or her dreams fade and die like the bubbles in the song.\n\nConstance wants to be a chemist, a pharmacist, but fails the exam repeatedly and settles for marriage with a well-off man she likes more than loves. Dan leaves to become a priest (at the news, his mother wails in protest and takes to her bed), but it doesn\u2019t stick and he moves to New York City where he discovers, at the height of the AIDS crisis, that he\u2019s gay. Emmett wants to save mankind and begins in Mali, with very-less-than-positive results. And Hanna, a promising actress, leaves the theater thanks to an unplanned pregnancy, and it\u2019s hard to tell which one likes her bottle more, Hanna or the child.\n\nRosaleen has summoned her now-adult offspring home at Christmastime to announce she is going to sell the family home, and in no time at all the old family patterns reappear. The author says a great deal by making a complete paragraph out of Constance commenting about her mother, \u201cThere was no pleasing her.\u201d By this point, the reader, more than familiar with Madigan familial dynamics, gets the significance.\n\nThe sturm und drang of these people, both individually and collectively, drives the novel, but Ms. Enright characteristically fills the pages with rare insights into human nature, leavened with large drops of dark humor. She\u2019s the kind of writer who makes the reader pull up short and notice what he or she has just read.\n\nFor example, early on, she has a young Hanna observe, of an uncle, \u201cBart had a perfectly useless wife. She had no children and beautiful shoes in a range of colors, and each pair had its own matching bag.\u201d Of a stray dog Emmett\u2019s girl adopts, Ms. Enright tells us, \u201cHe barked every evening he called the sudden sunset, as though doubting the dawn.\u201d\n\nOn page after page, the author offers up complex observations in the simplest of words. At one point, we\u2019re told a character is \u201cabout as much use as a chocolate teapot,\u201d and, later, that the father of Hanna\u2019s baby is as neat and dependable as Hanna is not, to the point that \u201cLiving with him put Hanna semi-permanently in the wrong.\u201d\n\nReaders who come to Anne Enright for the first time will be more than amply rewarded for their discovery. Over the past quarter-century, she has displayed her talent in three books of short stories, one work of nonfiction, and five novels. \u201cThe Gathering,\u201d her 2007 novel, won the prestigious Man Booker Prize. In addition, her last novel, \u201cThe Awakening,\u201d brought her (the first) Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction.\n\nDublin native and resident Anne Enright is known as much for her prose as for her storytelling ability. She is one of those rare writers who can make the darkest human tale palatable, thanks to her humanity and also, in no small part, her excellent sense of humor.\n\nBut then she is Irish, after all. As she told The Paris Review: \u201cI don\u2019t write about Ireland so much as from Ireland. I am keenly aware of the Irish tradition and I\u2019m very happy to take what I can from it, but it\u2019s also quite important to push against it. We\u2019re all helplessly local writers.\u201d\n\n\u2022 John Greenya is a Washington writer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sitting in the family home, writing Christmas cards to her four children, Rosaleen Madigan \"caught the sound of mischief upstairs and looked to the ceiling.
