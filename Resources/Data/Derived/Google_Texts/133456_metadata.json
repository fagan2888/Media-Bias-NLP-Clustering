However, the state\u2019s public health division stated that the flu typically arrives in Oregon later than it does in most of the country.\n\n\u201cThe flu surprises us every year,\u201d Ceislak said. \u201cWe do this pattern \u2014 the flu seems to start in the Southeast and then it comes our way.\u201d\n\nApproximately 67.4 percent of flu cases recorded around the U.S. this season are known as Influenza A, H3N2 \u2014 a strain of the virus associated with more severe illnesses and higher mortality rates. In Oregon, the state public health lab has reviewed 114 confirmed cases of influenza and 112 of them have been H3N2, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nHowever, this year's vaccine was designed with different viruses in mind than the new strain of H3N2, which doesn't currently have a widely available vaccine, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nVulnerability\n\nThe the elderly are most susceptible to the current strain of the flu, according to Ceislak. Elderly patients who contract H3N2 have had a higher mortality rate than elderly patients who came down with a different strain of the virus, Cieslak said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our happiest strain to have,\u201d Cieslak said. \u201cFor the older (patients), it tends to be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nYoung children are also especially susceptible to this year\u2019s flu, acording to CDC data.\n\nThe CDC's latest weekly flu surveillance report stated that influenza been responsible for 15 pediatric deaths across the country this season, with none so far in Oregon, Cieslak confirmed. The state's public health authority also tracks the statistic.\n\nPreventing an outbreak\n\nThere's no data on whether any of Oregon\u2019s flu patients fell ill after being vaccinated. However, there have been some media reports of people contracting the flu despite getting being vaccinated.\n\n\u201cFlu vaccines are not 100 percent perfect,\u201d Ceislak said.\n\nThe state won\u2019t know how effective the vaccine was in combatting this year\u2019s flu until the season ends in Spring. However, people should still get their flu shot, as there is some overlap between different strains of the virus, Ceislak said.\n\nTo combat the reduced effectiveness of immunization, the CDC recommended that individuals who are at a high risk and patients who have been hospitalized for their flu symptoms use antiviral drugs as a second line of defense against the illness.\n\n\u201cInfluenza vaccination still offers the best way to prevent seasonal flu,\u201d CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said.\n\nThere are a number of personal preventative measures people can take to reduce their risk that don\u2019t involve antiviral drugs.\n\n\u201cBy all means, stay home when you\u2019re sick,\u201d Ceislak said. \u201cEspecially this year, when the vaccine isn\u2019t working so well.\u201d\n\nCeislak also said everyone - even healthy people - should be washing their hands on a frequent basis, as patients carrying the virus can be contagious before showing any symptoms.\n\n\u201cWith a lot of these respiratory illnesses, we\u2019re seeing that a lot of times patheogens are spread, not by our cough, but by covering our cough with our hands,\u201d Ceislak said. \u201cHand washing is important, especially this season since the vaccine isn\u2019t working so well.\u201d\n\nRelated Slideshow: Slideshow: 14 Biggest Healthcare Stories of 2014\n\nCheck out GoLocalPDX's list of top healthcare stories of 2014.
