Amazingly, some of those veterans are still alive today.\n\nFrank Levingston, who is said to be the oldest living World War II veteran, just celebrated a milestone birthday.\n\nLevingston, who can still recall his Army days, turned 110 years old on Friday, Nov. 13, and says he is thankful to God that he is still here.\n\n\u201cI can remember the day I was inducted in the Army until the day I was discharged,\u201d Levingston told NBC-affiliate KPLC-TV.\n\nAn Army private who served in Italy during the Naples-Foggia Campaign (which lasted from Sept. 1943-Jan. 1944), Levingston was discharged in 1945 according to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through so many dangerous things and I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m thankful to the almighty God for it,\u201d he also told KPLC-TV.\n\nBorn in 1905, Levingston grew up in Northern Louisiana as one of seven children. While he did not have much formal education growing up, he says that life lessons from his parents have stuck with him. For example, Levingston says that honesty goes a long way.\n\n\u201cAlways be honest and truthful,\u201d Levingston told KSLA News.\n\nLevingston, who is known by many as \u201cUncle Frank,\u201d says he still feels well and is thankful for each day.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m one of the blessed ones,\u201d Levingston said.\n\nLevingston lives in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where his friend Pamela Gobert spends most days with him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always got a kind word and he lets me know that sometimes it\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish,\u201d Gobert told KPLC-TV\u2019s Erika Ferrando when the news station visited Levingston\u2019s home.\n\nLevingston spent the weekend following his birthday in celebration with family. He told KSLA News, \u201cMy family is my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery great event that has happened over the last 110 years, he has lived through it,\u201d Levingston\u2019s great niece Shannon Levingston-McCowan also told KSLA News.\n\nIn honor of the special occasion, Levingston recently received a birthday letter and a thank you for his service from the White House.\n\n\u201cWe trust you take enormous pride in everything you have accomplished and in the ways your service has touched the lives of others,\u201d the letter reads, according to KPLC-TV.\n\nAnother World War II veteran, Richard Overton, is 109 years old and lives in Austin, Texas. Overton credits God for his long life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The oldest living World War II veteran, Frank Levingston, just celebrated his milestone 110th birthday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The oldest living World War II veteran, Frank Levingston, just celebrated his milestone 110th birthday.", "title": "World War II Veteran Celebrates Milestone 110th Birthday", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/levingston-veteran.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1YgO5uO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The oldest living World War II veteran, Frank Levingston, just celebrated his milestone 110th birthday.", "title": "World War II Veteran Celebrates Milestone 110th Birthday", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/levingston-veteran.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2015-11-18T16:59:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "United States, World War 2, Frank Levingston, WWII"}, "article_summary": "Frank Levingston, who is said to be the oldest living World War II veteran, just celebrated a milestone birthday.\nAnother World War II veteran, Richard Overton, is 109 years old and lives in Austin, Texas.\nHe told KSLA News, \u201cMy family is my life.\u201d\u201cEvery great event that has happened over the last 110 years, he has lived through it,\u201d Levingston\u2019s great niece Shannon Levingston-McCowan also told KSLA News.\n16.1 million Americans served in the Second World War.\n\u201cAlways be honest and truthful,\u201d Levingston told KSLA News."}
