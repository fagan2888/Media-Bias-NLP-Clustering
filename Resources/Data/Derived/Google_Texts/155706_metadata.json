The first and most important is the ascendance of Barack Obama, whose vision of effectively unlimited government gives conservatives the willies. But there are deeper reasons, too: The Right believes, not without some reason, that the main reason we ended up with a disastrous Obama-Pelosi-Reid triumvirate government \u2014 the brief years of which imposed damage that will take much longer to undo \u2014 had to do with the foreign policy of George W. Bush and the fiscal incontinence of congressional Republicans during the Bush years. While the Obama administration has not yet produced a superior foreign-policy operating model, the Bush approach is not really looking any better in retrospect, at least in the sense that it would be difficult to say with a straight face that Iraq, Afghanistan, or the broader Middle East look today like more tractable problems than they did in 2001, or like they might become more tractable. On the domestic front, abortion has effectively calcified into a modus vivendi (more accurately, a horrifying modus mortis), and the new lion of the social issues, gay marriage, is a wet kitten by comparison, in that no sensible, non-fanatical person thinks of gay marriage as being as urgent an issue as abortion.\n\nAll of those are relevant, but consider one further, broader dynamic at work: The Right is finally coming around to the understanding that what mainly distinguishes it from the Left is not its general preference for muscular foreign policy, its not always convincing defense of the Judeo-Christian tradition, or even its relatively faithful reading of the Constitution, as important as those things are. Rather, the fight between Right and Left is about coercion.\n\nThat the Left has become much more intensively coercive in recent years has not gone unnoticed among conservatives. In Liberal Fascism and elsewhere, Jonah Goldberg has popularized a longstanding view of the left-wing philosophy that in the United States calls itself \u201cliberalism\u201d \u2014 though we cannot in good faith call it that \u2014 that connects it with the nakedly coercive, antidemocratic, and anti-constitutional tendency of Woodrow Wilson and the progressives of his era, and with the various nasty totalitarian movements that inspired them and were inspired by them in turn. It\u2019s not that we expect Robert Reich to come marching up Fifth Avenue wearing jackboots (the Pride March ain\u2019t what it used to be) but that managerial progressivism is fundamentally corporatist in the sense that Mussolini et al. used the term: It conceives of formal political power and economic production as a single unit to be kept working in harmony, like a well-tuned engine, by such experts as the state recognizes as suited to the task. In theory, these men are to be guided by evidence meeting scientific standards \u2014 they are to be the sort of disinterested and dispassionate pragmatists that exist mainly within the narrow confines of Ezra Klein\u2019s cranium.\n\nThe problem, as various capital-\u201dF\u201d Fascists and National Socialists and Communist politburos and Vox readers all discovered in their turn, is that even if these dispassionate and disinterested managers existed \u2014 and they don\u2019t \u2014 bureaucracies do not have the collective cognitive firepower to replace markets, or even to intelligently guide them. From the Soviet five-year plans to Obamacare, all central-planning exercises begin in hubris and end in chaos.\n\nAnd when the chaos comes, the natural thing to do \u2014 the imperative thing \u2014 is: find someone to blame. The planners and schemers are intellectually incapable of dealing seriously with the fact that the project that they have set for themselves \u2014 substituting their own judgment for that of the billions of better-informed parties in the market and coming up with superior outcomes \u2014 is an impossible one. But once you\u2019ve accepted real limits on what planning can do \u2014 on what government can do \u2014 then you have at some level essentially surrendered to conservatism.\n\nAnd that means that somebody, somewhere, must be a racist.\n\nJonathan Chait, the sort of nice suburban liberal boy you\u2019d want your daughter to marry if you hated your daughter, in his recent essay on the alleged renaissance of political correctness, bemoaned the emergence of racial- and gender-identity politics as an ultimate rhetorical trump card. Chait either misses or ignores the fact that this is not new; what\u2019s new is that the wanton application of this juvenile mode of discourse now encompasses previously immune white liberals. But the tendency itself is ancient, and prominent on his end of the political spectrum.\n\n\u201c\u0410 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043b\u0438\u043d\u0447\u0443\u044e\u0442\u201d is a bitter Soviet-era punch line meaning, roughly, \u201cBut in your country they lynch Negroes.\u201d There were a million Cold War variations on the joke: The Soviet farm minister meets his U.S. counterpart, who inquires about whether the heroic Soviet farmers are meeting their five-year plans. Asked about each crop in turn, the Soviet minister is forced to sheepishly admit that they are woefully behind on every goal, and then demands: \u201cBut what about the blacks in the South?\u201d A U.S. car salesman asks a Soviet counterpart how many months the typical Soviet citizen must work to purchase an entry-level car, and the Ruskie answers: \u201cIn your country, you lynch Negroes.\u201d\n\nWhen Matt Yglesias says he wants to \u201clay down a marker and say once again that Obamacare implementation is going to be a huge political success,\u201d and that doesn\u2019t happen, what happens next? Another chorus of \u201cThe Tea Party Is Racist!\u201d from Ezra Klein, or from whomever.\n\nThe Wilsonian vision of domestic governance through expertise and fiat quickly devolved into a reality of goon squads, political persecution, crushing of dissent with formal and informal political violence, politicization of law enforcement, etc. The Occupy bomb-throwers and the imbecile hooligans committing arson to prove that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d are not quite the American Protective League, but they\u2019re of a piece with it. In the Wilson years, we had politicized police; in the Obama years, we have a weaponized IRS . . . and Justice Department, and police unions, and jailers\u2019 unions. The Wilson-era progressives tried to use the Sedition Act to shut down critics of the great progressive. In our time, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Harry Reid want to throw people in prison for unpopular political activism of which they disapprove. The grand plans of 2009 are coming unraveled, as grand plans do, and so the Left grows ever more naked in its coercion. On the official side of the spectrum, you have Senate Democrats voting to repeal the First Amendment so that they can suppress political criticism. On the unofficial side \u2014 as the perpetually late-to-the-party Jonathan Chait has suddenly noticed \u2014 you have people such as Brendan Eich being run out of their jobs for holding unpopular political opinions, human-rights heroes such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali run off college campuses, and Trustafarians from suburban Boston shutting down emergency ambulance services because they are displeased about . . . something.\n\nThe fun part for the Left is that, in Mount Holyoke as in Pyongyang, totalitarianism is magnified by madness, and thus The Vagina Monologues must be suppressed on the grounds that not all women have vaginas. If you do not follow these sorts of things closely, you would not believe the vitriol \u2014 up to and including death threats \u2014 rained down on feminist groups who insist that while they sympathize with transsexuals they do not believe that a penis-and-testicle-bearing person counts as a woman simply on his own say-so.\n\nThe Left\u2019s last big idea was Communism. When Lenin turned out to be the god who failed, the Left undertook wide exploration for another grand unifying idea: environmentalism, multiculturalism, economic inequality, atheism, feminism, etc. What it ended up with was an enemies\u2019 list.\n\nThat and a taste for brute force.\n\nThe enthusiasm for coercion and the substitution of enemies for ideas \u2014 Christians, white men, Israel, \u201cthe 1 percent,\u201d the Koch brothers, take your pick \u2014 together form the basis for understanding the Left\u2019s current convulsions. The call to imprison people with unapproved ideas about global warming, the Senate Democrats\u2019 vote to repeal the First Amendment, the Ferguson-inspired riots, the picayune political correctness and thought-policing that annoys Jonathan Chait, the IRS\u2019s persecution of conservative political groups, Barack Obama\u2019s White House enemies\u2019 list, the casual violence against conservatives on college campuses and the Left\u2019s instinctive defense of that violence \u2014 these are not separate phenomena but part of a single phenomenon.\n\nThe difference between Elizabeth Warren\u2019s partisans and the Tontons Macoutes is very little more than testosterone and time.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.

In theory, these men are to be guided by evidence meeting scientific standards \u2014 they are to be the sort of disinterested and dispassionate pragmatists that exist mainly within the narrow confines of Ezra Klein\u2019s cranium.\n\nThe problem, as various capital-\u201dF\u201d Fascists and National Socialists and Communist politburos and Vox readers all discovered in their turn, is that even if these dispassionate and disinterested managers existed \u2014 and they don\u2019t \u2014 bureaucracies do not have the collective cognitive firepower to replace markets, or even to intelligently guide them. From the Soviet five-year plans to Obamacare, all central-planning exercises begin in hubris and end in chaos.\n\nAnd when the chaos comes, the natural thing to do \u2014 the imperative thing \u2014 is: find someone to blame. The planners and schemers are intellectually incapable of dealing seriously with the fact that the project that they have set for themselves \u2014 substituting their own judgment for that of the billions of better-informed parties in the market and coming up with superior outcomes \u2014 is an impossible one. But once you\u2019ve accepted real limits on what planning can do \u2014 on what government can do \u2014 then you have at some level essentially surrendered to conservatism.\n\nAnd that means that somebody, somewhere, must be a racist.\n\n#page#Jonathan Chait, the sort of nice suburban liberal boy you\u2019d want your daughter to marry if you hated your daughter, in his recent essay on the alleged renaissance of political correctness, bemoaned the emergence of racial- and gender-identity politics as an ultimate rhetorical trump card. Chait either misses or ignores the fact that this is not new; what\u2019s new is that the wanton application of this juvenile mode of discourse now encompasses previously immune white liberals. But the tendency itself is ancient, and prominent on his end of the political spectrum.\n\n\u201c\u0410 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043b\u0438\u043d\u0447\u0443\u044e\u0442\u201d is a bitter Soviet-era punch line meaning, roughly, \u201cBut in your country they lynch Negroes.\u201d There were a million Cold War variations on the joke: The Soviet farm minister meets his U.S. counterpart, who inquires about whether the heroic Soviet farmers are meeting their five-year plans. Asked about each crop in turn, the Soviet minister is forced to sheepishly admit that they are woefully behind on every goal, and then demands: \u201cBut what about the blacks in the South?\u201d A U.S. car salesman asks a Soviet counterpart how many months the typical Soviet citizen must work to purchase an entry-level car, and the Ruskie answers: \u201cIn your country, you lynch Negroes.\u201d\n\n#ad#When Matt Yglesias says he wants to \u201clay down a marker and say once again that Obamacare implementation is going to be a huge political success,\u201d and that doesn\u2019t happen, what happens next? Another chorus of \u201cThe Tea Party Is Racist!\u201d from Ezra Klein, or from whomever.\n\nThe Wilsonian vision of domestic governance through expertise and fiat quickly devolved into a reality of goon squads, political persecution, crushing of dissent with formal and informal political violence, politicization of law enforcement, etc. The Occupy bomb-throwers and the imbecile hooligans committing arson to prove that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d are not quite the American Protective League, but they\u2019re of a piece with it. In the Wilson years, we had politicized police; in the Obama years, we have a weaponized IRS\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and Justice Department, and police unions, and jailers\u2019 unions. The Wilson-era progressives tried to use the Sedition Act to shut down critics of the great progressive. In our time, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Harry Reid want to throw people in prison for unpopular political activism of which they disapprove. The grand plans of 2009 are coming unraveled, as grand plans do, and so the Left grows ever more naked in its coercion. On the official side of the spectrum, you have Senate Democrats voting to repeal the First Amendment so that they can suppress political criticism. On the unofficial side \u2014 as the perpetually late-to-the-party Jonathan Chait has suddenly noticed \u2014 you have people such as Brendan Eich being run out of their jobs for holding unpopular political opinions, human-rights heroes such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali run off college campuses, and Trustafarians from suburban Boston shutting down emergency ambulance services because they are displeased about\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0something.\n\nThe fun part for the Left is that, in Mount Holyoke as in Pyongyang, totalitarianism is magnified by madness, and thus The Vagina Monologues must be suppressed on the grounds that not all women have vaginas. If you do not follow these sorts of things closely, you would not believe the vitriol \u2014 up to and including death threats \u2014 rained down on feminist groups who insist that while they sympathize with transsexuals they do not believe that a penis-and-testicle-bearing person counts as a woman simply on his own say-so.\n\nThe Left\u2019s last big idea was Communism. When Lenin turned out to be the god who failed, the Left undertook wide exploration for another grand unifying idea: environmentalism, multiculturalism, economic inequality, atheism, feminism, etc. What it ended up with was an enemies\u2019 list.\n\nThat and a taste for brute force.\n\nThe enthusiasm for coercion and the substitution of enemies for ideas \u2014 Christians, white men, Israel, \u201cthe 1 percent,\u201d the Koch brothers, take your pick \u2014 together form the basis for understanding the Left\u2019s current convulsions. The call to imprison people with unapproved ideas about global warming, the Senate Democrats\u2019 vote to repeal the First Amendment, the Ferguson-inspired riots, the picayune political correctness and thought-policing that annoys Jonathan Chait, the IRS\u2019s persecution of conservative political groups, Barack Obama\u2019s White House enemies\u2019 list, the casual violence against conservatives on college campuses and the Left\u2019s instinctive defense of that violence \u2014 these are not separate phenomena but part of a single phenomenon.\n\nThe difference between Elizabeth Warren\u2019s partisans and the Tontons Macoutes is very little more than testosterone and time.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.
