It\u2019s their life.\n\nMany of the Capitol\u2019s food servers, who make the meals, bus the tables and run the cash registers in the restaurants and carryouts that serve lawmakers, earn less than $11 an hour. Some make nothing at all when Congress is in recess.\n\nMembers of the House and Senate collect their $174,000 annual salaries whether Congress is making laws, taking a break or causing a partial government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThis is the most important building in the world,\u201d said Sontia Bailey, who works the cash register and stocks the shelves at the \u201cRefectory\u201d takeout on the Capitol\u2019s Senate side. \u201cYou\u2019d think our wages would be better.\u201d\n\nBailey, 34, makes $10.33 an hour, a hair above the $10.10 hourly minimum for federal contractors. She had to move from her apartment to a rented room when the 2013 temporary government shutdown interrupted her income, she said.\n\nKFC pays her better. Bailey works weekends and two evenings a week there, making $12 an hour.\n\nIn the Capitol food service world, she said, \u201ceverybody has second jobs.\u201d\n\nDown an ornate hallway is 21-year-old Abraham Tesfahun. He serves lunch in the Senate members\u2019 dining room and handles the afternoon cash register in the busy Senate takeout one floor below. Tesfahun said his hourly pay is $10.30. But he receives an additional $3 an hour in cash, which otherwise would go toward health insurance. He is covered by his mother\u2019s insurance policy under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nDoughnuts on the side\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Tesfahun, who emigrated from Ethiopia as a teenager, is tight with his mom.\n\n\u201cShe kind of kicked me out of the house,\u201d he said sheepishly, when he quit community college after one year to work seven days a week. Now, he said, he rents a basement room and works full time in the Capitol. On Saturdays and Sundays, he works at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts for $8 an hour. That\u2019s above the federal minimum wage of $7.25, although some states have higher minimums.\n\n\u201cPeople are much nicer\u201d in the Capitol, Tesfahun said. But he said he generally has no work or pay when Congress is out of session, and he sometimes collects unemployment benefits. The Senate is scheduled to be in recess 13 weeks this year.\n\nBoth Bailey and Tesfahun said they once received a pay raise of 3 cents an hour.\n\nIn Congress and the 2016 presidential race, candidates in both parties promise to help U.S. workers narrow the gap with high earners. The Capitol\u2019s food workers \u2014 many of whom can\u2019t afford cars, let alone vacations \u2014 are prime examples of people without college degrees who have fallen far behind in the high-tech global economy.\n\nCapitol food workers with at least seven years\u2019 experience fare better than Bailey and Tesfahun, making about $16 or $17 an hour. But even one of those, cook Shawnee Ellis, said she does catering on the side because \u201cI have to make extra money\u201d to pay her bills.\n\n\u2018Above-market\u2019 wages\n\nAll work for Restaurant Associates, a major New York-based contractor that handles food services for the House and Senate.\n\nIn a statement, the contractor said it \u201ctakes pride in paying above-market competitive wages.\u201d It would not comment on individual employees.\n\nCapitol employees\u2019 struggles are causing discomfort for lawmakers as national debate churns over income inequality. In April, dozens of Capitol workers staged a one-day protest.\n\nSenate cook Bertrand Olotara wrote in The Guardian, \u201cI serve food to some of the most powerful people on Earth.\u201d They often talk of expanded opportunity for workers, he wrote, but \u201cmost don\u2019t seem to notice or care that workers in their own building are struggling to survive.\u201d\n\nThe Washington region is among the nation\u2019s most expensive.\n\nAfter The Washington Post, CNN and others profiled Charles Gladden, a Senate food worker who is homeless, several Democratic senators urged Republican leaders \u2014 now in the majority \u2014 to press Restaurant Associates to increase workers\u2019 pay. GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who leads the Rules Committee, said \u201ctheir concerns will be kept in mind as the contract comes up for renegotiation\u201d later this year.\n\nThe House contract with Restaurant Associates expires in August; requests for bids went out last fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Capitol employees\u2019 struggles are causing discomfort for lawmakers.", "og": {"description": "Capitol employees\u2019 struggles are causing discomfort for lawmakers.", "title": "In Congress, income inequality comes with breakfast, lunch", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150508-in-congress-income-inequality-comes-with-breakfast-lunch.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150508-congress_unequal_pay_43682503.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/CONGRESS_UNEQUAL_PAY_43682503.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-05-08T23:09:18Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-05-08T23:00:19Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"In Congress, income inequality comes with breakfast, lunch\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150508-in-congress-income-inequality-comes-with-breakfast-lunch.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150508-congress_unequal_pay_43682503.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/CONGRESS_UNEQUAL_PAY_43682503.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2288813\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-05-08T23:00:19Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"Charles Babington and Laurie Kellman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150508-congress_unequal_pay_43682503.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/CONGRESS_UNEQUAL_PAY_43682503.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-05-08T23:00:19Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda265\"", "article_summary": "In the Capitol food service world, she said, \u201ceverybody has second jobs.\u201dDown an ornate hallway is 21-year-old Abraham Tesfahun.\nCapitol food workers with at least seven years\u2019 experience fare better than Bailey and Tesfahun, making about $16 or $17 an hour.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Income inequality is more than a political sound bite to workers in the Capitol.\nIn April, dozens of Capitol workers staged a one-day protest.\n\u201cPeople are much nicer\u201d in the Capitol, Tesfahun said."}
