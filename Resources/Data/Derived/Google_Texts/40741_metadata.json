But obviously I\u2019m being put on forward just because my game is not where it needs to be on D,\u201d Holden said Wednesday after skating in practice on a fourth line with Michael Sgarbossa and Cody McLeod.\n\nHolden, who\u2019s played in each of the Avs\u2019 25 games this season, has a team-worst minus-16 mark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an injury thing. But I know I need to be much, much better on defense,\u201d Holden said. \u201cI\u2019ll work hard and try to get back in the lineup at D.\u201d\n\nThe Avs have two defensemen, Brad Stuart and Ryan Wilson, on injured reserve. So they recently recalled defenseman Karl Stollery from the minor-league Lake Erie Monsters and have turned Zach Redmond, often a healthy scratch early in the season, into a regular.\n\nThe move left Holden on the outs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy stretch for him right now. He did not have the start we were expecting,\u201d Roy said. \u201cAnd with the situation with our forwards, we think it will be good for Nick to play as a forward. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\nRoy said he is considering a third line of Tomas Vincour, Max Talbot and Daniel Briere against Calgary, with a Holden-Sgarbossa-McLeod fourth line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be good because I can just focus on simple plays and basic stuff,\u201d Holden said. \u201cGet in, hit some guys, play hard and forget about everything else.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche moves Nick Holden to forward, tries to fix defense", "title": "Avalanche moves Nick Holden to forward, tries to fix defense", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/03/avalanche-moves-nick-holden-to-forward-tries-to-fix-defense/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__nick-holdenp1.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__nick-holdenp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-03T13:02:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:49:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGet in, hit some guys, play hard and forget about everything else.\u201dNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\nSo Colorado coach Patrick Roy told Holden \u2014 who\u2019s struggled on the Avs\u2019 third defensive unit this season \u2014 to switch his position.\nAvalanche defenseman Nick Holden will shift to a forward\u2019s role Thursday for a game at Calgary against the Flames \u2014 in part out of necessity and in part as punishment.\nHolden, who\u2019s played in each of the Avs\u2019 25 games this season, has a team-worst minus-16 mark.\n\u201cAnd with the situation with our forwards, we think it will be good for Nick to play as a forward."}
