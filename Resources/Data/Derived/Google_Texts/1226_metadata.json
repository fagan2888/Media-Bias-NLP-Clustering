That is twice Ebola\u2019s incubation period, so it\u2019s unlikely that anyone else could have been infected with the virus.\n\nThe milestone will allow Liberia to celebrate how far it has come, as responders \u201creally wrote a new book on how to deal with Ebola,\u201d said D.C. resident Brett Sedgewick, who traveled to the country last fall as a technical adviser for Global Communities, an aid group aligned with the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the virus has every ability to come back,\u201d he said.\n\nEbola claimed roughly 4,700 lives in Liberia \u2014 the most of any country \u2014 and continues to spread in neighbors Sierra Leone and Guinea, although transmission has dropped sharply in both countries.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week said it is no longer warning people to avoid nonessential travel to Liberia, but it is still urging them to take extra precautions. The CDC has not lifted its warnings about Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nAt its worst, 1,000 people were being infected per week, African countries were canceling flights to infected countries and U.S. officials were siphoning visitors into designated airports where they could be screened.\n\nPresident Obama cast the fight as a chance for the U.S. to demonstrate its leadership on the world stage and resisted efforts to stop flights from affected areas. Several cases were diagnosed in the U.S., and two men, who were infected with the virus in Africa and carried it to the U.S., died.\n\nMedical officials tightened protocols in the U.S., and Mr. Obama committed nearly 3,000 troops to the fight in Africa with a focus on Liberia. Britain and France focused on Sierra Leone and Guinea, their former colonies.\n\nScientists fast-tracked vaccine trials for Ebola, and global response teams persuaded West Africans to cease hands-on burial traditions that sped transmission.\n\nCases in Liberia dropped precipitously late last year, and Mr. Obama lauded Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf during her February visit to the White House.\n\n\u201cBecause of the heroism of so many people in Liberia, and because of the actions of the United States and ultimately the international community, we have made extraordinary strides in driving back Ebola,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the worst appears to be over, the U.S. is maintaining contact with the region.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, in a visit this week, told Liberians not to stigmatize survivors.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the Senate passed a bipartisan measure that would encourage Americans to lend a helping hand to the thousands of children orphaned by the West African outbreak.\n\nSen. James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who sponsored the measure, is a strong advocate for adoption, although his office said Americans should consider giving clothes, time or other assistance.\n\nWary of the next outbreak, the CDC plans to study the ability of the virus to spread through survivors\u2019 bodily fluids in Sierra Leone. It also will explore attitudes about the disease in Guinea.\n\nThe first project will study various fluids \u2014 semen, vaginal fluids, sweat, saliva, rectal fluids, tears, urine and breast milk \u2014 to learn \u201cif and how Ebola can be spread by survivors,\u201d according to the agency.\n\nThe study will test participants\u2019 fluids for the presence of the virus every two weeks \u2014 until their samples are negative \u2014 in exchange for $28 per visit, according to federal guidance published Wednesday.\n\nThe second study will assess whether Guinea\u2019s population understands Ebola, how it is transmitted and how they can help snuff out the disease, after reports of residents hiding ill people or attacking aid workers.\n\n\u201cSome believe that [Ebola] is transmitted by witchcraft, \u2018outsiders,\u2019 or health workers,\u201d the CDC notice said. \u201cSome lack understanding or confidence in control measures.\u201d\n\nGuinea is where the epidemic began in December 2013, although it has reported roughly 3,500 cases compared with Sierra Leone\u2019s 12,470 and about 2,300 fewer deaths than Liberia.\n\nResentment of foreign aid teams has impeded efforts at times. This week, the United Nations reported that violent demonstrations in the Guinean capital of Conakry \u201cagain impeded operations of Ebola response partners.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ebola epidemic that ravaged West Africa for more than a year could be declared over in Liberia on Saturday, marking a major milestone for the hard-hit nation after a nightmarish period of death and fear that awakened the globe to a long-ignored virus.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Ebola epidemic that ravaged West Africa for more than a year could be declared over in Liberia on Saturday, marking a major milestone for the hard-hit nation after a nightmarish period of death and fear that awakened the globe to a long-ignored virus.", "title": "Liberia Ebola outbreak to be declared over after yearlong struggle, 4,700 deaths", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/7/liberia-ebola-outbreak-to-be-declared-over-after-y/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/Ebola.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/Ebola.jpg", "title": "Liberia Ebola outbreak to be declared over after yearlong struggle, 4,", "description": "The Ebola epidemic that ravaged West Africa for more than a year could be declared over in Liberia on Saturday, marking a major milestone for the hard-hit nation after a nightmarish period of death an", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone"}, "article_summary": "That is twice Ebola\u2019s incubation period, so it\u2019s unlikely that anyone else could have been infected with the virus.\nThis week, the United Nations reported that violent demonstrations in the Guinean capital of Conakry \u201cagain impeded operations of Ebola response partners.\u201d\nEbola claimed roughly 4,700 lives in Liberia \u2014 the most of any country \u2014 and continues to spread in neighbors Sierra Leone and Guinea, although transmission has dropped sharply in both countries.\nScientists fast-tracked vaccine trials for Ebola, and global response teams persuaded West Africans to cease hands-on burial traditions that sped transmission.\nWary of the next outbreak, the CDC plans to study the ability of the virus to spread through survivors\u2019 bodily fluids in Sierra Leone."}
