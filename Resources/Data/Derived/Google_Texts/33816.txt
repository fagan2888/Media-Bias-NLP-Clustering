Obamacare’s National Hotline? 1-800-F…You

Sometimes, you just have to laugh. Yesterday, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made the MSM blitz by announcing the website, glitches and all, and the national call-in center, which is 1-800-318-2596. Now to make this work, you have to skip the 1, because on a phone keypad, no letters are assigned to the number 1. But spell out the rest, and this is what you get.

1-800-3(F) 8(U) 2(C) 5(K) 9(Y) 6(O).

Tragically, the federal government, with all their power, couldn’t trade the 1 out for another 8 at the end. Then, the President’s true sentiment towards all of you would be much plainer.

Then again, they’ve really never been that subtle, have they?
