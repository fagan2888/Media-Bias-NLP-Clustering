And on Saturday night, the L.A. Clippers.\n\nTen games against playoff teams, all coming after the coaching change from Brian Shaw to Melvin Hunt. While it may be a stretch to say the Nuggets never stood a chance, the odds of them coming out on the right side of the majority of those games weren\u2019t good.\n\nAnd on Saturday, they really weren\u2019t good against the Clippers \u2014 coming off the second night of a back-to-back set that started at San Antonio.\n\nThe well-rested Clippers hadn\u2019t played since Wednesday. And the Nuggets played without injured starting point guard Ty Lawson and then lost Jameer Nelson in the second quarter for the rest of the game.\n\nSo, yeah, given all of that, the Nuggets\u2019 107-92 loss Saturday night seemed about right.\n\n\u201cA very good team, and a very wounded team,\u201d Hunt said of the difference in the game. \u201cAnd a very wounded team that kind of happened all of a sudden. Ty was a late scratch. Didn\u2019t anticipate that. Obviously when Jameer went down those were our two rudders, they make us go. When those two guys went out it was a matter of survival.\u201d\n\nThe game was a struggle from the start. The Clippers sprinted to a 10-0 lead. Then to a 24-6 lead.\n\nAnd essentially, that was it.\n\nThe Nuggets looked as tired as they probably were. A host of things are weighing them down, the least of which is a schedule that sees them play 13 of the last 23 games against playoff teams. The Nuggets are currently 3-7 in those games.\n\nAnd that has derailed a hot start under Hunt, their interim coach. The competition ratcheted up tenfold, and the Nuggets just aren\u2019t as good as the teams they\u2019re facing. Otherwise, the Nuggets are 5-3 in the final 23 against teams with losing records or out of the playoff picture.\n\nA shortage of able bodies is becoming an issue. The Nuggets played the bulk of Saturday\u2019s game with just 10 players, and only one was a true point guard \u2014 rookie Erick Green.\n\nAnd when NBA star Chris Paul is on the other side, that is, well, tough.\n\nThe Clippers are playing their best basketball at the right time, winning nine of their past 10 games as they try to earn the highest playoff seed possible in the rough-and-tumble Western Conference.\n\nThe usual suspects provided the production for the Clippers. J.J. Redick led them with 24 points. Paul had 23 points, nine assists and five rebounds. DeAndre Jordan was a rebounding machine, collecting 22 to accompany 14 points and three blocked shots.\n\nThe Nuggets were led by Wilson Chandler\u2019s 17 points. Randy Foye chipped in 14.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets struggles continue with loss to Clippers", "title": "Nuggets struggles continue with loss to Clippers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/04/nuggets-struggles-continue-with-loss-to-clippers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150404__nuggets-losep1-1.jpg", "height": 472}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150404__nuggets-losep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T21:58:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T05:42:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc24\"", "article_summary": "The Nuggets played the bulk of Saturday\u2019s game with just 10 players, and only one was a true point guard \u2014 rookie Erick Green.\n\u201cA very good team, and a very wounded team,\u201d Hunt said of the difference in the game.\nAnd the Nuggets played without injured starting point guard Ty Lawson and then lost Jameer Nelson in the second quarter for the rest of the game.\nTen games against playoff teams, all coming after the coaching change from Brian Shaw to Melvin Hunt.\nSo, yeah, given all of that, the Nuggets\u2019 107-92 loss Saturday night seemed about right."}
