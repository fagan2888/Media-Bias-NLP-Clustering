He emphasized the lawsuits placed against Texas and how their outcome could potentially work against the program.\n\n\u201cIf we can win these lawsuits, Obamacare is obliterated,\u201d he said.\n\nHe promised the crowd he would stand against the Obama administration and that the Constitution would be his guide as Texas attorney general should he win the election.\n\n\u201cI want to use any available means under the Constitution to protect our state,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourclevelandnews.com", "description": "The San Jacinto County Republican party held a fundraiser on Sept. 8 with a special guest of honor: Texas Senator Ken Paxton Jr.", "title": "Paxton stumps for support in race for Texas attorney general", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/cleveland/news/paxton-stumps-for-support-in-race-for-texas-attorney-general/article_927da458-c251-5150-b99c-c6ad40b404e4.html", "image": {"width": 518, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/f9/9f9a89a8-d535-5e00-b9d8-d54ff603376b/54108840b64e3.image.jpg?resize=518%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "news", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "news", "description": "The San Jacinto County Republican party held a fundraiser on Sept. 8 with a special guest of honor: Texas Senator Ken Paxton Jr."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a12\"", "article_summary": "Paxton\u2019s next issue involved the Texas border, saying that the border agents do not have everything they need to do their job.\nHe is also the Republican candidate for the position of Texas attorney general in the upcoming election on Nov. 4.\nOn a federal level, Paxton said much of what the government would try to do could potentially harm a great deal of Texas.\nHe promised the crowd he would stand against the Obama administration and that the Constitution would be his guide as Texas attorney general should he win the election.\nPaxton said their actions impacted politics in Texas in a different manner than what had previously occurred."}
