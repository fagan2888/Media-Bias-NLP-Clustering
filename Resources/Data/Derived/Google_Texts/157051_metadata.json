LOUIS (AP) \u2014 The police chief on Thursday unapologetically defended the fatal shooting of a black 18-year-old who was killed by two white officers in a confrontation that drew protesters and unrest back to the streets.\n\nProtesters pledged to stand firm. Said the director of a group called the Organization for Black Struggle: \u201cWe will not go away.\u201d\n\nMansur Ball-Bey, who police said had a handgun, was shot as officers raided a home in a violence-plagued part of north St. Louis. Within an hour of Wednesday\u2019s shooting, more than 100 people converged on the scene, taunting officers and decrying the use of deadly force.\n\nA vacant building and at least one car were torched, police said. Officers responded with tear gas and arrested at least nine people on charges of impeding traffic and resisting arrest.\n\nThe scene unfolded less than two weeks after violence marred the anniversary of the day Michael Brown was fatally wounded by a white officer in nearby Ferguson. His death launched the national Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nSt. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the crowd-control tactics were justified because officers were being hit with bottles and bricks and protesters refused to clear out of the roadway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d certainly much rather our officers focused in the neighborhoods, interceding violence before it happens,\u201d Dotson said Thursday, noting that some in the neighborhood implored police to leave them alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic that we\u2019re in that neighborhood where police services are most needed, and people are telling us not to do our jobs.\u201d\n\nActivists vowed to continue their efforts.\n\n\u201cWe have a right to live in freedom and specifically free from fear,\u201d said Montague Simmons, executive director of the Organization for Black Struggle. \u201cThis can\u2019t go unchecked. We\u2019re going to stay in the street. No matter what (police) put forward, we are not going to stop.\u201d\n\nThe latest shooting happened while officers were serving a search warrant. They encountered Ball-Bey and another suspect running from the home, police said.\n\nBall-Bey turned and pointed a handgun at the officers, who shot him, authorities said. He died at the scene.\n\nThe handgun found in the dead man\u2019s possession had one round in the chamber and 13 in the magazine, Dotson said.\n\nSome protesters questioned the police claim that the suspect was armed. Distrust of police accounts has been common since Brown\u2019s death.\n\nOn the night of the Brown anniversary, 18-year-old Tyrone Harris Jr. was wounded by plainclothes officers in Ferguson after he allegedly first fired at them. His father called that account \u201ca bunch of lies\u201d and insisted his son was unarmed.\n\nLater, police released surveillance video that appeared to show the younger Harris pulling a handgun from his waistband and running in the direction of the officers.\n\n\u201cI understand people\u2019s skepticism,\u201d Dotson said Thursday. \u201cBut don\u2019t let social media and innuendo drive what you believe to be true. You have to let the facts speak.\u201d\n\nMayor Francis Slay pledged an \u201cindependent and transparent\u201d investigation of the shooting but stood behind police.\n\n\u201cThe police were in this neighborhood doing their job,\u201d Slay said at a meeting with the St. Louis Clergy Coalition, a group of black ministers. The meeting was at a church about a block from the shooting site.\n\nThe police chief and mayor said protesters should have their voices heard, but they differentiated between those who gather to protest and others who create mischief.\n\n\u201cWe have to be mindful of the fact that there are criminals who were at the protest as cover for their activity,\u201d Slay said.\n\nJoe Steiger, president of the St. Louis Police Officers\u2019 Association, the city\u2019s police union, said the chief\u2019s decision to pull manpower away from other crime-prone areas to monitor protests risks stretching the city\u2019s already thin police force.\n\nThe protests, he added, \u201cseem like they\u2019re never going to end.\u201d\n\nActivists said the police response was unnecessarily \u201cmilitaristic\u201d and an affront to free-speech rights.\n\nSteiger bristled at the notion that police are the villains and said trouble-makers during protesters are criminals.\n\n\u201cPolice don\u2019t start riots. Rioters start riots,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scene of Wednesday\u2019s shooting \u2014 known as the Fountain Park neighborhood \u2014 is a historically high-crime area that has seen an uptick in violence, with 127 confirmed homicides this year. There were 159 homicides in all of 2014 and 120 the year before that.\n\nA 30-year-old man was shot and killed there Monday. Last month, a man was charged with felony child endangerment after his 3-year-old nephew accidentally shot himself in the head after finding a loaded gun under a pillow in a bedroom. A market next to Wednesday\u2019s shooting was riddled with bullets this week and ransacked hours after Ball-Bey\u2019s death. Thieves made off with cellphones, cigarettes, food and medicine.\n\nFountain Park is also the area near where a 93-year-old veteran who was part of the famous all-black Tuskegee Airmen of World War II was the victim of two crimes within a few minutes Sunday \u2014 being robbed and then having his car stolen. The veteran was unhurt, and his car was found Tuesday blocks from where it was taken.\n\n\u201cRight now, you see a police officer and your first instinct is to run,\u201d said Fred Price, 33, who lives near the shooting scene. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get shot by the police.\u201d\n\nSomething like this, he said, makes people \u201cwant to keep the police out of the neighborhood.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The police chief on Thursday unapologetically defended the fatal shooting of a black 18-year-old who was killed by two white officers in a confrontation that drew protesters and unrest back to the streets.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The police chief on Thursday unapologetically defended the fatal shooting of a black 18-year-old who was killed by two white officers in a confrontation that drew protesters and unrest back to the streets.", "title": "Sam Dotson, St. Louis police chief, defends fatal shooting by officers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/21/sam-dotson-st-louis-police-chief-defends-fatal-sho/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/20/0d626b125a78ac257f0f6a70670043b4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/20/0d626b125a78ac257f0f6a70670043b4.jpg", "description": "The police chief on Thursday unapologetically defended the fatal shooting of a black 18-year-old who was killed by two white officers in a confrontation that drew protesters and unrest back to the str", "card": "summary", "title": "Sam Dotson, St. Louis police chief, defends fatal shooting by officers"}, "Author": "Jim Suhr and Jim Salter", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Mansur Ball Bey"}, "article_summary": "St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the crowd-control tactics were justified because officers were being hit with bottles and bricks and protesters refused to clear out of the roadway.\n\u201cRight now, you see a police officer and your first instinct is to run,\u201d said Fred Price, 33, who lives near the shooting scene.\nST.
