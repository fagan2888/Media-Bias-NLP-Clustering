Rick Perry (R-TX) as he took a swing through Texas in his second week back on the campaign trail since launching his presidential campaign in Addison, Texas on June 4th.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis is the third part of our exclusive interview with Perry (don\u2019t miss Part I and Part II), in which he shares his thoughts about Texas\u2019 successful criminal justice reforms, his philosophy on the Tenth Amendment and how he would encourage more innovation and freedom for the states, and the special role his wife Anita will play in his campaign.\n\nHow Texas became the national model for criminal justice reform\n\nTexas\u2019 stellar record of job creation is well-known, but Texas has also made impressive strides in the area of criminal justice reform. During his fifteen years as Texas\u2019 longest-serving Governor, Perry supported and signed into law multiple substantive reforms, including creating specialty courts like drug courts and veterans courts that were better able to address the unique needs of certain types of offenders, expanding alternatives to incarceration like drug treatment programs and community supervision for low risk and first time nonviolent offenders, and directing more resources towards probation and parole monitoring.\n\nAs Breitbart Texas reported, Texas\u2019 criminal justice reforms experienced successes beyond what even their most optimistic supporters had hoped. Texas was able to not only avoid building any new prisons despite the state\u2019s exploding population, it even closed three of them. Texas saved over $2 billion, all the more incredible considering that this figure includes the funds spent on the new and expanded treatment programs and incarceration alternatives.\n\nMost importantly, the drop in Texas\u2019 incarceration rate was done without any corresponding detriment to public safety. Texas\u2019 crime rate is currently the lowest it has been since 1968, and violent crime, property crime, and recidivism rates have all gone down across the board.\n\nThe Texas model of criminal justice reform has won accolades from conservatives and liberals across the country, as dozens of state legislatures and even the federal government have sought to replicate the Lone Star State\u2019s success. Texas itself continued enacting substantive reforms throughout Perry\u2019s time as Governor, and even continued through this just-completed legislative session, with several new reform bills being passed, including decriminalizing truancy, expanding re-entry programs, and new alternatives for first time nonviolent offenders facing minor drug possession charges.\n\nBreitbart News asked Perry about his support for these reforms, and how the work had started. Perry described a conversation that he had had with John Creuzot, who at that time was a Texas District Court Judge in Dallas.\n\n\u201cYou know, we went on a really big [prison] building spree back in the early 1990s, under [former Democrat Texas Governor] Ann Richards\u2019 administration,\u201d said Perry, \u201ccoupled with really harsh sentencing.\u201d This combination of harsh sentencing, a growing population, and new prison construction led to Texas having one of the highest incarceration rates in the country.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 2000 to 2010 Texas\u2019 population grew to over 25.1 million people, an increase of 4.3 million, the highest growth in the country during that period, and the estimated population in 2014 was almost 27 million. Despite this rapid growth, the state\u2019s prison population stayed virtually stagnant during Perry\u2019s tenure as Governor, and has even started to decrease as reforms have continued to be implemented.\n\n\u201cNobody gets confused about Texas \u2014 we are a tough on crime state \u2014 but what we\u2019ve become is a very smart on crime state,\u201d said Perry.\n\nPerry told Breitbart News how he had been inspired from those initial conversations with Judge Creuzot, and then had worked with former State Rep. Jerry Madden (R-Plano) and State Sen. John Whitmire (D-Houston) to encourage their efforts to put together a package of legislation.\n\n\u201c[Judge Creuzot] was talking to me about this concept of drug courts, and it made sense,\u201d said Perry. Moreover, he added, \u201cthis was a really bipartisan thing,\u201d supported by Democrats like Creuzot and Whitmire, and Republicans like Madden, who he called the \u201creal champion\u201d of the initial reforms.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s a Democratic or a Republican idea, I care if it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whose idea it is, I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s a Democratic idea or a Republican idea,\u201d he continued. \u201cI care if it\u2019s a good idea, and [the creation of drug courts] was a good idea, it made sense to me, and the results are very powerful.\u201d\n\nEncouraged by the success of the drug courts, Texas added a number of other specialty courts, including prostitution courts and veterans\u2019 courts, that have a better understanding of both the unique challenges faced by veterans as well as the benefits and programs available to them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of different types of specialty courts now, that give the judges the flexibility to be able to rehabilitate, but [also] to punish. I mean, we\u2019re not saying, it\u2019s fine to go out and commit these crimes just because they\u2019re nonviolent\u2026there\u2019s a punishment, but we\u2019re not going to destroy your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country\u2019s always been about second chances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country\u2019s always been about second chances, giving people a second chance,\u201d said the Governor who is hoping that voters will give him a second chance during this campaign.\n\n\u201cAnd it needs to always be that way,\u201d Perry continued, comparing the early colonists who came to America to flee religious persecution, to immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island at the turn of the Twentieth Century, to Texans \u201cwho made an error [and were] deserving a second chance.\u201d\n\nPerry himself has continued to support criminal justice reform efforts across the country, joining the Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s (TPPF) Right on Crime campaign, along with Madden, who serves as a senior fellow for the organization. \u201cVery few elected officials have made the kind of impact on criminal justice issues that Rick Perry has,\u201d said Brooke Rollins, TPPF\u2019s President and CEO, crediting him with \u201cthe sweeping reforms that, in addition to lowering crime rates and saving taxpayers money, made \u2018the Texas model\u2019 on criminal justice\u2014as well as the Right on Crime campaign\u2014possible.\u201d\n\nJustifiably proud of the results of Texas\u2019 reforms, Perry told Breitbart News that their benefits extend far beyond just the raw numbers, pointing to the impact on human lives:\n\nThree prisons shut down in the past four years. Two billion dollars worth of savings to the taxpayers of this state. But what I will suggest is even more important: the lives that have been saved. People who didn\u2019t go to prison for a long period of time and learn how to become a hardened criminal and then they come out and that\u2019s all they know. They have been able to get a second chance and are becoming, or already are, productive members of society. And that\u2019s smart.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of the Tenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nMentioning how many other states were enacting their own versions of Texas\u2019 reforms, Perry cited this as an example of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution at work, and part of the inspiration for his campaign for President:\n\nOther states are looking at [Texas], and copying it. That\u2019s the beauty of the Tenth Amendment. That\u2019s what [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Louis Brandeis was talking about when he said the states are the laboratories of democracy. States are supposed to experiment. From time to time, they will foul up. And they will try something that doesn\u2019t work. But he said, at least they haven\u2019t destroyed the Republic. And that\u2019s a powerful story\u2026 One of the reasons that I\u2019m running for President is to be an advocate for the states, to devolve this power back out of Washington, D.C. to the states.\n\nPerry\u2019s support for experimentation by the states includes a wide latitude even for ideas that he may not personally like, such as Colorado\u2019s recent legalization of marijuana. Perry has a well-established record of opposing both marijuana legalization and incarceration-based penalties for minor use and possession, instead favoring decriminalization, which, in Perry\u2019s words, \u201ckeeps people from going to prison and destroying their lives.\u201d\n\nWhen I think about Louis Brandeis\u2019 statement about states experimenting, I can\u2019t help but think about Colorado\u2026they are experimenting with marijuana. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, and I think they will find later that they\u2019re going to have some challenges, problems\u2026we\u2019ll see. But I will defend their right to experiment on different ideas and policies and concepts, because that competition is how this country\u2019s going to continue to be stronger.\n\nHis enthusiasm for the Tenth Amendment extends beyond criminal justice reform. Perry, like many other Republican governors, has long been an advocate for transforming federal programs like Medicaid into block grants to the states, under which the federal government would give the funds directly to the states in a lump sum for them to manage and distribute as best fits the needs of their people.\n\n\u201cI would substantially give flexibility back to the states\u2026substantially reduce Washington\u2019s effect on the states,\u201d said Perry, not just for Medicaid, but many other programs as well, describing an example of how funding for federal transportation projects often comes with requirements that are a poor fit for what the local community wants or needs.\n\nPerry would also want states to have flexibility regarding health care. Like virtually all Republican candidates since Obamacare was enacted, Perry wants to repeal the health care law, and promised that a detailed policy proposal with his alternatives would be forthcoming very soon. Avik Roy, a nationally-recognized health care policy expert whose areas of expertise include how Obamacare and Medicaid hurt the poor, and whom Perry hired as his campaign\u2019s Senior Policy Advisor, will undoubtedly play a major role in putting together what Perry referred to as a \u201cpretty expansive restructuring\u201d of the health care system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re big believers that the states would come up with a lot of innovative ideas to deliver health care, and give people choices,\u201d said Perry, who added, \u201cI really believe the only reason that the states are a little bit hesitant to be as strong as maybe I am on this, is that they\u2019ve been blackmailed with their own money\u2026oh, but when you take it, there\u2019s all these strings attached.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst Lady of Texas for 14 years, my wife for 32 years, and my girlfriend for 49 years.\u201d\n\nThe conversation turned to Perry\u2019s wife, Anita, who had given a heartfelt introductory speech for her husband at his campaign launch two weeks prior. When the Perry campaign sent out a press release announcing the campaign leadership, included on that list was Minnie Salinas, the \u201cChief of Staff to Mrs. Perry.\u201d\n\nThis inclusion of the candidate\u2019s spouse as an integral part of the core campaign team is rare, if not virtually unheard of, for presidential or even statewide campaigns. Breitbart News asked Perry about structuring his campaign with his wife in such an essential role, and he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018structured\u2019 that way, she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe probably talks to [Perry campaign manager] Jeff Miller as much or more than I do,\u201d continued Perry. \u201cI mean, she knows what\u2019s going on\u2026she\u2019s really engaged in the campaign, she\u2019s smart, she has her areas of expertise, particular on health care, so she\u2019s very involved.\u201d\n\nMrs. Perry worked in the nursing profession for nearly two decades, and the nursing school at Texas Tech University, as well as nursing endowments at West Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at San Antonio, are named in her honor.\n\nBreitbart News confirmed Mrs. Perry\u2019s involvement with the campaign in a later phone conversation with Miller, who described her as an important and positive contributor to the campaign team.\n\nMrs. Perry also already has experience being a First Lady, he was happy to note. Perry grinned as he mentioned how she had been First Lady of Texas \u201cfor fourteen years, and has been my wife for thirty-two, and my girlfriend for forty-nine.\u201d\n\nDifference between today and 2012 is \u201cday and night\u201d\n\nThe support of his wife is not Perry\u2019s only reason to smile about this campaign. Relaxed and confident, he told Breitbart News that he was enjoying being out on the campaign trail, and was pleased with the positive reception he was receiving.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for a long time,\u201d said Perry. \u201cNobody went to Iowa more than we did over the last eighteen months. I mean, we go to New Hampshire and South Carolina a lot. We\u2019ve got really good organizations put in place there.\u201d\n\nSince the campaign officially launched, Perry described the reception as \u201cbigger\u201d and \u201cmore energetic,\u201d but the major difference was between how this campaign had started as compared to 2011.\n\n\u201cOh, well, the difference between now and then is, you know, day and night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe rolled into [Charleston, South Carolina, where he announced his 2012 campaign] on the day of the [Iowa] Straw poll, and people had picked who they were going to support a year before, I mean, literally, a year before. Or they had a group who they were looking at, and we weren\u2019t even in the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be on the debate stage.\u201d\n\nPerry was absolutely confident that he will make the cutoff for the Republican primary debates, which the current rules set at the top ten in the average of recent polls for the first one hosted by Fox News.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be on the debate stage. I\u2019m a lot more interested in what we\u2019re going to say on the debate stage than whether I\u2019m going to be there. I\u2019ll be there,\u201d he vowed.\n\nTo get to that debate stage, and then hopefully to the stage in Cleveland, Ohio to accept the Republican nomination for President, Perry believes the key will be making sure voters hear about his record, and that many will be pleasantly surprised by what they learn.\n\n\u201cI want them to know about our record,\u201d said Perry, \u201cand I want them to know that for the last decade, the population of Texas grew 5.6 million, faster than any other state in the nation. We created more jobs than any other state in the nation by a tremendous amount, but we also cleaned up the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour conventional wisdom would tell you that when you add 5.6 million people to the population of this state \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of pickup trucks,\u201d he quipped, before turning serious again. \u201cWe have the largest refining capacity in the country, on the Gulf Coast, which by the way, also puts out a lot of emissions. It\u2019s also at a latitude that is conducive for the production of ozone. All three of those things would tell you, conventional wisdom would tell you, the media would tell you, that that\u2019s making for an environment that is worse.\u201d\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not what ended up happening in Texas. According to Perry, \u201cNitrogen oxide levels went down 62.5 percent since 2001. Ozone levels went down 23 percent. And regardless of where you are on the whole climate change issue, carbon dioxide levels in Texas went down 9 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the twelfth largest economy in the world,\u201d emphasized Perry, and \u201cthis is where I think we need a President who actually tries to sit down and bring people together\u2026 If the goal is, we\u2019re going to try to have an economy where people can have a job and take care of themselves, and an environment that\u2019s clean, I mean if you\u2019re against either one of those, hold your hand up, OK? So if we agree on that, how did that happen?\u201d\n\nThe solution in Texas, said Perry, was relatively simple. \u201cWe gave incentives to these companies, these big fleet operators, to change over their old dirty-burning diesels to cleaner burning ones. We gave them credit on their franchise taxes. They responded to that incentive. We saw substantial shift from older, dirty-burning electric generation to natural gas, which is cleaner burning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want people to know that we went from twenty-seventh in the nation in high school graduation rates to second highest in the nation. I want people to know what we did on criminal justice reform,\u201d Perry said, adding that if voters will look at those two things, plus Texas\u2019 economic growth, they would want to support him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want people to know. If they\u2019ll just know the facts, then I\u2019m happy that they\u2019ll make the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur\u201d campaign, not \u201cmy\u201d campaign\n\nAs a final note, having now listened back through the over 35 minute long recording of our interview a few times, and thinking back on previous conversations with the Governor, an interesting speech pattern can be recognized. Perry frequently uses the first person plural \u2014 \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour,\u201d instead of \u201cI\u201d or \u201cmy\u201d \u2014 when describing his record as Governor, experiences on the campaign trail, and so on. It\u2019s not as clearly seen in the excerpts quoted in these articles, but is far more evident when hearing the interview straight through.\n\nRather than coming across as an example of pluralis majestatis, the \u201croyal we,\u201d Perry\u2019s use of the first person plural seems far more grounded in his sense of teamwork than any sort of personal ego. The proud Texan certainly is not lacking in any confidence (some might say swagger), but he almost always drops a mention of at least one or two people who played a part in whatever accomplishment he is describing.\n\nFor example, when he talks about policies that were enacted while he was Governor, he will describe it as \u201cour record\u201d not \u201cmy record,\u201d and he will name the legislators who helped push the bills forward, as he did above regarding Madden and Whitmire\u2019s roles in Texas\u2019 criminal justice reforms. And when he discusses his preparation over the past few years for this campaign \u2014 again, describing it as \u201cour campaign\u201d far more than \u201cmy campaign\u201d \u2014 he mentions his campaign policy advisers, as well as the experts at various think tanks and policy institutes across the country who worked with him.\n\nNo single person, including Governors and even Presidents, can possibly be an expert in all aspects of all subjects. The contrast between Perry\u2019s willingness to seek out and respect others who can contribute valuable ideas and President \u201cI\u2019m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters, better political than my political director\u201d Barack Obama, could not be more stark.\n\nRead Part I of Breitbart News\u2019 exclusive interview with Gov. Perry, in which he discusses how his lack of trust in President Obama made him unable to support the \u201cObamatrade\u201d bills, despite his belief in free trade.\n\nRead Part II, in which he shares his perspective on how this campaign differs from his 2012 attempt, why he believes that his record stacks up favorably against any of his competitors, what he believes will be a major challenge for former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL), his thoughts on the abuses at the VA, and a special memory he shared about time he spent with Breitbart News founder, the late Andrew Breitbart.\n\nNote: A previous version of this post triggered an automated system that incorrectly confused Perry campaign manager Jeff Miller with U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, whose name is spelled identically. The error has been corrected.
