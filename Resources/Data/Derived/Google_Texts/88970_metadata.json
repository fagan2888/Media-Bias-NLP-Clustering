The test in San Francisco began earlier this month and has spread to at least 15 other cities. Now USPS wants to take a \u201ccustomized delivery\u201d service to select metro areas nationwide.\n\nRelated: Post Office Paid $287K for Trucks It Can\u2019t Find\n\nUSPS would \u201cprovide delivery of groceries and other prepackaged goods,\u201d between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m., when its trucks are usually idle, the agency said in its proposal. A grocery store would drop off the previously packed and \u201cbranded totes\u201d at post offices between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. From there, postal carriers would deliver the \u201cperishable packages at pre-designated spots without ringing the bell or knocking on the door.\u201d\n\nIf the idea gets the all-clear, USPS would begin its wider test at the end of October. It would last about two years.\n\nIn the test phase in San Francisco, USPS averaged 160 packages a day to 38 designated zip code areas. It has asked regulators for a special OK for revenues to exceed $10 million a year, but says it has \u201ctaken steps to ensure\u201d that revenues don\u2019t go beyond $50 million.\n\nRelated: Big Idea to Save the Post Office: Turn It into a Bank\n\nUSPS noted that \u201cgrocery delivery services are expanding across the nation, with businesses ranging from the nation\u2019s largest retailers, to niche operators, to the popular car service Uber\u2026. With its operational reach, the Postal Service has an opportunity to provide retailers a nationwide solution that offers a trained workforce and the trust and reliability of the Postal Service brand.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United States Postal Service, starved for cash, wants to feed its coffers by deliv", "title": "Coffee, Butter, Milk and Meat\u2014Delivered by Your Mailman?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/Coffee-Butter-Milk-and-Meat-Delivered-Your-Mailman", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222013_mailbox_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/Coffee-Butter-Milk-and-Meat-Delivered-Your-Mailman", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222013_mailbox_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The United States Postal Service, starved for cash, wants to feed its coffers by deliv", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06e0\"", "article_summary": "With its operational reach, the Postal Service has an opportunity to provide retailers a nationwide solution that offers a trained workforce and the trust and reliability of the Postal Service brand.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nThe United States Postal Service, starved for cash, wants to feed its coffers by delivering groceries straight to your door.\nNow USPS wants to take a \u201ccustomized delivery\u201d service to select metro areas nationwide.\nThe test in San Francisco began earlier this month and has spread to at least 15 other cities.\nIn the test phase in San Francisco, USPS averaged 160 packages a day to 38 designated zip code areas."}
