To the Editor:

Re “Christians Flock to Shared Care” (front page, March 11):

It’s praiseworthy for individuals and families to form groups to share medical expenses. It’s something else entirely to exempt these group members from the Affordable Care Act’s mandated shared responsibility to carry essential minimum insurance coverage.

Consider whose “burdens” are shared. Health care sharing ministries share expenses among vetted members, a group of religious believers who can afford to pay the monthly “shares.” The health law, on the other hand, mandates that we (most of us) share the medical financial risks of a much larger group, including those who cannot afford coverage.

We can’t forget, too, that sharing ministries rely heavily on publicly funded insurance like Medicare, on charity programs and on steeply discounted provider bills to pay first dollar for their members’ care, leaving ministry members to (potentially) pay last dollar.

Health care sharing ministry members should not be exempt from sharing the burdens of all people, especially not in the name of religion.
