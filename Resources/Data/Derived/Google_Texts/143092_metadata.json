It passed the Legislature without objection, and it had the support of Gov. Paul LePage and his administration.\n\nBut now, LePage and his administration are flouting this state law when it comes to child care centers. Federal law concerning background checks for child care center employees has changed, and LePage is refusing to implement all of the new federally required provisions. In refusing to do so, LePage is not only violating a federal law. He\u2019s violating the state law that directs him to obey the relevant federal statute.\n\nWhen Congress reauthorized the federal Child Care and Development Fund block grant program in 2014, the background check requirement for child care centers grew to include a check of criminal records and sex offender registries in every state where an employee or prospective employee has lived in the past five years, a check of a handful of federal databases and a fingerprint check against FBI records.\n\nThe LePage administration is refusing to carry out the fingerprint provision, even though it says it will require every other component of the more comprehensive criminal background check by Sept. 30, 2017 \u2014 the date specified in federal law. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services says the administration\u2019s refusal is related to the additional cost to child care centers and the potential for the fingerprint check to violate an employee\u2019s civil liberties.\n\nBut the additional cost of fingerprinting is likely to be minimal, especially considering that children\u2019s safety is the objective. The FBI charges $18 to conduct a fingerprint check, and law enforcement agencies across the state have said they\u2019re willing to help child care centers implement this requirement at little or no cost. A fingerprint check, after all, can pick up on criminal convictions a name-only check might not, such as offenses committed under different names or in states where a prospective employee hasn\u2019t indicated he or she previously lived.\n\nDon\u2019t Maine\u2019s youngest children deserve this extra layer of assurance? Don\u2019t parents deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing the child care center where their children are spending their days has done everything it can to vet its employees?\n\nIt\u2019s deeply troubling that LePage won\u2019t stand up for the state\u2019s youngest residents.\n\nWhat\u2019s also deeply troubling is that LePage apparently sees fit to choose portions of federal law to follow and others to ignore. This choice has consequences: The law directs the federal government to withhold 5 percent of a state\u2019s Child Care and Development Fund block grant for noncompliance. Based on Maine\u2019s $17.3 million grant this year, that could work out to an $864,000 loss in the next federal fiscal year. That\u2019s $864,000 that low-income families are depending on to help them pay for the cost of child care. Some 4,324 children received child care with the help of the block grant in 2015.\n\nWhat\u2019s further troubling is that there\u2019s a state law directing the LePage administration to respect federal requirements, and he and his administration still see fit to flout it.\n\nSo, what are Maine lawmakers who have repeatedly affirmed background check requirements for child care centers to do? A bill explicitly requiring the LePage administration to comply with the fingerprinting provisions of federal law is making its way through the Legislature.\n\nLawmakers shouldn\u2019t need this bill, but a governor with no respect for state and federal laws \u2014 and apparently little regard for the safety of the state\u2019s youngest residents \u2014 leaves them little choice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill explicitly requiring the LePage administration to comply with the fingerprinting provisions of federal law is making its way through the Legislature.
