Despite this, an eighth investigation from a House select committee remains active.\n\nThe Benghazi fiasco would understandably lead you to think that Congress\u2019 oversight power has devolved into just another tool for partisan grandstanding. That would be a shame, because the ability to call attention to issues inside and outside of government, and extract real accountability as a result, is one of the most important duties of Congress, especially given how the Capitol has become a legislation-free zone.\n\nRelated: Sen. Graham Calls GOP Benghazi Report \u2018Full of Crap\u2019\n\nIn fact, the Democrats\u2019 loss of the Senate, and one key retirement, will hollow out Congress\u2019 investigatory appetite, which is good news for corporations who routinely break the law, and the regulators who let them. Even the Obama administration will benefit from having one of Congress\u2019 most important powers de-fanged from within.\n\nWith a Republican-led Senate Banking Committee, for example, you would probably not see the grilling that New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley took last week over the regional bank\u2019s woeful supervision record, disturbing revelations of sharing confidential information with banks, and recent tapes showing supervisors backing away from questioning financial titan Goldman Sachs. Not one Republican showed up for the subcommittee hearing.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee have been fighting to release their report on America\u2019s shameful history of torture after 9/11. Republican Richard Burr of North Carolina, who will take over the chairmanship in January, has said that he wouldn\u2019t even hold public Intelligence Committee hearings, let alone release a sensitive report. It\u2019s pretty clear that the administration has decided to slow-walk signing off on the release until Republicans take over and subsequently stick it in a drawer.\n\nThese represent real and not just rhetorical steps backward. The torture report\u2019s release would force a reckoning with acts committed in our name, and make it that much more difficult to ever revisit those tactics. The Federal Reserve tried to pre-empt the Banking subcommittee hearing by announcing a review of its supervision practices. Indeed, any improvement in captured financial regulators\u2019 conduct must be attributed in large measure to pressure from the likes of Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) looking over their shoulders. In other words, lawmakers have the power to alter policy, even without legislation.\n\nRelated: Warren Clearly Favored Over Hillary by Liberal Dems\n\nThat was certainly true of retiring Sen. Carl Levin\u2019s (D-MI) tenure as head of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations from 2007 to today. Over the past several years, the subcommittee has practically elevated itself into an outside white-collar law enforcement office, detailing corporate crimes and illicit practices with far more precision than those empowered to do the job. Armed with subpoena power and an experienced, talented staff under the direction of chief counsel Elise Bean, the subcommittee stood out as one of the few bright spots in this era of Congress. Reports meticulously documented corporate tax evasion, Wall Street malfeasance, and federal contractor corruption.\n\nMost important, the subcommittee\u2019s work did not merely give politicians an opportunity to scream at people in suits \u2014 often the sole output of many Congressional investigations. Levin\u2019s team actually influenced policy.\n\nFor example, the Levin report on the credit card industry\u2019s abusive practices formed the basis of consumer protection legislation called the CARD Act. And the committee\u2019s 2011 case studies of the financial crisis ended up more detailed and damning than the official report on the collapse. This unquestionably influenced the rule-writing of Dodd-Frank.\n\nRelated: Democrats Have Forgotten What Made Them Great\n\nLevin\u2019s report on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s London Whale trade came at a sensitive moment for the Dodd-Frank provision he co-authored prohibiting banks from making risky proprietary trades for their own profit, known as the Volcker rule. The report provided evidence that the rule needed to be strengthened to prevent dangerous derivative gambling masquerading as hedges of risk. Eventually, the Volcker rule closed the loophole and banned London Whale-type trades, a rare instance of bank regulations getting tougher through the implementation process.\n\nOften, Levin\u2019s investigations ended up well ahead of law enforcement, effectively handing over cases to the Justice Department on a silver platter. The subcommittee exposed HSBC\u2019s decade of shamelessly facilitating money laundering for terrorist groups and Mexican drug cartels. Sadly, the Justice Department ended up letting HSBC go with a minor fine and a deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nLevin\u2019s subcommittee report on Credit Suisse\u2019s efforts to help wealthy Americans avoid taxes did lead to criminal charges. But without Levin\u2019s team, law enforcement may never have made the attempt. In the previously mentioned Banking subcommittee hearing, New York Fed President William Dudley highlighted the Credit Suisse case as an example of how banks are no longer \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d But Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) pointed out that Levin uncovered the revelations first. \u201cShouldn\u2019t a regulator discover these facts,\u201d Merkley asked at the hearing. \u201cWhy did it take a U.S. Senate committee? Doesn\u2019t that indicate that you\u2019re asleep at the switch?\u201d\n\nLevin\u2019s swan song, a two-day hearing and report on market manipulation in Wall Street\u2019s purchase of physical commodities, displayed why the subcommittee was so critical. Building on earlier media reports, the subcommittee detailed a variety of pitfalls from bank intervention in commodities, particularly Goldman Sachs\u2019 ownership of aluminum warehouses in Detroit. By controlling warehouse operations and creating artificial scarcity, Goldman influenced futures markets and raised prices for manufacturers. The report was clear enough that even skeptics recognized the potential consequences.\n\nRelated: Why Wall Street Breeds So Many Bad Apples\n\nAt the hearings, representatives from JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley stressed that they planned to exit the commodities business, and Goldman Sachs announced it would wind down its uranium-trading unit. Moreover, the New York Fed\u2019s Dudley said in his Congressional hearing that \u201cwe do have to be concerned about commodities activities that expose banks to very large losses.\u201d So the final Subcommittee on Permanent Investigations hearing yielded results, just like the previous ones.\n\nCarl Levin\u2019s career includes plenty of legislative accomplishments. But these investigative accomplishments almost overshadow them. Politicians should not be judged merely by the laws they pass, but the difference they make. Late in his career, Levin showed that aggressive investigation and oversight can drive real policy improvements. Not only will he be sorely missed, but so will that spirit of following the evidence, questioning power and exposing the truth.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Late last Friday, the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on Benghazi, the seventh s", "title": "Congressional Oversight Doesn\u2019t Have to Be a Benghazi-Style Joke", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/25/Congressional-Oversight-Doesn-t-Have-Be-Benghazi-Style-Joke", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06212012_Issa_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/25/Congressional-Oversight-Doesn-t-Have-Be-Benghazi-Style-Joke", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06212012_Issa_article.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Late last Friday, the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on Benghazi, the seventh s", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Levin\u2019s subcommittee report on Credit Suisse\u2019s efforts to help wealthy Americans avoid taxes did lead to criminal charges.\nThe Federal Reserve tried to pre-empt the Banking subcommittee hearing by announcing a review of its supervision practices.\nNot one Republican showed up for the subcommittee hearing.\nThe Benghazi fiasco would understandably lead you to think that Congress\u2019 oversight power has devolved into just another tool for partisan grandstanding.\nDemocrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee have been fighting to release their report on America\u2019s shameful history of torture after 9/11."}
