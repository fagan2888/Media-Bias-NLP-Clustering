This year, however, in order to give back to Lopez because of her fighting spirit, they chose, \u201cI\u2019m gonna love you through it,\u201d by country artist Martina McBride. In less than a minute, Lopez was in tears.\n\n\u201cGetting cancer does not make someone a hero. But inspiring others to hold on to hope while at his/her personal darkest hour does. This lady is a hero,\u201d Breinberg wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nAs the students got close to the end, they sang one chorus a cappella as they held up pink carnations for their teacher. \u201cWhen you\u2019re weak, I\u2019ll be strong,\u201d the students sang.\n\nBreast cancer is a serious disease that affects women across the United States. The American Cancer Society reports that about one in eight women in America will develop breast cancer during their lifetime. Approximately 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed per year. But thanks to early detection, death rates have been declining steadily since 1989.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for this special moment. It was wonderful. It\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s not easy, but I will get through it because I have wonderful friends at this school,\u201d Lopez said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "adriana, lopez, school, teacher, ps22, nyc, given, tearful, surprise, school, choir, after", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Staten Island students gave their teacher a special surprise that would make her breast cancer diagnosis easier to bear.", "title": "NYC Teacher With Breast Cancer Given A Surprise She Won't Soon Forget [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/adriana-lopez-school-teacher-ps22-nyc-given-tearful-surprise-school-choir-after-344552", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/24/adriana-lopez-school-teacher-ps22-nyc-given-tearful-surprise-school-choir-after.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Staten Island students gave their teacher a special surprise that would make her breast cancer diagnosis easier to bear.", "title": "NYC Teacher With Breast Cancer Given A Surprise She Won't Soon Forget [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/adriana-lopez-school-teacher-ps22-nyc-given-tearful-surprise-school-choir-after-344552", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/24/adriana-lopez-school-teacher-ps22-nyc-given-tearful-surprise-school-choir-after.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/24/adriana-lopez-school-teacher-ps22-nyc-given-tearful-surprise-school-choir-after.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-24T13:46:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T14:45:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Staten Island students gave their teacher a special surprise that would make her breast cancer diagnosis easier to bear."}, "article_summary": "The American Cancer Society reports that about one in eight women in America will develop breast cancer during their lifetime.\nIt\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s not easy, but I will get through it because I have wonderful friends at this school,\u201d Lopez said.\nApproximately 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed per year.\nAdriana Lopez, a teacher at Public School 22 in Staten Island, received a heartwarming surprise from a chorus of students singing to her after she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.\nBreast cancer is a serious disease that affects women across the United States."}
