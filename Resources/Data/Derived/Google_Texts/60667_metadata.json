Alison Lundergan Grimes is running not only because democrats know that women vs. men has been a winning ticket for them, but because they want to increase their majority in the Senate in order to keep Obamacare and pass gun control legislation.\n\nGrimes is part of the ticket Obama is asking his liberal friends to support in order to accomplish those goals.\n\nNow you know Kentucky. She\u2019s the New \u201cObama Girl\u201d.\n\nOh sure, this is some birther blogger fringe dude, so no biggie. It doesn\u2019t represent the GOP.\n\nOh, wait. The NRSC\u2019s verified account tweeted that article out and the @Team_Mitch Political Director retweeted it:\n\nIs Alison Grimes Is The New \"Obama Girl\u201d? http://t.co/K7wPjbZMb5 #KYSEN via @marcuscarey \u2014 NRSC (@NRSC) November 19, 2013\n\nObama Girl? Yes, of course they would call this very powerful woman whose popularity and strength they can\u2019t fight an \u201cObama girl\u201d.\n\nGrimes is the current Secretary of State of Kentucky, and a lawyer.\n\nGrimes doesn\u2019t play these little boy games. She\u2019s all Southern steel magnolia with her gorgeous smile and her sugar coated daggers. In a web ad, she took on Republican incumbent opponent McConnell\u2019s dirty tricks directly, \u201cYour campaign wants to play silly games about where I am and where I stand. Well I\u2019m right here in Kentucky, Senator, where I\u2019ll be holding you accountable for voting to double Medicare premiums on Kentucky seniors, including our retired coal miners, for being against requiring the Department of Defense to buy equipment that\u2019s made in America first, for failing to stand up for women when you voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and the Violence Against Women Act, and for opposing raising the minimum wage over and over again while you became a multimillionaire in public office.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama girl\u201d is the close relative to the \u201cObama Cheerleader\u201d smear. According to certain people, all women who support Obama are naturally easily dismissed sexual objects \u2014 dumb, useless idiots. The GOP thinks this is the way to our hearts and our votes. We\u2019re so dumb that we won\u2019t notice.\n\nNever mind that Obama\u2019s administration has set historical records supporting women in policy, as Grimes detailed in her web ad. V.P. Joe Biden is no small part of the support for women from this administration but no one ever accuses a woman of being a Biden cheerleader. Ponder that while pretending the smear has no southern strategy to it.\n\nBut Grimes is not an Obama supporter. She is a politician running for office. Republicans are desperately trying to tie her to the president since they have nothing else on her than making her the cheerleader for the black guy.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t afford to rebrand because the truth is that they have nothing else. They can try to reduce Alison Grimes to a sex object Obama girl, but it\u2019s not as if Ms. Grimes hasn\u2019t dealt with this sort of immaturity before. It starts in about the 6th grade.\n\nIt gets even worse. Joe Sonka, the News editor at LEO Weekly, tipped that this blogger is a birther, tweeting, \u201c@nrsc promoting fringe Birther blogger who refers to @AlisonForKY as a \u201cgirl,\u201d w/ this pic. How savvy of them. #kysen pic.twitter.com/PqztjHYuFq\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Bluegrass blogger believes that Obama tricked everyone with a fake Kenyan birth certificate in order to make birthers look bad.\n\nThe Republican Party is apparently stuck in 6th grade. What does Mitch McConnell stand for again? We know the national party supports this kind of juvenile silliness, but where is the big man Senator McConnell to call out these nasty tricks. Surely a gentleman objects.\n\nUpdate #1: The NRSC deleted their tweet, but that\u2019s what screengrabs are for.\n\nUpdate #2: The NRSC has apologized.\n\n\n\nPost Image from Bluegrass Bulletin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Grimes is not an Obama supporter.
