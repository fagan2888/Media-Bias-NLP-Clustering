The 2015 rankings are based on the most recent statistics available from secondary sources.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Scorecard on State Health System Performance looks at access to medical care, prevention and treatment of disease, avoidable hospital use and cost, healthy lives and health equity.\n\nMore states \u2014 including Indiana \u2014 improved than worsened on the 42 indicators tracked in those areas, the first time that\u2019s happened since the scorecard was created in 2007.\n\nImprovements in Indiana included an increase in the rate of health insurance among children and decreases in colorectal cancer rates and in mortality rates for Medicare patients hospitalized for heart attack, heart failure or pneumonia.\n\nBut Indiana\u2019s overall rank of 43rd was unchanged from last year\u2019s report.\n\nThe areas where Indiana lost ground were vaccination rates for young children, adult obesity rates and the rate of adults reporting their activities are limited by poor physical or mental health.\n\n\u201cThere are wide differences that persist in state performance, and the lack of change we saw in many indicators indicates there are many remaining opportunities that states have to improve,\u201d said Douglas McCarthy, senior research director for The Commonwealth Fund. \u201cThe states that rank in the bottom half have the most to gain.\u201d\n\nResearchers found that better health outcomes strongly correlated with timely, affordable access to care.\n\nMcCarthy said that even areas with fewer resources can improve with a combination of leadership, policy changes and local health care system action.\n\nThis year\u2019s scorecard documents changes during 2013 and 2014 to assess the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance expansion last year, as well as payment reforms and incentives to reduce readmissions to the hospital.\n\nPhysician David Blumenthal, president of The Commonwealth Fund, said he \"can't with scientific precision\" attribute all the gains the report found to the Affordable Care Act but said several positive trends coincide with implementation of the law.\n\nStill, the report cautions, \u201cthe effects of the ACA are not yet fully reflected\u201d in this year\u2019s results, and \u201cit may take many years to see the resulting changes.\u201d\n\nThe top-ranked states overall were Minnesota, Vermont and Hawaii, while Mississippi, Oklahoma and Arkansas were the worst. Highest-ranked states performed up to eight times better than lowest-ranked states.\n\nLouisiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Tennessee saw the greatest gains across health measures \u2014 improving on at least 13 indicators despite being among the bottom states overall.\n\nFor example, Kentucky ranked just 40th overall but improved on 13 indicators and worsened on only three. The state led the nation in declines among uninsured adults, for example, and improved substantially in adults who went without care because of cost; infant mortality; and adults 50 and older who got recommended screenings and preventive care.\n\nKentucky expanded its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, although new Gov. Matt Bevin, who was inaugurated Tuesday, has pledged to scale back that expansion and dismantle the state\u2019s online insurance shopping site.\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Jayne O'Donnell contributed to this story.\n\nEmail Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
