So, where does enrollment stand? According to a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), over 3.4 million people selected a health plan, and 87% are eligible for subsidies.\n\nHere's a look at ObamaCare enrollment through December 15, 2014.\n\n3.4 Million People Selected a Health Plan\n\nAccording to HHS, more than 3.4 million people selected a plan through December 15 in the 37 states that are using HealthCare.gov. Of the 3.4 million plan selections, 48% (1.6 million) reenrolled in a Marketplace plan and 52% (1.8 million) signed up for the first time.\n\nDecember 15th was the enrollment deadline to have coverage starting on January 1st. And as such, enrollment picked up as December 15th approached. According to the report, nearly 1 million consumers selected a plan in the three days leading up to December 15th. That is almost one third (28%) of total plan selections from November 15th through December 15th.\n\nWhat about the states operating their own exchange? Over 600,000 people selected 2015 Marketplace plans in the 14 states (including DC) that are using their own Marketplace platforms in 2015, based on data that generally run through December 13th.\n\n87% Eligible for Health Insurance Subsidy\n\nOf those who selected a health plan through HealthCare.gov, 87% selected a plan and were eligible for financial assistance via the premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies. This is a higher percentage than last year at this time, compared to 80% in the early months of the 2013-2014 open enrollment period.\n\n14.7 Million Visits to HealthCare.gov\n\nDuring the first two months of 2015 open enrollment, there were 14.7 million visits on the Marketplace websites and 6.8 million calls to the Marketplace call center.\n\nOpen enrollment for coverage in 2015 lasts through February 15, 2015.
