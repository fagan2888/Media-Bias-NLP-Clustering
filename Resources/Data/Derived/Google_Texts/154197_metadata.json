Needed 76 to pass. There are 71 GOP members. Even if all 30 dems voted yes wouldn't have passed pic.twitter.com/f2RRLp942m\u2014 Phil Cross (@philsnews) May 19, 2016\n\n\u201cThis measure is the key to keeping nursing homes open across our state, keeping hospitals open across our state,\u201d Hickman said. \u201cAddressing DHS service providers, addressing mental health service providers. This is the path forward to address that.\"\n\nBecause the bill includes a tax increase, it requires 76 votes to pass. House Democratic Leader Scott Inman said his caucus wouldn't back the proposal until the GOP agrees to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"This is not a partisan issue. This is an Oklahoma issue,\u201d Hickman said. \u201cWhen you start talking about closing nursing homes and hospitals across the state it's going to affect every legislative district in this state. It will affect every member of the House.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Doug Cox, R-Grove, one of the few physicians at the state Capitol, served notice to reconsider the bill.\n\n\u201cRight now, without this cigarette tax, this budget is in peril,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWhile this is earmarked for healthcare, this affects the entire budget.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Leslie Osborn, R-Mustang, said she\u2019s never voted for a tax increase in eight years at the Capitol, but said she was fully ready to debate in favor of the measure and vote for it.\n\n\u201cMost of us do not like sin taxes. It\u2019s not something we would\u2019ve picked, but this is the choice we\u2019ve been dealt,\u201d Osborn said. \u201cWe are looking at 25 percent provider rate cuts. That closes the majority of our small town and rural hospitals in the state. That cuts down mental health spending. That cuts down services for the disabled, and that cuts down Department of Human Services spending.\u201d\n\nOriginal Post\n\nOklahoma's House Joint Committee on Appropriations and Budget passed a bill Monday that would raise the tax on a pack of cigarettes by $1.50.\n\nThat would generate $180 million for healthcare services, like maintaining the state\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rate at its current level and supporting the state\u2019s premium assistance program, Insure Oklahoma.\n\nState Rep. Doug Cox, R-Grove, one of the few physicians at the Capitol, says the tax increase would keep young people from starting to smoke.\n\n\u201cWe know that the greatest deterrent in a young person starting unfortunately is not education, it\u2019s price,\u201d Cox said.\n\nCox also dismissed that businesses would be hurt by the tax because smokers would buy tobacco in neighboring states.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it. Sad but true, most people who smoke a significant amount where they would be interested in stocking up, they simply can\u2019t afford to,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThey live day to day. They live pack to pack. They can\u2019t cross over the border to buy ten cases of cigarettes at $550 a trip.\u201d\n\nGov. Mary Fallin praised the measure, calling it \u201ca crucial first step in reducing Oklahoma\u2019s leading cause of preventable death.\u201d The bill would require a three-fourths majority in the House and Senate to pass.\n\nKGOU produces journalism in the public interest, essential to an informed electorate.
