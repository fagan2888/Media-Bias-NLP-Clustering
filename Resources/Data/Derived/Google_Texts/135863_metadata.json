John Kasich, was asked whether he would have a problem with a Muslim in the White House. \"The answer is, at the end of the day, you've got to go through the rigors, and people will look at everything. But, for me, the most important thing about being president is you have leadership skills, you know what you're doing and you can help fix this country and raise this country. Those are the qualifications that matter to me.\"\n\nCarson's comments came amid lingering fallout over Republican Donald Trump's refusal last week to take issue with a man during a campaign event who wrongly called President Barack Obama a Muslim and said Muslims are \"a problem in this country.\"\n\nAlso speaking on NBC on Sunday, Trump said that a Muslim in the White House is \"something that could happen... Some people have said it already happened, frankly.\"\n\nIn multiple interviews Sunday, Trump tried to draw a distinction between all American Muslims and extremist Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\n\"I have friends that are Muslims they're great people, amazing people,\" Trump said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"You have extremists Muslims that are in a class by themselves,\" Trump added. \"It's a problem in this country it's a problem throughout this world....You do have a problem with radical Muslims.\"\n\nGOP candidates have since been split over whether to criticize Trump, who has been a vocal skeptic of Obama's birthplace and faith. Obama is Christian.\n\nIn the NBC interview, Carson said he believes that Obama was born in the U.S. and is Christian, saying he has \"no reason to doubt\" what the president says.\n\nCarson also made a distinction when it came to electing Muslims to Congress, calling it a \"different story\" from the presidency that \"depends on who that Muslim is and what their policies are, just as it depends on what anybody else says.\"\n\nCongress has two Muslim members, Democratic Reps. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Andre Carson of Indiana.\n\n\"If there's somebody who's of any faith, but they say things, and their life has been consistent with things that will elevate this nation and make it possible for everybody to succeed, and bring peace and harmony, then I'm with them,\" Carson said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Andr\u00e9 Carson, president, ben carson, br-homepage, homepage, nd-jo, news, politics", "title": "GOP candidate Ben Carson says Muslim shouldn't be president on 'Meet the Press' (video)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"GOP candidate Ben Carson says Muslim shouldn\\u0027t be president on \\u0027Meet the Press\\u0027 (video)\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/gop_candidate_ben_carson_says.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nola.com/home/advance-media/width620/img/politics_news_national_desk/photo/18797417-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16999396\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-20T20:23:45Z\", \"author\": \"Associated Press\", \"tags\": [\"@reviewlist\",\"ben carson\",\"br-homepage\",\"homepage\",\"nd-jo\",\"news\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nola.com/home/advance-media/width620/img/politics_news_national_desk/photo/18797417-standard.jpg", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says Islam is antithetical to the Constitution, and he doesn't believe that a Muslim should be elected president.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nolanews"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, September 20, 2015,  3:00 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Ben Carson says a Muslim shouldn\\u0027t be president (video)\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.advance.net/politics_news_national_desk/photo/ben-carson-ea246601c534ea88.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"apnationaldesk\", \"author_nickname\": \"Associated Press\", \"author_id\": \"10948480\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Louisiana Politics & Government\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says Islam is antithetical to the Constitution, and he doesn't believe that a Muslim should be elected president.", "title": "GOP candidate Ben Carson says Muslim shouldn't be president on 'Meet the Press' (video)", "url": "http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/gop_candidate_ben_carson_says.html", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/advance-media/width620/img/politics_news_national_desk/photo/18797417-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, September 20, 2015,  2:23 PM", "article_author": "Associated Press", "Description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says Islam is antithetical to the Constitution, and he doesn't believe that a Muslim should be elected president."}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says Islam is antithetical to the Constitution, and he doesn't believe that a Muslim should be elected president.\n\"I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,\" Carson said.\nAlso speaking on NBC on Sunday, Trump said that a Muslim in the White House is \"something that could happen...\n\"It's a problem in this country it's a problem throughout this world....You do have a problem with radical Muslims.\"\nCongress has two Muslim members, Democratic Reps.
