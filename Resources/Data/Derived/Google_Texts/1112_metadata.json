The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has invited Atlanta residents to report fellow citizens for suspicion of illicit prescription drug activity. By texting TIP411, one may summon a G-man to investigate just about anyone.\n\nA low-paid pharmacy technician drives a pimped ride, way beyond his station. Suspicious. Another is popular with women addicted to prescription painkillers and other powerful narcotics. Suspicious. The Goth girl has cut marks on her forearm beneath her white pharmacy coat. Way suspicious. Any of these characters might \u2014 and should \u2014 be reported to a government increasingly worried about the health of the population.\n\nAmong the first to implement a text-message narcing campaign are the state of Georgia and Philadelphia as drug addiction grows in scope, according to Rick Allen, director of the Georgia Drug and Narcotics Agency. \"It really is out of control here,\" Allen told CNN.\n\nPrescription drug abuse has become a national epidemic as the rate of overdoses has more than tripled since 1990, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Tellingly, the tripling of drug overdoses in America has mirrored a tripling of sales for powerful prescription painkillers.\n\nBy 2008, illegal use of prescription drugs caused more deaths than overdoses from traditional street drugs such as cocaine and heroin. Like other times in history, today\u2019s drug abusers often develop their addiction by using legal medications, and then continue to buy drugs obtained by someone holding a legal prescription. Although a drug-store robbery makes the headline, 97.7 percent of users say they get their drugs through a friend or acquaintance rather than through a dealer, according to the CDC.\n\nHarry Sommers, a special agent who leads the DEA\u2019s Atlanta office, says the growth of prescription drug abuse is no mystery. \"The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse,\" he told CNN.\n\nThe federal agency is also distributing pamphlets to 1,200 Atlanta-area pharmacies to encourage the use of the reporting system. Among other ruses, drug sellers and abusers may try to impersonate doctors on the telephone or alter prescriptions with false information to otherwise fool pharmacists into selling the drugs. Aside from watching for frequent customers raising obvious suspicion, the DEA advises technicians that requests for stimulants and depressions \u2014 uppers and downers \u2014 by the same customer may indicate addiction to prescription painkillers. Similarly, the \u201cdoctor\u2019s\u201d handwriting on the prescription may be deemed too legible, and therefore a likely forgery \u2014 in this way, allowing thumb-texters to report those with good penmanship to the government.\n\nStill, although some may blanche at greater population health surveillance, the CDC says 36,000 Americans died in 2008 of drug overdoses, most of them precription painkillers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "prescription drugs, texting and prescription drugs, prescription drugs surveillance, dea and prescription drugs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "As America fights a prescription drug abuse epidemic, the Drug Enforcement Administration in Atlanta is testing a new text-message reporting system for illegal sales and use.", "title": "DEA Asks Public To Report Prescription Drug Abuse Through Text", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-asks-public-report-prescription-drug-abuse-through-text-269960", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/drug-enforcement-agency-encourages-text-reporting-illicit-narcotic-activity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As America fights a prescription drug abuse epidemic, the Drug Enforcement Administration in Atlanta is testing a new text-message reporting system for illegal sales and use.", "title": "DEA Asks Public To Report Prescription Drug Abuse Through Text", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-asks-public-report-prescription-drug-abuse-through-text-269960", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/drug-enforcement-agency-encourages-text-reporting-illicit-narcotic-activity.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/drug-enforcement-agency-encourages-text-reporting-illicit-narcotic-activity.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-02-23T16:09:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-23T16:09:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "As America fights a prescription drug abuse epidemic, the Drug Enforcement Administration in Atlanta is testing a new text-message reporting system for illegal sales and use."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3f39\"", "article_summary": "\"The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse,\" he told CNN.\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has invited Atlanta residents to report fellow citizens for suspicion of illicit prescription drug activity.\nHarry Sommers, a special agent who leads the DEA\u2019s Atlanta office, says the growth of prescription drug abuse is no mystery.\nAs America fights a prescription drug abuse epidemic, the Drug Enforcement Administration in Atlanta is testing a new text-message reporting system for illegal sales and use.\nTellingly, the tripling of drug overdoses in America has mirrored a tripling of sales for powerful prescription painkillers."}
