Federal and local law enforcement officers are searching for a man who robbed money from a bank vault at a Vectra Bank in Westminster then tried, but failed, to carjack a vehicle.

The man, who has not been identified, robbed the bank at 1955 W. 120th Ave. using a black handgun at 9:20 a.m. Saturday, according to a news release.

Officials have not said how much money the man took. No shots were fired and no one was injured during the robbery.

When the white robber left the bank, he attempted a carjacking just north of the bank. When that failed he fled to the northeast on foot.

FBI agents have joined the search for the man along with Westminster police.

Anyone with information about the case is asked to call police at 303-658-4360.
