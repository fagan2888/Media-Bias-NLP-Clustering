John Kasich on behalf of Suarez Corporation Industries about the same time the company's employees made $90,000 in questionable donations to Renacci's re-election campaign.\n\nThe Wadsworth Republican\u2019s letter urged Kasich to contact California Gov. Jerry Brown to intervene in a legal dispute that Suarez, a North Canton direct marketing company, was having in California.\n\n\u201cIt appears as if several District Attorneys in California may have been abusing the privilege of their office by filing repeated frivolous and baseless lawsuits, costing constituents of ours millions in settlements and attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d Renacci\u2019s letter said.\n\n\u201cWhile I support tort reform and the elimination of frivolous lawsuits filed solely to elicit a settlement, I also recognize that these issues are best left to the states,\u201d the March 29, 2011 letter continues. \u201cAccordingly, I urge you to contact Governor Brown to share our concerns with this matter and work together to find a commonsense solution that protects American and Ohioan businesses and jobs.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s office said the governor did not contact Brown, as Renacci requested. Suarez also contacted Kasich\u2019s office directly to seek help with his legal disputes and was told \u201cwe can\u2019t help you,\u201d said Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols.\n\n\n\nNichols forwarded an email from Renacci's legislative director Brian Werstler to Kasich staffer Jimmy Sheppard, which described the letter as \"a courtesy to our constituent,\" and said Renacci did not in any \"way realistically expect your office to take any action on this.\"\n\nThe letter from Renacci is nonetheless cited in a federal indictment that claims Suarez and its top corporate officers illegally reimbursed employees for donations they made to Renacci\u2019s campaign and Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel\u2019s unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid.\n\nCompany officials deny any wrongdoing, and the public officials are not charged with crimes. Renacci and Mandel long ago returned the donations from Suarez employees.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained the Renacci letter and other documents the company withheld from investigators when it executed a search warrant at SCI\u2019s offices on Jan. 22, 2013, the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment also says 18 Suarez employees and their family members made $5,000 donations to Renacci\u2019s campaign from March 29 to March 31 of 2011, which were all reimbursed by the company on April 1, 2011.\n\nRenacci\u2019s office at first said the congressman did not write any letters on Suarez' behalf. It supplied the letter cited in the Oct. 22 indictment within an hour of The Plain Dealer filing a public records request for it at Kasich\u2019s office.\n\nRenacci chief of staff James Slepian said he found the letter in an \u201cold staff file\u201d after several days of examining correspondence to and from the congressman\u2019s office.\n\nSlepian said the company\u2019s founder and president, Benjamin Suarez, asked Renacci to seek federal legislation that would limit a state\u2019s ability to enforce its own product liability laws.\n\nSeveral district attorneys in California have filed a lawsuit that accuses Suarez\u2019s company of selling \u201cunapproved and misbranded drugs and devices\u201d and making \u201cunsubstantiated false and/or misleading claims about their benefits.\u201d Their lawsuit seeks fines and restitution of at least $5 million.\n\nSuarez wanted Renacci to introduce legislation that would pre-empt all state laws that regulate advertising and product labeling. Slepian said Renacci wouldn\u2019t do so because \u201cJim viewed this as a state issue and did not see a role for the federal government to play.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, our office simply forwarded the SCI info to Kasich\u2019s office with a note explaining what we had received and pointing out that it was a matter for the states to sort out,\u201d said an email from Slepian.\n\nSlepian said there was no link between Renacci\u2019s letter and the $90,000 in donations his campaign got from Suarez\u2019 employees within two days of its authorship.\n\nThose contributions were tied to a large fundraising event at the Brookside Country Club in Stark County in the second quarter of 2011, said Slepian, who described it as the first large campaign event Renacci held after taking office that January.\n\n\u201cAt no point has our office ever taken any official action tied to campaign contributions,\u201d Slepian said. \u201cAnd in this case, our office never took any legislative action of any kind on the matter related to SCI. We received a packet of information from a company in our district requesting that we engage Congress on an issue they were concerned with. We reviewed the request, decided it was a state issue and that we would simply forward the information on to the Governor's office.\u201d\n\nSlepian forwarded a letter to The Plain Dealer that Benjamin Suarez sent to a variety of public officials in Ohio. It listed a string of actions Suarez wanted Renacci, Kasich, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio Inspector General Randy Meyer and Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted to take to help with his dispute in California.\n\nSuarez\u2019s letter claimed the California district attorneys who sued his company were operating \u201can extortion racket\u201d that would cost jobs at his company and others.\n\n\u201cThese Rogue 10 D.A.\u2019s extortion racket is doing more damage to businesses and the U.S. economy than all the federal regulators and all of the other 49 state regulators combined,\u201d his letter said.\n\nRepresentatives of the other Ohio office holders named in the letter said they did not help Suarez, although Husted\u2019s office said he called California Attorney General Kamala Harris to get more information about the issue. Campaign finance records show Suarez contributed $5,000 to Husted's successful 2010 run for Secretary of State.\n\nAn assistant attorney general in Harris\u2019 office called Husted back to say that the dispute was a local matter, not a state one, Husted spokeswoman Maggie Ostrowski told Northeast Ohio Media Group. Husted passed that message along to Suarez and had no further involvement in the matter, Ostrowski said.\n\nKasich\u2019s chief counsel, D. Michael Grodhaus, sent Suarez a letter on March 29, 2011 that said he had reviewed the businessman\u2019s complaints and had an assistant obtain additional information about the proceedings in California.\n\n\u201cBecause the people of the State of California have clearly expressed their wishes as to the kinds of consumer protection laws and regulations they want in their state, we do not believe that it would be appropriate for the Governor of Ohio to seek federal legislation to pre-empt or override California\u2019s consumer protection laws and regulations,\u201d Grodhaus\u2019 letter said.\n\n\u201cLikewise, we do not believe that it would be appropriate for the Governor of Ohio to intervene in or attempt to influence an on-going investigation or regulatory proceeding initiated by a district attorney in another state,\u201d the letter continued.\n\nNichols said Grodhaus subsequently forwarded Suarez's materials to California Attorney General Harris, who \"wrote back and said 'mind your own business.'\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Nichols, Suarez Corporation also contacted Kasich's office to seek help after the FBI and U.S. Attorney Steve Dettelbach began investigating its campaign donations.\n\nThe company's human resources director, Julianne Dalayanis, sent Kasich a letter copied to numerous other public officials that claimed a \"high crime\" was in progress. It accused Dettelbach and an aide of \"malicious prosecution\" to benefit their careers and to do the bidding of Democrats, such as Mandel's election rival, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, with whom it claimed they were aligned.\n\nThe letter asked Kasich to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Suarez's claims, and that he ask House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia to investigate abuses it alleged.\n\n\n\nKasich's constituent affairs director, Dave Ward, replied with a letter that said \"the concerns you expressed have to do with an issue that is outside the jurisdiction of the Governor's Office.\"\n\n\"You have contacted the appropriate federal authorities with your concerns, and I encourage you to work with them to address this issue,\" said Ward's Feb. 26, 2013 letter to Dalayanis.\n\n\n\nAfter Suarez was indicted, Kasich announced that he would donate the $22,395 that the businessman gave his campaign to the National Alliance on Mental Illness Ohio.\n\nOhio Treasurer Mandel did not share Kasich\u2019s misgivings about acting on Suarez\u2019 behalf, records released by his office show. Mandel sent Renacci a letter on March 21, 2011 that urged him to introduce the legislation sought by Suarez.\n\nMandel also wrote a May 23 letter to California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer that criticized the district attorneys in California for filing deceptive advertising claims against Suarez\u2019s company. Mandel\u2019s letter threatened to urge Ohio\u2019s attorney general to file a federal lawsuit against California.\n\n\u201cWe must not permit this victimization and attack on Ohio jobs to continue unchecked,\u201d said Mandel\u2019s letter to Lockyer. \u201cIf we must institute litigation to stop the abuses, I am confident we will.\u201d\n\nThe indictment says the company asked Mandel to write letters on its behalf to public officials around March 18 and May 17, and describes repeated correspondence over the letters between Mandel\u2019s campaign and SCI officials.\n\nIt also says 20 Suarez employees and their family members subsequently made donations of $5,000 apiece to Mandel between May 26 to June 13, which were illegally reimbursed.\n\nIt says the actions of Benjamin Suarez, his company, and its Chief Financial Officer, Michael Georgio, violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.\n\nThat law prohibits corporations from making direct donations to federal candidates, caps the amount that individuals can give, and bars people from making contributions in other people\u2019s names.\n\nIt claims the company made almost $200,000 in \u201cdisguised contributions\u201d to Mandel and Renacci to \u201cgain influence for SCI and Benjamin Suarez.\u201d\n\n\u201cBenjamin Suarez, Michael Georgio, and SCI disguised and concealed the amount and source of campaign contributions and the identity of SCI as the true contributor to the 2012 House Campaign and the 2012 Senate Campaign in order to enhance SCI\u2019s and Suarez\u2019 ability to seek and obtain favorable treatment, including official acts that could benefit SCI\u2019s business interests, while decreasing the risk of potentially unfavorable public scrutiny,\u201d the indictment says.\n\nIn an interview last month, Suarez said his company hadn\u2019t reimbursed employees for campaign donations. He said his workers gave money on their own because they were dismayed by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe acknowledged asking Mandel to write a letters on his firm\u2019s behalf, but said the donations from his company\u2019s workers were not in exchange for Mandel\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cEvery statement in the indictment is false,\u201d Suarez told The Plain Dealer. \u201cI have never done anything illegal. I do not do anything illegal, period, nor does anyone else at my company.\u201d\n\nView this document on a mobile device \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "jim-renacci,john-kasich,jon-husted,josh-mandel,rob-portman,suarez-corporation-industries", "title": "Rep.
