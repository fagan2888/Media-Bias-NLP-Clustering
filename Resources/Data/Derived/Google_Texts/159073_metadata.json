Both songs have reached platinum status and cracked the Top 40 on the pop charts; \u201cTake Your Time\u201d has even peaked at No. 20 on the Hot 100.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with the music reaching more and more people through whatever outlet allows that,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic that pop stations are picking up the song.\u201d\n\nCountry radio has rewarded Hunt for his diverse, genre-bending sound that fuses elements of R&B;, hip-hop and electronica with country. He\u2019s also a respected songwriter who co-penned hits like Kenny Chesney\u2019s \u201cCome Over,\u201d Keith Urban\u2019s \u201cCop Car\u201d and Billy Currington\u2019s \u201cWe Are Tonight.\u201d\n\nThe former quarterback for both Middle Tennessee State University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham grew up in Cedartown, Georgia, and said he drew inspiration from Atlanta-based R&B; acts like Usher and TLC, in addition to country singers.\n\nHunt\u2019s look isn\u2019t typical country either: The chiseled, bearded 30-year-old is usually seen rocking a fitted cap and trendy clothes that mirror Drake and Chris Brown.\n\nHunt believes his unique sound has helped him win on country radio. Some of his songs, like \u201cTake Your Time,\u201d feature his signature talk-sing delivery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different enough to have inspired people to not just listen to that song, but to go buy the record and see what the record has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes on the radio, it\u2019s a song that kind of catches people off guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSam is going to be a superstar,\u201d Darius Rucker said in a recent interview. \u201cI love what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s doing something so unique and different.\u201d\n\nOthers have recognized Hunt\u2019s work: \u201cLeave the Night On\u201d is nominated for top country song at next month\u2019s Billboard Music Awards, and Hunt will compete for new artist of the year at Sunday\u2019s Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\n\u201cI was flattered to be considered for the nomination,\u201d Hunt said of the ACMs. \u201cI know the category is new artist of the year, but I still kind of felt like at the time (I) was nominated, (I) was too new to be new artist of the year.\u201d\n\nHunt\u2019s debut album, \u201cMontevallo,\u201d debuted in November at No. 3 and 1 on Billboard\u2019s 200 and Top Country albums charts, respectively. The album recently hit gold status.\n\nHe will open on Lady Antebellum\u2019s Wheels Up Tour, which kicks off May 1 in Lubbock, Texas. He\u2019s also set to perform at the ACM Awards, airing live from the AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot to process. Everything\u2019s kind of happening so fast,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time. Two weeks will go by and I\u2019ll look back and you can really see the progress.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.samhunt.com/home/\n\nhttps://www.acmcountry.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rising country star Sam Hunt may be finding success on the pop charts, but don't fret - he won't pull a Taylor Swift.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Rising country star Sam Hunt may be finding success on the pop charts, but don\u2019t fret - he won\u2019t pull a Taylor Swift.", "title": "Singer Sam Hunt rising in both country and pop worlds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/18/singer-sam-hunt-rising-in-both-country-and-pop-wor/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/18/20ae3f11619af811730f6a706700eda2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/18/20ae3f11619af811730f6a706700eda2.jpg", "description": "Rising country star Sam Hunt may be finding success on the pop charts, but don't fret - he won't pull a Taylor Swift.", "card": "summary", "title": "Singer Sam Hunt rising in both country and pop worlds"}, "Author": "MESFIN FEKADU", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBy no means do I want to try to leave country music,\u201d Hunt said in a recent interview.\nNEW YORK (AP) - Rising country star Sam Hunt may be finding success on the pop charts, but don\u2019t fret - he won\u2019t pull a Taylor Swift.\nBoth songs have reached platinum status and cracked the Top 40 on the pop charts; \u201cTake Your Time\u201d has even peaked at No.\nHunt believes his unique sound has helped him win on country radio.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with the music reaching more and more people through whatever outlet allows that,\u201d Hunt said."}
