SINGAPORE (AP) — Singaporeans turned out in the tens of thousands Sunday to pay final respects to longtime leader Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore’s prime minister for more than three decades until 1990, Lee died last Monday at age 91. His cortege took a 15-kilometer (9-mile) route through the city-state before a three-hour state funeral. Singaporeans credit Lee’s leadership with laying the foundation of the Southeast Asian country’s current prosperity, and his death triggered a wave of emotion rarely seen in Singapore.

Some scenes from Sunday:

As the funeral cortege left Parliament, where Lee lay in state for four days, heavy rain poured down on onlookers, some of whom had waited for hours for a glimpse of the procession. Huddled beneath a canopy of umbrellas, the crowds sang patriotic songs, waved Singapore flags and chanted “Lee Kuan Yew.” On a nearby open field known as the Padang, Howitzer cannons were fired, creating a haze of smoke, and four air force fighter jets streaked across the island, one peeling off in a “missing man” formation. Navy patrol ships made an “LKY” signal with their flags and sounded horns.

Seeing the coffin draped in Singapore’s red and white flag and protected by a glass casing as it sat atop a ceremonial gun carriage, an elderly Chinese man at the Padang shouted “Thank you, Lee Kuan Yew” as tears streamed down his face. A couple dressed in black wrapped arms around each other’s waist as the teary woman rested her head on her male partner’s shoulder.

Reflecting on his own life, port systems planner Teo Chai Beng, 59, said, “I was a foster child, I was mistreated, I worried about where my next meal would come from. I had nothing but P6 (Primary 6) education.” Then he added, “Thanks to him, I am a supervisor now, and myself and my two sons all have houses.”
