Do Your Job and Stop Obama's Policies or GO HOME!

To: Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and All Members of the House Republican Conference and Senate Republican Conference

In 2014 Americans elected a new Congress to stop and reverse the President’s agenda and policies. The 2014 Republican congressional majority was not elected to relinquish more power, compromise and enable Obama to use their acquiescence to justify continued abuses. America’s voters demanded that Congress:

Stop the President’s promised “Fundamental Transformation” of the country, End Executive branch overreach, Restore Constitutional balance of power among the three branches of government, Bring an end to the perennially unpopular Affordable Care Act, Stop the President’s Executive Amnesty initiatives, Hold the Executive branch accountable for its myriad abuses of power and its national security failures both foreign and domestic, and Put the interests of the United States of America first among nations.

The contentious vote for Speaker of the House reflected the frustration of voters nationwide, who did not have confidence that the House Republican Leadership would have the courage to carry out the voters’ mandate. A poll conducted by Pat Caddell confirmed a growing rift between voters and Republican leaders in the House and Senate.
