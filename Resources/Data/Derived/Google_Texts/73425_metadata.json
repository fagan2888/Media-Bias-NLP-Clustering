Nevah use \u2019em \u2014 why pay for \u2019em?\n\nIt\u2019s high time that The Style Invitational furthered its mission to unenlighten the reading public with a contest seeking totally bogus trivia. This week, on the suggestion of 377-time Loser Jeff Contompasis (rhymes with \u201cquantum gases\u201d): Send us some fictoids about cars and trucks and driving and stuff, like the examples above, which Jeff wrote for our Week 998 contest for fictitious laws.\n\nWinner gets the Inkin\u2019 Memorial, the Lincoln statue bobblehead that is the official Style Invitational trophy. Second place receives \u201cHeads of State,\u201d by Carl Sferazza Anthony (back when he was a Washington Post researcher, his latter two names were transposed). This nifty book depicts such fabulous artifacts as a screaming-green Richard Nixon Head candle, a Herbert Hoover Head lemonade pitcher (the head is lopped off at the top for easy access); and a George W. Bush Head jack-in-the-box, from which W pops out complete with lectern. We\u2019d love to offer a few of these heads ourselves, but our second-prize budget is zero. So we thank Loser Pie Snelson for donating the book, at least.\n\nOther runners-up win their choice of a yearned-for Loser Mug or the ardently desired \u201cWhole Fools\u201d Grossery Bag. Honorable mentions get a lusted-after Loser magnet, either the Po\u2019 Wit Laureate or Puns of Steel. First Offenders receive a smelly tree-shaped air \u201cfreshener\u201d (FirStink for their first ink). E-mail entries to losers@washpost.com or, if you were born in the 19th century, fax to 202-334-4312. Deadline is Monday, June 16; results published July 6 (online July 3). No more than 25 entries per entrant per contest. Include \u201cWeek 1075\u201d in your e-mail subject line or it might be ignored as spam. Include your real name, postal address and phone number with your entry. See contest rules and guidelines at wapo.st/InvRules. This week\u2019s honorable-mentions subhead is by Jeff Contompasis; the alternative headline in the \u201cNext week\u2019s results\u201d line is by Chris Doyle.

Especially if you plan to enter, check it out at wapo.st/styleconv.\n\nREPORT FROM WEEK 1071: THREE ON A MATCH\n\nIn Week 1071, the Empress sent people to a Web site containing a huge list of three-letter abbreviations, from AAA to DZZ.
