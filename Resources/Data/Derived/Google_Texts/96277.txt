There's a little-known section in Obamacare that limits how much health insurance companies can deduct for executive compensation in their federal income taxes.

Prior to Section 9014, the corporations were able to write off massive CEO compensations. For example, former Anthem Inc. (NYSE: ANTM) CEO Angela Braly decided to leave the company in 2012 due to shareholder criticism. Under Braly, the ANTM stock price had fallen as far as 20% from January 2012 to August 2012. Yet even though she disappointed shareholders, Braly was still able to net $20 million before leaving.

What's worse is that Anthem was able to write off nearly all of the $20 million as deductible "performance pay," according to Fortune.

Now, under 9014, the deductions for executive pay shrank from 96% to 27% for the 10 largest publicly held health insurers in 2013 (the most recent available data).

That's good.

But it still leaves one big question: If the Affordable Care Act has cracked down on salary loopholes, why are health insurance CEOs making more money than ever before?

Obamacare Contributing to Health Insurance CEOs' Massive Salaries?

Despite Obamacare measures that force health insurance companies to cover additional individuals — and to pay full taxes on exec salary payouts — CEOs have found a way to boost their salaries even more.

CEOs from five of the biggest health insurance companies took home at least $10 million in 2014, according to healthcare news provider FierceHealthPayer. All of the CEOs listed below, outside of Joseph Swedish, earned more money in 2014 than they did in 2013…

This includes:

Aetna Inc. (NYSE: AET) CEO Mark Bertolini: $15 million

(NYSE: AET) CEO Mark Bertolini: $15 million UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) CEO Stephen Hemsley: $14.9 million

(NYSE: UNH) CEO Stephen Hemsley: $14.9 million Cigna Corp. (NYSE: CI) CEO David Cordani: $14.5 million

(NYSE: CI) CEO David Cordani: $14.5 million Anthem Inc. CEO Joseph Swedish: $13.5 million

CEO Joseph Swedish: $13.5 million Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) CEO Bruce Broussard: $10.1 million

For comparison, Cordani's pay increased 12.4% from 2012 to 2014. You'd think that because Obamacare has forced insurers to cover all Americans, and Section 9014 has dramatically eliminated the ability to deduct executive pay, that logically, pay would go down.

Here's why we've seen opposite effect, instead…
