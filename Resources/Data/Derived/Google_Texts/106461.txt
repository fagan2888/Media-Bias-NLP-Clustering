Boys and girls from around the area will now be able to walk into the local Boys & Girls club and see a fresh new coat of paint on the walls.

"Sherwin Williams came out and donate community service and try to help improve the community by doing paint projects around the community," Sherwin Williams Meridian Store Manager Sedric King said.

That was his response to why the organization received a facelift.

"We believe as a company that community service is really important,' King stated. "We try to go out in the community and try to enhance the community. That is one of the biggest importance that Sherwin Williams of trying to improve the community and the overall look of the community."

Linda Lavalais the school liaison for The Boys & Girls Club of East Mississippi says for Sherwin Williams to come out and donate time is very beneficial not only to the organization but for the kids themselves.

"I think I'm the most pleased with is not only did they supply the materials, but they supplied the volunteers as well," Lavalais said. "Most of the folks that come from Sherwin Williams know how to paint, if we girls had gone in there to try and do it or some other staff member, it may not have been as beautiful as it is today. We are very grateful."

Lavalais stressed the importance of community support and involvement in The Boys & Girls Club, especially after Sherwin Williams donated several hours of their time.

"The more you know about what an organization is doing for children, the better your life will be," Lavalais stated. "I think it's an overall good moment you know. They feel good , we feel good, the place looks great, and the children love it. It's a win-win situation."

The store manager says they painted one activity room and both boys and girls bathrooms in the building.
