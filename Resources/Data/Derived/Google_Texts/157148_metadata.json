At this point, the question is whether to go the homemade route or store-bought. Based on findings from a new study, babies that are fed store-bought food have to eat twice as much than those who are fed homemade foods in order to get the same energy and protein.\n\nFindings of the report published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood reveal that babies who ate ready-made foods got half the nutrients, more calories, and a \u201cvery high\u201d sugar content compared to their counterparts who ate homemade foods. The researchers at the University of Glasgow in Scotland analyzed all of the baby foods produced by Cow & Gate, Heinz, Boots, Hipp Organic, Organix, and Ella\u2019s Kitchen. These UK-based products included ready-made cereal that could be made with milk, water, biscuits, bars, snacks, and cakes, The Guardian reports.\n\nNutritional information, such as calories, fat, and iron contained within each product, was obtained by the researchers from the products themselves, e-mail inquiries, and the manufacturers' websites.\n\nThe average commercial product contained 67 calories per 100 grams. These food products also had half the amount of nutrients \u2014 with the exception of iron \u2014 that the homemade foods did. Fifty grams of homemade food would give the same amount of energy and protein as 100 grams of a similar commercial product, wrote the researchers.\n\nOf the 479 store-bought products used in the study, 65 percent contained high sugar content. Naturally, infants tend to like sweeter foods, which is why baby food manufacturers produce foods with very high sugar content. \"The UK infant food market mainly supplies sweet, soft, spoonable foods targeted from age four months,\u201d wrote the researchers.\n\nWith approximately two-thirds of the commercial baby foods classified as too sweet, continued exposure to these foods in early infancy could lead children to lean toward sweeter foods with age and potentially cause dental decay. \u201cParents should be aware of processed foods, artificial sweeteners in fruits and \u2018baby-friendly\u2019 yogurts and yogurt drinks,\u201d said Dr. Peter Richel, chief of the pediatrics department at Northern Westchester Hospital, to Health magazine.\n\nFor parents who want to prepare homemade baby food and reduce the risk of their infant having tooth decay, purees provide an easy way to introduce children to solid food while delivering the optimal amount of nutrients.\n\nFor homemade baby food puree recipes, visit Cookinglight.com.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "homemade baby food, store-bought, commercial baby food, nutrition", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Homemade baby food contains twice the nutrients as well as less calories and sugar than store-bought food.", "title": "Homemade Baby Food Is More Nutritious Than Store-Bought", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/homemade-baby-food-more-nutritious-store-bought-does-commercial-baby-food-pose-health-risk-256409", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/baby-being-fed-rice-first-time.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Homemade baby food contains twice the nutrients as well as less calories and sugar than store-bought food.", "title": "Homemade Baby Food Is More Nutritious Than Store-Bought", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/homemade-baby-food-more-nutritious-store-bought-does-commercial-baby-food-pose-health-risk-256409", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/baby-being-fed-rice-first-time.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/baby-being-fed-rice-first-time.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-11T14:25:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:44:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Homemade baby food contains twice the nutrients as well as less calories and sugar than store-bought food."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcb3\"", "article_summary": "Homemade baby food contains twice the nutrients as well as less calories and sugar than store-bought food.\nFor homemade baby food puree recipes, visit Cookinglight.com.\nFifty grams of homemade food would give the same amount of energy and protein as 100 grams of a similar commercial product, wrote the researchers.\nThese food products also had half the amount of nutrients \u2014 with the exception of iron \u2014 that the homemade foods did.\nNaturally, infants tend to like sweeter foods, which is why baby food manufacturers produce foods with very high sugar content."}
