The investigation revealed that some of the inmates learned wood-working skills through the Building Trades class, and made products such as wooden plaques and games. During the course of the investigation, Agents learned that three individuals who had taught classes at the facility were also part-owners of a wood-working business called Stand Firm Design. Agents developed information that from December 2014 through June 2015, some of the products made by the inmates in the Building Trades class were taken from the CCA facility and sold at a flea market as products of Stand Firm Design. The investigation further revealed that the three men kept profits from the items for themselves and the business.\n\nOn Monday, the Davidson County Grand Jury returned indictments charging (left to right) Robert Hill, 58, of Lebanon, Stephen Binkley, 65, of Nashville, and Roy Napper, 68, of Old Hickory, with two counts each of Official Misconduct and one count of Inmate Labor- Violation by Custodian. All three were arrested Tuesday and booked into the Davidson County Jail. Bond was set for each at $1,000.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/9/15/308310/Trio-Charged-With-Profiting-From-Inmate.aspx", "article": {"section": "Breaking News", "published_time": "2015-09-15T23:20:11.0556783Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T23:21:41.0396778Z"}, "type": "article", "title": "Trio Charged With Profiting From Inmate Labor At CCA Facility In Nashville"}}, "article_summary": "Tuesday, September 15, 2015Special Agents with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation have obtained indictments against three Middle Tennessee men charged with official misconduct and inmate labor violation at a Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) facility.\nAt the request of 20th District Attorney General Glenn Funk, on May 5, TBI Special Agents began investigating a complaint of misuse of inmate labor at the CCA facility at 5115 Harding Place.\nOn Monday, the Davidson County Grand Jury returned indictments charging (left to right) Robert Hill, 58, of Lebanon, Stephen Binkley, 65, of Nashville, and Roy Napper, 68, of Old Hickory, with two counts each of Official Misconduct and one count of Inmate Labor- Violation by Custodian.\nDuring the course of the investigation, Agents learned that three individuals who had taught classes at the facility were also part-owners of a wood-working business called Stand Firm Design.\nThe investigation revealed that some of the inmates learned wood-working skills through the Building Trades class, and made products such as wooden plaques and games."}
