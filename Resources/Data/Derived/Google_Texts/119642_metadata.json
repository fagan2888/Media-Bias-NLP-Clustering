It also said Shuttle America employees who work with customers undergo cultural sensitivity training, but did not specify how often.\n\n\u201cUnited does not tolerate behavior that is discriminatory \u2013 or that appears to be discriminatory \u2013 against our customers or employees,\u201d the airline said.\n\nAhmad\u2019s description of the incident touched off a social media firestorm, including a Twitter campaign at #UnitedforTahera, which garnered global support and a call by many to boycott the airline.\n\nAhmad did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\n(Reporting by Barbara Goldberg.)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, beer, chaplain, Diet Coke, islam, Northwestern University, Tahera Ahmad, United Airlines", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(Reuters) Ahmad said the flight attendant had discriminated against her when the attendant refused her request for an unopened can of Diet Coke, saying it could be used as a weapon, yet gave the man sitting next to her an unopened can of beer.", "title": "United Airlines apologizes to Muslim chaplain for soda incident", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/04/united-airlines-apologizes-to-muslim-chaplain-for-soda-incident/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1024px-United_Airlines_B763_N651UA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/04/united-airlines-apologizes-to-muslim-chaplain-for-soda-incident/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/04/united-airlines-apologizes-to-muslim-chaplain-for-soda-incident/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "(Reuters) Ahmad said the flight attendant had discriminated against her when the attendant refused her request for an unopened can of Diet Coke, saying it could be used as a weapon, yet gave the man sitting next to her an unopened can of beer."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22b8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhile United did not operate the flight, Ms. Ahmad was our customer and we apologize to her for what occurred on the flight,\u201d United Airlines said in a statement on Twitter.\nUnited launched an investigation after Northwestern University associate chaplain Tahera Ahmad complained about the incident last week aboard a flight from Chicago to Washington that was operated by Shuttle America for United.\nIt also said Shuttle America employees who work with customers undergo cultural sensitivity training, but did not specify how often.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) United Airlines apologized on Wednesday (June 4) to a Muslim chaplain who said she was denied an unopened can of soda on an affiliated U.S. domestic flight by an attendant who said it could be used as a weapon.\nBob Birge, a spokesman for Republic Airways Holdings, which operated the Shuttle America flight on behalf of United, has said the airline\u2019s beverage policy does not prohibit serving unopened cans to passengers."}
