The piece by Theodore R. Johnson and Leah Wright Rigueur allow that race-baiting \u201cdoes not mean that those who employ them are racists,\u201d but it does \u201cshow a willingness to exploit societal ills for political gain.\u201d The authors don\u2019t think Republicans are racists, just that Republicans have a tendency to exploit racist attitudes across America.\n\nIn an effort to argue their point that desperate Republicans always seem to turn to dirty tactics, the authors open with the 2000 primary battle between John McCain and George W. Bush. \u201cPush polls and flyers began appearing around South Carolina that blatantly accused, or implicitly suggested, that McCain\u2019s adopted daughter from Bangladesh was really \u201ca Negro child\u201d he fathered out of wedlock.\u201d\n\nThe piece then moves to the battle between Michael Dukakis and George H.W. Bush in 1988. \u201cthe Bush campaign began attacking Massachusetts\u2019s furlough program under Dukakis by running an ad about Willie Horton, a convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole, who raped a woman and stabbed her fianc\u00e9 while on weekend furlough. The ad\u2019s racial overtones were not lost on anyone.\u201d They're probably making the usual mental error: the Bush campaign ran a \"Revolving Door\" furlough ad, but not a Willie Horton ad.\n\nThe piece also addressed the current GOP candidates and examples of the candidates engaging in race-baiting. First, with Donald Trump being an Obama birther, and labelling \u201cMexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers.\u201d Next, Ben Carson for comparing \u201cObamacare and abortion to slavery.\u201d Jeb Bush for blaming \u201cAsians \u201cusing \u201canchor babies\u201d to hustle American citizenship\u201d and Chris Christie for associating \u201cblack criminality towards police\u201d with Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn a veiled attempt at being \u2018fair\u2019 in the story, the authors mention how Hillary Clinton \u201cwas accused of using racial divisiveness\u201d when she said Barack Obama couldn\u2019t win the support of \u201chard-working Americans, white Americans.\u201d That \u201cfairness\u201d doesn\u2019t last long as they go back to the throat on conservatives, claiming that \u201cRush Limbaugh argued that the Republican Party didn\u2019t need better minority outreach to win elections, only higher white turnout.\u201d Meanwhile, if the authors hadn\u2019t brought out talking points from 2012, but had read the full transcript from the Rush segment in question, they would have noticed this part:\n\nEvery minority or woman who is a conservative is targeted for destruction. We have done the reach-out. We have done everything they, quote, unquote, say we should do to show that we're not just the white guys party. Why doesn't it work, folks? Serious question. Why doesn't it work? Is it seen as not genuine? Is it seen as tokenism? Is it seen as -- what? Everything about these people is real. She was the secretary of state. She was the provost of Stanford. This is key. Every one of these people that I'm talking about that had a prominent role at our convention had something in common: the traditional American story, up from nothing. Parents who sacrificed and gave up a lot so that their kids could be something. Sneered at, laughed at. Didn't count. Doesn't work.\n\nThe piece\u2019s most beautiful moment of spin though occurs when they roll out the idea that the Republican Party lacks diversity, because it is \u201cover 90 percent white.\u201d In reality, this is a pitching point that Daily Kos made back in March 2012, where they summarized and omitted parts of a Gallup poll. While the poll does show Republicans being 89% white, it also shows that Independents are 70% white, and Democrats 60% white, showing that both parties, and the electorate, are majority white. Further down, when you examine the divide within racial and ethnic groups, you can see that except for Non-Hispanic Blacks, neither party holds a majority of any of the groups.\n\nRegardless of the facts, The Atlantic in its wrap-up states that, \u201cIt remains to be seen whether racial divisiveness as a campaign strategy can still help produce victories as it did in 1988 and 2000. It may be the case that it\u2019s a useful approach in some primary contests, but quite damaging in a general election with a more diverse electorate.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "On Tuesday, The Atlantic featured an article that lamented decades of Republican race-baiting in presidential campaigns.
