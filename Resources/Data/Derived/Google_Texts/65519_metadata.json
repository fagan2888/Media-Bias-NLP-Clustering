It all began with exchanges between Native folks and African sailors/explorers long before European contact; and later, when female slaves were raped by their white slave masters and had children. Then some are mixed with Indian, some Spanish, or any other nationally. Fact is: An allele, is one of a number of alternative forms of the same gene or same genetic locus. Sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. However, most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation. Skin shade is the result of melanin production, Vitamin D absorption, and human developmental adjustments result from both natural environmental pressures and cultural practices (This applies to all humans). Yet, \u201cIf one drop of \u201cblack\u201d blood can define us as Negroes, its apparent then that the strength of the African people can be determined in that one drop. Once the Europeans figured that out, they tried to whip that out of us too\u201d (The Late Richard Wilcox, Narragansett).\n\nFor some, the term black, when applied to Indians, is considered highly pejorative. Lorraine Baker (Nottoway-Pequot descendant) asserts, \u201cThere is no continent called, black.\u201d Why call myself after something that does not exist. Self-determination is the only way to eradicate the \u2018white\u2019 other\u2019s confusion.\u201d\n\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African-Americans and European-Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person\u2019s appearance, his fraction of known non-White ancestry, and his social circle. But the criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During Post Civil War Reconstruction, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with \u201cone drop\u201d of known \u201cblack\u201d blood to be black regardless of appearance. America\u2019s \u201cone-drop\u201d rule is unique in world history as it only applies here in this country. According to Ross Nutt, (Creek descendant) \u201cNative American people are the only people who are identified as a people by a variable degree of blood, and have cards (CDIB or Certificate of Degree of Indian or Alaska Native Blood) to identify the people as \u2018qualified\u2019 to be Indian.\u201d\n\nHomer Plessy was an \u201cOctoroon,\u201d a person having one-eighth black ancestry, who claimed his right to sit on white designated seats in Louisiana because he could pass for \u201cWhite.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cseparate but equal\u201d decision in Plessy v. Ferguson denied Mr. Plessy this right, thus recognizing the \u201cone-drop\u201d rule while legalizing Jim Crow segregation. Black Elk, a famous wi\u010dh\u00e1\u0161a wak\u021f\u00e1\u014b (medicine man and holy man) of the Oglala Lakota (Sioux) said, \u201c I am an Indian. If you have one drop of Indian blood in your veins, then you are Indian.\u201d His statement encourages that the \u201crule\u201d should not be fixed, but a choice for self-affirmation.\n\n\u201cLife under segregation was at its best as discrimination was at its worst for racial violence and terror among people of color\u201d (Kelly, Robin D.G., and Earl Lewis (2000) Make Our World Anew. Oxford University Press, 303-306).\n\nBy the early 20th century, this notion of invisible blackness was made statutory in many states and widely adopted nationwide. In contrast, Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of \u201cIndian blood\u201d (called, blood quantum) due in large part to American slavery ethics.\n\nIn southern New England, ambivalence about American Indian differences was bound to ideas about black racial differences in the seventeenth century, local Indians could be indentured, but Caribbean Indians and blacks could be enslaved. Living with White families sped acculturation but also brought Native people into contact with enslaved and indentured blacks, among them often marriage partners. Children of Indian-black marriages were often characterized as \u201ccolored\u201d or \u201cblack,\" but Indian identification and freedom depended on genealogy. For example, children of Negro women and Narragansett men were not allowed to vote as Narragansett in the 1790s and, until Rhode Island abolished slavery in 1784, could have been legally enslaved. \u201cColored\u201d remained a flexible category depending on the classifier, but terms such as \u201cmustee\u201d ignored distinctions between people of color: \u201cblack,\u201d \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored\u201d were increasingly applied to all mixed-descent people. The persistence of slavery in some areas and a tendency to see Indian people as black also caused difficulties: during the 1840s, the Narragansett people issued membership certificates lest tribal members be mistaken for escaped slaves. The late Dr. Ella Sekatau, Narragansett Tribal Historian explains, \u201cThe one-drop rule was used to deny our existence and allowed Europeans to claim what they had stolen.\u201d\n\nThe Handbook of American Indians, Fredrick W. Hodge, 1906, Black-Indian History, provides a capsule summery of inter-mixture of Indians and blacks, where racism has been a major issue since the colonial era and the slave era. In the twenty-first century, discrimination continues to permeate all aspects of American Indian life in the United States, and in particular, extends to American Indian communities of color, who are now being referred to as \u201cblack Indians.\u201d\n\nPompey \u201cBruner\u201d Fixico, Seminole Maroon descendant asserts, \u201cRacially, I\u2019m an African-Native American. Culturally, I\u2019m an aspiring Seminole Maroon Descendant, but to the people of America that see me on the street, I\u2019m just another flavor of \u2018black\u2019. I firmly believe that with this movement and the cultural renaissance that will accompany it, that we can change those perceptions for the better.\u201d The movement he is talking about was the recently well-attended July 19, 2014 First Gathering of the National Congress of Black American Indians organized by Jay Winter Nightwolf, and host of The American Indian\u2019s Truths on WPFW 89.3 FM. The groups founding principles are to \u201crecognize and celebrate the histories and experiences of Native people of shared African and American Indian ancestry, and Spanish speaking indigenous people as a part of the greater American Indian experience.\u201d The gathering received endorsement and letters of support from Maryland Gov., Martin O\u2019Malley, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray and Prince George County Executive, Rushern L. Baker III.\n\nTo learn more about the National Congress of Black American Indians, click here.\n\nJulianne Jennings (Nottoway) is an anthropologist.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.creator": "mazecyrus", "description": "\u201cBlack\u201d is the most multi-cultured of all Earth\u2019s peoples.
