She\u2019s worked pruning tomatoes, shaking almond trees and digging up garlic for the past 15 years. Sometimes she runs into her husband who waters pistachio and almond trees.\n\nBut in the recent months, as California\u2019s drought has worsened, Huerta\u2019s family \u2014 like others \u2014 have considered returning to Mexico.\u201cWith no water, they can\u2019t harvest the fields,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cAnd without a harvest, there is just no work anymore.\u201dHuerta, her husband, and two of their four children live in a small apartment in Huron, a small town 50 miles south of Fresno. When they turn on the kitchen faucet, light brown water pours out. On Saturday mornings, then, Huerta buys the cheapest bottled water she can find for the week\u2019s drinking and cooking. When her husband has less hours of work, she visits her daughter about 25 minutes away to fill up a plastic bucket with about four gallons of water to get by.\n\nElizabeth Huerta shows a photo of her grandson. (Carolina Wilson/Peninsula Press)\n\nAs California\u2019s water crisis looms over the agricultural industry, conversations have focused on the threat to big growers while often overlooking the devastating potential impact to the laborers and small migrant communities.Agricultural laborers face not only work shortages but also the increased potential of contaminated water supplies. This threatens both their health and their economic stability, as a disproportionate amount of their budgets is spent on private water supplies and other basic needs.But, basic needs cannot be purchased if members of the community are unemployed \u2014 a fear that\u2019s become more and more of a reality for farmworkers battling the drought \u2014 in the fields and at home.\n\nIn the fields\n\nIt\u2019s 4:30 a.m. on a Thursday morning and about 20 laborers are waiting outside the only Chevron gas station in Huron. One truck pulls up to pick up workers. The truck fits six.\n\nFarmworkers wait outside of a Huron gas station waiting for trucks to take them to fields for work.

(Carolina Wilson/Peninsula Press)\n\nThe other workers wait for another half hour. In traditional fieldwork attire, only their hands and faces are uncovered. There\u2019s no idle chat this morning; the workers just wait in silence. After another half hour, with no more signs of farm trucks seeking employees for the day, the workers return home. Leaving in pairs of two, they hope for more luck the next morning.Thomas Esqueda, director of public utilities for the City of Fresno, said there have been several farmers that have indicated they cannot farm their land this year due to the drought.\u201cSo no pruning, no picking and no cultivation is going on,\u201d Esqueda said. \u201cPeople are jobless as a result of not having water available.\u201dWith little to no work opportunities found locally, many migrant families find themselves having to travel to find work.An estimated 17,100 seasonal and part-time jobs were lost in 2014, according to researchers at the University of California-Davis who studied the drought\u2019s economic impact. There was also a 6.6 million acre-foot reduction in service water available to agriculture.\u201cThe 2014 drought is responsible for the greatest absolute reduction in water availability for California agriculture ever seen,\u201d the report stated, estimating that 428,000 acres fallowed in 2014. Approximately 60 percent of that fallowed cropland occurred in the San Joaquin Valley. Another Huron resident, Martha Moreno, travels seven hours south to Brawley, California, for farm work, a city that is less than one hour from the California-Mexico border.Workers like Moreno, then, find themselves away from home for three-to-four weeks at a time, adding hotel, food and babysitting costs to an already overwhelming list of expenses.\u201cIt\u2019s a real battle because I already have four kids that depend on me,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe drought doesn\u2019t only affect work, but it also affects our families, because many times we have to leave our children with strangers.\u201dThe Community Water Center (CWC), headquartered in Visalia, California, is another organization that helps communities \u2014 like the small town of Seville \u2014 in the Central and San Joaquin Valleys advocate for water rights.The majority of residents in Seville are farmworkers, with a median household income of about $14,000 a year. Stone Corral Elementary in Seville \u2014 the poorest school in California \u2014 was forced to spend about $500 a month on bottled water. After 50 years without access to safe drinking water, the CWC helped the small town of Seville get a new well in fall of 2014.\u201cThese areas have some of the highest poverty rates in the country,\u201d Jenny Rempel of the CWC said. \u201cWith agricultural areas being fallowed, that\u2019s higher unemployment rates and rising lines in terms of food assistance.\u201dRempel believes that although the drought is an emergency, it\u2019s also an opportunity to leverage the attention the state has on these communities. More specifically, the CWC supports policy to ensure access to affordable drinking water. AB 401, for example, would require the Department of Community Services and Development to develop a plan for a Low Income Water Rate Assistance program by 2017.\u201cWe need to think about putting systems in place that redistribute power, so that all residents can have a voice in the policies that are impacting their quality of life, especially at home.\u201d\n\nAt home\n\n\u201cBut, why worry about securing work when I\u2019m even more scared to drink my water at home?\u201d Huerta asks.\n\nThe source of the information is the Division of Drinking Water\u2019s database known as SDWIS. Only small PWS (<3300 service connections or <10,000 population), as defined by Health and Safety code section 116275(aa) and those owned by entities other than the federal government or state government are included. Only PWS with either an exceedance of Chrome VI MCL in monitoring conducted since July 1, 2014, or violation(s) of safe drinking water standards in at least one source in 2014 as follows: at least one MCL violation (for arsenic, nitrate, radioactivity, THMs, etc), or at least one treatment violation, or at least one Total Coliform Rule (pathogen) violation.\n\nAccording to the CWC, over one million Californians don\u2019t have access to clean drinking water. Rempel says it\u2019s likely that as the drought drives excessive drilling for water, water tables will drop and contamination rates will rise. The lower the water table is, the more likely it is that chemical contaminates be present.\u201cIn California, in 2015, there are over 350 small communities that on a recurring basis lack safe water,\u201d Rempel said.One of those small communities is Lost Hills, a Central Valley community with a population of just about 2,000 people.Rosanna Esparza of the Clean Water Fund works closely with this Kern County community and said its residents know something is wrong with their water because they can see it and smell it.According to California\u2019s Water Boards\u2019 data, in fact, about 1 in 4 people in Kern County are affected by a contaminated public water system.\u201cFor most of us, water is an entity that can flow freely, but when you describe it as a thick, clump coming out of your faucet, you have another dimension to water that most people don\u2019t understand or recognize,\u201d Esparza said.And so contaminated drinking water exacerbates the pressure farmworking communities endure during the drought. Both Huerta and Moreno have seriously considered returning their families to Mexico.For now, Moreno just finds herself returning almost every Thursday to John Palacios Community Center about two blocks from her house. Several dozens of Huron residents form lines to pick up bags of bread and cereal from food assistance programs \u2014 lines that have gotten longer as more people have lost their jobs in the fields.Before picking up food, residents are asked several questions in the form of a questionnaire. Names, addresses and ages varied. But when asked if they felt their lives were affected by the drought, the answer remained the same.\u201cFrom what we hear, it\u2019s just going to get more and more difficult,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cI\u2019m worried for what\u2019s to come.\u201d\n\n\n\nHuron residents form food assistance lines at John Palacios Community Center, where they are surveyed about the effect of the drought on their homes.
