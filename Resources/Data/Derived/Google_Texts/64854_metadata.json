She was stripped, raped, stabbed and beaten at the church.\n\nShe was found by the church\u2019s pastor and his family, who called for help. Guzman died from her injuries several days later.\n\nTwenty-seven years after Guzman\u2019s death, Scott was extradited to Denver from New York. Scott had been sentenced to 40 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to sexual assault and kidnapping in a 1995 case.\n\nDetectives identified Scott as a suspect in Guzman\u2019s death while they were investigating that case.\n\nScott was charged with murder in Guzman\u2019s death, but the case was not allowed to go forward because Scott was extradited to Colorado for the sole purpose of facing the charges in the 1995 case, not Guzman\u2019s death.\n\nAfter he pleaded guilty in the 1995 case, Scott was sent back to New York to serve a lengthy prison sentence in a case he was convicted of in that state.\n\nDenver prosecutors dismissed the original murder charge in Guzman\u2019s death so they could re-file the charge and move the case forward. Scott was sentenced to life in prison without parole after the jury\u2019s verdict was read Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jury convicts man of murder 35 years after he beat woman to death", "title": "Jury convicts man of murder 35 years after he beat woman to death", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/17/jury-convicts-man-of-murder-35-years-after-he-beat-woman-to-death/", "image": {"width": 474, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__aaajamesscottp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__aaajamesscottp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T17:12:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:29:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb4a\"", "article_summary": "A Denver jury on Wednesday found a man guilty of beating a young woman to death in a Denver church 35 years ago.\nDenver prosecutors dismissed the original murder charge in Guzman\u2019s death so they could re-file the charge and move the case forward.\nTwenty-seven years after Guzman\u2019s death, Scott was extradited to Denver from New York.\nDetectives identified Scott as a suspect in Guzman\u2019s death while they were investigating that case.\nScott was charged with murder in Guzman\u2019s death, but the case was not allowed to go forward because Scott was extradited to Colorado for the sole purpose of facing the charges in the 1995 case, not Guzman\u2019s death."}
