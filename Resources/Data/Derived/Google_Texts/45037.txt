DIANA WILLIAMS, WABC-TV: One other quick question. My daughter asked me to ask you, what is the coolest thing about being president? She says it's because you get to be friends with Beyonce and Jay-Z. So, I said, I'm going to ask the president what's the coolest thing?



PRESIDENT OBAMA: You can tell your daughter that that is a view shared by Malia and Sasha, that's what they think is the coolest thing. You know, for me, I think the coolest thing is that if there is somebody interesting, whose doing anything, a scientist, a sports figure, you know, a writer, anybody in the world -- if I want to call them up and talk, they will answer my call. And that's a pretty cool thing.
