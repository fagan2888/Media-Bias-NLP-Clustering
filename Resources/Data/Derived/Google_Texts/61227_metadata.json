And boy are their arms tired!\n\nIn an image that could go straight into the stock photo file labeled \u201cnot getting it,\u201d Reps. Roger Victory of Hudsonville, Pete Pettalia of Presque Isle and Ben Glardon of Owosso appeared Thursday on the House floor wittily holding copies of women\u2019s magazines. Michigan Public Radio Network reporter Jake Neher tweeted the image out, noting that Pettalia joked, \u201ca couple of times,\u201d in fact, \u201cDon\u2019t say we don\u2019t understand women.\u201d It\u2019s funny when middle-aged white men do super-emasculating things like holding an issue of Glamour! It\u2019s funny because women\u2019s magazines often foist unrealistic body images upon women and it\u2019s funny because holding a magazine does not in fact indicate an understanding of your female constituency! It works on so many levels!\n\nIt gets even more HI-larious when you find out a little more about these guys who josh around about not understanding women. Behold, the guys who recently voted to approve making abortion coverage optional in insurance plans, aka the delightful \u201crape insurance\u201d provision. They also voted in favor of a bill that would make welfare recipients perform community service, a feat that\u2019s challenging for, say, mothers with young children. Pettalia has also voted against late-term abortion, except to save the life of a mother. A \u201chealth of the mother\u201d exemption was not included. Stop, you guys, you\u2019re killing me.\n\nPettalia later clarified the jokey moment, explaining, \u201cDuring a short break on the House floor, Republican Rep. Gail Haines, a leading advocate on women\u2019s issues in the Legislature, gave some of us magazines to read and asked to take our photo with them. A member of the media then walked up behind her and snapped another photo. As part of that lighthearted moment, I made an off-the-cuff remark that has since been taken way out of context.\u201d So let\u2019s meet women\u2019s issues advocate Gail Haines, who did indeed two years ago helpfully propose a softened version of Rep. Bruce Rendon\u2019s stricter abortion regulations, suggesting fines instead of imprisonment for violations of stricter abortion clinic regulations. When the state pushed through what Planned Parenthood called \u201cthe biggest assault on women\u2019s health in our state\u2019s history,\u201d Haines, as committee chair, was notable for permitting \u201ca very few of the 90 opponents of the bill who packed the committee room to testify or even have their position on the bills read into the record.\u201d And four years ago, in a bill that would force women to have \u201cthe opportunity to view the [ultrasound] image before performing abortion,\u201d she introduced a detail requiring \u201cthe ultrasound equipment used to be the most technologically advanced equipment in the facility.\u201d Nothing but the finest will do for your abortion-shaming technology. Ladies, you\u2019re welcome.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Worst conservative photo op of the week?", "title": "Republicans think touching Glamour magazine makes them female-friendly", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Worst conservative photo op of the week?", "title": "Republicans think touching Glamour magazine makes them female-friendly", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/republicans_think_touching_glamour_makes_them_female_friendly/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/gop_women_tweet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Worst conservative photo op of the week?", "title": "Republicans think touching Glamour magazine makes them female-friendly", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/gop_women_tweet.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Glardon, Feminism, Michigan, Pete Pettalia, Roger Victory, Twitter, War on women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5ee\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s funny because women\u2019s magazines often foist unrealistic body images upon women and it\u2019s funny because holding a magazine does not in fact indicate an understanding of your female constituency!\nTopics: Ben Glardon, Feminism, Michigan, Pete Pettalia, Roger Victory, Twitter, War on women, Life NewsThis week in the Michigan House of Representatives, a bunch of male representatives picked up some women\u2019s magazines.\nBehold, the guys who recently voted to approve making abortion coverage optional in insurance plans, aka the delightful \u201crape insurance\u201d provision.\nPettalia has also voted against late-term abortion, except to save the life of a mother.\nIt gets even more HI-larious when you find out a little more about these guys who josh around about not understanding women."}
