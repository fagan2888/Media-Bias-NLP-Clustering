The share of Hoosier adults who lack health insurance has changed little since major parts of the Affordable Care Act began this year, according to new data.

But, unlike Indiana, states that expanded Medicaid and had an active role in running the exchanges in their state to help people buy coverage on the private market saw significant drops in their uninsured rates.

For example, Kentucky's uninsured rate dropped from about 20 percent last year to about 12 percent so far this year, according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index released last week.

Indiana's rate stayed at around 15 percent.

As a result, Indiana's uninsured rate is now highest among its neighbors, which have all expanded Medicaid.

"Obviously, the numbers are going to go down in states that have expanded coverage. So there was no surprise there," said Alex Slabosky, chair of the coalition Cover Indiana, which is pushing for a Medicaid expansion. "Indiana has often looked at itself as in competition with Kentucky over basketball and over a lot of different things. And on this issue, we need to step up and do a better job."

In addition to having a higher uninsured rate than Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, Indiana's rate is now also above the national rate of about 13 percent, the lowest rate Gallup has measured since it started tracking the figure six years ago.

"While a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate is declining, as the law intended," Gallup said in its release.

Rachel Garfield, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation's Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, said the general trend shown in the Gallup numbers is similar to what other surveys have found. But Gallup's varying sample sizes for each state, particularly the smaller ones, means that the actual uninsured rate in a state could vary by several percentage points.

Still, Garfield said, it's fair to say that Indiana's neighbors had a greater drop in uninsured adults than Indiana did.

The two main ways the Affordable Care Act aimed to expand health insurance coverage were through the health exchanges and by expanding Medicaid, the health care program for the poor funded jointly by states and the federal government.

Like most states, Indiana chose not to run its own exchange. It's also suing the Obama administration to stop the subsidies that are available on the exchange to help people who make up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level buy private insurance.

The suit, which is pending in federal court, was brought by Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller and 39 school districts to prevent employers from being subject to fines for not providing affordable coverage to workers. The fines are triggered if an employee uses a subsidy to buy a plan.

Indiana is also not among the 26 states that have expanded Medicaid to cover people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. As a result, eligibility rules for Hoosier adults remain among the strictest in the country.

Gov. Mike Pence has asked the federal government for permission to restructure Indiana's Medicaid program, while getting the additional federal funding available through the Affordable Care Act to expand access. Instead of expanding traditional Medicaid as the law envisioned, Pence wants to use a variation of the Healthy Indiana Plan pilot program that's been in place for some Hoosiers since 2008.

HIP is modeled after high-deductible plans with health savings accounts that advocates say give consumers an incentive to make smarter health care spending choices.

But the proposal requires monthly contributions by participants and the federal government has limits on how much the poor and near-poor can be required to pay.

A paper published this month in the journal Health Affairs found that increasing monthly premiums by $10 for children in families making just above the poverty line led to a 6.7 percentage point drop in coverage.

Expansion advocates like Slabosky who might have preferred that Indiana expand traditional Medicaid, are hopeful that the federal government will approve Pence's alternative.

"We can debate what would have been ideal," he said. "But right now the issue is getting people coverage."

Meanwhile, some conservative groups are pressuring Pence to drop expansion.

J. Scott Moody, who heads the group State Budget Solutions, said last week that Pence's alternative is just as bad as traditional Medicaid because Indiana will still become increasingly dependent on the government program and more spending by the public sector means there's less money available in the private sector.

"Governor Pence is letting good politics trump good policy," Moody said.

On the other side of the spectrum, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy whose mission is improving health care, estimated in a report last week that Indiana hospitals will lose out on nearly $1 billion in Medicaid payments in 2016 if Indiana's Medicaid program does not expand.

Kentucky, which both expanded Medicaid and ran its own health exchange, says the number of uninsured residents has dramatically fallen in each of its 120 counties.

Expanding coverage was part of the state's larger mission to improve health outcomes and habits, such as reducing rates for cancer, smoking and obesity.

"Getting more Kentuckians covered by health insurance helps lay the groundwork for us to achieve the goals set by the kyhealthnow initiative," Lt. Gov. Jerry Abramson said in a statement after the Gallup figures were released.

Gallup found that only one state — Arkansas — had a larger drop in its uninsured rate than Kentucky this year.

Source: Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. Interviews were conducted Jan. 2 to Dec. 29, 2013, with 178,068 adults across the country and with 88,678 adults surveyed between Jan. 2 to June 30, 2014. The margin of error for most states for the 2013 survey was plus or minus 1 to 2 percentage points but was as high as plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for less populous states such as Wyoming and Delaware. The margin of error for the 2014 survey was as high as plus or minus 5 percentage points for the smallest states.
