Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update included slugger David Ortiz, aka Big Papi, to talk about his selfie incident with President Barack Obama at the White House. And it was easily one of the funniest skits of the night.

The Boston Red Sox player was criticized for taking a selfie with Obama and tweeting it with his Samsung phone after it came to light that he had an endorsement deal with Samsung. So last night, SNL brought Big Papi, played by Kenan Thompson, for an interview. But speaking in his familiar and incredibly confusing lingo, the fake Ortiz didn’t supply many answers.

“I talked to Sam’s son, I talked to Sam, they tell me it’s no problem,” the faux ballplayer said in his Dominican accent.

When Weekend Update host Colin Jost tried to correct Ortiz’s pronunciation, the baseball player informed him that the ads for Sam’s son and Samsung were different.

“Samsung — giant a** phones,” fake Ortiz said. “Is that a television or a phone?”

Ortiz then talked about his other commercial appearances — such as “bats for bats” and “Come eat at Chick-fil-A, unless you gay.” But his best idea? For depression.

“Do you suffer from depression?” Big Papi asked. “Don’t.”

The audience roared with laughter at Thompson’s hilarious impression of Ortiz. Check it out below:
