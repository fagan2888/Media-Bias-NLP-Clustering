Rick Scott to veto a sweeping new anti-abortion bill, Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn reports.\n\nThe ad campaign is Planned Parenthood\u2019s first major pushback this year on state efforts to defund or undermine the organization, a trend that has risen dramatically since a series of sting videos was released last summer. The Florida bill would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and only perform the procedure in ambulatory surgical centers \u2014 provisions very similar to the Texas requirements that are now before the Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood is making a six-figure ad buy, according to a spokeswoman who declined to be more specific.\n\n\u2014 Read the story: http://politico.pro/1UloT76\n\n\u2014 See the ad: http://bit.ly/1R39TY1\n\nTHANK GOODNESS IT's FRIDAY PULSE \u2014 where we're watching in awe as thousands of med students go through the panic of Match Day and discover their residency destinations at noon.

But he also said he wants to position the drug lobby as \u201ca constructive participant\u201d in the pricing discussion and will bring \u201cpragmatic, pro-consumer solutions\" to the table that address health care costs \u201cholistically\u201d and are embraced by Republicans and Democrats. Ubl rolled out PhRMA's drug pricing proposals last week, but the jury\u2019s still out on how this one will play out.

The 7th Circuit said that a church-affiliated hospital is not the same as a \u201cchurch\u201d health insurance plan that would be exempt from ERISA. The case was brought by several employees of Advocate Health Care Network in Illinois. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals issued a similar ruling recently.\n\nThe 7th Circuit ruling: http://1.usa.gov/1UjozFJ\n\nSENATE HELP COMMITTEE TO MARKUP BILL TO IMPROVE FDA, NIH STAFFING \u2014 HELP Chair Sen. Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray introduced a bill on Thursday to help FDA and NIH attract and retain top scientists.\n\nWhat's in the bill:\n\n\u2014 Quadruples the number of people eligible for the Senior Biomedical Research Service from 500 to 2,000.\n\n\u2014 Allows FDA and NIH employees in the program to receive pay higher than normal government pay scales.\n\n\u2014 Eases FDA's ability to take advantage of the program, which is primarily used by NIH.\n\nSee the bill: http://1.usa.gov/1Z5Eyqv\n\nWhat's next: The committee will markup the bill during its third and final hearing on legislation that will be compiled into a counterpart to the House\u2019s 21st Century Cures Act.\n\nWhat advocates are saying: BIO and the Friends of Cancer Research praised the proposal. \"Improvements in human resources management and capability are essential if the FDA is to ensure that safe and effective new medicines, which are being developed with increasingly complex science, reach patients as efficiently and quickly as possible,\u201d BIO CEO Jim Greenwood said in a statement.\n\nHOUSE LEADERS SPAR OVER ZIKA FUNDING \u2014 Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer on Thursday argued on the House floor over funding to counter the Zika virus outbreak in Puerto Rico during their weekly exchange over the upcoming House schedule, Pro's Colin Wilhelm reports.\n\nReferencing the upcoming holidays \u2014 and \"the need to care for one another\" \u2014 Hoyer criticized a proposed Republican approach to use leftover Ebola emergency funding to address Puerto Rico\u2019s Zika outbreak. The administration asked Congress for $1.8 billion in new Zika funds, and CDC has earmarked leftover Ebloa money for public health efforts to fight the virus in Africa.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s for Ebola but they have leftover money,\u201d McCarthy countered.\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

She points out that hundreds of thousands of consumers have had challenges proving their eligibility, which has affected their coverage and subsidies.\n\n\"HHS could do more to limit inconsistencies by expanding the electronic sources of data for real-time verification and giving consumers more guidance about the documents to send to verify their income,\" Solomon writes in a CBPP post: http://bit.ly/1nSBeRX\n\nTHE STORY OF THE WEEK \u2026 is Sarah Kliff's story for Vox on the reality that providers often make medical errors \u2014 and the resulting shame that plagues those nurses and doctors for years to come, sometimes with devastating consequences. Sarah's story: http://bit.ly/1ptgphK\n\nHARVARD, NFL PLAYERS TEAM UP ON NEW HEALTH APP \u2014 The app is part of the ongoing Football Players Health Study, but it's open to everyone. TeamStudy will use Apple's ResearchKit platform to track brain function, heart health, pain and mobility; researchers are hoping to establish a control group of non-athletes in addition to football players, too.\n\n\"Using ResearchKit, we will be able to quickly identify patterns that could lead to treatments for health conditions faced by former NFL players,\" said Harvard's Alvaro Pascual-Leone.\n\nON TAP TODAY \u2014 The Cato Institute holds a 12 p.m. forum to preview next Wednesday's oral arguments in Zubik v. Burwell, the Supreme Court case on how the ACA's birth control coverage rule applies to religious non-profits.\n\nON TAP NEXT WEEK \u2014 On Tuesday, the House Oversight Committee holds a hearing on heroin and opioid abuse. On Wednesday, ProPublica hosts its forum on patient harm \u2014 expect questions about its surgeon scorecard to resurface \u2014 while a House Appropriations subcommittee holds a hearing on the CDC budget.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Rachana Pradhan\n\nA ProPublica analysis finds that physicians who get more money from drug companies tend to prescribe more brand-name medications. http://bit.ly/1R5DZbb\n\nThe Washington Post profiles an expectant mother in Colombia who has been diagnosed with the Zika virus. http://wapo.st/22owxlZ\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity digs into why a tobacco giant gave $250,000 to an organization that represents more than 200 African-American newspapers. http://bit.ly/1R33iN6\n\nThe Bangor Daily News editorial board writes that limiting doctors' painkiller prescriptions is the wrong approach for solving Maine's drug abuse epidemic. http://bit.ly/22ovLW1\n\nValeant's CEO tells employees that the company is not going bankrupt, Bloomberg reports. http://bloom.bg/1pxsbI1\n\nJohnson & Johnson will have to pay about $500 million to five plaintiffs injured by defective hip implants, Reuters reports. http://fxn.ws/22pOZHA\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
