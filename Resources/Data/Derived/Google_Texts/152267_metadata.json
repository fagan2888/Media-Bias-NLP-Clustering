After 2021, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually based on the rate of inflation.\n\nThe California Chamber of Commerce said earlier this month that it would oppose any state-wide ballot initiatives for a $15 minimum wage, arguing that it would create new costs for state and local governments as well as businesses.\n\nA Field Poll published last August showed that about seven out of 10 respondents favored the measure, with nearly half saying they strongly favored it.\n\nFourteen states and several cities began the new year with increases to their minimum wage. California and Massachusetts saw some of the biggest hikes among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n(Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Rigby)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The development comes as a wave of minimum wage increases at the state level sweeps th", "title": "Measure to hike California's minimum wage to $15 qualifies for ballot", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/22/Measure-hike-Californias-minimum-wage-15-qualifies-ballot", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-minimumwage-losangeles_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/22/Measure-hike-Californias-minimum-wage-15-qualifies-ballot", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-minimumwage-losangeles_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The development comes as a wave of minimum wage increases at the state level sweeps th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "After 2021, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually based on the rate of inflation.\nThe measure would boost the state's minimum wage to $11 an hour in 2017, and increase it by a dollar an hour every year until reaching $15 an hour in 2021.\nThe development comes as a wave of minimum wage increases at the state level sweeps the United States as the federal minimum wage has gone more than six years without an increase from $7.25 an hour.\nShe added that the measure would build on the efforts of Los Angeles lawmakers, who last year passed a law hiking the city's minimum wage to $15 by 2020.\nFourteen states and several cities began the new year with increases to their minimum wage."}
