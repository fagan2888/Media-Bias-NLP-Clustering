In an effort to close a projected $710 million budget deficit, Governor Sam Brownback is calling for an increase in the state's sin tax.

Sin tax can be applied to a multitude of products, usually alcohol and tobacco, and can bring in much revenue.

In the state of Kansas, the sin tax on cigarettes is 10% and liquor is 8%; the governor has proposed a 25% tax on cigarettes and 12% on liquor.

For bar customers, the increase tax will be directly forwarded to them. Luiz Lopez is the owner of Emerson Biggins. He says that he already has to pay the sin tax when he purchases the liquor for his bars; if the tax goes up, he will have no choice but to either increase prices or reduce drink sizes.

"The $2.50 special, the $3.00 special, the two-for-ones, a lot of that stuff, that is going to have to change, because I need to get this extra money from somewhere to pay for my tax bills," Lopez said.

Bar-goer Shelley Kuhn would rather see a small increase to sales tax across the state than isolate a tax for smokers and drinkers.

"I think they would do a much better job if they would just increase the sales tax that would affect everyone," Kuhn said, "why pick on the people that drink and smoke."

There are many proposals for closing the budget deficit. The legislature is discussing the possibilities during the current session.
