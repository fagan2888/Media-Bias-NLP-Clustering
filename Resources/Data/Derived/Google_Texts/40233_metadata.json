(AP) - Chuck Lillis thrills to the sight of the University of Washington rising to the top 50 in rankings of American universities.\n\nBut Lillis, the current -and first - chairman of the University of Oregon Board of Trustees, frankly doesn\u2019t like what he sees in the rankings when it comes to the UO, where he also went to school.\n\n\u201cI want us to see our rankings and have goose bumps,\u201d he told the UO Senate recently. \u201cI don\u2019t like these rankings that are 92nd, 104th, 86th. That just isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nSo in May 2014, a month before the Board of Trustees formally won control of the university, the UO quietly started a $20 million, donor-funded plan that included hiring an edgy Philadelphia branding firm - 160over90 - to elevate the university\u2019s stature.\n\nTop universities no longer wait for bright students, star academicians and wealthy donors to come to them. Increasingly, they use marketing, advertising and strategic communications to pump up their image.\n\nThe strategy pays off, said David Kirp, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, who wrote the seminal book on the subject.\n\n\u201cTo them that have, more shall be given,\u201d Kirp says in a lecture on YouTube.\n\n\u201cIf you win at this game, then you end up attracting better students, better faculty, more research dollars, more alumni support, faculty superstars. You get to become more selective. The story ratchets up.\u201d\n\nIn their quest, Lillis and other UO leaders are looking to emulate yet also move beyond Oregon football, which was an obscure, losing program 30 years ago, but now is a nationally recognized commodity.\n\nFootball\u2019s transformation required constantly evolving uniforms, audacious marketing and a massive influx of money from a billionaire benefactor who had a business interest in building a showcase team to adorn with the Swoosh: Nike Chairman Phil Knight.\n\nThe question of the coming year is: Will the university find a benefactor for its academic side who will stay loyal for 15 years and pour treasure into the school - Lillis says it needs a $2 billion endowment to be top-notch - and how would the university leadership capitalize on such largesse?\n\nNew UO President Michael Schill - hired by Lillis and other major donors - says he\u2019s optimistic.\n\n\u201cWhat I really want,\u201d he said recently, \u201cis to lift up the academic reputation of this school and move it forward in leaps and bounds.\u201d\n\nThe UO\u2019s claim to academic prestige rests heavily on its membership in the elite, 62-member Association of American Universities. It sits alongside the likes of Harvard, Yale, the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan.\n\nThe UO gained entry in the late 1960s based on its groundbreaking work in genetics. But in recent decades, the university found itself at the bottom of the AAU pack in key academic excellence measures, a report by interim UO President Scott Coltrane says.\n\nFor a research university, the UO is short on tenured faculty, doctoral students, research spending, research production and high-achieving students, the report says. Bringing all those measures up to snuff would take an endowment of billions, Lillis says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re financially weak,\u201d Lillis told the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019re very weak if we want to be a great university.\u201d\n\nHow does an organization such as the UO come from behind, burst into the national academic spotlight, appeal to the best and brightest students, and climb high enough in the various rankings to give its No. 1 trustee goose bumps?\n\nDuck football started with little recognition and a lame record but become a national contender, with a perennial berth in the top ranks of the various national polls.\n\nA New York Times analysis of Facebook traffic, for example, found that the Oregon Ducks claimed at least 10 percent of college football fans in more ZIP codes nationally than any other college football team.\n\n\u201cThe power of that brand is just enormous,\u201d said Tim Gleason, a former UO journalism dean who was an early participant in the UO\u2019s new branding initiative.\n\n\u201cWhen I traveled on the East Coast 15 years ago, it would have been, \u2018So, you\u2019re the University of Oregon. Are you the Ducks or the Beavers?\u2019?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happens anymore.\u201d\n\nWhat took the Ducks to the top?\n\nSimple, Craig Pintens, UO senior associate athletic director for marketing and public relations, said in an interview with Sportslogos.net .\n\n\u201cOur relationship with Nike, first and foremost,\u201d he said.\n\nThe global shoe and apparel behemoth, 115th on the Fortune 500, was co-founded by UO alum Knight and has its headquarters near Portland.\n\nKnight and other donors started the Duck football rise to success about 15 years ago.\n\n\u201c(Knight) approached us about updating the University of Oregon branding,\u201d then-Nike team sports designer Rick Bakas said on his blog. \u201cHis vision . was to raise Oregon\u2019s status as a national title contender by attracting better players, better coaches, and grow the Oregon fan base.\u201d\n\nKnight and other donors built a gleaming city of football buildings: a $15 million indoor playing facility, a $90 million Autzen Stadium upgrade, a $3.2 million locker room upgrade, a $10 million medical center, a $42 million athletics study building and the $95 million football operations center.\n\n\u201cWe are the University of Nike,\u201d senior associate athletic director Jeff Hawkins told The New York Times in 2013. \u201cWe embrace it. We tell that to our recruits.\u201d\n\nNike threw audacity at the branding challenge.\n\nThe company paid for fantastical sets of uniforms, some with feather or diamond plate designs in colors ranging from neon green to muted silver and gray.\n\nThe breakthrough moment, according to Pintens, was in 2001 when Nike and UO personnel placed a 100-foot-tall, $300,000 image of UO Heisman Trophy candidate Joey Harrington on a 10-story building in midtown Manhattan - placing Oregon at the heart of world media.\n\nHarrington\u2019s last name was lined out and changed to Heisman, as in \u201cJoey Heisman.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a risk, but that is what has differentiated our brand,\u201d Pintens told Sportslogos.net. \u201cWe are willing to put ourselves out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad the team gone in the tank, Oregon may have been laughed off the stage,\u201d sportswriter Chris Dufresne observed.\n\nThe sports success has been an asset and a drawback for the UO\u2019s new academic branding initiative.\n\nThe university\u2019s academic side, in adopting the Bakas-designed \u201cO\u201d as its logo, tapped into the sports brand that Nike built. The UO president at the time, Dave Frohnmayer, wanted the \u201cO\u201d to represent the whole university.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not represented by something,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know what you stand for.\u201d\n\nSome faculty saw that as a takeover of the university\u2019s image by Nike and the football team - a perception that the UO\u2019s new branding firm acknowledges.\n\n\u201cObviously, the university has a big problem getting out the message that we\u2019re a serious academic institution,\u201d Bill Harbaugh, economics professor and publisher of the uomatters.com blog , said recently. \u201cThe football program has co-opted the university\u2019s message; it\u2019s all about the Duck brand.\u201d\n\nA key UO image challenge, according to the brand strategy recently developed by 160over90 for the UO, is the \u201cunbalanced national perception of the university, currently dominated by athletics.\u201d\n\nDuck football isn\u2019t the full story, said Tammo Walter, 160over90\u2019s chief creative officer, in an interview, \u201cBut because there was a lack of the academic story, people take it as the full story. We\u2019re completing that story.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Walter said, Oregon football\u2019s reputation will help the academic side. Because of football, the school exists in the national imagination; the fact that the branding campaign doesn\u2019t have to place it there is an asset, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to add onto a wrong perception someone has and say, \u2018Hey, look, this is also what happens here, or this is what we primarily stand for,\u2019?\u201d he said.\n\nThe university needs academic substance to be great, said Tim Clevenger, a longtime private sector ad man whom the UO put in charge of the new branding effort.\n\nThe university needs the academic corollary of a Rose Bowl or a national championship - a scientific breakthrough, a Nobel Prize win, a reinforced perch among the nation\u2019s pre-eminent schools.\n\n\u201cA brand can have a really cool logo and neat ads,\u201d Clevenger said, \u201cbut if there\u2019s no substance behind it, it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\nThe proof, the UO says, will be if it can recruit more freshmen with higher SAT scores, hire more high-profile professors and scientists, and climb in the U.S. News rankings of top universities - up from its 2015 slot of No. 106.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Register-Guard, http://www.registerguard.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chuck Lillis thrills to the sight of the University of Washington rising to the top 50 in rankings of American universities.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/17/uo-hopes-academics-will-soon-join-football-in-top-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Chuck Lillis thrills to the sight of the University of Washington rising to the top 50 in rankings of American universities.", "title": "UO hopes academics will soon join football in top rankings"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chuck Lillis thrills to the sight of the University of Washington rising to the top 50 in rankings of American universities.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "UO hopes academics will soon join football in top rankings"}, "Author": "DIANE DIETZ", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb000\"", "article_summary": "The sports success has been an asset and a drawback for the UO\u2019s new academic branding initiative.\n\u201c(Knight) approached us about updating the University of Oregon branding,\u201d then-Nike team sports designer Rick Bakas said on his blog.\n\u201cI want us to see our rankings and have goose bumps,\u201d he told the UO Senate recently.\nFor a research university, the UO is short on tenured faculty, doctoral students, research spending, research production and high-achieving students, the report says.\n\u201cWhen I traveled on the East Coast 15 years ago, it would have been, \u2018So, you\u2019re the University of Oregon."}
