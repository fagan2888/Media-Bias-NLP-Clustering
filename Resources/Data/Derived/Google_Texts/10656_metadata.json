While training for the Olympic trials in Park City, Utah, and practicing an exceptionally difficult trick, he hit his head against the edge of a half pipe and was knocked unconscious. Pearce was a favorite to make the U.S. Olympic team and \u201cthe rare rider who has beaten the 2006 Olympic gold medalist Shaun White in head-to-head competitions,\u201d the New York Times said at the time.\n\nPearce was wearing a helmet, but the accident left him in critical condition and in a coma for a week.\n\nIn an interview with Alpha One\u2019s Chris Delenick, host of the \u201cBrain Matters Podcast,\u201d Pearce responds to what Delenick calls the \u201cstigma of an invisible disability.\u201d After the acute phase of a brain injury passes, for many the lingering symptoms remain contained in the head, invisible to others, Delenick said.\n\nPearce still experiences vision, memory, and balance problems, he says in the podcast.\n\n\u201cThat is without a doubt the hardest part of a brain injury,\u201d Pearce told Delenick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that I deal with that issue so, so much \u2026 There\u2019s no way that anybody in the world could look at me and say that I had such a severe injury.\u201d\n\nNow an advocate for individuals affected by brain injury, Pearce has been selected to carry the Olympic torch in the opening ceremonies for the 2014 winter games in Sochi.\n\n\u201cThe Crash Reel\u201d will be shown at Space Gallery in Portland tomorrow, Saturday, Jan. 25. Doors open at 7 p.m., and Delenick will be on hand in the lobby to answer questions.\n\nThe \u201cBrain Matters Podcast,\u201d dedicated to covering issues faced by individuals with brain injury, their family members, clinicians, and professionals, is available for download in the iTunes store or can be streamed online at www.brainmattersme.org.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Four years after former pro snowboarder and Olympic hopeful Kevin Pearce suffered a traumatic brain injury, he\u2019s still healing.\n\u201cThat is without a doubt the hardest part of a brain injury,\u201d Pearce told Delenick.\nPearce was wearing a helmet, but the accident left him in critical condition and in a coma for a week.\nThe \u201cBrain Matters Podcast,\u201d dedicated to covering issues faced by individuals with brain injury, their family members, clinicians, and professionals, is available for download in the iTunes store or can be streamed online at www.brainmattersme.org.\nIn an interview with Alpha One\u2019s Chris Delenick, host of the \u201cBrain Matters Podcast,\u201d Pearce responds to what Delenick calls the \u201cstigma of an invisible disability.\u201d After the acute phase of a brain injury passes, for many the lingering symptoms remain contained in the head, invisible to others, Delenick said."}
