I have a personal interest in the case, which wraps together with my continuing questions about President Obama\u2019s political past.\n\nTwo weeks before D\u2019Souza was indicted, he filmed an interview with me for inclusion in his forthcoming film, America. In that interview, I discussed the ideological radicalism and intimidation tactics of the founder of community organizing, Saul Alinsky, as well as the entanglement of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the world of Alinsky and his disciples. The interview touched on various aspects of Obama\u2019s political history, many still largely unknown to the wider public. (D\u2019Souza\u2019s new film has a much broader focus than Obama and Hillary, although they will certainly be covered.)\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about D\u2019Souza\u2019s conduct during the 2012 New York senate race, but I do know something about the thuggish tactics that Obama\u2019s people deploy on his behalf. During the 2008 presidential campaign I had some first-hand experience. There was the initial blocking of my access to documents about Obama\u2019s past and unanswered questions about how this happened. There was the Obama campaign\u2019s attempts to prevent me from discussing my findings about the Obama-Ayers relationship on Milt Rosenberg\u2019s radio show. There was the Obama campaign\u2019s over-the-top attempts to discredit me, and its false denials (very arguably, knowingly false) when I pointed to evidence that Obama had joined a leftist third party.\n\nA variety of incidents, from the Obama campaign\u2019s attacks on me in 2008, to their treatment of David Freddoso, to the Obama administration\u2019s 2009 \u201cWar on Fox News,\u201d to the IRS scandal, show that the Obama administration is perfectly capable of politically-motivated targeting designed to silence, discredit, and intimidate critics.\n\nDespite my familiarity with Alinsky-style moves to silence \u201cenemies,\u201d in 2008 I at first believed that the Obama campaign\u2019s attempts to keep me off the radio had backfired politically and would not likely be repeated. The Freddoso incident proved me wrong. The Obama camp was willing to brave a spate of bad publicity \u2014 so long as it was generally confined to conservative circles \u2014 for the sake of keeping critical accounts, as well as damaging information about Obama\u2019s political past, out of broader circulation. The willingness of the mainstream press to ignore negative information about Obama\u2019s past, and to largely overlook his attempts to suppress such information, vindicated this hardball strategy.\n\nI\u2019ve had some differences with D\u2019Souza over the years, yet my respect for his work is real. His first book, Illiberal Education, helped to place me on my current trajectory. I took strong public exception, on the other hand, to The Enemy at Home.\n\nD\u2019Souza\u2019s Obama studies have strengths as well as weaknesses. Was Obama\u2019s political development shaped by knowledge of his absent father\u2019s socialism? I believe it was. In foreign affairs, has Obama\u2019s evident preference for \u201cmanaged decline\u201d been influenced by his African family\u2019s fraught encounter with the legacy of colonialism? I believe it has.\n\nIt\u2019s not implausible to attribute outsized significance to Obama\u2019s struggle with his absent father\u2019s legacy. That is the premise of Dreams from My Father, after all. Yet in concentrating so heavily on Obama\u2019s earliest years, D\u2019Souza weakens his case. To be rounded and convincing, any account of the president\u2019s ideological development has to pay more attention to Obama\u2019s adulthood than D\u2019Souza has done up to now.\n\nD\u2019Souza would concede this point, I believe, which is why he\u2019ll have more to say about Alinskyism in his forthcoming work, and why he sought me out to speak to the issue for his film. D\u2019Souza understands the need to grapple more directly than he has with Obama the community organizer and the budding politician. That said, nothing in Obama\u2019s later development is fundamentally at odds with D\u2019Souza\u2019s portrait of the young Obama.\n\nUltimately, D\u2019Souza\u2019s minor sins of rhetoric and emphasis pale by comparison to the mainstream press\u2019s refusal even to acknowledge, much less grapple with, the reality of the president\u2019s radical political past. Consider that President Obama joined a leftist third-party and allowed his 2008 campaign to lie about it to the American people.\n\nHad it been learned at any point in his presidency that President George W. Bush once joined a rightist third-party and had lied about it during his first presidential election campaign, the story would have been on every network newscast and every front page in the country for days, if not weeks. Yet when Obama\u2019s affiliation with a far-left party was demonstrated by archival documents, the major outlets said nothing.\n\nSo when D\u2019Souza asked me to speak about this and other issues for his forthcoming film, I was more than happy to do so.\n\nFor many, this will all be water under the bridge. But political lies do have a way of coming back to haunt their perpetrators. That is, of course, what happened with Obamacare, which could never have passed without the president\u2019s claims that you can keep your plan, keep your doctor, and save big money to boot. What encouraged Obama to believe he could get away with these lies if not his earlier success at suppressing the truth about his political past? The press had rolled over once. Surely they would do so again. They did.\n\nOver time, there will be a reckoning. Friends and associates of Obama have apparently already made available to sympathetic historians various documents-letters, event-transcripts, and such \u2014 that will enlarge the account of Obama\u2019s radical past I laid out in Radical-in-Chief and Spreading the Wealth. We will not see this material until Obama\u2019s term is over. When it finally emerges, I hope historians will allow the public access to the full-texts, and not simply secondary summaries, of these important yet currently unavailable documents.\n\nIn a sense, the process has already begun, since, as I point out in Radical-in-Chief, David Remnick\u2019s Obama biography acknowledges the truth of some of the most contested claims by Obama\u2019s critics, if only in \u201cblink-or-you\u2019ll-miss-it\u201d fashion.\n\nGiven this history, I am less-than-surprised to discover that a motion picture project with prospects of conveying poorly-known facts about Obama\u2019s radical past to a broad audience has hit a speed bump.\n\nThe decidedly non-conservative Alan Dershowitz rails against the D\u2019Souza case, calling it \u201can outrageous prosecution and certainly a misuse of resources.\u201d Elsewhere, Dershowitz says, \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that [D\u2019Souza\u2019s] politics have something to do with it. . . . it smacks of selective prosecution.\u201d (Paul Rahe\u2019s comments on the Dershowitz defense of D\u2019Souza are well worth a read, as is Andy McCarthy\u2019s important piece on D\u2019Souza here at NRO.)\n\nYet a Reuters investigation by Alison Frankel, which makes an argument that D\u2019Souza was not unfairly targeted, may be most telling in the end. After significant research and reporting, Frankel acknowledges that given the amount of money involved, the charges against D\u2019Souza are unusual. Her \u201cgut feeling,\u201d she says, is that \u201cprosecutors like to make examples of notable alleged law-breakers, whatever their politics.\u201d\n\nThat prosecutors are \u201cmaking an example\u201dof D\u2019Souza is itself an important concession. D\u2019Souza\u2019s treatment-heavy criminal charges for an alleged infraction usually considered a misdemeanor \u2014 is atypical, even according to Frankel.\n\nYet if prosecutors make examples of high profile defendants, regardless of their politics, where are the liberal political pundits, left-leaning Hollywood filmmakers, or other celebrities on the left who\u2019ve been charged as D\u2019Souza has for the same alleged infraction? They may exist, but until we see examples, the most carefully reported D\u2019Souza-unfriendly piece I\u2019ve found in the mainstream press seems actually to buttress the argument that he\u2019s been unfairly targeted.\n\nHaving said all this, if Dinesh D\u2019Souza is found guilty of campaign-finance violations, he ought to pay a price. But will the penalty be just, given what appear to be inflated charges? At the moment, I\u2019m inclined to doubt it.\n\nI remain convinced that, in the fullness of time, a more truthful account of President Obama\u2019s political history and ideological leanings will emerge. In an effort to make that happen sooner rather than later, I am pleased to appear in Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s forthcoming film, America.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "D\u2019Souza\u2019s Case and My Role in His Film", "sailthru.author": "Stanley Kurtz", "description": "Serious questions have been raised about whether the indictment of Dinesh D\u2019Souza on charges that he violated campaign-finance law represents selective prosecution, double standards, and other forms of political mischief.

There was the Obama campaign\u2019s over-the-top attempts to discredit me, and its false denials (very arguably, knowingly false) when I pointed to evidence that Obama had joined a leftist third party.\n\nA variety of incidents, from the Obama campaign\u2019s attacks on me in 2008, to their treatment of David Freddoso, to the Obama administration\u2019s 2009 \u201cWar on Fox News,\u201d to the IRS scandal, show that the Obama administration is perfectly capable of politically-motivated targeting designed to silence, discredit, and intimidate critics.\n\nDespite my familiarity with Alinsky-style moves to silence \u201cenemies,\u201d in 2008 I at first believed that the Obama campaign\u2019s attempts to keep me off the radio had backfired politically and would not likely be repeated. The Freddoso incident proved me wrong. The Obama camp was willing to brave a spate of bad publicity \u2014 so long as it was generally confined to conservative circles \u2014 for the sake of keeping critical accounts, as well as damaging information about Obama\u2019s political past, out of broader circulation. The willingness of the mainstream press to ignore negative information about Obama\u2019s past, and to largely overlook his attempts to suppress such information, vindicated this hardball strategy.\n\nI\u2019ve had some differences with D\u2019Souza over the years, yet my respect for his work is real. His first book, Illiberal Education, helped to place me on my current trajectory. I took strong public exception, on the other hand, to The Enemy at Home.\n\n\nD\u2019Souza\u2019s Obama studies have strengths as well as weaknesses. Was Obama\u2019s political development shaped by knowledge of his absent father\u2019s socialism? I believe it was. In foreign affairs, has Obama\u2019s evident preference for \u201cmanaged decline\u201d been influenced by his African family\u2019s fraught encounter with the legacy of colonialism? I believe it has.\n\nIt\u2019s not implausible to attribute outsized significance to Obama\u2019s struggle with his absent father\u2019s legacy. That is the premise of Dreams from My Father, after all. Yet in concentrating so heavily on Obama\u2019s earliest years, D\u2019Souza weakens his case. To be rounded and convincing, any account of the president\u2019s ideological development has to pay more attention to Obama\u2019s adulthood than D\u2019Souza has done up to now.\n\nD\u2019Souza would concede this point, I believe, which is why he\u2019ll have more to say about Alinskyism in his forthcoming work, and why he sought me out to speak to the issue for his film.\u00a0 D\u2019Souza understands the need to grapple more directly than he has with Obama the community organizer and the budding politician. That said, nothing in Obama\u2019s later development is fundamentally at odds with D\u2019Souza\u2019s portrait of the young Obama.\n\nUltimately, D\u2019Souza\u2019s minor sins of rhetoric and emphasis pale by comparison to the mainstream press\u2019s refusal even to acknowledge, much less grapple with, the reality of the president\u2019s radical political past. Consider that President Obama joined a leftist third-party and allowed his 2008 campaign to lie about it to the American people.\n\nHad it been learned at any point in his presidency that President George W. Bush once joined a rightist third-party and had lied about it during his first presidential election campaign, the story would have been on every network newscast and every front page in the country for days, if not weeks. Yet when Obama\u2019s affiliation with a far-left party was demonstrated by archival documents, the major outlets said nothing.\n\nSo when D\u2019Souza asked me to speak about this and other issues for his forthcoming film, I was more than happy to do so.\n\nFor many, this will all be water under the bridge. But political lies do have a way of coming back to haunt their perpetrators. That is, of course, what happened with Obamacare, which could never have passed without the president\u2019s claims that you can keep your plan, keep your doctor, and save big money to boot. What encouraged Obama to believe he could get away with these lies if not his earlier success at suppressing the truth about his political past? The press had rolled over once. Surely they would do so again. They did.\n\nOver time, there will be a reckoning. Friends and associates of Obama have apparently already made available to sympathetic historians various documents-letters, event-transcripts, and such \u2014 that will enlarge the account of Obama\u2019s radical past I laid out in Radical-in-Chief and Spreading the Wealth. We will not see this material until Obama\u2019s term is over. When it finally emerges, I hope historians will allow the public access to the full-texts, and not simply secondary summaries, of these important yet currently unavailable documents.\n\nIn a sense, the process has already begun, since, as I point out in Radical-in-Chief, David Remnick\u2019s Obama biography acknowledges the truth of some of the most contested claims by Obama\u2019s critics, if only in \u201cblink-or-you\u2019ll-miss-it\u201d fashion.\n\nGiven this history, I am less-than-surprised to discover that a motion picture project with prospects of conveying poorly-known facts about Obama\u2019s radical past to a broad audience has hit a speed bump.\n\nThe decidedly non-conservative Alan Dershowitz rails against the D\u2019Souza case, calling it \u201can outrageous prosecution and certainly a misuse of resources.\u201d Elsewhere, Dershowitz says, \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that [D\u2019Souza\u2019s] politics have something to do with it. . . . it smacks of selective prosecution.\u201d (Paul Rahe\u2019s comments on the Dershowitz defense of D\u2019Souza are well worth a read, as is Andy McCarthy\u2019s important piece on D\u2019Souza here at NRO.)\n\nYet a Reuters investigation by Alison Frankel, which makes an argument that D\u2019Souza was not unfairly targeted, may be most telling in the end. After significant research and reporting, Frankel acknowledges that given the amount of money involved, the charges against D\u2019Souza are unusual. Her \u201cgut feeling,\u201d she says, is that \u201cprosecutors like to make examples of notable alleged law-breakers, whatever their politics.\u201d\n\nThat prosecutors are \u201cmaking an example\u201dof D\u2019Souza is itself an important concession.\u00a0 D\u2019Souza\u2019s treatment-heavy criminal charges for an alleged infraction usually considered a misdemeanor \u2014 is atypical, even according to Frankel.\n\nYet if prosecutors make examples of high profile defendants, regardless of their politics, where are the liberal political pundits, left-leaning Hollywood filmmakers, or other celebrities on the left who\u2019ve been charged as D\u2019Souza has for the same alleged infraction? They may exist, but until we see examples, the most carefully reported D\u2019Souza-unfriendly piece I\u2019ve found in the mainstream press seems actually to buttress the argument that he\u2019s been unfairly targeted.\n\nHaving said all this, if Dinesh D\u2019Souza is found guilty of campaign-finance violations, he ought to pay a price. But will the penalty be just, given what appear to be inflated charges? At the moment, I\u2019m inclined to doubt it.\n\nI remain convinced that, in the fullness of time, a more truthful account of President Obama\u2019s political history and ideological leanings will emerge.
