Bobby Jindal, a Republican, said Sunday that his state will comply with the 5-4 ruling Friday that gave same-sex couples the right to wed in all states, suddenly legalizing the practice in the final 13 states.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to comply with a court order; we don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Mr. Jindal, who last week announced that he is running for president, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nHe said he wants to see the appellate court papers that make it official before his state complies.\n\nOn Obamacare, the justices said Thursday that qualified customers could access government subsidies on Obamacare\u2019s exchanges no matter where they live, preserving tax credits for people in dozens of states that didn\u2019t set up their own health care exchanges.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said he would tear up the backup plan he submitted to the Health and Human Services Department in case the justices invalidated the subsidies that 382,000 of his residents use to afford plans on the federal HealthCare.gov website.\n\n\u201cI took steps to protect Pennsylvania\u2019s consumers by putting in place a contingency in the event the Supreme Court ruled people are not eligible for subsidies, but I am pleased to say that we will no longer need to rely on this plan,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials in Delaware, meanwhile, said they will continue to \u201cweigh the costs and benefits\u201d of a state-run exchange against their current model \u2014 a federal-state partnership that uses HealthCare.gov \u2014 and make a decision by the end of July.\n\nIn Arkansas, the only other state to submit a backup plan, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, said he was disappointed with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and that he was \u201cconvinced now more than ever that we need to proceed with caution\u201d in considering whether a state exchange would be worth it.\n\nOne of his state\u2019s past governors, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, called the Obamacare ruling an \u201cout-of-control act of judicial tyranny.\u201d He also said county clerks who object to the same-sex marriage ruling should be exempted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that every governor and every attorney general should just say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s the law of the land,\u2019 because there\u2019s no enabling legislation,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nSome states will be tempted to exempt themselves from running an Obamacare exchange, too, by ditching their faulty state websites and joining the 37 states that use HealthCare.gov.\n\nVermont Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, said his state should consider a regional exchange with Connecticut or make a wholesale switch to the federal exchange.\n\n\u201cFor 18 months, officials have dismissed repeated calls to explore alternatives to our dysfunctional exchange, saying to do so would put Vermonters at risk of losing their subsidies,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cNow, with today\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that federal subsidies can be offered in both state and federal health care exchanges, that fear is eliminated, and it\u2019s clear we must immediately explore alternatives to Vermont Health Connect.\u201d\n\nMinnesota state Rep. Tara Mack, a Republican, responded to the ruling by arguing that it is time for the state to abandon its state exchange, which has had technological problems. She said \u201cwith over $250 million already wasted on the broken MNsure website, it\u2019s time to stop throwing good money after bad.\u201d\n\nTheir calls to action reflect a broad shift toward use of HealthCare.gov, which stumbled out of the gate but recovered after a team of technical gurus salvaged the site in late 2013, setting up a relatively successful finish to Obamacare\u2019s first enrollment period and a calm second round.\n\nState exchanges in Oregon and Nevada couldn\u2019t recover from early glitches, however, so they turned to the federal government for their Web enrollment needs.\n\n\u201cOver time, it seems likely that additional state exchanges might transition to using HealthCare.gov, especially as they continue to grapple with how to ensure sustainability long-term,\u201d said Elizabeth Carpenter, a director at Avalere Health, a Washington-based consultancy. \u201cHowever, those states are likely to remain active in managing their insurance markets and conducting other on-the-ground activities such as consumer outreach and support.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pivotal Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare are reverberating in the states, where some officials are slow-walking overnight changes to their marriage laws and others want to retool their approaches to health care reform now that federal subsidies are on firm footing in all the states.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Pivotal Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare are reverberating in the states, where some officials are slow-walking overnight changes to their marriage laws and others want to retool their approaches to health care reform now that federal subsidies are on firm footing in all the states.", "title": "Obamacare, gay marriage Supreme Court rulings force states to change laws", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/28/obamacare-gay-marriage-supreme-court-rulings-force/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/20/GOP_2016_Struggling_Jindal.JPEG-09943.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/20/GOP_2016_Struggling_Jindal.JPEG-09943.jpg", "description": "Pivotal Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare are reverberating in the states, where some officials are slow-walking overnight changes to their marriage laws and others want to reto", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare, gay marriage Supreme Court rulings force states to change l"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Supreme Court, Bobby Jindal"}, "article_summary": "Pivotal Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and Obamacare are reverberating in the states, where some officials are slow-walking overnight changes to their marriage laws and others want to retool their approaches to health care reform now that federal subsidies are on firm footing in all the states.\nPhil Scott, a Republican, said his state should consider a regional exchange with Connecticut or make a wholesale switch to the federal exchange.\n\u201cHowever, those states are likely to remain active in managing their insurance markets and conducting other on-the-ground activities such as consumer outreach and support.\u201d\nState exchanges in Oregon and Nevada couldn\u2019t recover from early glitches, however, so they turned to the federal government for their Web enrollment needs.\nBobby Jindal, a Republican, said Sunday that his state will comply with the 5-4 ruling Friday that gave same-sex couples the right to wed in all states, suddenly legalizing the practice in the final 13 states."}
