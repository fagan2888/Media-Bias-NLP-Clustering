Most of the likely Democratic primary voters in South Carolina have never gone to college and never will. They probably don’t know or care what Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem said last week, or maybe any week, and are too busy trying to make ends meet to have a debate about which women owe what to whom.

Although Sanders dominated Clinton among millennial women in Iowa and New Hampshire, that won’t help him as much in the Palmetto state, where 86 percent of the voters in the 2008 Democratic primary were over 30 years old. That electorate was also 61 percent female and 55 percent African American. Sixty-three percent of the state's 2008 Democratic primary voters did not have college degrees, while 53 percent earned less than $50,000 a year.
