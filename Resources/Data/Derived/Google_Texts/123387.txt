A man police accuse of pulling a shotgun was hospitalized with serious injuries late Sunday, shot by Mountain View police pursuing him into Denver attempting a traffic stop.

Mountain View police tried to stop the man on West 44th Ave. and Yates Street around 9:56 p.m., Mountain View police spokesman Kirk Firko said. “The man got out with a shotgun,” Firko said, “and the police officer fired shots.”

Denver Police responded to the shooting. Residents of Yates Street, who were asked not to return to their homes as police worked the scene, reported hearing about 5 rapid shots.

The vehicle appeared to be a light colored hatchback. Denver police will investigate the shooting, Firko said.

Mountain View covers about 12 square blocks west of Denver and west of Sheridan Boulevard. The shooting occurred two blocks inside Denver.

Denver police late Sunday were interviewing the Mountain View police officer who did the shooting. Firko said he could not provide further details including the basis for the attempted traffic stop or the speed of the pursuit.
