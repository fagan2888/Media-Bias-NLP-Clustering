(Susan Hiland/Daily Republic)\n\nFAIRFIELD \u2014 Eat healthy foods and watching what goes into your body was the key to former 49er Otis Amey\u2019s message Saturday at the annual Solano Coalition for Better Health Faith Based Collaborative Health Fair and Awards Summit.\n\nSince leaving the team two years ago, Amey packed on 20 pounds. After a visit to the doctor, he went home in shock.\n\n\u201cHow did that happen? I wasn\u2019t eating what I thought was bad food,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter examining what he was eating, he realized the food wasn\u2019t as healthy as he thought.\n\n\u201cI never realized how much sugar was in my food. I read labels, I do the research and became aware of what goes in my body,\u201d he said.\n\nHe compared the experience of eating poorly to putting sugar in the gas tank of a car and expecting it to work right.\n\n\u201cThat just wasn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nHe took off the weight, and has since been talking to people about watching what they eat and staying healthy with regular exercise.\n\nAmey notices when he eats sugar he gets an unpleasant rush, when he eats something fatty he feels sluggish and his body just doesn\u2019t feel right.\n\nCelina Keshishian, project coordinator for Community Clinic Consortium, also gave an in-depth talk about insurance.\n\n\u201cThe system has become very complicated,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that one of the best parts of the Affordable Care Act was free preventive health care services.\n\n\u201cThat is the best and biggest change of the whole thing. It used to be you paid for these things like screenings for breast cancer but not anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nGigi Crowder, with Mental Health Friendly Communities, said she was excited to share a new project aimed at helping pastors and other faith-based workers identify when they can help mentally ill people or refer them to someone who is more equipped to deal with their issues.\n\n\u201cMany African-Americans who are suffering from some form of mental illness will go to their church first, when they really need to go to a doctor,\u201d Crowder said.\n\n\u201cRather than sending them home with Scripture to read, this is geared to help the pastor identify that this is a mental illness that needs another kind of assistance,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Rev. Bryan Harris of Emmanuel Temple Apostolic Church in Vallejo said he hoped that the health fair would bring information and awareness to the African-American community.\n\n\u201cOne of the big things we are focusing on in Solano County is the fight against diabetes,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHe said he hoped that by being at the Solano Community College it would be an event that would introduce healthy eating to a younger generation.\n\n\u201cThis is really the time when they start setting their eating habits for life,\u201d he said.\n\nReach Susan Hiland at 427-6981 or [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Republic", "description": "FAIRFIELD \u2014 Eat healthy foods and watching what goes into your body was the key to former 49er Otis Amey\u2019s message Saturday at the annual Solano Coalition for Better Health Faith Based Collab...", "title": "Ex-49er brings message of healthy eating to event", "url": "http://www.dailyrepublic.com/news/ex-49er-brings-message-of-healthy-eating-to-event/", "image": "http://www.dailyrepublic.com/files/2015/12/6-health-fair-otis-amey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T08:00:24-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-06T06:22:21-08:00", "author": "http://www.dailyrepublic.com/author/susanhiland/"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.dailyrepublic.com/files/2015/12/6-health-fair-otis-amey.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@AllDailyRepNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@AllDailyRepNews"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He said he hoped that by being at the Solano Community College it would be an event that would introduce healthy eating to a younger generation.\nAfter examining what he was eating, he realized the food wasn\u2019t as healthy as he thought.\nI wasn\u2019t eating what I thought was bad food,\u201d he said.\nHe compared the experience of eating poorly to putting sugar in the gas tank of a car and expecting it to work right.\n\u201cThis is really the time when they start setting their eating habits for life,\u201d he said."}
