HOUSTON — Texas prosecutors have filed a motion to revoke Adrian Peterson’s bond and have him re-arrested after the Minnesota Vikings running back allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana while he is awaiting trial on a felony child abuse charge.

In a motion filed Thursday, the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office accused Peterson of smoking marijuana while out on bond. He allegedly told a worker conducting his urinalysis exam during a Wednesday court appearance that “he smoked a little weed.” Not taking any illegal drugs are common terms to adhere to when out on bond.

Peterson has been put on paid leave while the case plays out. He has admitted using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier this year in suburban Houston.
