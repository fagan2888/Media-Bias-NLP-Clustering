She is president of The Morning Star Institute, which organizes the National Sacred Places Prayer Days. \u201cObservances are necessary,\u201d she said, \u201cin order to call attention to Native peoples\u2019 myriad struggles with developers who are endangering or destroying Native sacred places.\u201d\n\nMany observances are open to the public, but some are private. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that there is no constitutional or statutory cause of action to defend Native sacred places. \u201cNative Peoples are the only people or group in the U.S. who do not have a door to the courthouse to protect sacred places or site-specific ceremonies,\u201d Harjo said. \u201cThat must change as a simple matter of fairness and equity. Sadly, the Obama administration has backed developers that are desecrating sacred places and has done little to protect sacred places. The very least it can do is ask Congress to enact a statutory right of action.\u201d\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians has called for better protection of sacred sites using existing laws and policies.\n\nMany feel that President Barack Obama hasn\u2019t lived up to campaign promises. During his 2008 presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama addressed this issue in his Native American policy platform for religious freedom, cultural rights and sacred places protection: \u201cNative American sacred places and site-specific ceremonies are under threat from development, pollution, and vandalism. Barack Obama supports legal protections for sacred places and cultural traditions, including Native ancestors\u2019 burial grounds and churches.\u201d\n\nToward the end of 2012, five federal entities\u2014Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Energy and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation\u2014signed a five-year Memorandum of Understanding \u201cto improve the protection of and tribal access to Indian sacred sites through improved interdepartmental coordination and collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MOU does nothing of substance to protect sacred places, but provides for recommendations and a report by the end of 2017, the first year of the next Administration,\u201d says a press release from The Morning Star Institute.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today marks the beginning of ceremonies and observances being held across the land for 2014 National Days of Prayer to Protect Native sacred sites.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/20/national-sacred-places-prayer-days-begins-today-155413", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/mount-shasta.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "National Sacred Places Prayer Days Begins Today"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "National Sacred Places Prayer Days Begins Today"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/20/national-sacred-places-prayer-days-begins-today-155413", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-20T13:48-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American Sacred Sites, Sacred Sites, President Barack Obama", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "National Sacred Places Prayer Days Begins Today"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95f1\"", "article_summary": "Sadly, the Obama administration has backed developers that are desecrating sacred places and has done little to protect sacred places.\nShe is president of The Morning Star Institute, which organizes the National Sacred Places Prayer Days.\nToday marks the beginning of three days of ceremonies and observances being held across Turtle Island for 2014 National Days of Prayer to Protect Native American Sacred Places.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that there is no constitutional or statutory cause of action to defend Native sacred places.\nDuring his 2008 presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama addressed this issue in his Native American policy platform for religious freedom, cultural rights and sacred places protection: \u201cNative American sacred places and site-specific ceremonies are under threat from development, pollution, and vandalism."}
