In the latest \u201cHow Did We Get Here?\u201d video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia, evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe explains how evolution has shaped the human penis to be larger than its primates, the chimpanzee or gorilla, and why there exists such a discrepancy.\n\nVariations in penis size boil down to the evolutionary pressures associated with reproduction. These pressures vary from species to species. According to Curnoe, the size of a primate\u2019s genitalia comes from the level of competition involved in impregnating females.\n\n\u201cAmazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organized socially,\u201d said Curnoe in the video. For example, chimpanzees have medium-sized penises and large testicles \u2014 much larger than humans \u2014 because there is a lot of sperm competition between males. If a female is \u201creceptive to multiple males in each reproductive episode,\u201d it maximizes her chances of getting high-quality DNA. Therefore, this encourages chimpanzee males to fight to fertilize the egg.\n\nUnlike chimpanzees, gorillas\u2019 social groups assign one alpha male who gets to have sex with as many females as he wants. Therefore, gorillas are more likely to have small penises and small testicles. This is due to a lack of competition and the diminished need for sperm.\n\nNow, Curnoe asks, \u201cWhy is ours the longest?\u201d He believes the size of the human male penis can be partially explained by the upright posture. Walking on two feet makes leaves the penis out in the open with the possibility of attracting females. Since human females don\u2019t make themselves readily available like female chimpanzees, the human male penis must advertise itself, making it large and appealing.\n\nThe environment in which humans live in also factors in penis size. Early humans had to endure freezing temperatures that were more tolerable due to large penises, which release heat. The human penis helped regulate body temperature keeping it warm and cool.\n\nScience still has a lot of uncover when it comes to the penis, but studying primates can help lead to a better understanding about why it has evolved the way it has. While evolution can help explain the human male penis size, Curnoe admits, \u201cThere is still much more to the penis that meets the eye.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "evolution, penis, size, humans, have, large, penises, due, upright, posture, body, temperature", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Evolution helps explain why humans have larger penises than their primate cousins\u2019 chimpanzees and gorillas.", "title": "Why Humans Have Large Penises [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/evolution-penis-size-humans-have-large-penises-due-upright-posture-body-temperature-328272", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/06/evolution-penis-size-humans-have-large-penises-due-upright-posture-body-temperature.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Evolution helps explain why humans have larger penises than their primate cousins\u2019 chimpanzees and gorillas.", "title": "Why Humans Have Large Penises [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/evolution-penis-size-humans-have-large-penises-due-upright-posture-body-temperature-328272", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/06/evolution-penis-size-humans-have-large-penises-due-upright-posture-body-temperature.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/06/evolution-penis-size-humans-have-large-penises-due-upright-posture-body-temperature.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-04-06T17:35:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T10:35:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Evolution helps explain why humans have larger penises than their primate cousins\u2019 chimpanzees and gorillas."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda130\"", "article_summary": "Since human females don\u2019t make themselves readily available like female chimpanzees, the human male penis must advertise itself, making it large and appealing.\nWhile evolution can help explain the human male penis size, Curnoe admits, \u201cThere is still much more to the penis that meets the eye.\u201d\nThe human penis helped regulate body temperature keeping it warm and cool.\nNow, Curnoe asks, \u201cWhy is ours the longest?\u201d He believes the size of the human male penis can be partially explained by the upright posture.\nVariations in penis size boil down to the evolutionary pressures associated with reproduction."}
