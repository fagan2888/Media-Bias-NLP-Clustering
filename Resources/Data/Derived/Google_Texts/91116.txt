When Nikki Martinez was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, she needed a mastectomy — since she couldn’t do anything to change that, she laughed at it. Five years later, Martinez has developed a comedy routine around her diagnosis and is affectionately known as the "Cancer Queen of Comedy."

Martinez told CBS News making cancer her career was her way of "giving it the finger." She started off taking part in an annual breast cancer charity comedy show, and got massive laughs as she flung off her wig and talked about the absurdities of the disease that changed her life. "It’s my first time doing comedy, and I’m trying not to die!” she said to the crowd.

Martinez also incorporates some education into her shows, encouraging the audience to get regular screenings for breast cancer. She recognizes the special niche she's found in show business. "You're not gonna find too many healthy women that're gonna whip off a wig and a fake boob, so that is probably the only advantage…you can't really steal my jokes," Martinez said.

Mike Oquendo, the comedy show producer that hosts the annual charity show, says members of the audience can relate to Martinez’s experience with cancer. "In the course of a year, maybe 10 to 15 of our regular audience members at some point or another are dealing with it," he said.

Martinez deals with her condition every day: After her mastectomy, she went through 12 rounds of chemotherapy and 33 radiation treatments. Still, the cancer persisted. In 2012, doctors told Martinez her cancer isn't just back, but it's terminal. She currently has tumors from her scalp, down to her neck, spine, and hips. She plans to keep the laughter going, however, and has found strength in her daughter.

"I cannot leave her," she said. "I'm not ready."
