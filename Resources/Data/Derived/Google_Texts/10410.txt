Rep. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) got the backing of a major small business group on Wednesday, which has ditched its past support for Sen. Mary Landrieu (D.) due to her support of Obamacare.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) endorsed Cassidy for Senate, and said its 4,200 Louisiana members “will be out in force” for the Congressman this fall.

“Our members support the candidates who support small business, and Congressman Cassidy’s record speaks for itself,” said Lisa Goeas, NFIB vice president for Political and Grassroots, in a press release. “Cassidy has earned a 97-percent lifetime NFIB voting record in the U.S. House of Representatives.”

The organization said it is supporting Cassidy for his votes on energy policy, the National Labor Relations Board, family leave, and his support for delaying the individual mandate in Obamacare.

“On the other hand, Mary Landrieu voted against repealing Obamacare,” Goeas said. “She voted against an amendment that would have protected individuals and small-business owners from higher taxes. She voted against permanently eliminating the estate tax, which makes it harder for people to pass their family businesses to their children.”

“Louisiana’s Main Street communities, businesses and families are tired of empty campaign promises, and simply can’t afford six more years of Mary Landrieu,” she added.

The NFIB launched a candidate website and will air radio and online ads in support of Cassidy.

The group previously endorsed Landrieu in 2008, and gave her the “Guardian of Small Business” award that year.

Recent polling has given Cassidy a slight edge in the close race this year.
