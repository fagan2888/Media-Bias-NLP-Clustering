MADISON COUNTY, Ala. (WHNT) - In terms of explosive incidents, over a fireworks career that stretches more than two decades, Julie L. Heckman says she's seen five incidents.

As the executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA), she's often the person people turn to when the disasters like Friday's explosion at Ultratec occur.

"The whole industry is very concerned. It's devastating news when you find out that there was an incident and there was a loss of life," she said.

The fireworks business is loaded with rules, and with good reason.

"You're dealing with highly energetic materials that are classified as explosives," she explained. "They're highly sensitive to static and friction."

Heckman says the highest risk is found in manufacturing plants, just like the Owens Cross Roads plant where two lives were taken following the blast.

"Every time they do occur, it's a headline."

She says it's a close-knit industry where many people knew the victims who lost their lives Friday.

"It becomes really hard to stomach," she said.

The APA is offering support while waiting on the end of the investigation into the incident to see how it can lead to policy changes to prevent further incidents.

"There are some high risk jobs out there and manufacturing highly energetic material is on of them," Heckman said.

"We certainly don't want to hurt anyone so we want to learn from this unfortunate tragic accident and do the best we can to make sure we don't have another incident and another loss of life."
