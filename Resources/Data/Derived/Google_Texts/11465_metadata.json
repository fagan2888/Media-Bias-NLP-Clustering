She was diagnosed with having taeniasis after visiting a doctor in Xiamen, a Fujian province in China, according to the NY Daily News.\n\nTaeniasis is a parasitic infection caused by a tapeworm after consuming either beef or pork. Humans are likely to become infected with these types of tapeworms after eating undercooked or raw meat.\n\nWhen a human eats a piece of uncooked meat with eggs of a tapeworm still alive, the eggs can grow and hatch inside of someone. According to the Mayo Clinic, many people who have a tapeworm are unaware of their symptoms. However, if left untreated they can cause severe organ and tissue damage. Some symptoms include, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are approximately less than 1,000 cases diagnosed each year. But due to the lack of reporting, the exact number is not known.\n\nTo diagnose a tapeworm, there are three different options: stool sample analysis, blood test, or imaging exam. And the most comment types of treatments include oral medications such as praziquantel (Biltricide), albendazole (Albenza), nitazoxanide (Alinia).\n\nEarlier this year, Dr. Michael Mosley, British journalist known for self-experimenting, infected himself with a tapeworm to see the effect it would have on his body.
