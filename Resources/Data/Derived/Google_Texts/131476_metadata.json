Pohl, Ph.D., professor emerita at The University of Michigan School of Nursing; Deborah J. Barksdale, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the Doctor of Nursing Practice program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and Kathryn (Kitty) E. Werner, executive director of the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties. At the same time, the number of NPs graduating and entering the healthcare field has increased.\n\nThe National Center for Health Workforce Analysis predicts that by 2020 the country will face a shortage of primary care physicians as high as 20,400.\n\nThe authors wrote that it's time to eliminate the barriers to NPs so they can practice to the fullest extent of their training and they can fill the gap left by the shortage. Currently 21 states and the District of Columbia allow NPs to practice fully under their own licenses without requirements for supervision and other states have legislation pending to expand the scope of practice for NPs. Nebraska expanded the role of nurse practitioners earlier this year.\n\n\"The unnecessary requirements in numerous states for physicians to sign orders for physical therapy or other referrals, supervise NPs, or sign off on numerous other documents are costly, waste precious physician time, and are not feasible in the real healthcare world,\" the authors wrote.\n\nRegulations that support a patient's access to NPs are essential to meet the demand for medical care, they said. Expanding NPs ability to practice independently will help provide care in rural areas where access to healthcare is often more problematic, but physician groups are often opposed to those efforts.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the post\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNurse scope of practice expansion may help ease rural healthcare woes\n\nNebraska latest state to expand nurse practitioners' role\n\nExpanded scope of practice may boost patient outcomes, transition to value-based care", "article_metadata": {"description": "Increasing numbers of nurse practitioners who enter the healthcare field could help fill the gap created by a shortage of primary care physicians, according to an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0on the\u00a0Health Affairs Blog.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Increasing numbers of nurse practitioners who enter the healthcare field could help fill the gap created by a shortage of primary care physicians, according to an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0on the\u00a0Health Affairs Blog.", "title": "Why healthcare must eliminate barriers for nurse practitioners", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/why-healthcare-must-eliminate-barriers-nurse-practitioners/2015-07-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,health affairs,HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,nurse practitioners,Patient Care & Outcomes,Physician Shortages,primary care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Increasing numbers of nurse practitioners (NP) who enter the healthcare field could help fill the gap created by a shortage of primary care physicians, according to an opinion piece on the Health Affairs Blog.\nThe National Center for Health Workforce Analysis predicts that by 2020 the country will face a shortage of primary care physicians as high as 20,400.\nTo learn more:- read the postRelated articles:Nurse scope of practice expansion may help ease rural healthcare woesNebraska latest state to expand nurse practitioners' roleExpanded scope of practice may boost patient outcomes, transition to value-based care\nAt the same time, the number of NPs graduating and entering the healthcare field has increased.\nNebraska expanded the role of nurse practitioners earlier this year."}
