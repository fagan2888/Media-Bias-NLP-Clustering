Traumatic memories from childhood could cause you to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood.\n\nBut new research shows that you don't have to have a vivid memory of your trauma to develop PTSD. Your mind may subconsciously remember the fear that you experienced many years ago, even if you don\u2019t recall any or very few of the details.\n\nDr. Andrew Poulos, a former University of California, Los Angeles, postdoctoral scholar, and his colleagues conducted a study to find out if some parts of early life memories still exist, and how they affect people later in life. For the study, the researchers used rodents to test their hypothesis. The juvenile rodents were placed in unpredictable new and stressful environments. The animals were tested later as adults to see if they remembered the stressful situations, and the researchers measured their levels of fear. Rodents that were exposed to the stressful environments showed more signs of anxiety and fear, the researchers found.\n\n\u201cThese heightened levels of fear and anxiety corresponded with drastic changes in daily rhythms of circulating hormone corticosterone,\u201d Poulos said in a press release. Corticosterone is the hormone that controls your response to stress. In this experiment, researchers found that in the amygdala, the part of the brain that learns fear, corticosterone levels increased.\n\nThe researchers concluded that you don\u2019t have to remember traumatic events to experience negative effects, such as fear and anxiety. According to Mayo Clinic, PTSD is a mental condition that is triggered by traumatic events you\u2019ve experienced or witnessed. If you have constant flashbacks, nightmares, or severe anxiety, you could be suffering from the disorder.\n\nAccording to the Department of Veterans Affairs, every year, 5.2 million adults suffer from PTSD. Victims of abuse, people with mental problems, or those who have suddenly lost loved ones are more prone to developing the disease. In urban communities, the condition is known controversially as the \u201chood disease.\u201d Kids who have witnessed murders are also at risk for developing the disorder. \u201cYouth living in inner cities show a higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder than soldiers,\u201d Dr. Howard Spivak, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division of Violence Prevention, told CBS San Francisco.\n\nOverall, your past could be causing anxiety in your present-day life even though you don\u2019t remember the exact event that triggered it.\n\nFor people struggling with symptoms of PTSD, Mayo Clinic recommends psychotherapy combined with certain medications. Psychotherapy can be divided into several categories. For example, cognitive therapy helps PTSD patients recognize their thinking patterns, while exposure therapy uses virtual reality programs to allow you to re-enter the environment you were traumatized in. Sometimes, PTSD patients are also prescribed antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications to ease their symptoms.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "post traumatic stress disorder, memory, explicit, childhood", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study suggests that people may experience PTSD without ever remember the event that triggered it.
