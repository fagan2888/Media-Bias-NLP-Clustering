AURORA — Hundreds of students at a middle school were evacuated Monday after authorities found the remnants of a pipe bomb, leading them to search for other explosives.

The search began about 9 a.m. at Mrachek Middle School on the 1900 block of South Telluride Street after a school resource officer found the bomb. Wendy Lippman, a captain with the Aurora Fire Department, said the officer was looking in an alcove between two buildings and found the device, which had been packed with shrapnel.

Lippman said an undisclosed number of suspects tried to detonate the bomb outside the middle school at 6:30 p.m. Saturday but were unsuccessful. Investigators believe that had the bomb been properly detonated, it could have caused significant damage.

Surveillance video showed the individuals trying to light the device on fire, officials said.

“They have very good video of the suspects,” Lippman said, adding that no other devices were found.

Law enforcement was working with school officials to identify and contact those in the video, she said. Investigators did not release details about those involved in the attempted detonation.

“As a precaution, we have evacuated the building,” said Georgia Duran, a spokeswoman for Aurora Public Schools.

Duran said officials moved the students to Rangeview High School and then dismissed them for the day. Classes will resume Tuesday.

Aurora and Denver police, the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office and the Aurora Fire Department searched the building. No injuries were reported.
