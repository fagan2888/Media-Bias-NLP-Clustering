The candidates appeared separately and were asked questions from a panel of chamber reps, as well as follow-ups from moderator Derek McGinty from WUSA 9 TV.\n\nGillespie, a former Republican National Committee chair, said Warner, first elected to the Senate in 2008, is not representing Virginia\u2019s best interests.\n\n\u201cHe has voted 97 percent of time with Obama,\u201d said Gillespie. \u201cInstead of being a vote for us, he has been a blank check for president Obama. Since Warner and Obama took office, we have nearly twice as many people go on food stamps than we have had jobs created.\u201d\n\nWarner pointed out that every piece of legislation he has worked on in the Senate has been alongside a Republican counterpart. He said Gillespie comes from a partisan world where it is always Republican vs. Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf there is ever a time to drop partisanship and come together, that time is now,\u201d said Warner. \u201cIf you want someone able to take arrows from both sides, I would respectfully ask you to rehire me. Don\u2019t lose heart \u2014 there are more good people with goodwill in both parties. We have just got to and make it safe for them to work together again.\u201d\n\nGillespie said too many Virginians are being squeezed in an economy with rising food and energy costs and slow job growth. \u201cSome say we have to accept economic conditions as the new normal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new normal is the old mediocre \u2014 and we can do better. This is the result of bad policies and government grown too big.\u201d\n\nGillespie repeatedly referred to his five-point plan, called EG2 (\u201cEd Gillespie\u2019s Agenda for Economic Growth). His main points: Replace the Affordable Care Act, which he calls the single biggest drag on our economy; Unleash energy, starting with drilling off Virginia\u2019s coast; Provide tax and regulatory relief; education reform and cutting wasteful spending and concentrate on beefing up defense.\n\nWarner says his career record speaks for itself. He referred to his term as Virginia governor (2002-2006), in which he inherited a deficit and left with a $1 billion surplus, a ranking as the best state in which to do business and the creation of 130,000 new jobs.\n\n\u201cAs senator, I have tried to take that same approach,\u201d he said. \u201cMy record is simple. When I agree with the president, I work with him. When I don\u2019t, I step up.\u201d\n\nWarner cited across-the-aisle examples such as calling on the administration to stand up to Russian President Vladmir Putin and to build broader coalition against ISIL. Meanwhile, Warner called last year\u2019s sequestration \u201cstupidity on steroids,\u201d even though he was among the 74 senators \u2014 a bipartisan mix \u2014 that voted in favor of it.\n\n\u201cThe alternative was another government shut down, which would have been worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got to take on entitlement reform and tax reform. Until we grapple with that, we are not going to get our balance sheet in order.\u201d\n\nHe also said the ACA is flawed and the challenge is now to fix it, not repeal it.\n\n\u201cWhat I hear constantly in Virginia is \u2018we are tired of being a political football \u2014 just fix it\u2019, \u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep prexisting conditions, women treated equally as men, keeping kids on the plan till they are 26. But there is a lot Congress did not get right.\n\n\u201cI would remind folks everyone loves Medicare now. Congress did not get Medicare right the first time 49 years ago. I have never invested in a business that met its business plan. The ones that work know how to adjust and change. We have got to have people who are willing to work together and change it.\u201d\n\nRecent polls have Warner ahead of Gillespie by as many as 22 points. Election Day is Nov. 4.
