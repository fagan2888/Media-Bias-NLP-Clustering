Two of three shooting suspects chased by Adams County sheriff deputies and police — and stopped using spike strips — were caught in central Brighton, authorities said Sunday night.

Authorities were searching for the third man.

The shootings occurred in Commerce City several weeks ago, Brighton Police commander Frank Acosta said.

One of the suspects was spotted Sunday. Police “attempted to stop him. He took off” at speeds up to 80 miles per hour, Acosta said.

Names of the three men were not released Sunday night.

A vehicle carrying them crashed after hitting the spikes and losing a tire. The three men got out and ran. “They were jumping into backyards,” Acosta said.

One of the suspects was thought to be armed, he said.

Colorado State Patrol troopers aided the effort providing perimeter support, patrol spokesman Nate Reid said, “to make sure nobody got out of the area.”
