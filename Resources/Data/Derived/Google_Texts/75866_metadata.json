Recent data from the federal government shows that a surprising number of people are doing just that.\n\nMore than 30 percent of federal marketplace customers who re-enrolled for 2015 did so by actively returning to Healthcare.gov and picking a plan, according to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell. That\u2019s still less than half of all customers, but it far exceeds what you might expect based on consumer behavior in other public health insurance marketplaces.\n\n\u201cI initially expected active renewals to be much lower than that,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, a vice president at the health care consultancy Avalere Health, in an email.\n\nThe Obama administration expected that many people wouldn\u2019t shop again. That\u2019s why they set up a default setting that would automatically renew people into their existing health plans or a similar one.\n\nThe numbers released this week were the first that included any information about the people being automatically renewed into their existing plans. Altogether, the government estimates that 4.5 million people who bought 2014 plans in marketplaces managed by the federal government have been enrolled in plans for 2015. Of those, Ms. Burwell said that the proportion who returned to the Healthcare.gov website to actively pick a 2015 plan was in the \u201cmid-to-high\u201d 30-percent range.\n\nMany Returning Obamacare Shoppers Switched Plans The rate of plan switching was far higher for HealthCare.gov than previous government insurance markets. Percent of customers switching HealthCare.gov Medicare Part D Federal employees Massachsuetts Commonwealth Care 29% 13% 12% 7% Percent of customers switching HealthCare.gov Medicare Part D Federal Employees Massachsuetts Commonwealth Care 29% 13% 12% 7%\n\nAn H.H.S. analysis estimated that more than 70 percent of customers would be able to find a cheaper plan in the same category if they were willing to switch. An Upshot analysis of data from the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform showed those savings could be quite substantial in some markets. Benefits in some plans are also changing, as a ProPublica analysis published in The Upshot highlighted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Burwell said that returning customers received between three and 10 \u201ctouches\u201d from the government, encouraging them to consider new options. Americans still have until Feb. 15 to switch into a new product if they wish.\n\nLarry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, says he thinks general confusion about how the Affordable Care Act marketplaces work may have also played a role in overcoming consumer inertia. The messages about the need to return to the market and shop, he said, may have drowned out messages telling people that automatic renewal was an option.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe high rate of returning shoppers may reflect differences in the marketplace\u2019s customers, compared with those in the other markets that have been studied in the most detail: senior citizens buying prescription drug plans and federal workers picking plans on their health benefit exchange. These customers may be more sophisticated web users or more price sensitive. They are also more likely to have had in-person help picking their first plan from a counselor, a person they may have called again for advice about renewals.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what percentage of the people who returned to the federal website actually changed plans after doing so. But a more-than-30-percent shopping rate still looks pretty good compared with the switching rates that have been observed in those programs, between 7 and 13 percent.\n\nThe high rate of shopping may be a good sign for the future of the exchanges, where price competition between health plans is the primary mechanism for keeping premiums low.\n\nBut the power of inertia in insurance markets remains a powerful force. Last year, President Obama signed up for a bronze plan on the D.C. Health Link, the district\u2019s marketplace. The move was largely symbolic; the president receives his health care from the military. This year, according to a White House official, he stuck with the same plan.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141224155643, "twitter": {"description": "The high rate of shopping may be a good sign for the future of the exchanges, where price competition is the primary mechanism for keeping premiums low.", "title": "People Are Shopping for Health Insurance, Surprisingly", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/upshot/people-are-shopping-for-health-insurance-surprisingly.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003416956"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "sangerkatz", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/11/upshot/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566-thumbLarge-v3.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/upshot/people-are-shopping-for-health-insurance-surprisingly.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003416956", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/upshot/people-are-shopping-for-health-insurance-surprisingly.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 24, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "HealthCare.gov", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,HealthCare.gov,Shopping and Retail", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/11/upshot/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566-thumbLarge-v3.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The high rate of shopping may be a good sign for the future of the exchanges, where price competition is the primary mechanism for keeping premiums low.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/11/upshot/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566-thumbStandard-v3.png", "description": "The high rate of shopping may be a good sign for the future of the exchanges, where price competition is the primary mechanism for keeping premiums low.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 24, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Shopping and Retail", "published": "2014-12-24", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "25up-switch", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150824161422, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/upshot/people-are-shopping-for-health-insurance-surprisingly.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/11/upshot/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566/obamacare-facts-affordable-care-act-enrollment-1415663684566-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.png", "type": "article", "description": "The high rate of shopping may be a good sign for the future of the exchanges, where price competition is the primary mechanism for keeping premiums low.", "title": "People Are Shopping for Health Insurance, Surprisingly"}, "pdate": 20141224, "des": "Shopping and Retail", "articleid": 100000003416956, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "People Are Shopping for Health Insurance, Surprisingly", "col": "Public Health", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd48c6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI initially expected active renewals to be much lower than that,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, a vice president at the health care consultancy Avalere Health, in an email.\nAs we\u2019ve said many times before, it really pays for returning customers to the Obamacare insurance marketplaces to shop around for a 2015 health plan.\nThat\u2019s why they set up a default setting that would automatically renew people into their existing health plans or a similar one.\nThe move was largely symbolic;
