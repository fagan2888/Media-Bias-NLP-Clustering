An elderly woman on Friday backed into three parked cars in a Long Island Trader Joe\u2019s before putting her car in drive, ramming over a curb, and smashing 20 feet into the building. Fifteen were injured, reports Fox 5 out of New York on Friday.\n\nAn elderly woman's car is hauled out of the gaping hole she left in a Long Island Trader Joe's after she lost control and smashed into the building, injuring 15.\n\nThe accident occurred at the Trader Joe\u2019s in Oceanside, Long Island around 1 p.m. on Friday. Oceanside\u2019s First Assistant Fire Chief Kevin Klein said two were injured seriously, but that it could have been much worse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle there were no fatalities,\u201d Klein said. \u201cThe store was crowded, and she entered through the front, right where the cash registers are, where people were lined up. . . . It was the worst-case scenario where she hit them.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed driver of the white sedan was said to be unhurt but \u201cdisoriented.\u201d\n\nA dozen people were taken to hospitals, most with injuries from broken glass. At least one person was pinned by the woman\u2019s out-of-control car.\n\n\"I looked back and realized what had happened someone drove through the front of the store, and the fact that it happened is unexplainable,\" said witness Eric Lemberg, who was in a checkout line when the car came smashing though.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trader Joe\u2019s have their own parking lots, and no they are not inside of the store.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "Officials say 15 people were injured after a car crashed through a Long Island Trader Joe\u2019s Friday afternoon.", "title": "Trader Joe's: Elderly woman, 80, plows into Long Island Trader Joe's, injures 15", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/98/f8/98f8f56fe369e64bed26f43b40eede70.jpg?itok=IQNEsevO", "video": {"width": 480, "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 401}, "type": "movie"}, "twitter": {"site": "@examinercom", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/98/f8/98f8f56fe369e64bed26f43b40eede70.jpg?itok=IQNEsevO", "description": "Trader Joe\u2019s have their own parking lots, and no they are not inside of the store.", "card": "summary", "title": "Trader Joe's: Elderly woman, 80, plows into Long Island Trader Joe's, injures 15"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-12-07T02:25:23-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Top News, trader joes, Long Island", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f8b\"", "article_summary": "The accident occurred at the Trader Joe\u2019s in Oceanside, Long Island around 1 p.m. on Friday.\nAn elderly woman's car is hauled out of the gaping hole she left in a Long Island Trader Joe's after she lost control and smashed into the building, injuring 15.\nAn elderly woman on Friday backed into three parked cars in a Long Island Trader Joe\u2019s before putting her car in drive, ramming over a curb, and smashing 20 feet into the building.\nTrader Joe\u2019s have their own parking lots, and no they are not inside of the store.\nOceanside\u2019s First Assistant Fire Chief Kevin Klein said two were injured seriously, but that it could have been much worse."}
