Marco Rubio - also in Oklahoma City Friday - who has emerged as a GOP establishment favorite.\n\n\"They hate him in Florida. They hate him,\" Trump said, almost as soon as he had taken the stage. \"He defrauded Florida, if you think about it. He runs, he becomes a senator, he doesn't show up to vote, he's never around.\"\n\nTrump got a hand in his attacks from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a recent presidential-race dropout and, on the campaign trail, a frequent Rubio critic.\n\nChristie endorsed Trump for president Friday and appeared with the front-runner on stage.\n\n\"America needs a strong leader who will restore American strength around the world, and Donald Trump is that man,\" Christie told the crowd. \"Marco Rubio, your campaign is almost over, buddy. He's showing a lot of desperation today, throwing punches from a lot of angles, but none of them are landing, because America has made its decision. Donald Trump represents strength. Marco Rubio represents Washington, D.C.\"\n\nTrump's biggest applause lines of the night included his pledge to protect the second amendment and gun owners, remarking: \"Boy, you people do like your guns, don't you?\"\n\nHe also got an ovation for pledging to end Common Core education and for calling himself \"the greatest jobs president that God ever created. We're not going to get ripped off anymore.\"\n\nThe brash style is what his supporters and campaign volunteers said they like about the businessman.\n\n\"I like how he\u2019s bold, and I like how he\u2019s not afraid to say things that other candidates may not,\" said Jackson Balkman, who isn't even old enough to vote.\n\n\"This country wasn\u2019t built on political correctness,\" said Curtis Wilson. \"It was built on businessmen, hardworking men and leadership skills.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "OKLAHOMA CITY - It was like a reunion tour for Donald Trump Friday night.
