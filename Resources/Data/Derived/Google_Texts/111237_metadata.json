CFA opposes the Obama administration\u2019s proposal, saying it doesn\u2019t go far enough. Instead, the group supports a bill now before Congress that would create an independent agency operating outside of the HHS umbrella. While IFSH doesn\u2019t appear to take a formal position on the Obama administration proposal, two of IFSH\u2019s three key constituents happen to be the food industry and the FDA itself.\n\nAfter I expressed skepticism over the proposed reform on HuffPost Live in part because small, local food producers had been threatened by FDA rules the agency proposed under the Food Safety Modernization Act, and I feared a new agency would likely dream up further threats. But Brackett said he could care less if that was the case.\n\n\u201cHaving a robust food safety system in place should apply to the large companies as well as to the small companies,\u201d said Brackett, who previously served in top regulatory positions with both the FDA and the nation\u2019s top grocery lobby.\n\nOther noted food-safety advocates echo Brackett\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cI think everyone producing food\u2013no exceptions\u2013should be using science-based food safety procedures with testing,\u201d Marion Nestle told Food Safety News in 2009.\n\nBut small competitors typically can\u2019t comply with regulations written for large producers. That means big food producers get bigger, and smaller ones disappear. That consolidation is then used to justify the need for more stringent regulations, which leads to more consolidation, which leads to calls for stricter regulations. It\u2019s a death spiral that is crushing small, local food producers, as local-food advocates have lamented, sometimes in pleas to liberal allies.\n\nWhile dueling food-safety advocates and local-food supporters are often found on the political left, I\u2019ve described a similar disconnect over the years among those on the political right. As I\u2019ve noted before, many Republicans are quick to suspend their purported devotion to the free market on any issue pertaining to farmers and subsidies. In fact, I\u2019ve written, Republicans are typically the worst offenders when it comes to doling out farm subsidies to businesses in need of no handout.\n\nThat coziness between politicians and business is evident in the push for stricter food-safety regulations, too. That food-safety advocates whistle the same tune as large food producers on the issue of food safety is a fact many of those advocates don\u2019t like to acknowledge. In fact, when I noted this reality in a 2013 column on FSMA, two writers from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a group that evidences the phenomenon, took issue with my claims, protesting that a regulatory partnership between government, advocates, and big business was as rare as a Yeti sighting. (Hardly.)\n\nIf there are benefits to be gained from buying local food, more stringent food-safety regulations impede those benefits from being realized.\n\nBut where does this partnership between government, food-safety advocates, and big business leave the aforementioned \u201clocal food movement\u201d championed by many others on the left\u2014including leading thinkers like Michael Pollan?\n\nPollan may have thought he could have it all.\n\nBack in 2010, Pollan lauded FSMA, saying \u201cit promises to achieve several important food safety objectives, greatly benefiting consumers without harming small farmers or local food producers.\u201d\n\nClearly, that\u2019s not the case. But, according to his website, that was the last Pollan had to say on food safety and local food.\n\nWith FSMA's disastrous rollout, and the calls by peers like Nestle to strengthen it further, what can he say? Disconnect between staunch supporters of rigid, process-oriented food safety regulations and advocates for local food is palpable. Their goals are simply at loggerheads.\n\nThe Obama administration has tried to placate both sides. But\u2014whether they care to admit it or not\u2014the ongoing debate over increasing food-safety regulations and expanding local food options pits heavyweight food-policy experts like Nestle against peers like Pollan. Victory for the former would mean fewer small producers and fewer choices for consumers. I think it\u2019s incumbent on local food supporters like Pollan to argue that point.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It's time for key local food advocates to admit\u2014loudly\u2014that strict food safety regulations are not the answer.", "title": "Stricter Food Safety Regulations Mean Fewer Local Food Options", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/02/14/stricter-food-safety-regulations-mean-fe", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14238536517783.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's time for key local food advocates to admit\u2014loudly\u2014that strict food safety regulations are not the answer.", "title": "Stricter Food Safety Regulations Mean Fewer Local Food Options", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14238536517783.jpg", "creator": "@baylenlinnekin", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-02-14T13:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/baylen-linnekin"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1422\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think everyone producing food\u2013no exceptions\u2013should be using science-based food safety procedures with testing,\u201d Marion Nestle told Food Safety News in 2009.\nDisconnect between staunch supporters of rigid, process-oriented food safety regulations and advocates for local food is palpable.\nBut, according to his website, that was the last Pollan had to say on food safety and local food.\nIf there are benefits to be gained from buying local food, more stringent food-safety regulations impede those benefits from being realized.\nVictory for the former would mean fewer small producers and fewer choices for consumers."}
