But it came after two previous orders from the judge concerning her business relationship with another lawyer and a story in The Denver Post detailing that relationship.\n\nThe Post reported that Palmer and Jennifer Gormley, who had borrowed $1.5 million to buy an office building for themselves and other tenants, together charged four estates more than $400,000 in fees. Members of the four families say they were not informed of the business relationship between Palmer and Gormley.\n\nPalmer could not be reached for comment.\n\nPublic administrators are appointed in probate court cases where no heir is named or willing to distribute the assets of an estate. They also may be called as conservators of estates when people are judged incompetent to handle their own finances.\n\nIn 2012, Palmer reported charging with the court\u2019s approval a total of $319,851 in fees and costs for managing 87 estates.\n\nOne of the heirs welcomed Judge Sylvester\u2019s decision Friday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather pleasant news,\u201d said Robert Lewis, one of Eleanor Lewis\u2019 four children. He and his sister, Janet Van Vliet, said much of their mother\u2019s $2 million estate was depleted in four years for 24-hour care, guardianship services, legal fees and other costs.\n\nPalmer was the conservator of Eleanor Lewis\u2019 estate, and Gormley was paid about $41,000 in legal fees after the guardian hired her. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s left is the family ranch we\u2019re trying to keep,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nIn April, Judge Sylvester issued an order that Palmer and Gormley could not be involved in the same estate cases without court approval. Last month, he asked Palmer to advise him of any cases where she and Gormley continued to collect fees. Palmer responded that there were four, but she had been appointed to each before the judge\u2019s April order.\n\nJudge Sylvester appointed probate lawyer Marco Chayet to succeed Palmer and instructed her to cooperate with him \u201cto ensure a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arapahoe judge dismisses official who heirs say mishandled estates", "title": "Arapahoe judge dismisses official who heirs say mishandled estates", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/07/arapahoe-judge-dismisses-official-who-heirs-say-mishandled-estates/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-07T18:18:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-07T18:18:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b0e\"", "article_summary": "The chief District Court judge in Arapahoe County has dismissed a public administrator who had been accused by four families of mishandling their estates with her business partner.\nIn April, Judge Sylvester issued an order that Palmer and Gormley could not be involved in the same estate cases without court approval.\nPublic administrators are appointed in probate court cases where no heir is named or willing to distribute the assets of an estate.\nJudge Sylvester appointed probate lawyer Marco Chayet to succeed Palmer and instructed her to cooperate with him \u201cto ensure a smooth transition.\u201dDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dolingerdp\nMembers of the four families say they were not informed of the business relationship between Palmer and Gormley."}
