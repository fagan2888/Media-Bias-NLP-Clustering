Some 60% of taxpayers use them to prepare their returns.\n\nIt is important to choose carefully when hiring an individual or firm to prepare your return. Well-intentioned taxpayers can be misled by preparers who don\u2019t understand taxes or who mislead people into taking credits or deductions they aren\u2019t entitled to in order to increase their fee. Every year, these types of tax preparers face everything from penalties to even jail time for defrauding their clients.\n\nWhat to do\n\nHere are a few tips from the IRS on choosing a tax preparer:\n\nAsk if the preparer has an IRS Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). Paid tax return preparers are required to register with the IRS, have a PTIN and include it on your filed tax return.\n\nInquire whether the tax return preparer has a professional credential (enrolled agent, certified public accountant, or attorney), belongs to a professional organization or attends continuing education classes. A number of tax law changes, including the Affordable Care Act provisions, can be complex. A competent tax professional needs to be up-to-date in these matters. Tax return preparers aren\u2019t required to have a professional credential, but make sure you understand the qualifications of the preparer you select. IRS.gov has more information regarding the national tax professional organizations.\n\nCheck the preparer\u2019s qualifications. Use the IRS Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers with Credentials and Select Qualifications. This tool can help you find a tax return preparer with the qualifications that you prefer. The Directory is a searchable and sortable listing of certain preparers registered with the IRS. It includes the name, city, state and zip code of:\n\n-- Attorneys\n\n-- CPAs\n\n-- Enrolled Agents\n\n-- Enrolled Retirement Plan Agents\n\n-- Enrolled Actuaries\n\n-- Annual Filing Season Program participants", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/browserconfig.9a449e447575.xml", "description": "While the vast majority of tax professionals provide honest service, there are scoundrels out there.
