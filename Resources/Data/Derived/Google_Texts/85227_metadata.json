So the same vaccine strain can be used next year, making it easier for drugmakers, who already know how to produce the medication.\n\nThe news isn\u2019t all good, however, as officials warn it may be more difficult to develop a vaccine for the winter of 2015-16 as a number of components for this year\u2019s virus could change drastically by that time.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how the vaccine performed, the Post says it was 74% effective at avoiding flu severe enough to warrant medical treatment. But it wasn\u2019t good enough to avoid having to get a shot again next year, CDC officials say.\n\nJason McDonald, CDC spokesman, says the antibodies that came with this year\u2019s flu shot won\u2019t live long enough to ward off the virus next year.\n\n\u201cWe highly recommend that you do [get another shot],\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe immunity kind of wanes.\u201d\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare may not save on high costs of specialty drugs\n\nActavis continues hot streak with better-than-expected earnings\n\nExpect firms to rethink plans and a system disruption under Obamacare", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-02-20T16:28:18-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control says the flu vaccine used this past year may make a rare curtain call next year.", "title": "2013-2014 flu vaccine may make rare curtain call next season", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/20/2013-2014-flu-vaccine-may-make-rare-curtain-call-next-season/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV051_flu_sh_MG_20140220153326.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Centers for Disease Control,Flu shots", "article.headline": "2013-2014 flu vaccine may make rare curtain call next season", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Centers for Disease Control,Flu shots", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control says the flu vaccine used this past year may make a rare curtain call next year.", "article.published": "2014-02-20T16:28:18-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/20/2013-2014-flu-vaccine-may-make-rare-curtain-call-next-season/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control says the flu vaccine used this past year may make a rare curtain call next year.", "title": "2013-2014 flu vaccine may make rare curtain call next season", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/20/2013-2014-flu-vaccine-may-make-rare-curtain-call-next-season/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BV051_flu_sh_MG_20140220153326.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2129", "article.updated": "2014-02-20T16:28:18-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9590\"", "article_summary": "The story says the flu vaccine used to inoculate people in the U.S. this past year may make a rare curtain call next season, according to officials from the Centers for Disease Control.\nJason McDonald, CDC spokesman, says the antibodies that came with this year\u2019s flu shot won\u2019t live long enough to ward off the virus next year.\n\u201cWe highly recommend that you do [get another shot],\u201d McDonald said.\nIf you\u2019re wondering how the vaccine performed, the Post says it was 74% effective at avoiding flu severe enough to warrant medical treatment.\nBut it wasn\u2019t good enough to avoid having to get a shot again next year, CDC officials say."}
