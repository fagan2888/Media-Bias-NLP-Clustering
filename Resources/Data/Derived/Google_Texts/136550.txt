DUNBLANE, Scotland (AP) â€” Andy Murray has married long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in the tennis star's home town.

The couple, both 27, said their vows in front of family and friends during a ceremony at Dunblane Cathedral in Scotand.

On a day of showers and hailstorms, the rain held off as the couple exited the 300-seat cathedral to cheers from the large crowd gathered outside to wish them well.

Britain's No. 1 player wore a blue and green kilt. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Cromlix House, the luxury hotel owned by Murray near Dunblane.

There was a somber note to the wedding as press photographer Gordon Jack died Saturday after being taken to a hospital following a fall on Friday as media captured Murray arriving for the rehearsal.
