Conservative columnist George Will says the liberals throw the words "racist" and "racism" around so much it has become a joke among young people."Liberalism has a kind of Tourette's syndrome these days," Will said on "Fox News Sunday." "It’s just constantly saying the word racism and racist."On college campuses one person will say it looks like it is going to rain and another will respond, "You're a racist," Will said. "The constant implication of this is that I think it is becoming a national mirth."Will was responding to a question from viewer Michael Daigeaun who asked "Why is it that if you oppose their position and you’re white, you’re branded a racist? Both Attorney General [Eric] Holder and POTUS [President of the United States] race bait.""If you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. If you have neither, pound the table. This is pounding the table," Will said. "There’s a kind of intellectual poverty now. Liberalism hasn't had a new idea since the 1960s except Obamacare and the country doesn't like it… So what do you do? You say anyone criticizes us is a racist."
