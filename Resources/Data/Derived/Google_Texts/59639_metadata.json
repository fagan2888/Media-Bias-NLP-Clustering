And if the law is in constant flux \u2026 there is no law.\u201d\n\nWill tried to put recent events in a historical perspective.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on is the fulfillment of a progressive dream now 100 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cOne-hundred years ago, we were in the first year of the first progressive Democratic president, Woodrow Wilson. \u2026 He said the very separation of powers is inappropriate for the modern age, because for America to be governed, it needs to have more power concentrated in Washington, more and more Washington power concentrated in the executive branch, and more and more executive branch power concentrated in executive agencies immunized from control or even supervision and oversight by Congress.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmarginalization of Congress\u201d has thus been a constant goal of progressives, Will continued.\n\n\u201cThis is why conservatism, modern conservatism, was really born in reaction to a strong executive in Franklin Roosevelt during the New Deal and a strong executive of Lyndon Johnson during the Great Society.\u201d\n\nThe success of Ronald Reagan helped conservatives shed some of their distrust in a strong executive branch, Will said, but he suggested that recent events could change that.\n\n\u201cAt that point they began to lose some of their suspicion of executive power, which I hope they are now reacquiring,\u201d Will said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:27:49 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Recent maneuvers on health care and the filibuster
