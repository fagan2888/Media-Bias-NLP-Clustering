Once I was old enough to know that my mother was Indian and my father wasn\u2019t, I began responding \u201cHalf.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until my teenage years that I would ask my mother for the details of my ethnic breakdown. She pulled an index card out of her desk drawer. I knew that I was Cowlitz, Polish, Irish, and Ukrainian, but the card was full of surprising facts as well. What did it mean to be Welch? French?\n\nThe truly shocking information the card carried was my Indian blood quantum. I didn\u2019t know that was the term for the sum of the fractions next to Cowlitz and Cascade. This was the \u201cHow much?\u201d people had prodded me about, and it wasn\u2019t the half I\u2019d assumed. \u201cWhat are you, a quarter?\u201d people would toss out at times. It wasn\u2019t that. The sum of the Cascade and Cowlitz fractions made an awkward hybrid. I decided it would be nobody\u2019s business.\n\nI grew up in the time of Native American proverb posters and mass-produced dream catchers. Disney\u2019s \u201cPocahontas\u201d was released in 1995, when I was ten. I had outgrown my Barbies then, but I still added a Pocahontas doll to my retired collection. I knew that she was a fullblood. She communicated with animals and never wore a jacket. She painted with all the colors of the wind. If someone had asked me to explain the difference between my plastic doll and me, I might have said that she was the real Indian and I was the fake one.\n\nIn the nineties, Americans loved a certain kind of Indian. \u201cDances With Wolves\u201d (1990), a box office triumph after a flub-filled filming process, is a fictional account of Lieutenant John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) and his process of \u201cgoing Indian\u201d after befriending a band of Lakota neighbors. While the film succeeds in rendering the Lakota characters as fully-developed people with motivations, concerns, humor, and the individual personality variations often afforded only non-Indian characters, at the end the filmmakers made their fictionalized Native band vanish. Viewers are informed via epilogue:\n\n\u201cThirteen years later, their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone, the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone and the American frontier was soon to pass into history.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood Indian certainly hadn\u2019t disappeared. Following the success of Dances with Wolves, the Western came back into style, with depictions of Indians from earlier eras projected onto screens worldwide. \u201cBlack Robe\u201d (1992), The Last of the Mohicans (1992), \u201cGeronimo: An American Legend\u201d (1994), \u201cSquanto: A Warrior\u2019s Tale\u201d (1994), and other films depicted confrontations between indigenous communities and colonizers. Although progress had been made since the time of John Ford westerns, with Native characters played by Native actors and increased attention paid to character development rather than poorly-sketched \u201csavages,\u201d still, these films relegated Native peoples to the past.\n\n\u201cThunderheart\u201d (1992) glances back only two decades into American Indian history for its fictionalization of the 1973 Wounded Knee occupation on Pine Ridge Reservation.Questions of blood quantum and Lakota identity arise for Ray Levoi (Val Kilmer), a white-identifying FBI agent who is assigned to the reservation because of his Lakota ancestry. Levoi\u2019s blood quantum is of great concern to him and to those around him: we learn immediately that Levoi\u2019s Lakota blood quantum is one-eighth, and a blood chasm forms between him and tribal cop Walter Crow Horse (Graham Green), who is full-blooded Lakota and was born and raised on the reservation. Blood quantum functions as shorthand for potency of identity. By the end, Levoi is seeing visions, some ancestral memory having been shaken from his bones. In Hollywood, 119 minutes is ample time to turn a character from community outsider to medicine man, because \u201crealness\u201d is nothing more than imagery and romance.\n\nNo film of the nineties does this more explicitly than \u201cThe Last of the Mohicans\u201d (1992), the most recent of a series of adaptations of James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s 1826 novel and a robust performer at the box office. At the end of the director\u2019s cut of the film, Chingachgook (Russell Means), his adopted son Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis), and Hawkeye\u2019s romantic partner Cora look out over a great expanse of virgin land:\n\nChingachgook: The frontier moves with the sun and pushes the red man of these wilderness forests in front of it until one day there will be nowhere left. Then our race will be no more, or be not us.\n\nHawkeye: That is my father\u2019s sadness talking.\n\nChingachgook: No, it is true. The frontier place is for people like my white son and his woman and their children. And one day there will be no more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. Like the Mohicans. A new people will come. Work. Struggle. Some will make their life. But once, we were here.\n\nAlthough the dying out of Native populations might make for the tidy completion of narratives, and the idea of a vanishing race has developed an unsavory romantic appeal, the truth is that colonization didn\u2019t wipe out North America\u2019s indigenous peoples. The 2010 Census reported that 5.2 million people identified as American Indian. Currently, there are 566 federally recognized tribes. Images have emerged from Hollywood that reinforce stereotypes of Native peoples as suspended in time, but tribal cultural practices continue to develop in a natural correspondence with the passage of time.\n\nMany of these tribes have come to use blood quantum, the degree of Indian ancestry expressed fractionally, as a consideration when defining their membership. Contemporary determinations of blood quantum often look back to base rolls, records of tribal membership, often created by non-Indians. Determinations of blood quantum are made by establishing proximity to the ancestors listed on these rolls. The Dawes Rolls are the best-known base rolls, listing people accepted by the Dawes Commission between 1898 and 1914 as members of the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole Tribes. For my tribe and others in the region, the Roblin Rolls form a base roll.Similar to the Dawes Rolls, these listings of families were created in 1919 by Indian agent Charles Roblin to record names of Indians in Western Washington. Base rolls can be wrought with problems: commissioners denied some families\u2019 enrollment, while other families resisted giving their names to the government. Some registrants died before their names could appear. The records are handwritten, aged, and littered with inaccuracies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "White-skinned and New Jersey-born, I grew up with the question \"How Indian are you?\" It's one I refuse to answer", "title": "I am not Pocahontas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "White-skinned and New Jersey-born, I grew up with the question \"How Indian are you?\" It's one I refuse to answer", "title": "I am not Pocahontas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/i_am_not_pocahontas_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/pocahontas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "White-skinned and New Jersey-born, I grew up with the question \"How Indian are you?\" It's one I refuse to answer", "title": "I am not Pocahontas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/pocahontas.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elissa Washuta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American identity, dances with wolves, ethnic heritage, Identity, indian, Native American, Pocahontas, The Weeklings", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20e6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: American identity, dances with wolves, ethnic heritage, Identity, indian, Native American, Pocahontas, The Weeklings, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on The WeeklingsAS A COWLITZ Indian child, white-skinned and New Jersey-born, I grew up fielding the question, \u201cHow much Indian are you?\u201d without any sense of its meaning.\nI had outgrown my Barbies then, but I still added a Pocahontas doll to my retired collection.\nDisney\u2019s \u201cPocahontas\u201d was released in 1995, when I was ten.\nThe truly shocking information the card carried was my Indian blood quantum.\nI grew up in the time of Native American proverb posters and mass-produced dream catchers."}
