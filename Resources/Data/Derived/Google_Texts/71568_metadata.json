Other than the 2010 buddy comedy \u201cDue Date,\u201d the legal family drama marks Downey\u2019s first movie in five years that doesn\u2019t star the 49-year-old actor as either Iron Man or Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn the film, conceived of and directed by \u201cWedding Crashers\u201d filmmaker David Dobkin, Downey plays a Chicago lawyer who returns to his small Indiana hometown to attend his mother\u2019s funeral. While there, Downey\u2019s stubborn motor-mouth becomes enmeshed in a criminal case involving his more stubborn father, the town\u2019s judge, portrayed by Robert Duvall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done lawyers before and it\u2019s like, \u2018Dude, really? Courtrooms? So boring,'\u201d Downey recently acknowledged over a cup of coffee. \u201cThe idea David (Dobkin) had was that a lawyer would be able to get his father \u2014 when he\u2019s sworn in \u2014 to tell the truth. How could you not take advantage of that, with his life on the line and all the stuff that\u2019s happened between them?\u201d\n\nAfter saving the world as Tony Stark in four Marvel films, Downey said he wasn\u2019t necessarily looking to make the 180-degree turn that he does in \u201cThe Judge,\u201d out next Friday. (Besides, Iron Man will be back in next year\u2019s \u201cAvengers\u201d installment.) Downey and Susan, a longtime producer he first met on the set of the 2003 thriller \u201cGothika,\u201d were merely drawn to the story.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re a good partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cShe works really closely with the director, as do I, obviously. She\u2019s really smart, pretty and calm \u2014 for the most part. That\u2019s just a winning combination. I\u2019ve seen this before with directors who have partners that produce. You just see this symbiosis between them, and you go, \u2018Oh, I get why they do this together.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018The Judge\u2019 a family affair for Robert Downey Jr.", "author": "Derrik J.
