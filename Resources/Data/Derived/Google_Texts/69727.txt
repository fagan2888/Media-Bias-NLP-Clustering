Two stars from the Seattle Seahawks took time away from the field to cut an ad shilling for Obamacare.

The ad, posted Friday, features Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and rhetorically explosive cornerback Richard Sherman touting the benefits of President Obama’s healthcare law and its web portal Healthcare.gov.

Wilson urges viewers to “make the right call” and sign up while Sherman adds, “when your health or the game is on the line, nothing is more important than quality coverage.

Not mentioned are the very real costs Obamacare foists on millions of Americans:

- The millions of insurance cancelations.

- The numerous known falsehoods repeated to the American people.

- The tax increases.

- The “crippling cost” to the middle class.

- The disproportionate cost on young Americans.
