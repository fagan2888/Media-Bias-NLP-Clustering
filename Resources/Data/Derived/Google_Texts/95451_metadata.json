They can begin submitting health plans Tuesday for inclusion in the 2015 Illinois marketplace. They have until June 10 to do so.\n\nUnited executives said in an April conference call with investors that the insurer was evaluating other markets with the intent to expand its relatively modest footprint.\n\n\"At this stage, our bias is to increase our participation\" next year, said Gail Boudreaux, chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, United's primary health insurance subsidiary.\n\nNationwide, UnitedHealth offered exchange-based products in the individual or small-business markets in 10 states and Washington, D.C., this year. It did not offer individual policies on the exchanges in any of the 34 states where the federal government operated the marketplaces, including Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "noweb, business", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "After sitting out the first year, UnitedHealth Group Inc. intends to offer individual policies on the Illinois health insurance exchange next year, according to sources familiar with the company's...", "title": "Sources: UnitedHealth to enter Illinois exchange", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-05-23/business/ct-united-health-aca-0523-biz-20140523_1_illinois-health-insurance-exchange-illinois-market-individual-policies", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5530052e/turbine/chi-default-open-graph-ct-logo/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818}, "description": "After sitting out the first year, UnitedHealth Group Inc. intends to offer individual policies on the Illinois health insurance exchange next year, according to sources familiar with the company's", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fc5\"", "article_summary": "Sources: UnitedHealth to enter Illinois health exchangeState's No.\nAfter sitting out the first year, UnitedHealth Group Inc. intends to offer individual policies on the Illinois health insurance exchange next year, according to sources familiar with the company's plans.\nThey can begin submitting health plans Tuesday for inclusion in the 2015 Illinois marketplace.\nFive insurers offered plans on the Illinois health insurance marketplace in the first year, including Blue Cross, Humana, Aetna, Health Alliance and the startup Land of Lincoln Health.\n2 insurer, has the potential to shake up the Illinois market, which was dominated in 2014 by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, the state's dominant insurer."}
