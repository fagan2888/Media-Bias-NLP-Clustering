Many of the bird questions I had \u2014 and they were numerous \u2014 were answered by Kathy Heidel. She was a naturalist on staff there from 1968 through 2003. Kathy died May 17.\n\nThere must be thousands of people like me who had their questions answered by Kathy. She took your interest in all things wild and natural and sharpened it, in my case to a continuing passion for birds. One day in early spring I hurried to the nature center from a park lake to tell Kathy about the unusual loon I had just seen, a new bird for me. I described it, and she said, gently, with a smile, yes, the Common Merganser.\n\nMemorial donations are welcomed by Kathy\u2019s family and Three Rivers Parks. They can be sent to: Kathy Heidel Memorial Fund-LNC, Three Rivers Park District, 3000 Xenium Lane N., Plymouth MN 55441. They will be used to continue support of Kathy\u2019s efforts to educate people about the wonders and preservation of our natural resources.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Many years ago, when we were living west of Excelsior and my interest in birding was turning seriously serious, I spent much of my birding time at Carver Park Reserve.", "title": "Kathy Heidel, longtime naturalist at Carver Park", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/kathy-heidel-longtime-naturalist-at-carver-park/263037841/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/jjwilliams_1402673717_KathyHeidel.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/jjwilliams_1402673717_KathyHeidel.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Many years ago, when we were living west of Excelsior and my interest in birding was turning seriously serious, I spent much of my birding time at Carver Park Reserve.", "title": "Kathy Heidel, longtime naturalist at Carver Park", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/kathy-heidel-longtime-naturalist-at-carver-park/263037841/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/jjwilliams_1402673717_KathyHeidel.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/jjwilliams_1402673717_KathyHeidel.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Many years ago, when we were living west of Excelsior and my interest in birding was turning seriously serious, I spent much of my birding time at Carver Park Reserve."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e06\"", "article_summary": "They can be sent to: Kathy Heidel Memorial Fund-LNC, Three Rivers Park District, 3000 Xenium Lane N., Plymouth MN 55441.\nMany of the bird questions I had \u2014 and they were numerous \u2014 were answered by Kathy Heidel.\nMany years ago, when we were living west of Excelsior and my interest in birding was turning seriously serious, I spent much of my birding time at Carver Park Reserve.\nThere must be thousands of people like me who had their questions answered by Kathy.\nThey will be used to continue support of Kathy\u2019s efforts to educate people about the wonders and preservation of our natural resources."}
