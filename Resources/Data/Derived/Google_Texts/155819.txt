U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess has proven throughout his congressional tenure that he values constructive problem-solving over clamoring against the opposition.

Take one of the most complicated issues that has bedeviled policymakers for decades: the quality and cost of health care. Burgess opposes the Affordable Care Act, but he has not wasted time with empty complaints. Instead, he has employed his own valuable perspective as a physician to improve the system wherever possible.

Burgess, 65, is a reliable conservative on a wide variety of issues, one whose voice is informed and respected on both sides of the aisle.

For example, he is responsible for last year getting rid of the Sustainable Growth Rate, a troublesome calculation used to pay physicians for treating Medicare patients, and replacing it with a better formula. He also played a key role in reauthorizing the children’s health care program to prevent it from expiring in states such as Texas.

In contrast, the knowledge and perspective that Burgess’ two opponents in the Republican primary for the 26th Congressional District offer is painfully lacking.

Neither small-business owner Joel Krause, 57, nor Realtor Micah Beebe, 31, displayed even a basic understanding of many critical issues, whether it be proposing realistic tax reform or prosecuting a war against ISIS. Nor has either apparently attracted the interest of supporters willing to donate to their campaigns.

Beebe acknowledged that he doesn’t even know Burgess’ positions on key aspects of health care reform — despite being certain that the congressman’s stance is wrong. Krause, who received less than 16 percent of the vote in his race against Burgess in 2014, vows to “keep running every two years” because he enjoys the process so much.

It’s difficult to fathom how such perspectives serve voters in the least.

The winner of this primary will face Democratic opposition in November.
