He said, \"Migraine doesn't cause Bell's Palsy, or vice-versa. It tells you that there is an association.\"\n\nResearchers at National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan studied more than 137,000 people. They were put into one of two groups: one with migraine and one without.\n\nThey found that people with migraine were twice as likely to develop Bell's Palsy even after researchers accounted for other factors.\n\nThe study's authors say more research is needed to determine the direct connection, but Dr. Tepper says if you have either of these conditions talk to your doctor. \"These associations alert the care provider to keep an eye open. So, somebody who has Bell's Palsy you keep an eye open for migraine, somebody with migraine you keep an eye open for Bell's Palsy,\" he said.\n\nComplete findings for the study titled \"Increased Risk of Bell's Palsy in Patients with Migraine\" can be found in the online issue of \"Neurology.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A new study has found migraine headaches may double the risk of Bell's Palsy, a nervous system condition that causes facial paralysis.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "A new study has found migraine headaches may double the risk of Bell's Palsy, a nervous system condition that causes facial paralysis.", "title": "New Study Finds Migraine Headaches Linked to Bell's Palsy", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/news/newschannel7today/headlines/New-Study-Finds-Migraine-Headaches-Linked-to-Bells-Palsy-286861121.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/8A1/0A5/8A10A537D675465F9A8FFBCA61CB0679", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D07/9D5/D079D57A817045389BE6C0E127F8D432.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "A new study has found migraine headaches may double the risk of Bell's Palsy, a nervous system condition that causes facial paralysis.", "title": "New Study Finds Migraine Headaches Linked to Bell's Palsy", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/news/newschannel7today/headlines/New-Study-Finds-Migraine-Headaches-Linked-to-Bells-Palsy-286861121.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Migraine2.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "New Study Finds Migraine Headaches Linked to Bell's Palsy", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "New Study Finds Migraine Headaches"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2542\"", "article_summary": "So, somebody who has Bell's Palsy you keep an eye open for migraine, somebody with migraine you keep an eye open for Bell's Palsy,\" he said.\nRelated LinksNeurology OnlineA new study has found migraine headaches may double the risk of Bell's Palsy, a nervous system condition that causes facial paralysis.\nComplete findings for the study titled \"Increased Risk of Bell's Palsy in Patients with Migraine\" can be found in the online issue of \"Neurology.\"\nThey found that people with migraine were twice as likely to develop Bell's Palsy even after researchers accounted for other factors.\nHe said, \"Migraine doesn't cause Bell's Palsy, or vice-versa."}
