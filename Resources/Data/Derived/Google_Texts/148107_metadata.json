It could also lead to additional costs to the state\u2019s general fund because under the federal Affordable Care Act, according to Katherine Pelletreau of the Maine Association of Health Plans, new coverage mandates must be subsidized by the state.\n\nUnder Mason\u2019s bill, insurance companies would be allowed to require co-payments of up to 50 percent for the treatments, which can run easily into the thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cOur members oppose LD 943 on the basis that it is a mandate that would increase costs for all ratepayers,\u201d said Pelletreau.\n\nMason said that approximately 10 to 15 percent of U.S. couples are infertile.\n\n\u201cOftentimes, a couple builds their future around a plan of having children and can be devastated when they are unable to conceive a child through natural methods,\u201d said Mason. \u201cFortunately, there are many safe and effective treatments for overcoming infertility.\u201d\n\nThe number of Mainers affected by infertility, however, and how much this concept would financially affect insurance companies, is not known because the last time the issue was studied was in 2003 by the Maine Bureau of Insurance. That prompted some to suggest that the bill be put on hold until a new study can be conducted.\n\n\u201cIf the committee is interested in pursuing this legislation, we suggest that it be sent to the Bureau of Insurance for a new mandated study,\u201d said Kristine Ossenfort, spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maine.\n\nThe bill will be the subject of a work session in the coming weeks.\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nA previous version of this report erroneously stated that Kate Brogan spoke on behalf of Planned Parenthood of Maine.
