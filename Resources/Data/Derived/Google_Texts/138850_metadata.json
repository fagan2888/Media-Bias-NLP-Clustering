In the past year, it added an obstetrician/gynecologist clinic in North Longview, plus psychiatric services to its locations on High Street and on East Marshall Avenue.\n\nAt its main location on East Marshall Avenue, Wellness Pointe added vision and optical care in 2015. It's the third federally qualified health center in the state to add optometry services, Jones said.\n\nBrown said more people have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, allowing them better access to services.\n\n\"While we do see a lot of patients that are Medicare/Medicaid related, we have seen our numbers grow in insured patients as well,\" Brown said.\n\nThe new physician positions are expected to boost Wellness Pointe's pediatric and OB/GYN departments, \"and we'll soon be adding in our family medicine,\" Brown said.\n\nDespite higher patient volumes, Brown said patient wait times have not increased substantially, as the health center strictly monitors its quality measures.\n\n\"We have not experienced (increased wait times), and we don't expect to experience additional wait times, which is why we're increasing staff,\" he said. \"We increased our total staff capacity by more than 15 percent last year.\"\n\nWellness Pointe operates five clinics with three in Longview, one in Gilmer, and one in Kilgore and serves as the federally qualified health center for Gregg, Upshur, and Wood counties.\n\nThe center offers services including obstetric/gynecologic, pediatric, family medicine, family dentistry, optometry/optical, behavioral health counseling, psychiatric services, substance abuse counseling and a wide range of social service programs.\n\nWellness Pointe accepts Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare and most private insurance. The center also offers a sliding-fee discount based on income and family size.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.news-journal.com/news/2016/mar/26/wellness-pointe-adds-docs-as-patients-surge/", "image": "https://static.texascommunitymedia.com/img/photos/2016/03/26/032316-WELLNESS_POI_1_2639428.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Leadership at Wellness Pointe health center in Longview says it's hiring more doctors to meet increased demand for its health care, spurred in part by ...", "title": "Wellness Pointe adds docs as patients surge - Longview News-Journal"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "blitz": "mu-10ba9b19-0c38fcd6-4c764ea6-9fa4649b", "fb": {"app_id": 1419380718274846}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.texascommunitymedia.com/static/lnj/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Between 2014 and 2015, patients using Wellness Pointe services increased almost 21 percent, and the health center reported a 31 percent increase in patient visits.\nEarlier this month, Wellness Pointe announced significant year-over-year growth in its annual report to the federal government.\nAt its main location on East Marshall Avenue, Wellness Pointe added vision and optical care in 2015.\nWellness Pointe accepts Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare and most private insurance.\nThose physicians' jobs will be added to Wellness Pointe clinics and practices, but more jobs might be expanded in the future to meet patient demands, he said."}
