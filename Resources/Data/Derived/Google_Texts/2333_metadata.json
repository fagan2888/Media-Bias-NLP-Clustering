(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) The Associated Press\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Wayne Simmonds had two power-play goals in the first period and the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second consecutive day, 4-3 on Sunday afternoon.\n\nSimmonds assisted on Brayden Schenn's goal 2:06 into the game and then scored twice in a 6:54 span to give the Flyers a three-goal lead 14 minutes in.\n\nSurging Philadelphia, which beat its cross-state rival 4-0 at home Saturday, improved to 5-1-1 in its past seven.\n\nDefensemen Brooks Orpik and Matt Niskanen and recent call-up Jayson Megna scored for the injury-depleted Penguins, who lost two straight in regulation for the first time since dropping three in a row from Nov. 6-13.\n\nDuring the final seconds, the Penguins' Sidney Crosby hit the post with a backhand off a pass from Evgeni Malkin while skating down the right wing.\n\nPittsburgh still holds a commanding lead in the Metropolitan Division, but remained three points behind the Boston Bruins in the race for the Eastern Conference's top seed.\n\nMatt Read had his third goal of the weekend for Philadelphia, which entered Sunday holding down the eighth and final spot in the conference standings. The Flyers are 8-1-1 in their past 10 regular-season games in Pittsburgh.\n\nMaking starts on consecutive days for only the second time this season, Marc-Andre Fleury made a lunging glove save on the first shot he faced Sunday, from Simmonds.\n\nBut he couldn't control the puck in his glove and it fluttered to Schenn in the slot, who slid it in past a diving Penguins defenseman Robert Bortuzzo for his 17th of the season.\n\nClaude Giroux assisted on Simmonds' 20th and 21st goals, the first of which was with 13:13 left in the first when he deflected a Kimmo Timonen shot from the point. Simmonds made it 3-0 when he corralled a rebound while uncovered and beat Fleury to end his afternoon after just 13:41.\n\nUnder siege by a Philadelphia attack that Pittsburgh had issues dealing with, Fleury allowed seven goals on 55 shots in less than four periods covering 24 hours against the Flyers.\n\nRookie Jeff Zatkoff replaced him.\n\nWithout their top two goal-scoring wingers \u2014 Chris Kunitz (lower body) and James Neal (concussion) \u2014 for the second consecutive game, the Penguins were held to fewer than four goals for the eighth consecutive game. That hadn't happened to them since early in the 2011-12 season.\n\nA pair of defensemen pulled Pittsburgh to within a goal with slap shots from the point that found their way through traffic and past Flyers goalie Steve Mason.\n\nOrpik was credited with his second of the season with 2:27 left in the first, and Niskanen tallied his 10th at 5:50 of the second.\n\nBut Read had a short-handed goal for the second straight day, finishing a 2-on-1 break himself with a wrist shot for his 19th of the season.\n\nMegna tapped in a nice pass from Brian Gibbons to cut the Penguins' deficit to 4-3 with 3:41 left in the second, but Pittsburgh failed to score on 11 third-period shots.\n\nPittsburgh has the NHL's No. 1 power play and No. 2 penalty kill but lost the special teams battle 5-0 over the weekend against the Flyers.\n\nNotes: Penguins D Simon Despres was a healthy scratch. ... Including playoffs, the Flyers are 10-2-1 all-time at Consol Energy Center (8-1-1 in the regular season). ... Giroux has five assists in the past three games. ... The Penguins fell to 18-2 in March home games over the past three seasons. They were 10-0 at home last March. ... Crosby, who had 74 points over his first 45 career games against Philadelphia, was scoreless in the home-and-home series.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "sports/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "Flyers beat Penguins for 2nd straight day", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Wayne Simmonds had two power-play goals in the first period and the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second consecutive day, 4-3 on Sunday afternoon.", "title": "Flyers sweep home-and-home series against rival Penguins with 4-3 victory", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2014/03/16/flyers-beat-penguins-for-2nd-straight-day", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/74/8fb3022b73b408908d1c8e07d1f27f/media:cb4484fbae674d189319262bb2ce3759FlyersPenguinsHockey.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Wayne Simmonds had two power-play goals in the first period and the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second consecutive day, 4-3 on Sunday afternoon.", "card": "summary", "title": "Flyers beat Penguins for 2nd straight day"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "March 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: Sports,Associated Press,Collections: Sports,Associated Press", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Wayne Simmonds had two power-play goals in the first period and the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second consecutive day, 4-3 on Sunday afternoon."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f9d\"", "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) The Associated PressPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Wayne Simmonds had two power-play goals in the first period and the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second consecutive day, 4-3 on Sunday afternoon.\nPhiladelphia Flyers' Wayne Simmonds (17) celebrates past Pittsburgh Penguins' Rob Scuderi (4) after scoring on goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, right, during the first period of an NHL hockey game on Sunday, March 16, 2014, in Pittsburgh.\nSurging Philadelphia, which beat its cross-state rival 4-0 at home Saturday, improved to 5-1-1 in its past seven.\nThe Flyers are 8-1-1 in their past 10 regular-season games in Pittsburgh.\nBut Read had a short-handed goal for the second straight day, finishing a 2-on-1 break himself with a wrist shot for his 19th of the season."}
