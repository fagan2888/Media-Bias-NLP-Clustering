Once that capacity is reached the penalty rises sharply when more drivers try to crowd in.\n\nWith a safe, flat path through the tunnel, many local residents will be induced to walk or bike to their destinations, leaving their cars at home.\n\nWhile some new traffic infrastructure can and should be provided, the underlying assumption seems to be that despite the physical constraints of the built environment and the surrounding topography, driving alone, at will, can continue forever. This is a pipe dream.\n\nEven Caltrans, founded some 120 years ago to develop highways, has concluded, after much study over the last 15 years, that multi-modal is now essential.\n\nSee Caltrans\u2019 \u201cStrategic Management Plan 2015-2020\u201d where, on page 11, the following goals are set for 2020: triple cycling, double walking, double transit use, and reduce vehicle miles traveled by 15 percent.\n\nWhen tunnel opponents find themselves stuck in traffic, I hope they will use that opportunity to consider Caltrans\u2019 changing philosophy, and to ponder the lesson of the J-curve.\n\n\u2014 Cindy Winter, Greenbrae\n\nDon\u2019t punish coach for helping students\n\nIt was with absolute disgust that I read Wednesday\u2019s headline story regarding the College of Marin men\u2019s basketball program and alleged \u201ctuition and housing assistance\u201d provided by former COM head coach David Granucci.\n\nIn a world where we are faced with unprecedented problems ranging from ISIS threats, political uncertainty, affordable health care and an ever-prevalent issue in the Bay Area of affordable housing options, I am dumbfounded by the actions of the Bay Valley Conference Commissioner Shirley Baskin.\n\nI find it appalling that David, his father and sister are being portrayed as criminals for their acts of helping others. Where did we lose perspective between what constitutes a generous act of lending a helping hand versus a crime? How is assistance with finding housing and books a punishable act?\n\nSince David took over the COM coaching position, he and his family and supporters made COM basketball relevant.\n\nDuring the holiday season the focus is on giving. I applaud David Granucci for exemplifying that giving spirit year-round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully, Ms. Baskin and the COM administrators can learn from his fabulous example.\n\n\u2014 Malia Lyle, San Anselmo\n\nTrails rules should put protection first\n\nI thank John Dakin for his Nov. 21 letter in which he speaks of peace and solitude on Marin\u2019s narrow trails, and their destruction in the presence of bicyclists on those same trails.\n\nOur culture of today allows us few places where we can experience peace in nature. Mount Tamalpais and Marin\u2019s open spaces provide us with that opportunity.\n\nWith the unceasing encroachment of materialism and technology into our lives, our souls need the mountains and hills in order to help us experience being at one with our essence and the earth.\n\nHowever, we continue to be in danger of losing this rare refuge. As we all know, there is a significant number of bicyclists who place their desires for speed and reckless daring on our narrow trails far above the health and safety of the rest of us.\n\nThere is a Buddhist saying: \u201cAll haste is a form of violence.\u201d Bicyclists riding on our narrow trails bring violent destruction of our peace through fear and confrontation. They also bring violent destruction of the bodies of hikers and horse riders.\n\nI truly hope these bicyclists soon learn to see the reality of what they are doing and surrender their misguided desires to the benefit of their better natures and the rest of us.\n\n\u2014 Larry Ball, San Rafael", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reopening Alto tunnel should improve trafficThe main reason to open the Alto Hill tunnel is to relieve gridlock on local roadways.A very small reduction in road use will improve traffic flow significantly.
