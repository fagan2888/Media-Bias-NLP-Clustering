Nearly every Democratic plan put before the legislature will be stymied until either the national Republican Party controls its right wing or Democrats return to unified government. Neither is likely to happen anytime soon. Even Democrats accept that Republicans will hold onto the House of Representatives in 2016 even if their presidential nominee loses in a landslide. The Senate could flip under the right circumstances, but the Democrats\u2019 path to hold onto it in 2018 looks even narrower than it did in 2014. Either way, divided government will be a reality for the foreseeable future.\n\nClinton is a proud moderate who has championed bipartisanship and centrism since her first presidential run. \u201cI think every piece of legislation, just about, that I ever introduced,\u201d she said proudly in January, \u201chad a Republican co-sponsor.\u201d Her spokesperson later clarified what she meant to say, which is that \u201cnearly every Republican senator\u201d she served with co-sponsored at least one of her bills. Regardless, the point is that she can cooperate with Republicans. But today, there are very few moderate Republicans left to partner with (which isn\u2019t always a bad thing: Third Way bipartisanship gave us the 1994 crime bill, the repeal of Glass-Steagall, and the Iraq War). Why would congressional Republicans be more likely to work with Clinton, whom many consider a criminal for her handling of the Benghazi attacks and for having a private email server? To them, she\u2019d simply be another Democratic extremist in the White House, no different from Sanders: In his third-place victory speech on Saturday night, Senator Ted Cruz referred to \u201cHillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or whatever socialist they decide to nominate.\u201d\n\nThe few areas where a Democratic president could make progress in Congress would involve libertarian allies in the Republican Party. Here, Sanders looks more the part of a change-maker, given his stances on reforming the criminal justice system, American drug policy, and government surveillance (although Sanders would have to do quite a bit of legwork to get Clinton-style Democrats on board with reining in the National Security Agency). Otherwise, a Democratic president will have to play nonstop defense to keep Republicans from further slashing Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, and although Sanders may not love those programs, he\u2019s made clear that he prefers them to the alternative.\n\nThe real power of a Democratic president, as Chait rightly notes, would lie in their use of executive power. But he\u2019s wrong about the implications of this for Clinton versus Sanders. \u201cThose areas in which a Democratic Executive branch has no power are those in which Sanders demands aggressive action,\u201d he writes, \u201cand the areas in which the Executive branch still has power now are precisely those in which Sanders has the least to say.\u201d Those areas, he says, are judicial nominations, executive authority, and foreign policy.\n\nOn this, Sanders deserves a bit more credit than Chait is willing to give him. Most liberals would agree that more progressive nominations in the judiciary are better, and Sanders would likely nominate staunch progressives, while Clinton could accept more moderate judges. Likewise, in using his executive authority, Sanders would push much farther to the left than the executive branch has been since, well, the Johnson or Roosevelt administrations. Both his judicial picks and the right use of executive power, in areas like racial justice and criminal justice reform, could radically transform the way those institutions currently operate.\n\nSanders obviously has less foreign policy experience by virtue of never having served as secretary of state, but as he\u2019s been apt to point out, he has historically exercised better judgment than Clinton, notably by voting against the Iraq War. In the Democratic debate in October, Clinton cited \u201cthe Iranians\u201d as some of her biggest enemies, and although she came out in favor of the nuclear deal, it\u2019s worth considering what our relationship with Iran would be today like if Clinton had won the presidency in 2008.\n\nA pluralist, centrist foreign policy, championed not only by neoconservatives like George W. Bush and John McCain but by Democrats like Hillary Clinton, led us into two wars in the last fifteen years\u2014one of which gave rise to the Islamic State. If the \u201cpragmatic\u201d option is more military action to resolve intractable conflicts, then here\u2019s hoping the next president avoids pragmatism altogether.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s realism is overrated.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s realism is overrated.", "title": "Bernie Is the Pragmatic Pick for True Liberals", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c1cd4396e803a00461b1ab1001a5582aa921528f.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/130445/bernie-pragmatic-pick-true-liberals", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c1cd4396e803a00461b1ab1001a5582aa921528f.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Bernie Is the Pragmatic Pick for True Liberals", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s realism is overrated.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/c1cd4396e803a00461b1ab1001a5582aa921528f.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bernie Is the Pragmatic Pick for True Liberals\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/130445/bernie-pragmatic-pick-true-liberals\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-24T15:46:47.000Z\",\"post_id\":130445,\"author\":\"Paul Blest\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Election 2016\",\"Hillary Clinton\",\"Bernie Sanders\",\"Democratic Primary 2016\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-02-24"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "The real power of a Democratic president, as Chait rightly notes, would lie in their use of executive power.\nIf the \u201cpragmatic\u201d option is more military action to resolve intractable conflicts, then here\u2019s hoping the next president avoids pragmatism altogether.\nBoth his judicial picks and the right use of executive power, in areas like racial justice and criminal justice reform, could radically transform the way those institutions currently operate.\nBut he\u2019s wrong about the implications of this for Clinton versus Sanders.\nMost liberals would agree that more progressive nominations in the judiciary are better, and Sanders would likely nominate staunch progressives, while Clinton could accept more moderate judges."}
