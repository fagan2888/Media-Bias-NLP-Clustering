The 10-year-old\u2019s music therapist, Rich Moats, sits on the bed across from her\u2014guitar in hand.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell Miracle has been suffering from severe migraines stemming from a brain hemorrhage. She\u2019s been in the hospital for three weeks and has tried all sorts of things to deal with her pain, including yoga and pet therapy.\n\n\u201cBut the one I like the most is music because it expresses my frustration dealing with my pain and it also distracts me from focusing on my pain. It\u2019s extraordinary because it\u2019s not my everyday life,\u201d said Miracle.\n\nMiracle\u2019s music therapist goes from room to room, providing her services to people of all ages at Florida Hospital. Everyone responds differently to music and Moats says that\u2019s why she keeps a close eye on how her patients are responding.\n\n\u201cAre they making eye contact? Is their heart rate going up or going down? Are they breathing heavier or are they breathing easier,\u201d she said.\n\nMoats said this is the clinical training that separates her from just anyone who can play guitar and has time to sing to patients. And it\u2019s exactly why Florida lawmakers are considering whether to require music therapists to be licensed.\n\nShe\u2019s in favor of the licensing by the Florida Department of Health because it emphasizes that training.\n\nThere are more than 250 music therapists in Florida that have national credentials from The Certification Board for Music Therapists. That designation requires at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in music therapy and at least 1,200 hours of clinical training. If Senate Bill 1310 passes, they\u2019d be required to go a step further and get a state license.\n\n\u201cIt protects the public by making sure that a music therapist has actually received proper training and that our profession is being regulated,\u201d said Music Therapist Michelle Pellito, a music therapist and co-chair of the task force that helped write the bill.\n\nA handful of other states already regulate music therapy. Georgia, North Dakota and Nevada already require music therapists to get a license. Rhode Island and Wisconsin require them to be registered. And Utah has a music therapy state certification program.\n\nBut the push to get states to regulate music therapy has not come without opposition. That\u2019s according to Kimberly Sena Moore who teaches music therapy at University of Miami. She said most of the concerns have come from other healing professionals who want to protect what they do.\n\n\u201cIn some other states we have heard from say occupational therapists or the speech language pathology organizations and one of their first concerns is can they still use music and that we have been addressing,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be a concern for Florida. There\u2019s disclaimer language in the bill that says other health care professionals can use music as long as they are working within their scope of practice. Still, if the bill passes, anyone who identifies themselves as a music therapist would need to have a license starting Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nCrystal Chavez is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
