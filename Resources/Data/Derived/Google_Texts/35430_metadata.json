Trump has no longstanding commitment to the Republican Party; does not even make a pretense of knowing anything about policy; breaks from party orthodoxy on issues like trade; mobilizes racial and ethnic resentment in a way that is too loud and overt for elite Republicans; and is thus unacceptable. But Ted Cruz\u2019s straightforwardly radical conservatism isn\u2019t acceptable either:\n\nIf the G.O.P. is going to survive as a decent and viable national party, it can\u2019t cling to the fading orthodoxy Cruz represents. But it can\u2019t shift to ugly Trumpian nationalism, either. It has to find a third alternative: limited but energetic use of government to expand mobility and widen openness and opportunity. That is what Kasich, Rubio, Paul Ryan, and others are stumbling toward.\n\nBrooks\u2019s narrative, however, founders on one problem: Substantively, there\u2019s not a dime\u2019s worth of difference between Cruz and alleged moderates like Kasich, Rubio, and Ryan. And none of them have policy agendas that are any more serious than Trump\u2019s. Let\u2019s consider what these \u201cmoderate\u201d alternatives stand for.\n\nJohn Kasich: The Ohio governor has taken the role of the moderate, sensible adult in the primaries. He has maintained an avuncular tone and refused to ape Trump\u2019s insult comedy routine (as the hapless Rubio did). He also broke from party orthodoxy as governor by accepting the Medicaid expansion offered by the Affordable Care Act. But there\u2019s absolutely nothing moderate about his policy agenda. He favors a massive upper-class tax cut that would slash the top marginal rate by more than ten points and completely eliminate the taxes on investment and inherited income. In addition to reducing federal revenues to redistribute wealth upward, he\u2019s calling for $100 billion in additional defense spending. Even if these policies were mostly funded by debt, they would still require major cuts to federal spending for important programs for the poor and middle class. But he also favors a balanced budget amendment, which means the necessary cuts would be absolutely savage.\n\nAnd before you give him too much credit for accepting the Medicaid expansion, like every major Republican candidate he favors repealing the Affordable Care Act and gestures at replacing it with a bunch of empty platitudes (\u201cpatient-centered care, choices, market competition, decentralized decision-making, higher quality, respect for individuals, and an end to Obamacare\u2019s big government interference\u201d). In practical terms, this mean repealing a program that has provided health insurance to 20 million people and replacing it with less than nothing. Kasich might be moderate in tone, but there\u2019s nothing moderate about him in substance.\n\nMarco Rubio: The erstwhile Great Establishment Hope was once a poster boy for the \u201creformicons,\u201d a small and apparently uninfluential group of conservative intellectuals who urged the Republican Party to move beyond its obsessive focus on cutting taxes for the rich and start providing some benefits for ordinary families. But his futile bid for the presidency involves diving into conservative orthodoxy headfirst. He\u2019s offering a massive tax cut\u2014costing $6.8 trillion over the next decade\u2014heavily titled towards the upper class. This, of course, is paired with a big increase in military spending. The effect of all this on actually necessary programs would be devastating. He\u2019s on board with the Republican agenda of \u201creplacing\u201d the ACA with some clich\u00e9s about \u201cpatient-centered\u201d care scrawled on the back of a cocktail napkin. He does, however, believe in \u201cenergetic\u201d government in at least one respect: He has argued that the Constitution requires abortion to be banned at any stage of the pregnancy, without exception.\n\nPaul Ryan: The reluctant speaker of the House is the pioneer of pairing a moderate, wonky-sounding tone with nutty, radical ideas. His budget plan\u2014upper-class tax cuts paid for by a combination of debt and cuts in spending for the poor, more defense spending, and replacing the Affordable Care act with tort reform and deregulation (in other words, worse than nothing)\u2014set the template that virtually all elite Republicans have followed.\n\nThe alternatives to Trump and Cruz that Brooks touts, in other words, fully reflect the Republican orthodoxy that turned Trump and Cruz into frontrunners. Like Cruz, they\u2019re all committed to radical and unpopular fiscal plans that, in a time of increasing inequality and economic insecurity, would gut cherished programs for the poor and the middle class to pay for a huge redistribution of wealth to the top 10 percent. Like Trump, they\u2019re also completely unserious about policy, making ridiculous claims about the economic magic of tax cuts that have left the finances of states like Louisiana and Kansas in utter ruins. They are barely even pretending to offer an alternative to the 20 million people they want to deprive of health insurance. (Trump\u2019s health care \u201cplan\u201d is essentially cut-and-pasted from the non-plans of his allegedly more serious rivals.) And for good measure, they\u2019re all climate-change deniers.\n\nWhatever relationship they have to their party elites, Cruz and Trump are perfect symbols of what the Republican Party has become, however much Brooks and the establishment might prefer to pretend otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Lost in the fiasco surrounding Donald Trump is that the so-called moderate Republican candidates are almost as bad.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Lost in the fiasco surrounding Donald Trump is that the so-called moderate Republican candidates are almost as bad.", "title": "David Brooks and the Depths of the GOP\u2019s Delusions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e340a4329512b728c54579242af7beb73e6c7147.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/131326/david-brooks-depths-gops-delusions", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lost in the fiasco surrounding Donald Trump is that the so-called moderate Republican candidates are almost as bad.", "title": "David Brooks and the Depths of the GOP\u2019s Delusions", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e340a4329512b728c54579242af7beb73e6c7147.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@LemieuxLGM", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/e340a4329512b728c54579242af7beb73e6c7147.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"David Brooks and the Depths of the GOP\u2019s Delusions\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/131326/david-brooks-depths-gops-delusions\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-10T11:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":131326,\"author\":\"Scott Lemieux\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Election 2016\",\"Republican Primary 2016\",\"Donald Trump\",\"Ted Cruz\",\"Marco Rubio\",\"John Kasich\",\"Paul Ryan\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-03-10"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "The alternatives to Trump and Cruz that Brooks touts, in other words, fully reflect the Republican orthodoxy that turned Trump and Cruz into frontrunners.\nis going to survive as a decent and viable national party, it can\u2019t cling to the fading orthodoxy Cruz represents.\nHe also broke from party orthodoxy as governor by accepting the Medicaid expansion offered by the Affordable Care Act.\nWhatever relationship they have to their party elites, Cruz and Trump are perfect symbols of what the Republican Party has become, however much Brooks and the establishment might prefer to pretend otherwise.\nBrooks has a story about the fight over the Republican presidential nomination that has become a common one."}
