Eating and drinking expenses are among the big ones \u2014 buying a 5-gallon jar of pickles at the warehouse club to save money doesn\u2019t seem like such a good idea when you\u2019re buying for one.\n\nA \u201csingles penalty\u201d for buying small amounts is especially apparent with food, but strategies specific to singletons can help.\n\nRecent government statistics show that single Americans make up more than half of the adult population for the first time \u2014 at least since the government began collecting such statistics in 1976.\n\nAnd a record 20 percent of adult Americans 25 or older, or 42 million people, have never married, according to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center.\n\nOf course being single can take different forms \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re becoming a nation of Seinfeld characters. Single includes young people living alone, single parents, unmarried people living with partners or roommates, and widows and widowers.\n\nBesides the obvious difference of potentially having one fewer income-producer, singles have a variety of money issues that differ from marrieds. For example, unless they have someone depending on their income, they might not need life insurance. Disability insurance might be crucial.\n\nBut among singles who have to financially fend only for themselves, food spending can be a sticking point.\n\nIt\u2019s no small expense. Single people who lived alone last year on average spent $3,654 on food, more than 40 percent of which was dining out, according to the federal government\u2019s Consumer Expenditure Survey. By contrast, a family of four spent about $2,400 per person.\n\nIf you\u2019re single and find you\u2019re spending too much on food and dining out, here\u2019s what to look at.\n\nCook. Eating out almost always costs more than cooking at home \u2014 unless you\u2019re OK with fast-food dollar menus. So, the obvious advice is to dine out on special occasions and when you really want to, not because you\u2019re a poor meal planner. Ditto for beverages, including morning coffee and evening alcohol.\n\nTake stock. The main strategy for food buying is the same for singles as it is for families: Don\u2019t shop for what you need. Instead, shop for what\u2019s on sale and stock up. In other words, buy multiples when it\u2019s cheap \u2014 think half-price \u2014 and few or none when it\u2019s full price. The difference for singles is the extent to which they can do that. Bulk-buying perishables is a bad idea, and some singles\u2019 small apartments might not lend themselves to stockpiling jars, cans and boxes of food.\n\nBulk buying. \u201cI don\u2019t think singles necessarily have to stop buying in bulk, but they certainly don\u2019t need to stock up the way families do,\u201d said Jill Cataldo, who teaches classes on supermarket couponing and founded SuperCouponing.com. \u201cI continue to teach quite a few singles in my coupon workshops, and I hear from them that they may buy one or two extra of something during a good sale vs. buying six boxes of cereal like a family might want to do.\u201d\n\nBuy larger sizes of nonperishable items that you know you will use, said Stephanie Nelson, founder of CouponMom.com. \u201cCompare the cost per ounce, and if the larger size of laundry detergent is half the unit cost of the small size, save by getting the larger size,\u201d she said.\n\nAndrea Woroch, a savings expert with a site at andreaworoch.com, suggests splitting a warehouse club membership with a friend or family member.\n\n\u201cThere are certain items that you can save money on and make it convenient to stock up on so you don\u2019t have to regularly replace them, like batteries, toilet paper and toiletries,\u201d she said.\n\nThe warning is to avoid buying too much perishable food in bulk that will just be thrown away, which greatly increases the unit cost of the food you actually ate.\n\n\u201cAs a single person, you may have more social commitments throughout the week or be willing to make last-minute plans to meet a friend for dinner,\u201d Woroch said. \u201cIf you plan a week of meals and buy perishable items ahead, you may wind up wasting expired food.\u201d\n\nThe freezer is your friend. For some perishables, you can divide and conquer. For example, $3 per pound is a fine price on ground beef, but you won\u2019t often find it in 1-pound packages. Go ahead and buy the 5-pound pack and divide into 1-pound portions and freeze them, Cataldo said.\n\nMore broadly and perhaps most important, use your freezer for batch cooking. \u201cWhen ingredients for favorite meals are on sale but you can\u2019t eat the recipe that serves 12, make it and divide into individual portions and freeze,\u201d Nelson suggested.\n\nThat serves a dual purpose. First, you can buy in larger quantities for a lower unit price.\n\nSecond, you have ready-made meals that are only microwave minutes away the next time you arrive home late and hungry, perhaps reducing the urge to order pricier takeout food.\n\n\u201cYou will be glad to have premade meals,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nIt also means you can vary your meals, rather than cooking a big batch and eating the same leftovers three nights in a row.\n\nCoupons still work. Couponing, via coupons in the newspaper, printed from online sources or stored electronically, can still work for single people. They are most effective when you apply a coupon to an item already on sale.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s easier to coupon as a single \u2014 you can get by with just one newspaper per week because stocking up doesn\u2019t equate to buying a whole bunch of stuff,\u201d said Cataldo, who often advocates that families buy multiple Sunday newspapers to take advantage of coupon deals.\n\nNelson suggested paying attention to high-value coupons for nonfood items, too.\n\n\u201cYou generally do not have to buy multiple quantities, and coupons for personal-care products can be $5 or more,\u201d she said.\n\nCommunal dining. If you\u2019re especially social with a tight group of friends, consider taking turns cooking.\n\n\u201cOne day a week, each of you cook for the entire group, with any leftovers divided among those attending,\u201d said Jeff Yeager, author of four books on frugal living, including How to Retire the Cheapskate Way.\n\n\u201cThat way, you can shop for and cook in larger quantities, but only for a single dinner each week.\u201d\n\nGregory Karp,\n\nChicago Tribune", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bulk buying is more suited to families than singletons, but there are other ways to cut costs on food.", "og": {"description": "Bulk buying is more suited to families than singletons, but there are other ways to cut costs on food.", "title": "Singles can save on groceries with strategic shopping tips", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141226-singles-can-save-on-groceries-with-strategic-shopping-tips.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141226-1227bus_perfifoodcosts_web.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/1227bus_perfifoodcosts_WEB.jpg", "height": 649}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-12-27T02:59:34Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-12-27T02:59:34Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Singles can save on groceries with strategic shopping tips\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141226-singles-can-save-on-groceries-with-strategic-shopping-tips.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141226-1227bus_perfifoodcosts_web.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/1227bus_perfifoodcosts_WEB.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2110786\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-27T02:59:34Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141226-1227bus_perfifoodcosts_web.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/1227bus_perfifoodcosts_WEB.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-12-27T02:59:34Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b28\"", "article_summary": "The main strategy for food buying is the same for singles as it is for families: Don\u2019t shop for what you need.\nIf you\u2019re single and find you\u2019re spending too much on food and dining out, here\u2019s what to look at.\nEating and drinking expenses are among the big ones \u2014 buying a 5-gallon jar of pickles at the warehouse club to save money doesn\u2019t seem like such a good idea when you\u2019re buying for one.\nA \u201csingles penalty\u201d for buying small amounts is especially apparent with food, but strategies specific to singletons can help.\nBesides the obvious difference of potentially having one fewer income-producer, singles have a variety of money issues that differ from marrieds."}
