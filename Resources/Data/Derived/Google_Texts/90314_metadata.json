She asked our claim representative for assistance in this area.\n\nAs a matter of policy, Farmers does not make any recommendations nor provides lists of recommended contractors to customers who have filed a claim. Customers always retain the right to select any contractor they wish to make the necessary repairs.\n\nDuring their conversation, the claim representative advised Ms. Flood that he was familiar with Concierge Contractors but that Ms. Flood should consult with friends, neighbors and to do her own research to secure a contractor to make the repairs to her home.\n\nSometime after their conversation, Ms. Flood advised Farmers that she had chosen Concierge Contractors to complete the repair work and had entered into a contract with them.\n\nWe have reached out to both Ms. Flood and representatives of Concierge Contractors to provide whatever assistance we can to get this matter resolved to everyone\u2019s satisfaction.\"\n\n\"I don't want him to victimize anyone else. I want people to know not to use his company,\" said Wilson.\n\nWe have tried numerous times to get in touch with Concierge Contractors.\n\nThe state Attorney General's office could not confirm an ongoing investigation with the company, but we're told the office has received a complaint.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Homeowners in Moore come forward with complaints against Concierge Contractors out of Michigan.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26087349/new-complaints-leveled-against-contractor-working-in-moore", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4282579_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Homeowners in Moore come forward with complaints against Concierge Contractors out of Michigan.", "title": "New Complaints Leveled Against Contractor Working In Moore"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4282579_G.jpg", "description": "Homeowners in Moore come forward with complaints against Concierge Contractors out of Michigan.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Complaints Leveled Against Contractor Working In Moore"}, "wnreadableurl": "new-complaints-leveled-against-contractor-working-in-moore", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/07/22", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "moore,tornado,contractor,woes,fraud,evan anderson,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS15", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "moore,tornado,contractor,woes,fraud,evan anderson,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0865\"", "article_summary": "Other homeowners with similar issues want Concierge Contractors owners Jim and Michelle Abramson stopped.\nHomeowners in Moore come forward with complaints against Concierge Contractors out of Michigan.\nWe have tried numerous times to get in touch with Concierge Contractors.\nFlood and representatives of Concierge Contractors to provide whatever assistance we can to get this matter resolved to everyone\u2019s satisfaction.\"\nThat's why she's suing the owners of Concierge Contractors out of Michigan."}
