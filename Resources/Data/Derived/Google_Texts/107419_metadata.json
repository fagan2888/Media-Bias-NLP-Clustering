Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, and Jeb Bush are calling for respect for the courts\u2019 decisions on this matter and/or respect and understanding for people on both sides of the issue.\n\nBut Ted Cruz and Bobby Jindal are suggesting continued resistance; both have talked about a Constitutional marriage amendment. Mike Huckabee has said states should not be bound by such a decision, and on Meet the Press yesterday, he seemed to stick by that position.\n\nI don\u2019t have any idea whether these anti-marriage-equality warriors are serious about their hints at keeping up the fight in the context of the coming GOP primaries or not. But the polling does point to an emerging divide among Republicans on this question that seems revelant to how all of this might unfold.\n\nA Washington Post poll last spring found that Republicans are all alone in opposing legal gay marriage, by 54-40. And they also don\u2019t believe the \u201cequal protection\u201d clause guarantees the legal right to marry by 54-38. Majorities of independents and moderates are in the Yes camp on both.\n\nThe religious breakdown is key. White evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly oppose gay marriage, by 66-28. By contrast, white non-evangelical Protestants support it by 62-27, and white Catholics support it by 70-26. Evangelicals, of course, are important in GOP primaries; indeed, Huckabee has explicitly warned that if the GOP embraces gay marriage, \u201cthey\u2019re going to lose a large part of their base because evangelicals will take a walk.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a Tea Party angle here. The Post poll found that Republicans and GOP-leaning independents who support the Tea Party oppose gay marriage by 54-38. By contrast, non-Tea Party Republicans and GOP-leaners support gay marriage by 57-36. Tea Party Republicans are often described as more libertarian-leaning on social issues than other segments of the GOP base (such as evangelicals), but a majority of them still opposes same-sex marriage.\n\nCandidates who are striving for (relative) moderation on gay marriage, such as Bush, Rubio, and Romney, are framing their position as rooted in conservative values: Respect for the rule of law and/or for those (even gays and lesbians) who want to enshrine lifetime commitments to one another. Will that assuage GOP primary voters? Perhaps, as Ross Douthat has suggested, continued resistance wouldn\u2019t gain any traction among Republican primary voters in any case, largely because even many religious conservatives think this cultural battle is already lost. But if opposition to marriage equality does indeed remain deep among evangelicals, it could prove a tempting exploitation target indeed for the likes of Cruz and Jindal.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\n* GOP CANDIDATES \u2014 JEB BUSH EXCEPTED \u2014 MARCH IN STEVE KING\u2019S PARADE: Jon Ward has a good overview of the Steve King event, which he aptly contrasts with Jeb Bush\u2019s latest comments on immigration, in which Bush suggested \u201ca path to legalized status for those who have come here and languished in the shadows\u201d:\n\n\u201cThere is no way they are going to be deported,\u201d Bush said. \u201cNo one is suggesting an organized effort to do that. The cost would be extraordinary. We need to find a way where they pay fines, they learn English, they work, and they get in the back of the line. But they come out of the shadows so that they can be full partners in this strategy of high economic growth.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s basically a call for legalization. It\u2019s unclear whether Bush envisions that precluding citizenship, but this nonetheless shows that Bush\u2019s presence in the race will constitute a challenge to Republicans as to whether they are willing to accept legalization in any form. Good luck with this one, Jeb!\n\n* THE DEEPER MEANING OF IMMIGRATION FIGHT: E.J. Dionne identifies the deeper argument that\u2019s at the heart of our national debate over immigration, which also helps explain why Republicans are struggling so much with the issue:\n\nThis is the new culture war. It is about national identity rather than religion and \u201ctranscendent authority.\u201d It focuses on which groups the United States will formally admit to residence and citizenship. It asks the same question as the old culture war: \u201cWho are we?\u201d\u2026The new question is about how we define ourselves ethnically, racially and linguistically.\n\nWith Hillary Clinton embracing Obama\u2019s executive deportation relief, even as the GOP moves ever more towards a maximum deportations stance, hopefully the larger questions at the heart of our policy dilemma over the undocumented will get a full airing out in the 2016 race.\n\n* BILL CLINTON SEES JEB BUSH AS THREAT: Politico reports on the thinking inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s evolving presidential campaign. This is the most interesting nugget:\n\nBill Clinton is already deeply engaged in the campaign, warning that Jeb Bush is a real threat, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is probably just a sideshow.\n\nOf course, he\u2019s got to get through the primaries first, what with his suggestions that the plight of the undocumented should be viewed as morally complex and that we should respect gay people who want to marry one another.\n\n* GOP CANDIDATES AT ODDS OVER IRAN: ABC News reports on a separate candidate forum that took place over the weekend, at which Cruz and Rubio talked mighty tough about how negotiating with Iran is complete folly. But Rand Paul dissented:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying you want 535 negotiators, not the president,\u201d said Paul, R-Kentucky. \u201cDiplomacy is better than war, and we should give diplomacy a chance.\u201d\u2026Paul suggested that his colleagues would put the United States on a path to war. \u201cMany times in our fear and anger and distrust and we want to \u2013 you know, what are we going to do?\u201d said Paul. \u201cAre you ready to send ground troops into Iran? Are you ready to bomb \u2018em? Are you ready to send 100,000 troops?\u201d\n\nAnd Paul\u2019s chances in the GOP primaries have now gone \u201cpoof.\u201d\n\n* SCOTUS DECISION COULD \u2018CRIPPLE\u2019 OBAMACARE: National Journal has a good overview of what could happen if the Supreme Court guts subsidies in three dozen states on the federal exchange: Congress is unlikely to do anything, and there is little the White House can do to make it more likely that GOP state lawmakers set up their own exchanges to keep subsidies flowing. The question is whether the consequences \u2014 millions losing health coverage; widespread disruptions in insurance markets \u2014 will weigh on the Justices.\n\n* BUT REPUBLICANS VOW A \u2018FIX.\u2019 NO, REALLY! SERIOUSLY!!!! GOP Senate leader John Barrasso tells Philip Klein in an interview that if SCOTUS does gut subsidies, Republicans will have a \u201cfix\u201d ready to go to help the millions who might lose coverage:\n\n\u201cWe are working on a transition plan from what the President\u2019s health care law is now, that does provide for those people who are getting subsidies and would possibly be abruptly cut off, as we transition to a more market-based health care plan,\u201d he said.\n\nSome conservatives, such as Klein, genuinely want Republicans to respond with their own alternative if SCOTUS does rule with the challengers. But maybe, just maybe, Congressional Republicans are floating the idea that they\u2019ll have a \u201cfix\u201d ready to go to make the consequences of such a ruling appear less dire.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz and Bobby Jindal hint at continued resistance in the GOP presidential primaries.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Ted Cruz and Bobby Jindal hint at continued resistance in the GOP presidential primaries.", "title": "Morning Plum: The last stand of the anti-gay marriage warriors?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/01/26/morning-plum-the-last-stand-of-the-anti-gay-marriage-warriors/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/07/South_Carolina_2016_image_982w.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/01/26/morning-plum-the-last-stand-of-the-anti-gay-marriage-warriors/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "gay marriage, 2016 gop presidential primary, supreme court gay marriage, marriage equality, ted cruz, bobby jindal, obamacare, affordable care act, repeal obamacare, amnesty, immigration reform", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "gay marriage, 2016 gop presidential primary, supreme court gay marriage, marriage equality, ted cruz, bobby jindal, obamacare, affordable care act, repeal obamacare, amnesty, immigration reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e28\"", "article_summary": "A Washington Post poll last spring found that Republicans are all alone in opposing legal gay marriage, by 54-40.\nThe Post poll found that Republicans and GOP-leaning independents who support the Tea Party oppose gay marriage by 54-38.\n* BILL CLINTON SEES JEB BUSH AS THREAT: Politico reports on the thinking inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s evolving presidential campaign.\nBy contrast, non-Tea Party Republicans and GOP-leaners support gay marriage by 57-36.\nWhite evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly oppose gay marriage, by 66-28."}
