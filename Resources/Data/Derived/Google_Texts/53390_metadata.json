Duchene also assisted on the first goal of the game.\n\nAvs goaltender Semyon Varlamov stopped both shots as Colorado won its fifth consecutive shootout after losing its first two this season.\n\nDaniel Briere scored for the Avs in the second period, and Benoit Pouliot tied it early in the third. Varlamov couldn\u2019t handle Pouliot\u2019s second-effort chip shot outside the crease, and Edmonton\u2019s Ben Scrivens had no chance on Briere\u2019s weakside tap-in.\n\nVarlamov and Scrivens each finished with 27 saves, but Varlamov proved better in the shootout.\n\nDuchene was the player of the game for the Avalanche, but his goal-scoring drought in regulation and overtime increased to nine games. \u201cI\u2019m not too worried about it,\u201d he said of his scoring woes outside the shootout. \u201cOther than now, I thought I was scoring pretty consistently this season, and this happens. I went through it last year too. If we lose, I worry more about it.\u201d\n\nBriere\u2019s 306th career NHL regular-season goal was one of his easiest, thanks to Duchene. Duchene\u2019s threat for the side of the net drew two defensemen toward him and left Briere uncovered in front of the opposite post. Duchene\u2019s backhander set up Briere\u2019s back-door tap-in.\n\nThe Avs were in control through much of the first two periods, outshooting Edmonton 22-14 heading into the third. But the one-goal lead wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe Oilers tied it 4:47 into the third after Colorado took two consecutive penalties, the latter on Tanguay while he was on the penalty kill with Briere in the box for tripping. Pouliot scored with Tanguay off for hooking.\n\n\u201cI thought we could have been up by two or three goals after the second period. We had plenty of good chances and opportunities,\u201d said Avalanche coach Patrick Roy. \u201cI just feel that we\u2019re tight around the net.\n\n\u201cWe should be more relaxed, looser and taking a split second more to take a better shot. It\u2019s sad in some ways that we\u2019re not as confident as we should be at the net, and tonight it proved it.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs defeat Edmonton Oilers in a shootout", "title": "Avs defeat Edmonton Oilers in a shootout", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/avs-defeat-edmonton-oilers-in-a-shootout/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__20150103_B1_SP03HKNAVSALONEp1.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__20150103_B1_SP03HKNAVSALONEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T21:58:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:57:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Colorado Avalanche vs. Edmonton OilersThe Avalanche defeated the Edmonton Oilers 2-1 in a shootout, with Matt Duchene and Alex Tanguay scoring the goals in the one-on-one matchup with Edmonton goaltender Ben Scrivens.\nAvs goaltender Semyon Varlamov stopped both shots as Colorado won its fifth consecutive shootout after losing its first two this season.\nThe Avs were in control through much of the first two periods, outshooting Edmonton 22-14 heading into the third.\nVarlamov and Scrivens each finished with 27 saves, but Varlamov proved better in the shootout.\nDaniel Briere scored for the Avs in the second period, and Benoit Pouliot tied it early in the third."}
