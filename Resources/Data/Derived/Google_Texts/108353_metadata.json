On his show Monday, Rush mocked the entire idea, saying caustically, \u201cSeduction used to be an art. Now, of course, it\u2019s \u2018brutish\u2019 and it\u2019s \u2018predatory.'\u201d\n\nLimbaugh then drew outrage by adding,\n\n\u201cHow many guys, in your own experience, have learned that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018yes\u2019 if you know how to spot it?\u201d\n\nThere have been some critics of the new policy, particularly in regards top the definition of \u201cconsent,\u201d but no one but Rush Limbaugh has gone so far as to say that \u201cno means yes.\u201d\n\nIn response to Limbaugh\u2019s inflammatory \u201cno means yes\u201d remark, top Democrat and Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Israel called for Limbaugh\u2019s removal from radio, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s simply no excusing comments of this offensive nature, especially at a time where our country is having a long-overdue conversation about violence against women. Plain and simple \u2014 Rush Limbaugh is advocating for the tolerance of sexual assault and should be taken off the air immediately.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Limbaugh has been under fire for remarks viewed as anti-woman. In 2012, he referred to law student Sandra Fluke as a \u201cslut\u201d and a \u201cprostitute\u201d for advocating for the contraception mandate under the Affordable Care Act. Limbaugh also said once that feminism was created to give ugly women a place in society and referred to single mothers as \u201csemen receptacles.\u201d Statements such as those have caused Limbaugh to become the subject of petitions and boycotts groups, urging advertisers to withdraw from his show and urging Clear Channel to drop Limbaugh.\n\nIn addition to requiring affirmation between consenting partners, Ohio State\u2019s new policy also requires the university to review its handling of sexual harassment and violence reports, expand training for the campus community to help prevent further incidents, and take action to ensure that students and staff are aware of their rights under the anti-discrimination law known as Title IX. By doing this, Ohio State has been removed from a list of 79 colleges and universities that are under investigation for how sexual violence reports have been handled.\n\nAccording to the Ohio State University website, consent is defined as \u201cThe act of knowingly, actively and voluntarily agreeing explicitly to engage in sexual activity. Consent must be freely given and can be withdrawn at any time.\u201d\n\nThe website also states that the criteria listed below must be met, as well.\n\nSober\n\nNot coerced\n\nImaginative\n\nEnthusiastic\n\nCreative\n\nWanted\n\nInformed\n\nMutual\n\nHonest\n\nVerbal\n\nThe absence of \u201cno\u201d does not mean \u201cyes\u201d\n\nIt must be asked every step of the way\n\nIt cannot be implied or assumed, even in the context of a relationship\n\nIn addition, there are certain circumstances where consent cannot be legally given, even if the person verbally consents. For example, an intoxicated person cannot give consent legally.\n\nWhat do you think?
