They are trying to ease the opposition,\u201d said Bill Sweetnam, legislative and technical director with the Employers Council on Flexible Compensation in Washington.\n\nBut employer groups say the only change Congress should make is to repeal the tax.\n\n\u201cThe proposal makes only minor adjustments and falls far short of the mark. We need to be discussing repeal and repeal only,\u201d said Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe only way to fix this tax is to repeal it entirely,\u201d James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington, said in a statement.\n\nBenefit group executives say the chief flaw in the tax is the assumption that it will generate tens of billions of dollars in new federal revenues as employers cutting benefits to avoid the tax will, to offset those cuts, increase employees' taxable wages.\n\n\u201cIt is an incorrect assumption. I have not heard of a single employer that plans to do that,\u201d Ms. Guarisco Fildes said.\n\nPBGC woes\n\nAside from modifying the excise tax, the administration says it wants to hold the line on premiums employers pay the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., and shift to the agency's Board \u2014 comprised of the secretaries of Labor, Treasury and Commerce \u2014 the authority to set premium levels.\n\nCongress last year sharply raised PBGC single-employer premiums, but the administration says more hikes are not necessary.\n\n\u201cAdditional increases in single-employer premiums are unwise at this time and would unnecessarily create further disincentives to maintaining defined benefit pension plans,\u201d the administration said.\n\nHowever, the administration feels very differently about the agency's multiemployer insurance program, which is projected to run out of money by 2025, noting that the current $27 per participant premium for multiemployer plans is \u201cwell below what is needed to ensure PBGC's solvency.\u201d\n\nTo improve funding of the agency's multiemployer insurance program, the administration wants lawmakers to pass legislation that would levy \u2014 as is the case for single employers, a second so-called variable rate premium that would be based on plan underfunding.\n\nIn addition, an exit premium would be assessed on employers leaving underfunded multiemployer plans.\n\nThose changes are needed because \u201cthe multiemployer program is likely to run out of money by 2025. The proposal substantially reduces that risk in a way that encourages the preservation of plans and sound funding of pension promises,\u201d PBGC Director Tom Reeder said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "The Obama administration is backing changes to decrease the likelihood that employer plans will trigger the health care reform law's \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, but employer groups say they will continue to press Congress to repeal the tax.Under current law, a 40% excise tax will be imposed,...", "title": "Obama proposes Cadillac tax, PBGC premium changes - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20160210/NEWS03/160219982", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20160210/NEWS03/160219982/AR/0/president-obama-federal-budget.jpg", "type": "article"}, "title": "Obama proposes Cadillac tax, PBGC premium changes - Business Insurance", "description": "The Obama administration is backing changes to decrease the likelihood that employer plans will trigger the health care reform law's \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, but employer groups say they will continue to press Congress to repeal the tax.Under current law, a 40% excise tax will be imposed,...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png"}, "article_summary": "In addition, an exit premium would be assessed on employers leaving underfunded multiemployer plans.\nThe Obama administration is backing changes to decrease the likelihood that employer plans will trigger the health care reform law's \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, but employer groups say they will continue to press Congress to repeal the tax.\nWe need to be discussing repeal and repeal only,\u201d said Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington.\nBut employer groups say the only change Congress should make is to repeal the tax.\nCongress last year sharply raised PBGC single-employer premiums, but the administration says more hikes are not necessary."}
