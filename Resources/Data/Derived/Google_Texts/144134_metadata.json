She also attacked his record on education and his opposition to increasing the federal minimum wage.\n\nWhen Bush took the lectern, he declared, \u201cI believe in the right to rise in this country,\u201d writes the Times.\n\nBush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson were the only two GOP presidential candidates to attend the annual convention of the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights group. Well over a dozen other candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination declined the Urban League\u2019s invitation to appear, mostly citing scheduling conflicts, reports the Associated Press.\n\nTwo of Clinton\u2019s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also attended the event. The candidates are hoping to win African-American votes, which helped propel President Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012.\n\nRead more at the New York Times and Fox News.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/482514350-democratic-presidential-hopeful-and-former-secretary-of.jpg?w=50", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theRoot", "site_name": "The Root", "description": "Organizers said other Republican candidates were invited but declined, citing scheduling conflicts.", "title": "Jeb Bush and Ben Carson Only 2 of 16 GOP Candidates to Speak at Urban League Conference", "url": "http://www.theroot.com/articles/news/2015/08/jeb_bush_and_ben_carson_only_2_of_16_gop_candidates_to_speak_at_urban_league", "image": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/482514350-democratic-presidential-hopeful-and-former-secretary-of.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-01 10:11:00", "sailthru.title": "Jeb Bush and Ben Carson Only 2 of 16 GOP Candidates to Speak at Urban League Conference", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 110960888944481}, "sailthru.tags": "News", "sailthru.description": "<p>Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton slammed Republican candidate Jeb Bush on racial issues Friday during a speech at a National Urban League conference in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., contending that his campaign slogan, \u201cRight to rise,\u201d is an insult to people of color.</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/482514350-democratic-presidential-hopeful-and-former-secretary-of.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson were the only two GOP presidential candidates to attend the annual convention of the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights group.\nRead more at the New York Times and Fox News.\nWell over a dozen other candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination declined the Urban League\u2019s invitation to appear, mostly citing scheduling conflicts, reports the Associated Press.\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t rise if they can\u2019t afford health care,\u201d Clinton said to cheers from the audience, taking aim at former Florida governor Bush\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe candidates are hoping to win African-American votes, which helped propel President Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012."}
