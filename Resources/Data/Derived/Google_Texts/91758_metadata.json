It meant that every sentence, he automatically said \u201cNike.\u201d He paid a lot for it. It was hilarious, because you could hardly understand what he said anymore. It was just, \u201cThis fuckin\u2019 shit Nike, fuckin\u2019, you know, Nike,\u201d etc. Everything was not always going well, because for most people, our hair fell out and we were bald, and we had less and less skin. Then later there was this thing that hit hipsters. People were just stopping in their tracks frozen. At first, people thought it was another virus, and they were looking for groups like the Coalition of Pity, but it turned out that it was something called Nostalgia Feedback. People had been getting nostalgia for fashions that were closer and closer to their own time, until finally people became nostalgic for the moment they were actually living in, and the feedback completely froze them. It happened to Calista and Loga. We were real worried about them for a day or so. We knew they\u2019d be all right, but still, you know. Marty was like, \u201cHoly fuckin\u2019 shit, this is so Nike fucked.\u201d \u2014 Feed, M.T. Anderson\n\nDisney recently released a trailer for Maleficent, which exists in the murky area between prequel and remake as it reworks the characters and plot from Disney\u2019s own Sleeping Beauty. The new live-action film will hit theaters 55 years after the animated movie that spawned it, though this is hardly the only time Disney\u2019s recycled its own characters. Between video games, ABC\u2019s Once Upon a Time, and theme park shows, the company is in the business of repacking itself as many times as possible. Merchandising is one thing, though, and it\u2019s understandable. Yet the very existence of Maleficent is proof that it\u2019s easier these days \u2014 or at least more popular \u2014 to try and resell something old than come up with something new.\n\nThe studios like to pretend it\u2019s new, though, because they\u2019ve changed things around or opted for a remake that feels \u201cgritty\u201d or \u201ccontroversial\u201d or another buzzword that doesn\u2019t mean anything other than \u201cdifferent enough to let us justify selling you another ticket.\u201d The thing is, Maleficent was, at one point, a fresh creation. The myth of Sleeping Beauty is an old one, but Disney found a way to freshen it with their own creations. It became their story. The remake, though, is a sign that ginning up nostalgia came easier than inventing a new film world. Sure, the risks of doing something new are always apparent \u2014 what if people just don\u2019t respond? \u2014 but the risks of recycling characters and content in endless nostalgia remixes are even more troubling.\n\nTo start: remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels, franchise spin-offs, all of that \u2014 they dilute the power of the original work. Keith Phipps wrote a couple weeks ago about this overkill, lamenting the glut of sequels and franchises by calling for a temporary moratorium on all recycled content. He said: \u201cOnce upon a time, there was no Luke Skywalker. Or Indiana Jones. Or Buzz Lightyear. Or, let\u2019s go back further: No Rick Blaine, Margo Channing, Benjamin Braddock, Michael Corleone, or Annie Hall. Someone had to dream them up.\u201d These neverending knockoffs, sequels, reimaginings, etc., have a way of making the originals feel cheaper. Fans clamor to know more about what happened to this character or that couple, but not every story deserves to be resurrected or reinvented. Often, films are perfectly contained little universes, stopping right where they need to. With too much exposure, what felt special and fresh and powerful starts to feel stale, played out, and past its prime. The 1959 version of Sleeping Beauty is already pretty great (and gorgeous to look at); it\u2019s hard to imagine how a Wicked-inspired reimagining is going to improve things.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Movies like Disney's forthcoming \"Maleficent\" aren't just lazy -- they actually shrink audiences' imaginations", "author": "Daniel Carlson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Movies like Disney's forthcoming \"Maleficent\" aren't just lazy -- they actually shrink audiences' imaginations", "title": "If it ain\u2019t broke: Why remakes and spinoffs almost never work", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/17/why_remakes_suck_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/M_Id_409563_angelina-jolie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Movies like Disney's forthcoming \"Maleficent\" aren't just lazy -- they actually shrink audiences' imaginations", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/M_Id_409563_angelina-jolie.jpg", "title": "If it ain\u2019t broke: Why remakes and spinoffs almost never work", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "If it ain\u2019t broke: Why remakes and spinoffs almost never work", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, franchise, Pajiba, remakes, spinoffs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7e8\"", "article_summary": "It was just, \u201cThis fuckin\u2019 shit Nike, fuckin\u2019, you know, Nike,\u201d etc.\nTo start: remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels, franchise spin-offs, all of that \u2014 they dilute the power of the original work.\nTopics: franchise, Pajiba, remakes, spinoffs, Entertainment News, NewsThis piece originally appeared on PajibaMarty had also gotten a Nike speech tattoo, which was pretty brag.\nWith too much exposure, what felt special and fresh and powerful starts to feel stale, played out, and past its prime.\nThe remake, though, is a sign that ginning up nostalgia came easier than inventing a new film world."}
