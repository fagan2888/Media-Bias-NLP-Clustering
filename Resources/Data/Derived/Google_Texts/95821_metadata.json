The notice, which was in a question-and-answer format, also clarified some areas of the employer mandate\u2014or shared-responsibility provisions\u2014and other topics related to the ACA.\n\nThe comment letters were dated Feb. 18, which was the comment deadline.\n\nFor More Information For more information, see Compensation and Benefits Library\u2019s Tax Aspects of Health Plans Under the Affordable Care Act chapter.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kristen Ricaurte Knebel in Washington at kknebel@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jo-el J.
