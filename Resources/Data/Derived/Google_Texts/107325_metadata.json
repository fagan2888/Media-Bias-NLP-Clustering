Like a coach giving a halftime speech, he shouted encouragement.\n\n\u201cOK people, let\u2019s get y\u2019all signed up for health coverage,\u201d he said, offering handshakes and high-fives. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you some affordable Obamacare.\u201d\n\nJenkins, a Democrat, has emerged as perhaps North Texas\u2019 top cheerleader for President Barack Obama\u2019s much-debated health care overhaul. He has spent countless hours meeting with residents, explaining the Affordable Care Act and helping people apply for coverage.\n\nThe spotlight on Jenkins\u2019 fervent support will shine brightly Wednesday, when Obama visits Dallas to thank local health care volunteers \u2014 at a meeting the county judge helped organize.\n\nJenkins\u2019 hearty backing of the contentious measure, and of a polarizing president, carries political risks, especially heading into an election year. Republican Ron Natinsky, a former Dallas City Council member, has already announced his intention to run against Jenkins.\n\nThe health care overhaul\u2019s disastrous website rollout has already given Republican critics of the law ample fodder.\n\nBut Jenkins said some issues transcend political polls \u2014 and that access to affordable medical care fits the bill in a county where 27 percent of residents lack health insurance.\n\n\u201cI recognize that I am the local face of a program that\u2019s had many challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to continue to make that trade-off if it means even a small number of \u2026 uninsured people getting affordable insurance.\u201d\n\nWith its high number of uninsured residents and its solidly conservative Republican base, Texas has been at the center of the health care debate. Many oppose Obamacare. But in the end, despite countless legislative and legal challenges, the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land.\n\nJenkins and other leaders, including Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, are now grappling with that reality.\n\nDallas County has about 650,000 uninsured residents, according to Census Bureau statistics. Many of those seek health care on a crisis basis and end up rushing to the emergency room at the county hospital \u2014 at great public cost.\n\nLast year, county taxpayers paid the lion\u2019s share of the $685 million it cost to take care of uninsured patients at Parkland Health & Hospital System, Jenkins said.\n\nHe views the issue from a humanitarian standpoint, arguing that access to better insurance will prevent treatable health problems from becoming debilitating or deadly ones. But he also makes a fiscal plea, saying fewer uninsured patients could mean millions of dollars in savings.\n\n\u201cYou pay more in county taxes to care for the uninsured than all other county taxes combined,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about that.\u201d\n\nJenkins is far from alone in North Texas\u2019 multipronged health care outreach, which advocates describe as a model for the state.\n\nFaith-based groups, hospitals and other organizations have been at the forefront, helping people get a handle on the new law. At Parkland, for instance, more than 300 employees trained as counselors have helped nearly 3,000 people fill out applications for coverage.\n\n\u201cThey raised the bar \u2014 created it, actually,\u201d said Marjorie McColl Petty, director of the regional office of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.\n\nOther local politicians have been active, but Jenkins has gone further than most.\n\nHe\u2019s attended forums with hundreds in the audience, and he\u2019s shown up at events to mingle with just a few.\n\nAn acknowledged policy wonk, the county judge is well-versed in Obamacare\u2019s plans and premiums. And he\u2019s memorized the hotline numbers that consumers can call for help.\n\n\u201cThe judge has been an incredible force,\u201d Petty said, echoing similar praise from the White House.\n\nSometimes, Jenkins has approached enrollment one person at time. Just ask Makala Washington, a 33-year-old substitute teacher who came to Parkland\u2019s Irving Health Center this week on the judge\u2019s advice.\n\nWashington had given up on the website (HealthCare.gov). But as the judge looked on, she filled out an application with help from trained Parkland counselors and started the process toward getting insurance for the first time in several years.\n\nWhat would\u2019ve happened without Jenkins\u2019 prodding?\n\n\u201cI probably would\u2019ve gotten sick and been like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I never finished that,\u2019\u201d she said with a sheepish grin.\n\nThat the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rollout has had problems has only raised the stakes of Jenkins\u2019 \u201call in\u201d approach.\n\nSome Texas Democrats, at least those with credible Republican challengers, are reluctant to embrace Obama in a public way. And Jenkins, who worked on Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, is only three years removed from squeaking out what he jokingly calls a \u201c49.6 percent landslide victory\u201d in the race for county judge.\n\nEven though Dallas County has become reliably Democratic, Jenkins said he knows his Republican critics are champing at the bit to voice their disgust at Obamacare \u2014 and at him.\n\nWade Emmert, Dallas County\u2019s Republican Party chairman, said Jenkins\u2019 support for the health care law proves he\u2019s a big-government Obama shill. Natinsky, Jenkins\u2019 GOP opponent next year, said the judge\u2019s efforts have \u201cclearly crossed the line of bringing politics into policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a county judge take it to these extremes,\u201d Natinsky said.\n\n\u201cYou should do what\u2019s right, not be beholden to some mandate from Washington.\u201d\n\nBut if anything, the problems with Obamacare have caused Jenkins to redouble his efforts.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t avoided addressing the overhaul\u2019s shortcomings, though it\u2019s not often that he\u2019s really had a choice. He\u2019s defused some concerns with humor, joking that the website would\u2019ve been OK if officials had simply paid GoDaddy.com an extra $500.\n\nAnd Jenkins has become more aggressive in pointing out other ways to sign up \u2014 over the phone or in person at a Parkland location \u2014 and encouraging resolve among the thousands trying to obtain health insurance.\n\nAt the health fair at the convention center, 36-year-old Alisa Coleman stopped the judge as he shouted encouragement. \u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d she said. Jenkins, hopeful that she would get signed up that day, simply said, \u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are a lot smarter than politicians give them credit for,\u201d he said later. \u201cWe are ultimately judged by those who are paying attention \u2014 and not voting an ideology or straight ticket.\u201d\n\nFollow Tom Benning on Twitter at @tombenning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He knows his support for the Affordable Care Act carries political risks.
