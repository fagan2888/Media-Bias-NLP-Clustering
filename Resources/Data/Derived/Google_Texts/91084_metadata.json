The reason, the pundits quickly concluded, was an unprecedented surge in black Democrats \u2014 some 13,000 or more \u2014 crossing over to support Cochran over his virulently anti-government tea party opponent, Chris McDaniel. \u201cIt should send a message,\u201d retired school principal Ned Tolliver said. \u201cIt shows that we have the power to elect who we want to elect when the time is right.\u201d\n\nAround the time the polls closed, a very different view of Mississippi was playing out on PBS, in the form of a documentary called \u201cFreedom Summer.\u201d Grippingly recounting the 1964 effort that brought more than 700 college students \u2014 primarily white northerners \u2014 to register black voters in Mississippi, the film is part of a flood of 50th anniversary commemorations, from conferences to children\u2019s books. In grim and grainy black-and-white footage, interspersed with interviews from the heroic Americans who risked beatings and firebombings and even death, these tributes remind us of the long road to African-Americans having the power to elect who they want to elect and celebrate those who made it possible.\n\nAnd there is much to celebrate. Mississippi \u2014 where only 28,000 blacks were registered to vote in 1963 \u2014 now boasts more black elected officials than any other state, including the recently reelected first black mayor of Philadelphia, the site of the brutal murders of three civil rights workers. The \u201cWHITES\u201d and \u201cCOLORED\u201d signs have long since come down. A black man sits in the Oval Office.\n\nBut 50 years after Freedom Summer, the United States faces the greatest curbs on voting rights since Reconstruction, with the Supreme Court gutting the Voting Rights Act last year and 22 states passing new voting restrictions since 2010. Poll taxes and literacy tests have been replaced with burdensome new laws that help keep approximately 3.7 million eligible black voters unregistered across the South. And an estimated 2.6 million American felons \u2014 including nearly 8 percent of all black adults \u2014 are barred from voting, despite having served their sentences.\n\nWith more and more Americans losing what President Lyndon Johnson called \u201cthe basic right without which all others are meaningless,\u201d the remaining pool of older, whiter, more conservative voters are desperately trying to take the country back to a past we\u2019d rather not revisit. In North Carolina, to pick a particularly egregious example, the GOP has slashed unemployment insurance, blocked a minimum wage expansion, opted out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, cut universal prekindergarten, cleared the way for fracking, enacted one of the nation\u2019s harshest voter-identification laws, and dramatically reduced access to abortion while allowing concealed weapons in bars, schools, and playgrounds. Even more astoundingly, they accomplished that destructive agenda in just a few short years.\n\nAll of this reinforces why, as Martin Luther King III recently said, we need \u201cnot just this moment of reflection, but also a year of action.\u201d And activists and advocates across the country are taking that charge seriously.\n\nIn Congress, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Reps. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) have spearheaded a bipartisan push to restore the section of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court overturned. Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) have proposed a constitutional amendment to affirmatively guarantee and protect the right to vote for all Americans of legal age. Even Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) \u2014 who has criticized a key provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u2014 is introducing a bill with cross-party appeal to restore federal voting rights to nonviolent felons.\n\nMeanwhile, fired by the same spirit of righteous indignation that drove their predecessors, a movement of young people and minorities and progressives of all stripes is stepping up. Already, we have seen weekly \u201cMoral Monday\u201d protests pop-up in North Carolina in response to the Republican assault on working people. They are joined this summer by a network of grassroots activists and organizations calling themselves Freedom Sid, which hopes to recruit and train over 4,000 volunteers and register more than 30,000 young voters in Mississippi, Texas, Florida and Ohio. Their efforts are aimed at a broad spectrum of social ills, from the restriction of voting rights to mass incarceration to immigration reform to youth unemployment. \u201cThe best way to commemorate Freedom Summer,\u201d the group says, \u201cis to reinvent it and take back the democratic process for our generation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, freedom takes more than a summer. It\u2019s time for all of us to earn our insurgencies.\n\nRead more from Katrina vanden Heuvel\u2019s archive or follow her on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifty years after Freedom Summer, the U.S. faces the greatest curbs on voting rights since Reconstruction.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000403637764", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Fifty years after Freedom Summer, the U.S. faces the greatest curbs on voting rights since Reconstruction.", "title": "50 years after Freedom Summer, America needs a year of action", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/katrina-vanden-heuvel-after-mississippi-america-needs-a-year-of-action/2014/06/30/c713cd48-008d-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/01/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Minority_Voters_The_New_Math-0022f-2505.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KatrinaNation"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/katrina-vanden-heuvel-after-mississippi-america-needs-a-year-of-action/2014/06/30/c713cd48-008d-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Katrina vanden Heuvel, thad cochran, mississippi, voting rights, chris mcdaniel, primary, republican primary, freedom summer, civil rights, supreme court, felons voting, voter id, north carolina, lyndon johnson, patrick leahy, john conyers, james sensenbrenner, rand paul, keith ellison, mark pocan, moral monday,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000403637764"}, "news_keywords": "Katrina vanden Heuvel, thad cochran, mississippi, voting rights, chris mcdaniel, primary, republican primary, freedom summer, civil rights, supreme court, felons voting, voter id, north carolina, lyndon johnson, patrick leahy, john conyers, james sensenbrenner, rand paul, keith ellison, mark pocan, moral monday,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "c713cd48-008d-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0957\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe best way to commemorate Freedom Summer,\u201d the group says, \u201cis to reinvent it and take back the democratic process for our generation.\u201dIndeed, freedom takes more than a summer.\nBut 50 years after Freedom Summer, the United States faces the greatest curbs on voting rights since Reconstruction, with the Supreme Court gutting the Voting Rights Act last year and 22 states passing new voting restrictions since 2010.\nPoll taxes and literacy tests have been replaced with burdensome new laws that help keep approximately 3.7 million eligible black voters unregistered across the South.\nTheir efforts are aimed at a broad spectrum of social ills, from the restriction of voting rights to mass incarceration to immigration reform to youth unemployment.\nEven Sen.
