Ted Cruz.\n\nDuring the Texas senator's speech, he discussed wanting to reignite America's promise and he says that can be done by abolishing the IRS, Common Core and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSen. Cruz also compared his campaign to President Ronald Reagan's in 1980 and said it will take a grassroots campaign to win.\n\n\u201cIf you think we just need to fiddle around the edges and not make fundamental change, then I ain't your guy, but if you think it is profoundly broken that there is bipartisan corruption, where the rich and powerful in Washington get stronger and stronger and working men and women get left in the cold, if you want to get the power out of Washington and back to we the people, that's what this campaign is all about,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to his stance on creating a stronger and safer America, the Texas senator discussed keys to economic growth. He touted regulatory and tax reforms and mentioned abolishing the IRS.\n\n\u201cThere are about 90,000 employees at the IRS. We need to padlock that building and take everyone of them and put them on our Southern border,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile some of Sen. Cruz's speech could be considered tongue in cheek, some delegates say they appreciated the honesty.\n\n\u201cThere wasn't any question about where he stood on the issue. He wasn't kind of wishy-washy, he was direct and clear,\u201d said delegate Virginia Crocker.\n\nDelegate Watson Lawrence said support from delegates is important for presidential hopefuls' campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of delegates to the National Convention, so this is a very important state for all presidential candidates to come and garnish folks,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Cruz said grassroots support will help him win.\n\n\u201cJust like it happened in 1980, I think 2016 is going to be an election like 1980. I think Ronald Reagan is right, we win when we paint in bold colors, and not pale pastels,\u201d he said.\n\nDonald Trump will headline Saturday night's events. Dr. Ben Carson will also have a speaking slot Sunday.
