[Fox News]\n\nFox Business News host Neil Cavuto, known more for reporting on the economy and defending business interests, attempted a stab at a humorous commentary this week, asking, \u201cWhy does Obama blame Fox New for everything?\u201d\n\nAfter running a selection of contextless clips of the president, sometimes laughing, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I don\u2019t always get my most favorable coverage on Fox,\u201d Cavuto added \u201cBusted!\u201d with a smirk.\n\n\u201cI am busted, so busted. Pick a crisis, any crisis: FOX created it'\u201d Cavuto said before ticking off a laundry list of ills that have afflicted the country during\u2013 and slightly before \u2014 Obama took office, saying the president blamed the conservative network for them.\n\n\u201cThis tepid economic meltdown? Sorry: Fox News. The housing meltdown that preceded it? You guessed it \u2013 Fox News started it,\u201d he mockingly confessed.\u201d The Internet bubble? Fox News created it and we burst it so we could keep milking it. The energy crisis back in the 1970\u2019s? Fox News, which is amazing because we weren\u2019t even around in the 70\u2019s.\u201d\n\nCavuto then moved on, attempting to use hyperbole to say that Fox News was responsible for the Kennedy assassination, the sinking of the Titanic, Pearl Harbor, and the Irish Potato Famine.\n\n\u201cFOX\u2019s Irish-American anchors [Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity] did nothing to stop the famine,\u201d Cavuto admitted..\n\nCavuto also confessed that the network was also responsible for tsunamis, earthquakes, and the disappearance of the dinosaurs, saying, \u201cFOX News killed them off!\u201d\n\nThe Fox host did not share video with his viewers of the president blaming the network for the events \u2014 the ones shown contained the president commenting on their coverage of the news \u2014 nor did he note that studies have shown that Fox News viewers are consistently misinformed by their news network of choice.\n\nAmong many news viewers, Fox News has become a punchline for jokes about poor reporting and misinformation.\n\nOn the recent Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, former SNL Weekend Update host Jane Curtin, reflected, \u201cA lot has changed since I sat at this desk. For example, I used to be the only pretty blonde woman reading fake news. Now there\u2019s an entire network devoted to that,\u201d with an image of the conservative news network\u2019s logo shown beside her.\n\nWatch the video below from Fox Business News:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Neil-Cavuto-Screenshot-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "WATCH: Fox news host fails at sarcasm while asking \u2018Why does Obama blame Fox for everything?\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Among many news viewers, Fox News has become a punchline for jokes about poor reporting and misinformation.\nFox News host Neil Cavuto on Oct. 29, 2013.\nWatch the video below from Fox Business News:Watch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com\nNow there\u2019s an entire network devoted to that,\u201d with an image of the conservative news network\u2019s logo shown beside her.\nPick a crisis, any crisis: FOX created it'\u201d Cavuto said before ticking off a laundry list of ills that have afflicted the country during\u2013 and slightly before \u2014 Obama took office, saying the president blamed the conservative network for them."}
