It\u2019s a lot harder the second time around, though.\u201d\n\nIf last night\u2019s 52-12 victory over the Tigers (3-5) at Joseph N. Coviello Field is any indication, the Bees (5-3) might be further along than Rodriguez thinks. The win puts Bayonne into position to make the playoffs for the second time in Rodriguez\u2019s second stint with the team.\n\nWhile some early trickery from the home team put the Bees in a 6-0 hole, Bayonne came back with a vengeance, controlling the game on offense as well as defense from thereon.\n\nWide receiver/linebacker Damon Small led the Bees with four catches for 172 yards and four touchdowns, in addition to securing the interception that set up the Bees first score.\n\nThe interception, which led to a 12-yard score by senior running back Xavier Matos (148 yards, three touchdowns), was the first of two turnovers that gave the Bees favorable field position in the first quarter.\n\nThe latter came in the form of a fumble recovery on the Memorial 31-yard line. This time, Small capitalized on offense, hauling in a 31-yard touchdown reception from sophomore quarterback Zymire Gordon to put the Bees ahead 14-6. Gordon had a stellar night as well, finishing the game with 172 passing yards and four scores, while also snatching an interception that led to another Matos rushing touchdown.\n\nSenior Josh Patrovich scooped up another turnover for the Bees in the second half, returning a fumble recovery 99 yards for a touchdown, as Bayonne took a 38-12 lead.\n\nWith their playoff hopes on the line, the Tigers started the game with a splash of innovation on offense. On the second play, senior quarterback Bobby Bailey tossed a pass out to Jorge Ortez, who reeled in the catch, and then chucked a pass of his own downfield to a wide open Marcus Vegas.\n\nOrtez would later score on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Bailey in the second quarter, cutting the Bees\u2019 lead to 20-12.\n\nWith their first eight games in the books, the Bees will now wait to see what seed they end up with in the North 2, Group 5 playoffs. But no matter what they\u2019re seeded, Rodriguez feels the Bees\u2019 schedule, which has included matchups against St. Peter\u2019s Prep (7-1) and Sparta (6-1), has Bayonne prepared for any obstacle.\n\n\u201cWe just play one game at a time,\u201d said Rodriguez, who coached the team from 2001 to 2004 and guided the Bees to their only state title in 2002. \"We\u2019ve played some of the toughest teams in the state of New Jersey. Our schedule is unbelievable, it\u2019s like a South Eastern Conference schedule, but it\u2019s good because when we get to the playoffs, we\u2019ll be battle tested.\u201d\n\nBayonne (5-3) 14 18 13 7 \u2013 52\n\nMemorial (3-5) 6 6 0 0 \u2013 12\n\n(M): Marcus Vegas 85 pass from Jorge Ortez (kick blocked).\n\n(B): Xavier Matos 12 run (Xavier Matos kick).\n\n(B): Damon Small 31 pass from Zymire Gordon (Xavier Matos kick).\n\n(B): Damon Small 46 pass from Zymire Gordon (kick failed).\n\n(M): Jorge Ortez 11 pass from Bobby Bailey (pass failed).\n\n(B): Damon Small 76 pass from Zymire Gordon (pass failed).\n\n(B): Xavier Matos 11 run (kick failed).\n\n(B): Josh Patrovich 99 fumble return (Xavier Matos kick).\n\n(B): Damon Small 19 pass from Zymire Gordon (kick failed).\n\n(B): Xavier Matos 16 run (Xavier Matos).", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "sports", "title": "Bees regain mojo in big win over Memorial", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Bees regain mojo in big win over Memorial\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/11/bees_regain_mojo_in_big_win_ov.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2013/11/13695960-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11558472\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-02T07:03:37Z\", \"author\": \"Brandon Gould/The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"sports\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/11/13695960-small.jpg", "description": "WEST NEW YORK - After a six-year absence as the head coach of the Bayonne High School football team, Rick Rodriguez has led his team on a gradual return to prominence over the past three seasons, trying to rekindle the days when the Bees were a team to be feared", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, November 02, 2013,  3:03 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/11/13695960-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"gould9tcnj\", \"author_nickname\": \"Brandon Gould/The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"10907171\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "WEST NEW YORK - After a six-year absence as the head coach of the Bayonne High School football team, Rick Rodriguez has led his team on a gradual return to prominence over the past three seasons, trying to rekindle the days when the Bees were a team to be feared", "title": "Bees regain mojo in big win over Memorial", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/11/bees_regain_mojo_in_big_win_ov.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, November 02, 2013,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Brandon Gould/The Jersey Journal", "Description": "WEST NEW YORK - After a six-year absence as the head coach of the Bayonne High School football team, Rick Rodriguez has led his team on a gradual return to prominence over the past three seasons, trying to rekindle the days when the Bees were a team to be feared"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa9e\"", "article_summary": "(B): Xavier Matos 16 run (Xavier Matos).\n(B): Xavier Matos 12 run (Xavier Matos kick).\n(B): Damon Small 76 pass from Zymire Gordon (pass failed).\n(B): Damon Small 31 pass from Zymire Gordon (Xavier Matos kick).\nThis time, Small capitalized on offense, hauling in a 31-yard touchdown reception from sophomore quarterback Zymire Gordon to put the Bees ahead 14-6."}
