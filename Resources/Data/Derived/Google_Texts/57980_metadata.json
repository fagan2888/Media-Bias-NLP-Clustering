Their commercial success worldwide has triggered many attempts by competitors to imitate their designs and essential characteristics. Some of these attempts have been in compliance with intellectual property rules, and accordingly courts have correctly rejected Lego\u2019s legal moves to stop such \u201clegal\u201d imitations. But others have not been so lucky.\n\nLego has won its latest trademark battle after an EU court recently ruled that its mini-figures should continue to be classed as protected shapes. The decision followed an attempt by Best-Lock, a Lancashire-based toy manufacturer, to appeal against the trademark protection to allow it to produce similar products, along with the lego-compatible toys it already produces. So are the little figures distinctive enough to warrant protecting?\n\nShapes of products can be registered as trademarks, provided they are distinctive and therefore enable consumers to recognise the trade origin of the good. The typical example is the Coca-Cola bottle: its shape has been registered as a three-dimensional trademark by the Atlanta-based giant. Lego registered its figures as a three-dimensional trademark in 2000.\n\nRelated: Bigger Than Barbie: Lego Is Now King of the Toymakers\n\nEven when products are distinctive, however, they may be denied trademark protection if the shape itself is also deemed to serve a technical function. This is to protect competition. It ensures that companies cannot use trademark law in order to perpetually monopolise technical solutions (trademark registration can be renewed every ten years, potentially for ever) and therefore block technological progress.\n\nFor this reason, Lego was denied the trademarking of its eight-studded brick back in 2010. After years of legal action, the EU\u2019s top judicial body upheld a challenge by Canadian toymaker Mega Brands who argued that a trademark on the the Lego brick would prevent competitors (including their Mega Bloks bricks) from manufacturing and selling a basic technical building shape. The court agreed.\n\nPatents\n\nIf companies want to protect technological solutions they must use patents, which are limited in time (just 20 years from the date of application). This ensures that the public at large can benefit from inventions once the term of the patent protection expires.\n\nThese points had been stressed by Best-Lock, which also manufactures cheap plastic building bricks that are compatible with Lego. Their case was based on the idea that the shape of Lego\u2019s little men and women is their defining technical characteristic. They argued that the mini-figures are merely toy building blocks designed for play purposes.\n\nThey therefore serve \u2013 Best-Lock argued \u2013 a technical function. And they do so because of the mobility of the figures and because the holes under the figures\u2019 feet enabled them to be connected to other Lego bricks. This is why these technical features had been protected by a patent filed by Lego in the 1970s, which has now expired.\n\nAesthetics trumps technicality. Lego.\n\nThe aim of Lego\u2019s competitor was clear. They tried to have Lego\u2019s trademark registration cancelled in order to be able to produce and sell themselves replicas of the men and women figures and thus erode the dominant position held by Lego in the toy market. Yet, Best-Lock\u2019s arguments failed to convince the court.\n\nThis time, the judges found that the key elements of the shape of the Lego figures \u2013 the head, body, arms and legs \u2013 do not actually involve the ability to join them to other building blocks. They therefore serve no technical function. Instead they are designed mainly to confer human traits on those figures \u2013 their function is aesthetic and fully distinctive. This means they can be protected by a trademark registration, according to the court.\n\nRelated: 10 of the Most Inappropriate Toys for Kids\n\nThis is a major victory for Lego as it can keep suing competitors with a view to stopping them producing and selling replicas of the little figures \u2013 and so maintain a position at the top of toytown. This ruling will effectively help Lego monopolise this distinctive toy. It is also a timely decision for the Danish toymaker as it comes exactly in the year the Lego brand has replaced luxury sports car brand Ferrari as the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Powerful Brand\u201d.\n\nEnrico Bonadio is Senior Lecturer in Law at City University London.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
