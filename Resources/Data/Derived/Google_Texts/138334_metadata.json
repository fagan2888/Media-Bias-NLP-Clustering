Anthony Weiner is subdued and largely confined to the sidelines. Grover Norquist \u2026 gets to say a line or two on camera. From beyond the bright lights pops Garry Trudeau, who is choreographing this dance of famous faces. The celebrated political satirist, best known as creator of the Pulitzer-winning comic strip \u2018Doonesbury,\u2019 \u2026 is channeling his inner Robert Altman. The late filmmaker was his partner on HBO\u2019s \u2018Tanner \u201988\u2019 and the Sundance Channel\u2019s \u2018Tanner on Tanner\u2019 (2004), a pair of comedy series that served as Trudeau\u2019s early forays into live-action televised political sendups. \u2026 \u2018For the first time, I\u2019m the boss,\u2019 the 65-year-old New York native says on his lunch break\u2026.\n\n\u201c\u2018Alpha House\u2019 [is] the first original series from Amazon Studios \u2026 (You can watch the first three episodes for free starting [now]; streaming the season\u2019s remaining eight weekly episodes online will require signing up for Amazon Prime, which gives you access to Amazon Prime Instant Video. \u2026 ) \u2018Alpha House\u2019 is a pioneer, perhaps a bellwether \u2014 and, just maybe, the canary in the gold mine. As online-streaming programmers aim to make inroads into Hollywood, Netflix already has its Emmy-winning political show, \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 which gained insta-cred after it landed Oscar-winning Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright in starring roles. Now, Amazon Studios is betting on a political comedy that has a lofty pedigree of its own. \u2026 Based on a real Hill living arrangement from last decade, \u201cAlpha House\u201d centers on four Republican senators who are also roommates [including] John Goodman \u2026\n\n\u201c[T]he left-leaning cartoonist was inspired after reading a [2007] New York Times piece by Mark Leibovich about four Democrats who were \u2018Real World\u2019-style roomies: Rep. George Miller, Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Sen. Charles E. Schumer and Rep. Bill Delahunt. He wrote a script, but the project never gained traction. In 2012, Trudeau\u2019s friend Jonathan Alter [now executive producer of \u2018Alpha House\u2019] got a tip from former CNN president Jon Klein. \u2018He told me Amazon was going into the content business.\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/Ok4Drw\n\nSCOOP \u2013 WSJ A1, \u201cGeithner Heads To Private Equity,\u201d by Ryan Dezember, with Deborah Solomon: \u201cFormer U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, one of the architects of the federal government's rescue of the financial system, is joining private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. Mr. Geithner, who has spent most of his career outside the private sector, said in an interview he plans to start in March at the New York-based firm, known for its role in buyouts of companies including eye-care firm Bausch & Lomb Inc., luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and stadium concessionaire Aramark Corp. \u2026 At Warburg, he will serve as president and managing director, not the kind of figurehead or advisory positions that public-sector figures often land after government stints. Mr. Geithner, 52 years old, is expected to work on mapping the firm's strategy and management, investor relations and on matters related to the firm's investments. \u2026 Citing the firm's global reach and \u2018low-key\u2019 nature, he said Warburg is \u2018culturally very compatible with what I was looking for.\u2019\n\n\u201cWarburg Co-Chief Executive Charles Kaye said Mr. Geithner will \u2026 \u2018very much be here every day.\u2019 \u2026 The former Treasury secretary will join a long line of public servants going into private equity after government service. Earlier this year, KKR tapped David Petraeus \u2026 to lead an internal team focused on macroeconomic forecasting and public policy. Former Vice President Dan Quayle and former Treasury Secretary John Snow work for Cerberus Capital Management LP. Carlyle Group LP has enlisted many officials from the Bush and Clinton administrations, including former Secretary of State James Baker III, in advisory roles. \u2026 Fund executives can accumulate substantial wealth if the investments perform well. \u2026\n\n\u201cGeithner, who has two young-adult children, lives just north of New York City in suburban Larchmont. \u2026 The Warburg job will be Mr. Geithner's first private-sector position since he worked early in his career for Kissinger Associates \u2026 Since leaving Treasury, Mr. Geithner hit the speaking circuit, fetching big fees to speak at corporate events, including Warburg's annual meeting in May.\u201d http://goo.gl/XLAebz\n\n--WARBURG BACKGROUND \u2013 A September article by Forbes, \u201cWarburg Pincus: The Merchant Of Modest\u201d: \u201cWhile others in the business have expanded their financial offerings -- from renewable energy at Carlyle to retail junk bond mutual funds at KKR -- Warburg has [stuck] to the basic \u2026 buyout business, avoiding ten-figure megadeals. Often it acts more like a venture capital firm, buying big into small, unproven companies. Warburg didn\u2019t go public like Blackstone and the Carlyle Group during the recent wave.\u201d http://goo.gl/JTg9FC\n\nJEREMY W. PETERS, on the cover of N.Y. Times \u201cSunday Styles\u201d section, \u201cThe Gayest Place in America?\u201d: \u201cMy earliest sense of what it meant to be gay in the nation\u2019s capital came more than a decade ago when I was a summer intern. I was a few blocks from Union Station when a congressman walked by and gave the reporters I was standing with a big, floppy wave hello. \u2018You know what they say about him,\u2019 said one of them, the inflection of his voice rising to a squeak so there could be no mistaking what he meant. I didn\u2019t know, in fact. I wasn\u2019t even sure what the congressman\u2019s name was. But the message was as clear as it was unsettling for a 20-year-old struggling with his own sexual identity: There were plenty of gay people in Washington, even at the highest levels of government. But instead of being widely accepted, they were usually whispered about derisively, suspect characters to be mocked and maligned.\n\n\u201cToday, having moved here 10 months ago after six and a half years of living in Manhattan, I hardly recognize that closeted, often intolerant Washington I first glimpsed as a 20-year-old. I now live in the gayest place in America. \u2026 One of my first observations about my new city was the throngs of gay men I would see over the course of a typical day all over town \u2014 walking their dogs in my neighborhood before work, riding the Metro, working in the halls of Congress. \u2026 Such ubiquity isn\u2019t just an abundance of gay bars, though there are at least six within walking distance of my house in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest Washington.\n\n\u201cOn the days I make the 20-minute walk from home to my office near the White House, I will pass one example after another of this city\u2019s thriving gay economy: a Mitchell Gold & Bob Williams furniture store; a clothing retailer whose window displays regularly feature bare-torso, well-endowed mannequins in nothing but tiny briefs; three CrossFit gyms; the offices of two gay newspapers, The Washington Blade and Metro Weekly (most cities cannot even sustain one); a bathhouse; and the national headquarters for the Human Rights Campaign. \u2026\n\n\u201cIt was only during the Clinton years that the White House finally ended the decades-long practice of denying security clearance to people known to be gay or lesbian. That meant in order to be considered for many high-level jobs involving access to classified information, gays and lesbians had to concoct a web of lies about their personal lives. Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on Capitol Hill for years, described how he and his gay friends had to make sure they all gave the same references to government agents investigating their backgrounds, an insurance policy so that if the question of their sexual orientation came up, they could be certain no one unpredictable would spill the truth.\n\n\u201cHilary Rosen, a longtime Democratic lobbyist, told me that in the 1980s she once unsuccessfully tried to persuade Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, to support a bill that would have given more AIDS-prevention money to San Francisco. \u2018He said to me with much concern and affection, \u201cOh, Hilary, why would you want to help those people?\u201d\u2019 she said. \u2018When I told him I was actually one of those people, he shook his head, tried to change the subject and voted against us.\u2019 \u2026 Hatch recently voted for legislation to include gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in federal nondiscrimination law. \u2026 Elmendorf \u2026 thinks that gay people, because they were mostly without children, were able to resist the draw of higher pay in the private sector. \u2018All the straight people would leave, worrying about how they were going to send their kids to Sidwell Friends.\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/DrPKcw\n\nDIGITAL DOWNLOAD \u2013 L.A. Times Business lead, \u201cValues of social media start-ups boom: Are the huge numbers a \u2018form of delusion,\u2019 a good bet or something in between?\u201d by Jessica Guynn in S.F.: \u201cSnapchat is not even 3 years old. It's run by a couple of twentysomethings with no prior business experience. And it has never made a cent. Yet investors are fighting for the opportunity to throw hundreds of millions at the mobile messaging service that is all the rage with teens. The tiny Venice Beach start-up just turned down a $3-billion all-cash offer from Facebook Inc. And then, according to the Silicon Valley rumor mill, it rejected an offer from Google Inc., this one for $4 billion. \u2026 Among the better-known Silicon Valley companies with monster truck-sized valuations are mobile payments start-up Square Inc. at $3.25 billion, online storage start-up Dropbox Inc. at $4 billion, private transportation service Uber Technologies Inc. at $3.5 billion and home rental service Airbnb Inc. at $2.5 billion.\n\n\u201cThese sky-high valuations for companies with untested business models are giving some people a bad case of dot-com deja vu. \u2026 Technology giants are willing to spend large sums of money buying these start-ups to keep up with young people's rapidly evolving online habits. \u2026 Pinterest \u2026 just raised $225 million from investors, valuing it at $3.8 billion \u2026 Pinterest has tens of millions of users, some of whom spend hours a day on the service, yet it has just begun to explore how it will make money \u2026 [A]lthough valuations in Silicon Valley are clearly inflated, they may not be as bubbly as they sound, some experts say. Twitter is just the latest social media company to show it can make money from its massive audience. And its successful initial public offering \u2014 it ended its first day of trading with a $25-billion market cap despite never having turned a profit \u2014 has whetted investors' appetite for companies with significant growth potential.\n\n\u201cContributing to the current fervor: Investors are feeling more optimistic, with the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 indexes rising to record highs. \u2026 A federal law enacted last year that will allow start-ups to raise money from smaller investors could send tech valuations even higher. Their target: social media. With the success of Facebook, LinkedIn Corp. and now Twitter, the sector has proved it is not a passing fad.\u201d http://goo.gl/t4TGY0\n\n** A message from Altria: Attitudes toward tobacco have changed, and Altria\u2019s companies have significantly changed how we do business.

CGI moved into AMS\u2019s custom-made building off Interstate 66, changed the sign outside and kept the core of employees, who now populate the upper ranks of CGI Federal. \u2026 A year before CGI Group acquired AMS in 2004, AMS settled a lawsuit brought by the head of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which had hired the company to upgrade the agency\u2019s computer system.

In addition, the Broads announced a $100-million gift to their institute focused on biomedical research in Cambridge, Mass. The moves reflect the significant interest the Broads have in education and research throughout the country. The foundation tapped Bruce Reed, Vice President Joe Biden's chief of staff for nearly three years, to oversee its Los Angeles-based philanthropic group that backs efforts to improve urban public schools. \u2026 Reed has served in senior positions in both the Obama and Clinton administrations and will join the foundation in mid-December.\n\n\u201cReed has been involved in education policy since he worked for then-Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) in the 1980s. He went on to become the policy chief for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, then worked in the White House for eight years, becoming domestic policy advisor in Clinton's second term. \u2026 The foundation has led numerous efforts to change public schools nationwide.

Lublin: \u201cSteve Ballmer paced his corner office on a foggy January morning here, listening through loudspeakers to his directors' voices on a call that would set in motion the end of his 13-year reign as Microsoft Corp.'s chief executive. Microsoft lagged behind Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in important consumer markets, despite its formidable software revenue. Mr. Ballmer tried to spell out his plan to remake Microsoft, but a director cut him off, telling him he was moving too slowly. \u2018Hey, dude, let's get on with it,\u2019 lead director John Thompson says he told him. \u2018We're in suspended animation.\u2019 \u2026 [T]he contentious call put him on a difficult journey toward his August decision to retire, sending Microsoft into further tumult as it began seeking a successor to a man who has been at its heart for 33 years.\n\n\u201c\u2018Maybe I'm an emblem of an old era, and I have to move on,\u2019 the 57-year-old Mr. Ballmer says, pausing as his eyes well up. \u2026 \u2018[T]he best way for Microsoft to enter a new era is a new leader who will accelerate change.\u2019 \u2026 Mr. Ballmer, in a series of exclusive interviews tinged with his characteristic bluster and wistfulness, tells of how he came to believe that he couldn't lead Microsoft forward\u2014that, in fact, Microsoft would not be led by him because of the very corporate culture he had helped instill\u2026. The Microsoft board's list of possible successors includes, among others, former Nokia Corp. CEO Stephen Elop, Microsoft enterprise-software chief Satya Nadella and Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally \u2026\n\n\u201cMicrosoft's next chief will be only the third in its history [after Bill Gates and Ballmer]. Mr. Ballmer joined in 1980 at the suggestion of his Harvard University pal, \u2026 Gates, and is its second-largest individual shareholder and a billionaire. \u2026 Ballmer says he is weighing casual offers as varied as university teaching and coaching his youngest son's high-school basketball team. He plans no big decisions for at least six months -- except that he won't run another big company. He says he's open to remaining a Microsoft director.\u201d http://goo.gl/nDssSO\n\nBIRTHDAYS: Elizabeth Drew is 78 \u2026 Reid Kaplan, son of Allison Price of DoJ and Jonathan Kaplan of Open Society Foundation, is 1!

Michelle and Columbia Crest. Our products are intended for adults only and we recognize the importance of marketing them accordingly. Our companies support several approaches to reducing the harm caused by smoking including preventing underage tobacco use and connecting adults who have decided to quit smoking with information to help them. We believe a complementary strategy focused on developing innovative tobacco products that could reduce harm for smokers is also important. In addition to communicating openly about the health risks of tobacco, we provide funding for the widely-recognized We Card\u00ae age verification program and non-profit community groups that help kids make healthy decisions. It\u2019s our way of doing business at Altria today. Take a closer look at www.altria.com. **\n\n** A message from BP: Safety is never being satisfied \u2013 and always working to be better.
