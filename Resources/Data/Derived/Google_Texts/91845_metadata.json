He learned that he had suffered a series of ministrokes, exacerbated by poorly treated diabetes and a tobacco addiction. Now the blood vessels in his eyes are bleeding and he suffers from a partially detached retina, according to the Charlotte Observer.His doctor, presently treating him for free, told the newspaper that he will go blind if he doesn\u2019t receive specialized surgery.While the operation is widely available, Lang has exhausted his savings and can no longer work due to his impaired vision. The self-employed repairman who owns a suburban home valued over $300,000 always figured \u201chelp would be available in an emergency.\u201dHe did try to obtain Affordable Care Act coverage, but by the time he applied, he missed the 2015 enrollment deadline. He does not earn enough income to qualify for a private coverage subsidy and says he\u2019s \u201ceither too young or too old\u201d to be eligible for charities helping with blindness and diabetes.Although Medicaid is typically available for low-income Americans, the right-wing state of South Carolina refused to participate in the program\u2019s expansion, even though it would have been fully funded by the federal government.Lang\u2019s wife blames President Obama\u2019s labyrinthine health policies for her husband\u2019s current predicament.\u201c(My husband) should be at the front of the line, because he doesn\u2019t work and because he has medical issues,\u201d Mary Lang told the Charlotte Observer. \u201cWe call it the Not Fair Health Care Act.\u201dBut as the Charlotte Observer\u2019s health care reporter points out, \u201cAnyone who\u2019s remotely familiar with insurance knows there\u2019s no system that lets people skip payments while they\u2019re healthy and cash in when they get sick.\u201dSince the original news story was posted, Lang\u2019s GoFundMe page has raised more than half of the $30,000 that he believe he will need for surgery and medical bills. Almost all of the fundraisers are Obamacare supporters who hope that this experience forces Lang to reconsider his stance on the legislation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/far-out-friday-republican-who-said-hed-rather-go-blind-than-use-obamacare-is-now-going-blind-22491.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "A diabetic man who insisted he could pay his own medical bills now seeks donations for a surgery needed to prevent blindness.", "title": "Far Out Friday: Republican who said he'd rather go blind than use Obamacare is now going blind"}, "twitter": {"description": "A diabetic man who insisted he could pay his own medical bills now seeks donations for a surgery needed to prevent blindness.", "title": "Far Out Friday: Republican who said he'd rather go blind than use O ...", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/far-out-friday-republican-who-said-hed-rather-go-blind-than-use-obamacare-is-now-going-blind-22491.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A diabetic man who insisted he could pay his own medical bills now seeks donations for a surgery needed to prevent blindness.", "author": "Insurance Business"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4a3\"", "article_summary": "Almost all of the fundraisers are Obamacare supporters who hope that this experience forces Lang to reconsider his stance on the legislation.\nHe learned that he had suffered a series of ministrokes, exacerbated by poorly treated diabetes and a tobacco addiction.\nLuis Lang, a 49-year old handyman from Fort Mill, South Carolina, is a self-reliant Republican who never obtained health insurance because he \u201cprided himself on paying his own medical bills.\u201dThen the headaches started.After 10 days of unceasing pain, Lang consulted a doctor.\nThe self-employed repairman who owns a suburban home valued over $300,000 always figured \u201chelp would be available in an emergency.\u201dHe did try to obtain Affordable Care Act coverage, but by the time he applied, he missed the 2015 enrollment deadline.\nNow the blood vessels in his eyes are bleeding and he suffers from a partially detached retina, according to the Charlotte Observer.His doctor, presently treating him for free, told the newspaper that he will go blind if he doesn\u2019t receive specialized surgery.While the operation is widely available, Lang has exhausted his savings and can no longer work due to his impaired vision."}
