LOS ANGELES (AP) — Emma Stone is a Kids’ Choice Award winner who largely escaped the show’s trademark green slime. But the same isn’t true for the stars of “Modern Family.”

Stone was honored as favorite movie actress for her role in “The Amazing Spider-Man 2″ at Saturday’s ceremony. Stone gamely put her hands in a spray of the show’s trademark slime, but otherwise remained goo-free.

When “Modern Family” collected its Nickelodeon trophy for favorite family TV shows, cast members including Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Rico Rodriguez got hit by a slime wave — as Ferguson thanked the show for letting them off the hook.

Nick Jonas hosted the ceremony, which also honored the group Fifth Harmony as favorite new artist and Liam Hemsworth of “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1″ as favorite male action star.
