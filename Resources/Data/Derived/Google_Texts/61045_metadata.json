After all, the military has opened all combat roles to women.\n\nFollowing the debate, Sen. Ted Cruz disagreed with his rivals. He called the proposal \u201cnuts.\u201d\n\nLt. Gen. (US Army-Ret.) William \"Jerry\" Boykin appears to agrees with the Texas senator. Boykin, the executive vice president of the Family Research Council, sent an urgent email to supporters on Tuesday noting how concerned he was after last weekend\u2019s GOP debate. He said the new proposal to make women sign up for the draft proves that the military is being used as a social experiment.\n\nEveryone in the military knows that once in, you don't get to choose where you will end up serving. As the current administration has made abundantly clear, the U.S. military is now operating as a testing ground for social change -- at the expense of military readiness. As combat infantry and Special Forces specialties are opened to women, it only follows that if a draft should occur, conscripted women would inevitably be placed in units where the mission is to find and engage the enemy, including hand-to-hand combat.\n\nFor some peace of mind, Boykin urged the current presidential candidates to sign the following pledge.\n\nPetition to U.S. Presidential Candidates I, the undersigned, urge you to reject mandatory registration for selective military service for women. It is unconscionable that we would even contemplate forcing our daughters to be put in in harm's way against their will. The women in our military have a long history of excellent service as volunteers. Should a draft occur, there is no need to conscript our women into service that would ultimately include infantry and Special Forces. The current national discussion on the issue places a liberal social agenda over and above military readiness and respect for the value of America's young women. Don't draft our daughters. I urge you to reject required selective service registration for all American women.\n\nBoykin is perhaps convinced Cruz will sign it. He endorsed the Texas senator Thursday, according to Cruz's campaign.\n\n\u201cThe next President will appoint three Supreme Court Justices,\u201d Lt. Gen. Boykin said. \u201cI want Ted Cruz to do that. He is a man of character, integrity, and courage.\u201d\n\nOther politicians are drawing attention to the issue. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is expected to introduce a bill that would block women from registering for the Selective Service. His reason was personal.\n\n\u201cI do not want to see my 15-year-old daughter drafted into the military,\u201d the Utah senator told CNS News.\n\nArmy Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller disagree. Both are fully supportive of women being included in the draft.\n\n\u201cEvery American who\u2019s physically qualified should register for the draft,\u201d Neller testified during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.\n\nWhat do Americans think?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Should women be drafted?.05/27/2016 9:12:04AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Should women be drafted?", "title": "Retired General: 'Don't Draft Our Daughters'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/11/retired-general-dont-draft-our-daughters-n2117658", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/233/eace2a9f-74e9-48df-b863-b0e607880251.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Should women be drafted?", "title": "Retired General: 'Don't Draft Our Daughters'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/11/retired-general-dont-draft-our-daughters-n2117658", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/233/eace2a9f-74e9-48df-b863-b0e607880251.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Retired General: 'Don't Draft Our Daughters', Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Petition to U.S. Presidential Candidates I, the undersigned, urge you to reject mandatory registration for selective military service for women.\nHe said the new proposal to make women sign up for the draft proves that the military is being used as a social experiment.\nSen.
