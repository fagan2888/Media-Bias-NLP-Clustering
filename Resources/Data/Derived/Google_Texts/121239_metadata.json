There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told Andrea Mitchell. \u201cI didn\u2019t really stop and think, \u2018What kind of email system will there be?\u2019 \u201c\n\nAt the same time, the former secretary of state stopped short of apologizing even after she was asked directly if she were sorry. She said instead that she wished she had \u201cmade a different choice,\u201d adding that the private server at her suburban New York home was \u201cfully aboveboard\u201d and known to government officials.\n\nSEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton\u2019s favorability ratings near low as rivals rise\n\nAfter a \u201cWomen for Hillary\u201d rally Saturday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton told reporters that her family had paid a State Department employee to assist with the private home server \u201cfor a period of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe obviously paid for those services and did so because during a period of time we continued to need his technical assistance,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nStill, the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server may be taking a toll on her poll numbers. An NBC/Marist poll released Sunday found her moving in the wrong direction, now trailing Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont in the key early primary state of New Hampshire by 41 percent to 32 percent.\n\nThe same poll found her leading Mr. Sanders in July by 10 percentage points. Similar polls in the spring showed Mrs. Clinton leading by as much as 50 percentage points.\n\nMrs. Fiorina, whose standing in the crowded GOP field is on the rise, referred to the recent revelations surrounding Bryan Pagliano, the former State Department employee and Clinton campaign tech worker, who helped her set up the home server.\n\n\u201cWe know, for example, that she hired into the State Department a political operative who had done IT work on her campaign and for her PAC, and that that IT operative was paid $5,000, not by taxpayers, but by Mrs. Clinton herself, to do IT work on that basement server,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said.\n\nAttorneys for Mr. Pagliano said last week he has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to a subpoena from the House Benghazi committee.\n\nThe NBC interview, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s first in weeks, was intended to stem some of the political bleeding she has suffered in the wake of questions over her use of her own email server to conduct government business.\n\nShe again insisted that she did not send or receive any material marked secret, saying the nearly 200 messages already released and marked classified were designated only after the fact and didn\u2019t indicate she mishandled information.\n\n\u201cThis was fully aboveboard, people knew I was using a personal email, I did it for convenience,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos, a former aide to President Bill Clinton and donor to the Clinton Foundation, said Sunday that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has entered a \u201cnew phase,\u201d which he described as, \u201cShe\u2019s coming out herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hoping to pivot after what has been a very tough summer,\u201d Mr. Stephanopoulos said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Donna Brazile, who headed up Al Gore\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign, added that, \u201cthey are going to pivot, George, because they believe that the first thing they should do is say that it was regrettable. She\u2019s said it herself. She said it was a mistake. And now beyond the contrition, they want to get back to the issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be that easy, as you know, because over the next couple of weeks, Chairman [Trey] Gowdy will continue to try to bring up more trumped-up, trivial charges against Secretary Clinton,\u201d Ms. Brazile said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Among those skeptical of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's contention that she was \"not thinking\" when she set up a private email server at her home is tech-savvy Republican Carly Fiorina.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Among those skeptical of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s contention that she was \u201cnot thinking\u201d when she set up a private email server at her home is tech-savvy Republican Carly Fiorina.", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Hillary Clinton\u2019s server explanation \u2018not plausible\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/6/carly-fiorina-hillary-clintons-server-explanation-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/9_6_2015_ap-5082776756868201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/9_6_2015_ap-5082776756868201.jpg", "description": "Among those skeptical of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's contention that she was \"not thinking\" when she set up a private email server at her home is tech-savvy Republican Carly Fiorina.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Hillary Clinton\u2019s server explanation \u2018not p"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan and Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bcc\"", "article_summary": "Among those skeptical of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s contention that she was \u201cnot thinking\u201d when she set up a private email server at her home is tech-savvy Republican Carly Fiorina.\nStill, the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server may be taking a toll on her poll numbers.\nSimilar polls in the spring showed Mrs. Clinton leading by as much as 50 percentage points.\nWe had so many problems around the world,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told Andrea Mitchell.\n\u201cThis was fully aboveboard, people knew I was using a personal email, I did it for convenience,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said."}
