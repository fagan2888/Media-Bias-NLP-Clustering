And while the movement toward medical homes might have evolved without Obama, his health reforms clearly laid the groundwork for rapid adoption.\n\nThe only problem? There\u2019s still no clear evidence that the model even works.\n\nA prominent Journal of the American Medical Association study last month found that after three years, one of the nation\u2019s largest medical home pilots didn\u2019t lead to lower costs or significantly higher care quality.\n\n\u201cThere are folks who believe the medical home is a proven intervention that doesn\u2019t even need to be tested or refined,\u201d lead study author Mark Friedberg told the Wall Street Journal\u2018s Melinda Beck. \u201cOur findings will hopefully change those views.\u201d\n\nAn accompanying editorial also sounded caution. \u201cIt is time to replace enthusiasm and promotion with scientific rigor and prudence,\u201d Thomas Schwenk wrote, \u201cand to better understand what the PCMH is and is not.\u201d\n\nHow Obamacare\u2019s Authors Wanted To Reform Payment\n\nThe medical home model is just one of a passel of payment and delivery reforms either encouraged by the Affordable Care Act or directly included in the law. Some of them aren\u2019t new concepts; the PCMH was first conceived nearly 50 years ago, and Medicare\u2019s bundled payment program draws on a successful pilot from the mid-1990s. Others were newer innovations, like the accountable care organization model first articulated by Dartmouth\u2019s Elliot Fisher in 2006.\n\nThe kitchen-sink approach to cutting costs heartened economists and would-be reformers. (\u201cEverything is in here,\u201d economist Jon Gruber said in 2009, remarking on a protean version of the ACA. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d do that they are not doing in the bill.\u201d)\n\nBut to accomplish this feat \u2014 given that lawmakers historically have resisted plans to reform health payment \u2014 many of these reforms had less bite. Participation in Medicare\u2019s bundled payment programs, for example, is optional. An independent panel to reform Medicare spending, the IPAB, may never live to see the light of day.\n\nYet hope remained that these pilot programs could lead to significant cost savings.\n\nHarvard\u2019s David Cutler was among three authors of a 2010 Commonwealth Fund brief that concluded if the ACA delivered expected cost savings, the pace of national health expenditures (NHE) growth would fall from 6.3% to 5.7%.\n\n\u201cThe new health reform law introduces a range of payment and delivery system changes likely to result in a significant slowing of health care cost growth,\u201d they concluded.\n\nHow Obamacare\u2019s Payment Reforms Are Playing Out\n\nFour years later, health spending has slowed; NHE is now projected to grow at 5.8% through 2022.\n\nAnd in some cases, researchers do credit Obamacare \u2014 whether through its interventions or merely its looming presence.\n\nFor example, bundled payments appear to be lowering the cost of devices and surgical supplies. And the ACA\u2019s program to reduce hospital readmissions is leading to real change, experts say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning that providers seem to be extremely responsive to the prices they receive,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Cutler tells California Healthline, pointing to plummeting readmissions at hospitals after new penalties took effect.\n\nBut many researchers agree that it\u2019s too soon to give the ACA the lion\u2019s share of credit.\n\nEspecially because after a much-anticipated launch, several pilots are failing to stick their landing.\n\n\u201cFor each method, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope,\u201d says Suzanne Delbanco of the Catalyst for Payment Reform, \u201cbut not a substantial body of evidence\u201d that they\u2019re actually working.\n\nFor example:\n\nMedical homes: The JAMA analysis found that the medical home pilot only improved patients\u2019 health on one of 11 measures and didn\u2019t cut visits to hospitals or emergency departments.\n\nPioneer ACOs: Thirty-two organizations opted for this much-anticipated program run by Medicare\u2019s innovation center, but by last summer, nearly one-third of participants had dropped out. And while 13 pioneers did qualify for bonuses, most were relatively meager: just four pioneers generated about two-thirds of the savings.\n\nMedicare Shared Savings Program ACOs: CMS released data last month that found most of the 114 ACOs in this program didn\u2019t beat their payment targets. In fact, only one-quarter performed strongly enough to take home a slice of savings.\n\nWhy Failure Is OK\n\nThese mixed results are to be expected, say experts. Researchers need to develop a library of evidence \u2014 through some success and perhaps many failures \u2014 to determine which practices are best and export them across the industry\n\nFor example, Cutler says he\u2019s optimistic that the new JAMA study on medical homes contains nuggets of wisdom. Rather than focus on what didn\u2019t work, \u201cwhat is it that successful medical homes did?\u201d he muses. \u201cAnd is there something we can learn that can help us to do this better\u201d at other organizations?\n\nEarly results from the ACO program, too, have cheered some supporters. They say you can truly look at it as a glass half-full, glass half-empty scenario: Nearly 50% of participants did achieve savings, which offers evidence that the model can achieve lawmakers\u2019 broader goals.\n\nAnd an independent evaluation \u2014 released several months after CMS\u2019 initial report last summer \u2014 found that Pioneer ACOs cut Medicare spending by $147 million in their first year, ahead of officials\u2019 initial estimates.\n\n\u201cFrom the standpoint of CMS, these results suggest great potential for ACOs to bend the overall cost growth curve,\u201d former National Coordinator for Health IT Farzad Mostashari and two other researchers wrote at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe fact that evidence is constantly evolving is one reason why Delbanco cautions against rushing to judgment. \u201cIt takes years to get these programs off the ground, and we\u2019re still at an early stage in many cases,\u201d she tells California Healthline. \u201cTime and time again, we might see results in year 1 [of a pilot] that aren\u2019t sustained in year 2 or year 3.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be patient on these pilots,\u201d agrees Ashish Jha of the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cThey were never going to be the magic bullet that so many people hyped them up to be.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some participants in these programs are stuck at an odd transitional point, says David Muhlestein of Leavitt Partners, who\u2019s tracked ACO adoption rates across the industry. Between Medicare\u2019s programs and private sector initiatives, \u201cthere are now 620 ACOs,\u201d Muhlestein tells California Healthline, although many are relatively small and cover less than 10,000 lives. For many providers, these ACOs represent a tentative foray from long-held fee-for-service payment models into the emerging world of value-based payment.\n\nIt\u2019s like Cinderella at the ball, Muhlestein says. Providers are inching toward the door \u2014 they know they can\u2019t stay where they are \u2014 but they\u2019re not quite ready to leave.\n\nWhat would get them to move forward? \u201cThey want to see a viable model,\u201d Muhlestein. \u201cThey want to see a model from a similar organization.\u201d\n\nThe Challenges Ahead\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that some of these pilots could lead to unintended consequences. ACOs, for example, could concentrate market power in the hands of large providers. To take advantage of bundled payments, hospitals are buying up physician practices \u2014 an expensive proposition.\n\nAnd that plays into a broader conundrum: To cut health spending in the future, the federal government and providers must spend money chasing efforts that may ultimately be wasteful, too.\n\nIt\u2019s worth the risk, experts say. Although with several years of experience, they\u2019re adopting an ever-savvier way of thinking about payment reforms now.\n\nAfter Catalyst for Payment Reform was founded in 2010, Delbanco says, leaders set a goal for the industry: to get 20% of provider payments based on value by 2020. More than three years later, that goal hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 but there\u2019s been a telling shift in how she talks about it. \u201cWe still want 20% of payments to doctors and hospitals [to] flow through methods of payment that are proven to improve the value,\u201d Delbanco now says.\n\n\u201cBecause it would be terrible if we woke up in six years to realize that 85% of payments are flowing through value-oriented methods,\u201d she adds, \u201cand they\u2019re not producing the results we hoped they would.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what else is making news on the road to reform.\n\nMcAllen, revisited: Writing at Forbes, Peter Ubel looks at the Texas town that became infamous after being featured in Atul Gawande\u2019s seminal New Yorker article, \u201cThe Cost Conundrum,\u201d and wonders if health disparities played a role in McAllen\u2019s high spending.\n\nBerwick pushes for single-payer: David Williams of the Health Business Blog posted his interview with Donald Berwick, ex-CMS administrator and current candidate for Massachusetts governor. Among other takeaways, Berwick suggests that a single-payer plan could be the solution to help control health costs in the Bay State.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To slow health spending, the federal government, dozens of payers and thousands of providers are spending time -- and money -- on pilots that ultimately may not lead anywhere.
