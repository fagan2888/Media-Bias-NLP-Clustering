It's an exciting time to be in the healthcare industry.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act brings many changes in the delivery and my job is really to position the hospital so we are able to respond to those changes in a timely manner, and in no way effect the quality of care, but at the same time work towards improving it.\"\n\nBut as Ms. Proske faces those external challenges, including billion-dollar reductions to hospitals and smaller reimbursements from insurance companies, she has promised to keep intact the ideals she had when she first entered the profession at the age of 22.\n\n\"The story is I used to baby-sit for a thoracic surgeon,\" said Ms. Proske, a 63-year-old Westerleigh resident. \"I was always sort of fascinated with what he did. I went on and became a candy striper out in a hospital on Long Island and I decided to pursue that as a career.\"\n\nMs. Proske moved to Staten Island from her native Long Island to attend Wagner College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in nursing.\n\nShe also holds a master's degree in nursing from Rutgers University.\n\nHer time at the hospital has taken her from a staff nurse to head nurse of the medical surgical unit and to head nurse of the ICU.\n\nIn 1997, she was named senior vice president of operations and chief nurse executive.\n\nIn 2007, she was appointed chief operating officer.\n\nShe takes on the new role of executive director the same way she has every position she has held at SIUH.\n\n\"I view myself as responsible for the quality of care that's delivered in the hospital and in the community,\" she said.\n\nRecently, that came into play during Hurricane Sandy and previously Hurricane Irene -- both the Ocean Breeze and Prince's Bay campuses sit in flood zones.\n\n\"We actually evacuated 100 percent of the patients during Irene,\" Ms. Proske said. \"I was the incident commander at the north site. It was quite an event. I thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\"\n\nThat was until Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\"The night the storm hit, it was surreal. The water was coming down Seaview Avenue and right up to the door of the hospital and we weren't sure if it was going to stop. It was an experience you don't recover easily from.\"\n\nOnly high-risk patients were evacuated during Sandy, mostly those on ventilators, including babies in the neonatal care unit.\n\n\"The outcomes of the patients that were evacuated and those that remained there were not impacted at all,\" Ms. Proske said.\n\nMs. Proske's plans include maintaining SIUH's presence in the community.\n\nLectures by physicians in the Regina M. McGinn, M.D., Education Center are well-attended by borough residents and a mobile unit still addresses Sandy-related health issues.\n\n\"I always say when I went into nursing school, I never aspired to be an administrator,\" Ms. Proske said.\n\n\"There are a lot of unknowns out there which makes it all the more challenging. I think that's part of what I really love about what I do -- how do I figure out what to do next.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Staten Island University Hospital names Donna Proske as its first female executive director", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Staten Island University Hospital names Donna Proske as its first female executive director \", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/staten_island_university_hospi_16.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/13746710-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11613452\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-10T16:27:09Z\", \"author\": \"Stephanie Slepian | slepian@siadvance.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "Former nurse began her career with hospital in 1972 at \"The Castle\" in Tompkinsville.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SIAdvance"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, November 10, 2013, 11:27 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.silive.com/latest_news/photo/proskejpg-f02ed3632bb8846a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sslepian\", \"author_nickname\": \"Stephanie Slepian | slepian@siadvance.com\", \"author_id\": \"2639\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Staten Island Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "Former nurse began her career with hospital in 1972 at \"The Castle\" in Tompkinsville.", "title": "Staten Island University Hospital names Donna Proske as its first female executive director", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/staten_island_university_hospi_16.html", "image": "http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/13746710-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/statenislandadvance"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, November 10, 2013, 11:27 AM", "article_author": "Stephanie Slepian | slepian@siadvance.com", "Description": "Former nurse began her career with hospital in 1972 at \"The Castle\" in Tompkinsville."}, "article_summary": "Ms. Proske moved to Staten Island from her native Long Island to attend Wagner College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in nursing.\n\"I thought you couldn't get any better than that,\" said Ms. Proske, whose lengthy career led to her appointment in September as the first female executive director of what is now Staten Island University Hospital.\n\"I always say when I went into nursing school, I never aspired to be an administrator,\" Ms. Proske said.\n\"The story is I used to baby-sit for a thoracic surgeon,\" said Ms. Proske, a 63-year-old Westerleigh resident.\nSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- When Donna Proske first started working at Staten Island Hospital in 1972, back in the building known as The Castle in Tompkinsville, the nurse's station was in a converted bathroom and there were four patients to a room."}
