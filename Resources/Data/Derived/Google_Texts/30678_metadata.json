The game finally began at 9:08 p.m., the latest start ever for a game at Folsom Field. Previously the latest start was a 2007 loss to Florida State (8:15 p.m.), but that delay was strictly because of television.\n\nSaturday\u2019s game was originally scheduled to begin at 8:07 p.m. to accommodate ESPN. It ended at 12:31 a.m. Sunday.\n\nBefore the game a moment of silence was observed for the victims of Thursday\u2019s shooting at Umpqua Community College in southwestern Oregon, which is located about 70 miles from the Oregon campus in Eugene. The Ducks wore helmet decals depicting a remembrance ribbon with the initials UCC for the school where the shootings took place. Colorado helmets bore the same decal on their helmets.\n\nOregon coach Mark Helfrich asked CU for the moment of silence.\n\n\u201cThey were very respectful of that, which I thought was a very class deal by Colorado,\u201d Helfrich said. \u201cThey were fantastic about that. Obviously our hearts and minds are there as well.\u201d\n\nAlternating QBs Oregon used two quarterbacks, Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie. Vernon Adams, who started three of Oregon\u2019s first four games but was replaced by Lockie after an ineffective start in last week\u2019s 62-20 loss to Utah, has a broken index finger on his throwing hand. He also reportedly suffers from sickle-cell trait, which can cause cramping, and that\u2019s more of a risk at altitude.\n\nLockie, who was Marcus Mariota\u2019s backup last year, started and completed 8 of 11 passes for 54 yards. Alie completed 4 of 9 for 83 yards.\n\n\u201cWe had a plan going in, and we wanted to execute that plan,\u201d Helfrich said. \u201cThey\u2019ve both done enough good things in practice last week to merit playing. We felt, looking at the game plan, we could parcel out aspects for each. We had divvied it up pretty well in our minds, unless something freaky happened.\u201d\n\nOregon runners pound CU Royce Freeman rushed for 163 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries. Taj Griffin added another 110 yards on 11 carries, including a 62-yarder.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado vs. Oregon: Lightning causes latest kickoff in Folsom Field history", "title": "Colorado vs. Oregon: Lightning causes latest kickoff in Folsom Field history", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/colorado-vs-oregon-lightning-causes-latest-kickoff-in-folsom-field-history/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_124239_CU-Football3-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_124239_CU-Football3-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-04T01:19:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:18:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1d1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey were very respectful of that, which I thought was a very class deal by Colorado,\u201d Helfrich said.\n\u201cWe had a plan going in, and we wanted to execute that plan,\u201d Helfrich said.\nWe felt, looking at the game plan, we could parcel out aspects for each.\nThe game finally began at 9:08 p.m., the latest start ever for a game at Folsom Field.\nPreviously the latest start was a 2007 loss to Florida State (8:15 p.m.), but that delay was strictly because of television."}
