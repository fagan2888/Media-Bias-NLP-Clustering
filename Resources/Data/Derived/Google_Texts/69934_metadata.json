The \u00a3160m annual costs of that scheme, designed to reduce the need for agency nurses, would be paid for from the \u00a32.5bn Time to Care NHS fund, funded in part by a mansion tax on properties worth more than \u00a32m.\n\nAs Miliband finished his speech in Salford, Andy Burnham stood up at the King\u2019s Fund, in London, to outline one of the key reforms at the heart of Labour\u2019s plans for government \u2013 a 10-year plan to merge health and care services. In one key change Labour is to pledge an end to the \u201ccrude 15-minute slots\u201d of care visits.\n\nBurnham confirmed the Labour plan to repeal the Health and Social Care Act introduced by the former health secretary Andrew Lansley and pledged to end the \u201cTory market experiment in the NHS\u201d. The \u201cpublic NHS\u201d would be cemented as the preferred provider.\n\nThe Miliband and Burnham speeches prompted Milburn to say that Labour would make a fatal mistake if it positioned itself as the party that would provide greater NHS funds without saying how it would introduce further reforms.\n\nIn an interview on The World at One, on Radio 4, Milburn warned of the dangers of repeating the mistakes of the 1992 election, when Neil Kinnock was defeated by John Major on the economy after running an emotional campaign on Tory threats to the NHS.\n\nMilburn, a close ally of Tony Blair, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a pale imitation actually of the 1992 general election campaign. Maybe it will have the same outcome, I don\u2019t know. But it would be a fatal mistake for Labour to go into this election looking as though it is the party that would better resource the NHS but not necessarily put its foot to the floor when it comes to reforming it.\u201d\n\nThe remarks by Milburn, who served as health secretary under Blair from 1999-2003, were echoed by Hutton, who sat in Blair\u2019s and Gordon Brown\u2019s cabinets from 2005-2009.\n\nHutton, a health minister between 1998 and 2005, said: \u201cI do agree with Alan on all of this. It is really important Labour doesn\u2019t just have a policy that consists of just committing to spend more on the NHS without tackling some of the fundamental things that need to be fixed in the NHS \u2013 how it becomes efficient, how it can deliver better outcomes for patients. Alan was right to speak out and make clear that sorting the NHS is not just an issue about money. The NHS is going to need very significant reforms in the years ahead if it is going to continue to serve the public interest as best as it can.\n\n\u201cWe should avoid a re-run [of 1992]. We can win the next election, we ought to win the next election. But we shouldn\u2019t imagine that there aren\u2019t some really difficult, hard choices to be made, not just about the economy, but also about the future shape of public services.\n\n\u201cLabour has got to talk about the economy and have a message about what it will do to keep the economy moving ahead. In part that\u2019s about the next five years but is also about defending our record in government.\u201d\n\nHutton took issue with the confirmation by Burnham that he would cement the \u201cpublic NHS\u201d as the preferred provider. He said: \u201cI really don\u2019t think that is where we should focus all our efforts \u2013 on another round of organisational change.\u201d\n\nBut Healey challenged Milburn\u2019s claim that Miliband and Burnham were not embracing reform. The former shadow cabinet minister said: \u201cAlan Milburn is wrong. The 10-year plan is a big reform plan. Integration of health and social care was the big reform that we didn\u2019t do in the last decade, including when Alan Milburn was health secretary, which we must do in the next decade.\n\n\u201cThe second reason why he is wrong is that Labour is where the patients are, Labour is where the public is with the serious concerns they have about the future of the NHS and the way they see it going at present.\u201d\n\nLabour did receive some good news as a ComRes/ITV News poll confirmed that the NHS, where the party leads on trust, was seen as the most important issue by voters. The NHS, on 50%, is just ahead of immigration on 49%. But voters preferred David Cameron over Ed Miliband (55% to 45%) in a straight choice for prime minister.\n\nThe interventions by Milburn and Hutton echoed Blair\u2019s recent warning that 2015 could bring an election \u201cin which a traditional leftwing party competes with a traditional rightwing party, with the traditional result\u201d.\n\nMilburn, who served as health secretary under Blair from 1999-2003, told the BBC: \u201cThere is a risk that Labour\u2019s position on the NHS becomes almost an emblem for Labour showing an unwillingness to lean into a difficult reform agenda. Look, reform is not easy. But the Labour party is not a conservative party \u2013 it should be about moving things forward, not preserving them in aspic.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest risk for Labour on health, and indeed more generally, is that we could look like we are sticking to our comfort zone but aren\u2019t prepared to strike out into territory that in the end the public know any party of government will have to strike out into. [That] is to make some difficult changes and difficult choices.\u201d\n\nAs Burnham claimed that the NHS was facing a downward spiral, the former health secretary Alan Johnson said political parties needed to be careful about their language on the NHS. Johnson, who served as health secretary under Gordon Brown from 2007-09, told the BBC: \u201cThere are risks and I know from my constituents that if you criticise the NHS in a way that the public believes is actually undermining it then you run a political risk.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson, who was succeeded by Burnham, was supportive of the shadow health secretary. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think Andy has fallen into that trap. Yes there is a danger. The benefit of having Andy there is he has been a health secretary.\u201d\n\nLiz Kendall, the shadow care minister, rejected Milburn\u2019s criticism. Kendall, who served as special adviser to Patricia Hewitt during her time as health secretary from 2005-2007, told the BBC: \u201cI have a great deal of respect for Alan Milburn. I really do. But I just think he is plain wrong on this issue. Andy today was very, very clear: doing more of the same won\u2019t work. We need major reforms to reset our health and care services so they are fit for the 21st century and fit for dealing with very old, very frail people.\u201d\n\nKendall dismissed suggestions by the Times columnist Rachel Sylvester that she was sympathetic to the Milburn criticism suggesting Labour was moving backwards on reforms. \u201cIt is not the right approach to put every single service out to tender every single time,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cThe vast bulk of NHS services are, will and must, be provided by the NHS. That is what Simon Stevens [head of NHS England] says, that is what Andy Burnham and Ed Miliband and I think. To have the government\u2019s approach, which is that every single service should go out to tender every single time, is a waste of time, money and effort.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "Alan Milburn and other critics say Labour leader needs to do more to address economy", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Nicholas Watt", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Alan Milburn and other critics say Labour leader needs to do more to address economy", "title": "Ed Miliband\u2019s NHS plans risk losing the election, say Blair supporters", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/27/miliband-nhs-plans-risk-losing-election-blair-supporters-warn", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/1/27/1422390817391/Ed-Miliband-makes-a-speec-012.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=58d02046d8ac80ac11c03b49a38e9c4d", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://politics/2015/jan/27/miliband-nhs-plans-risk-losing-election-blair-supporters-warn?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/27/miliband-nhs-plans-risk-losing-election-blair-supporters-warn", "iphone": "gnmguardian://politics/2015/jan/27/miliband-nhs-plans-risk-losing-election-blair-supporters-warn?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/1/27/1422390817391/Ed-Miliband-makes-a-speec-012.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://politics/2015/jan/27/miliband-nhs-plans-risk-losing-election-blair-supporters-warn?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Ed Miliband,Politics,General election 2015,NHS,Health,Society,UK news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-01-27T20:44:43.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaswatt", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T10:15:57.000Z", "tag": "Ed Miliband,Politics,General election 2015,NHS,Health,Society,UK news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/1/27/1422390817391/Ed-Miliband-makes-a-speec-012.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=5266b0b8d5ee2690deeda927af905267", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Ed Miliband,Politics,General election 2015,NHS,Health,Society,UK news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef6b\"", "article_summary": "But the Labour party is not a conservative party \u2013 it should be about moving things forward, not preserving them in aspic.\nThe \u201cpublic NHS\u201d would be cemented as the preferred provider.\nMilburn, a close ally of Tony Blair, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a pale imitation actually of the 1992 general election campaign.\nThat is what Simon Stevens [head of NHS England] says, that is what Andy Burnham and Ed Miliband and I think.\nIn part that\u2019s about the next five years but is also about defending our record in government.\u201dHutton took issue with the confirmation by Burnham that he would cement the \u201cpublic NHS\u201d as the preferred provider."}
