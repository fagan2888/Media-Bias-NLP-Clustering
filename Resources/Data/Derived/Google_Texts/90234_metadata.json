No, really\n\nBy Alex Kotch\n\nI\u2019m a low-income PhD student with a shaky health history and limited earning capacity. The Affordable Care Act should improve my quality of life. But will it?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the answer you tend to hear on the news, but yeah, it will. Dramatically.\n\nHere\u2019s my background. I\u2019m a 30-year-old, soon-to-be PhD graduate with an expected income in 2014, the first year of Obamacare, not much above the minimum wage. My $190-a-month student health plan runs out the day Obamacare starts. I\u2019m a nonsmoker, but I have had some serious health issues in the past. In the eyes of health insurers, I\u2019m hardly a solid bet. So Obamacare should, if it\u2019s fit for purpose, help me out of a bind when I go to change my plan. Let\u2019s see if that holds up.\n\nWhen friends heard that I was enrolling in Obamacare, they told me their own health insurance costs would rise if they signed up. They\u2019re mistaken, but that\u2019s not surprising: Media coverage has often ignored subsidies and focused on insurance premiums. Understanding the subsidies is essential to understanding how much your health care will cost. To make matters worse, states like mine (North Carolina) have stymied the work of Affordable Care Act (ACA) navigators, who are paid by state insurance exchanges or federal grants to educate people about the program.\n\nNorth Carolina alone turned away $23 million of federal money allotted to educate and assist the uninsured. It also rebuffed $4 billion allotted to expand Medicaid, and its Republican members of Congress heaped onerous paperwork requests on navigators.\n\nOnce HealthCare.gov finally began to work reliably, I started to fill in my details. Before the ACA, I would have been asked to disclose \u201cpre-existing conditions.\u201d The worse your pre-existing health conditions, the more you pay.\n\nIn fall of 2010, I suffered a life-threatening brain aneurysm rupture. While working out at the gym, I burst a central cerebral artery. I underwent major surgery at Duke Hospital, followed by two weeks in the intensive care unit. Without world-class medical care, I wouldn\u2019t be alive. I spent two weeks in the neuroscience ICU, including a week in the room where Ted Kennedy convalesced after a brain operation.\n\nJust months before my rupture, President Obama had signed the ACA into law. In pre-ACA America, having had an artery explode inside my head would have left me struggling to find any insurance company that would accept me without charging exorbitant rates. Under Obamacare, it isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nThe income section of HealthCare.gov is all-important. As a freelance writer and musician with a PhD, I estimated that I\u2019ll earn $16,800 for 2014. That\u2019s 146 percent of the national poverty level, qualifying me for very inexpensive \u201ccost sharing\u201d Silver plans. Most of my fellow musicians are there with me near the bottom of the income ladder. According to a recent study, 53 percent of musicians in the U.S. are uninsured, so the ACA could be many musicians\u2019 first health insurance in their adult lives.\n\nOn Silver plans, if your income is between 100 and 250 percent of poverty, you get reduced deductibles (what you pay before the plan kicks in to subsidize the rest). You also get reduced out-of-pocket costs such as prescription drug prices and doctor visits, as well as extremely low out-of-pocket maximums (a cumulative, annual ceiling on the amount you personally contribute to your health care).\n\nSilver plans have the second-lowest premium prices in the four-tier system. Because of my income, 94 percent of my expenses will be covered by the insurance plan and government subsidies. If my income were above 200 percent of poverty ($23,000 for the year)but below 250 percent, it would cover 73 percent of my expenses. In contrast, Bronze plans, with cheaper premiums, pay for only 80 percent of one\u2019s costs.\n\nThe cheapest Silver plan will cost me about $47 per month. Its $5 primary care doctor visits and $10 generic prescription drugs (after a $200 drug deductible) are great, but the out-of-pocket maximum of $700 is exceptional. If I have another expensive medical emergency and keep my health care within my health network, I won\u2019t pay more than $700 for the year. Also, with plans that have predetermined co-payments for doctor visits, these kick in immediately, as the deductible does not apply. A limited plan from Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas costs $53 per month, has no deductibles and offers free primary care doctor visits and $3 generic prescription drugs (but a $1,000 out-of-pocket maximum).\n\nI even qualify for a free Bronze plan and another that costs a whopping $1.89 per month, but these come with high deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, so I\u2019ll save more money if I enroll in a Silver plan. If I happened to be ideologically opposed to the ACA, I\u2019d take the free plan and forgo the penalty for remaining uninsured.\n\nEvery plan I\u2019m considering is much more affordable than the nearly $190 per month I paid this fall for my student plan. This plan has no in-network deductible, but the out-of-pocket maximum is $2,500 within the network and $3,000 out-of-network, far more than the $500 or $700 I\u2019m considering now.\n\nPut it this way: If I were to have another brain aneurysm in January 2014, my health bill for the year under the cheapest Silver plan could top out at $1,264. On my old college plan, it would be four times that.\n\nI\u2019m relatively lucky. However, in 25 U.S. states, people who fall below the poverty line ($11,490) may end up in a health care no-man\u2019s-land. Many in North Carolina are officially too poor for subsidies, yet still ineligible for Medicaid.\n\nThe Medicaid gap for those below the poverty line here in North Carolina, which refused to expand the program, is a big problem. There are 4.8 million Americans, including 319,000 in my state, who will fall into this category, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study.\n\nOne 29-year-old woman I talked with, who wished to remain anonymous, has been without work for the last year, and conservative legislators took away her unemployment benefits in July. Now, well below the poverty line and already denied unemployment benefits and food stamps, she won\u2019t be getting any help with her health insurance either.\n\nAs a single woman under 65 with no children nor a disability, she doesn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or subsidies from the health insurance exchange. Even the available catastrophic plans are more expensive than the plan she has struggled to pay for over the past three years.\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: I believe the U.S. should institute true universal health care, like nearly every other \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation on the planet. Health care is a right, not a privilege, and for-profit companies have no business deciding who deserves subsidized care and who doesn\u2019t. The ACA is a big step forward, and for those it covers, particularly those on lower incomes, it\u2019s a bigger one than I had previously thought. I\u2019ll save on health insurance premiums, doctor visit charges and prescription drug costs, so maybe I\u2019ll have a shot at making ends meet by writing articles and playing DJ sets.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde99a\"", "article_summary": "When friends heard that I was enrolling in Obamacare, they told me their own health insurance costs would rise if they signed up.\nMy $190-a-month student health plan runs out the day Obamacare starts.\nHealth care is a right, not a privilege, and for-profit companies have no business deciding who deserves subsidized care and who doesn\u2019t.\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: I believe the U.S. should institute true universal health care, like nearly every other \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation on the planet.\nIf I have another expensive medical emergency and keep my health care within my health network, I won\u2019t pay more than $700 for the year."}
