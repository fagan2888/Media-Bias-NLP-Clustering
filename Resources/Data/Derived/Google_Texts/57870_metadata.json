John Valenzuela \u2014 Staff photographer\n\nThe Kaiser Permanente pilot clinic in the Inland Empire is located at the Fontana North Target, 15272 Summit Ave., Fontana It is open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday Saturday and Sunday hours are 11 a.m. until 4 p.m.\n\nFONTANA >> Kaiser Permanente has entered into a pilot program with Target Corp. to create four Target Clinics in Southern California, which would accept a broad array of insurance plans.\n\n\u201cThe program marks a distinctive departure from Kaiser\u2019s traditional brick- and-mortar approach to delivering medical services,\u201d said Dylan Roby, who is director of the Health Economics and Evaluation Research Program at UCLA.\n\nThe program this week began a location in north Fontana and two in San Diego. A fourth will be opened Dec. 6 in Fullerton, said Dr. Paul Minardi, medical director, business management, Kaiser Permanente Southern California and Target Clinics in Southern California.\n\nThe Target Clinics will be staffed with nurse practitioners and licensed vocational nurses. Kaiser physicians will be available by telemedicine consultations.\n\nThe four pilot target clinics will treat walk-in patients and accept any health insurance plan or cash, Minardi said.\n\nBlue Shield of California is on board to cover its customers for services at the Target clinics and the partnership is in process of contracting with Medicare, Medi-Cal and other leading insurance plans, he said.\n\nAnd the clinics present existing Kaiser Permanente members with an additional convenient point of service, Mindardi said.\n\nThere will be no extra charge for Kaiser patients who elect to use the Target clinics during its weekend hours, he said.\n\nEach Target clinic location will occupies about 1,000 square feet and has two examination rooms and one consultation room, Mindardi said.\n\nRoby said the Target Clinics allow patients on other insurance plans other than Kaiser to gain exposure to the Kaiser system of medical services delivery.\n\n\u201cAnd other insurers pay Kaiser to do this,\u201d Roby said.\n\nMinardi said that was not the intent of the program.\n\nHaving spent many years as a Kaiser physician in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, Minardi said he is \u201cwell aware how underserved this region is.\u201d\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act allowing more people than ever before to have health insurance, the demand for medical services is likely to soar, he said.\n\nKaiser Permanente wanted to be part of the solution to meet the needs of the community, Mindardi said.\n\nThe pilot program will be carefully watched and perhaps modified.\n\nIf successful it will likely be rolled out across Southern California and be introduced to new regions as well, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FONTANA >> Kaiser Permanente has entered into a pilot program with Target Corp. to create four Target Clinics in Southern California, which would accept a broad array of insurance plans.\u201cThe program marks a distinctive departure fr", "title": "Kaiser Permanente moving into Target stores in pilot project", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20141119/kaiser-permanente-moving-into-target-stores-in-pilot-project", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20141119/NEWS/141119291/AR/0/AR-141119291.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "983px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Kaiser Permanente moving into Target stores in pilot project"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "FONTANA >> Kaiser Permanente has entered into a pilot program with Target Corp. to create four Target Clinics in Southern California, which would accept a broad array of insurance plans.\u201cThe program marks a distinctive departure fr", "title": "Kaiser Permanente moving into Target stores in pilot project", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20141119/kaiser-permanente-moving-into-target-stores-in-pilot-project", "image": {"src": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20141119/NEWS/141119291/AR/0/AR-141119291.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Access to medical services,Kaiser Permanente,target, Diagnosis and treatment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Access to medical services,Kaiser Permanente,target, Diagnosis and treatment"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce108\"", "article_summary": "Kaiser Permanente wanted to be part of the solution to meet the needs of the community, Mindardi said.\nThe four pilot target clinics will treat walk-in patients and accept any health insurance plan or cash, Minardi said.\nA fourth will be opened Dec. 6 in Fullerton, said Dr. Paul Minardi, medical director, business management, Kaiser Permanente Southern California and Target Clinics in Southern California.\nRoby said the Target Clinics allow patients on other insurance plans other than Kaiser to gain exposure to the Kaiser system of medical services delivery.\nAnd the clinics present existing Kaiser Permanente members with an additional convenient point of service, Mindardi said."}
