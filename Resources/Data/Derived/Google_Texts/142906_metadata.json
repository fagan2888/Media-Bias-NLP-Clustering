Three big developments\u2014the Obamacare enrollment deadline, the Paul Ryan budget, and the Supreme Court\u2019s McCutcheon decision\u2014return us to first principles, so to speak; remind us of what our two parties (and the philosophical positions behind them) are really and truly about. And they remind me, at least, of why the Republican Party, on a very basic level, can\u2019t ever be truthful with the American people about what matters to it most at the end of the day.\n\nSo what is it that matters most to the Republican Party? A lot of things do, and for different Republicans, the answer will be different: abhorrence of abortion, disgust at social relativism, hatred of big government. These things matter. But they don\u2019t, in my view, matter most. What matters most, especially to elected Republicans in Washington (that is, more so than the rank-and-file), is this: Protect the well-off from redistribution of their wealth to those who don\u2019t deserve it.\n\nOn what basis do I make this claim? Well, I\u2019ve been watching Republicans on Capitol Hill pretty closely for many years now. There are, Lord knows, a number of topics on which they are not exactly what you\u2019d call amenable to compromise. The climate-change denialism, the constant attempts to chop away at reproductive rights (which are constitutional rights), et cetera.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s fair and accurate to say that, especially in the Obama era, two issues have obsessed the party more than all the others: opposition to tax increases, especially on the wealthy; and a zeal for cutting the budget, which really means cutting domestic spending programs.\n\nIn other words\u2014protect the rich, and injure the poor. These are the points on which they\u2019ve fought tooth and nail. After all, think about this: They could have had a major concession from Obama on entitlements (chained CPI) if they\u2019d been willing to allow an income-tax increase on dollars earned above $250,000. But even that couldn\u2019t reel them in. It\u2019s true they did allow an increase on dollars earned above $450,000 (for families) in the fiscal-cliff deal, but their backs were really against the wall on that one: They relented to that small increase only because the country was hours away from a major tax increase (the expiration of the Bush tax cuts), and it was clear to everyone that the Republicans were going to shoulder most of the blame.\n\nAs for cutting the federal budget, downsizing government\u2014and we all know doing that hurts poor and working-class families most directly\u2014well, wasn\u2019t that the chief impetus behind the creation of the Tea Party? Remember Rick Santelli\u2019s creation-myth rant, about the anger at the people who took mortgages they couldn\u2019t afford. (Classic liberal-conservative divide, rooted almost entirely in psychological outlook: Liberals tended to blame the banks that hornswoggled people, while conservatives tended to blame the people who let themselves be hornswoggled.)\n\nThat\u2019s the game. Redistribution, as in loathing of. That\u2019s the glue of the Washington Republican Party. And it\u2019s wrong to think of it as just an \u201ceconomic\u201d issue. It is, to them, a moral one. Don\u2019t believe me? Take it from Arthur Brooks, head of the American Enterprise Institute, who wrote a famous Wall Street Journal column back in April 2009 headlined \u201cThe Real Culture War Is Over Capitalism.\u201d Reread that. Money, a cultural issue. Defenders of free enterprise, he wrote, \u201chave to declare that it is a moral issue to confiscate more income from the minority simply because the government can.\u201d He also charged these same defenders with the task of defining true \u201cfairness\u201d as \u201cprotecting merit and freedom.\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have to decode those two words for you, I shouldn\u2019t think.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Brooks\u2019s candor was and is rare. It wasn\u2019t a risk of any kind for him to express those views to the readers of the Journal\u2019s Op-Ed page, who would strongly agree. But most Americans don\u2019t agree. Most Americans support redistribution to one degree or another. They support progressive taxation, they support many or even most categories of government spending, and so on. We\u2014liberal Democrats, centrist Democrats, and moderate Republicans, to the extent that they exist\u2014argue about how much spending, but not about the very notion of spending. Real conservatives stand outside this conversation: They believe that virtually no redistributive spending is justified. But they know that\u2019s a highly unpopular position, so most of the time, they can\u2019t say that. They have to say other things.\n\nNow let\u2019s circle back to this week. What Republicans really think about Obamacare, as E.J. Dionne put it in The Washington Post yesterday, is that \u201cthey don\u2019t want the federal government to spend the significant sums of money needed to get everyone covered.\u201d But they know that sounds cruel, so they can\u2019t say that. So instead of inveighing against redistribution directly, they\u2019ve spent months talking about its unworkability. Well, that\u2019s been proven wrong (so far), and so now they\u2019ll just say, as they have been this week, that they don\u2019t believe the numbers. Then they\u2019ll fish out more alleged horror stories that don\u2019t check out. But they won\u2019t say what they actually think.\n\nIn the same way, Paul Ryan puts out a budget document that makes dramatic cuts on programs for poor and working people, which makes four domestic promises in the summary\u2014\u201cExpand Opportunity,\u201d \u201cStrengthen the Safety Net,\u201d \u201cSecure Seniors\u2019 Retirement,\u201d and \u201cRestore Fairness\u201d\u2014but in its numbers does the opposite. Ryan\u2019s budgets have always been first and foremost about attacking redistribution aggressively. But he can\u2019t say that. So he just says the opposite.\n\nAnd what does the McCutcheon decision have to do with all this? Very simple. Redistribution happens because redistributionist politicians have the nasty habit of getting elected. They get elected, in part, because of campaign-finance laws that limit wealthy conservatives\u2019 ability to influence outcomes. In this sense the campaign-finance reform laws of the 1970s are themselves redistributionist\u2014they were explicitly designed to level the playing field, which is a hoary clich\u00e9 but expresses a proper goal, i.e., not letting the wealthy own Congress lock, stock, and barrel.\n\nMcCutcheon tells us, to an extent that even Citizens United hadn\u2019t quite, that Chief Justice John Roberts detests this electoral redistributionism, and as Jeffrey Toobin wrote this week, has as his goal \u201cthe deregulation of American political campaigns.\u201d Roberts\u2019s opinion says: \u201cIt is not an acceptable governmental objective to \u2018level the playing field.\u2019\u201d You can\u2019t ask for it to be put more plainly than that. (Roberts doesn\u2019t face voters and has a job for life and can speak with more candor than senators.)\n\nSavagely fighting the delivery of health care to financially struggling people; slashing the federal programs that help these people get by; rigging elections so that rich conservatives (who outnumber rich liberals substantially) have more control over who wins them. These may seem disparate battles, especially the third one, but the motivation in each case is the same: Protect the well-off from redistribution of their wealth to those who don\u2019t deserve it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Paul Ryan, Republican Party, Federal Communications Commission, campaign finance law, Obamacare", "publicationDate": 201404040945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The McCutcheon decision, Paul Ryan\u2019s budget, and Obamacare deniers all say what the GOP can\u2019t: We protect the well-off from redistribution of their wealth to those who don\u2019t deserve it.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "A Most Revealing Week for Republicans", "tags": "entity:person/paul_ryan,entity:organization/republican_party,entity:organization/federal_communications_commission,entity:industryterm/campaign_finance_law,Obamacare:Industryterm", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"A Most Revealing Week for Republicans\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/04/a-most-revealing-week-for-republicans.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/04/a-most-revealing-week-for-republicans/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46553491.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/04/a-most-revealing-week-for-republicans\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-04T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Michael Tomasky\",\"tags\":[\"paul_ryan\",\"republican_party\",\"federal_communications_commission\",\"campaign_finance_law\",\"Industryterm\"]}", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Republican Party, Federal Communications Commission, campaign finance law, Obamacare", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Michael Tomasky", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-04T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/michael-tomaskyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/04/a-most-revealing-week-for-republicans", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The McCutcheon decision, Paul Ryan\u2019s budget, and Obamacare deniers all say what the GOP can\u2019t: We protect the well-off from redistribution of their wealth to those who don\u2019t deserve it.", "title": "A Most Revealing Week for Republicans", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/04/a-most-revealing-week-for-republicans.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/04/a-most-revealing-week-for-republicans/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1396604738899.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/michael-tomasky", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "If you haven\u2019t done so yet, I urge you to take three minutes here with me to reflect on this unusually revealing week.\nBut they know that\u2019s a highly unpopular position, so most of the time, they can\u2019t say that.\nBut he can\u2019t say that.\nWell, I\u2019ve been watching Republicans on Capitol Hill pretty closely for many years now.\nWell, that\u2019s been proven wrong (so far), and so now they\u2019ll just say, as they have been this week, that they don\u2019t believe the numbers."}
