And that\u2019s likely to lead to higher healthcare spending and increased charity care at hospitals.\n\nAccording to a recent report from NDD United, an alliance of more than 3,200 national, state and local organizations working to stop budget cuts to various government social services programs, federal funding for discretionary programs is severely restricted over the next decade as a result of budget caps and sequestration.\n\n[See also: Respite care programs for homeless patients provide safe discharges]\n\nBy 2023, funding for discretionary programs will be cut by more than $2 trillion relative to the inflation-adjusted 2010 funding levels, the report said. Specifically, it\u2019s estimated that 140,000 Housing Choice vouchers have been lost due to sequestration so far, prolonging homelessness and family instability, according to Morgan McDonald, MD, a physician at United Neighborhood Health Services in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nMcDonald explained that in addition to funding cuts for employment programs and affordable housing, there have also been numerous cuts to affordable daycare centers, working mom vouchers and mental health access.\n\nThe cuts to housing and employment programs may seem far removed from the healthcare industry, but there\u2019s a trickle down effect.\n\n\u201cMany people were employed before and lost their jobs with the down economy or perhaps had a medical issue and lost their disability,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cYou lose your insurance, then you lose your housing. Medical problems take over and it\u2019s even harder to get a job, and medical problems are harder to deal with when you don\u2019t have housing. Housing is really healthcare.\u201d\n\nThe impact to healthcare \u2013 hospitals in particular \u2013 is the likelihood of increased charity care.\n\n\u201cIt will put more pressure on hospitals,\u201d said Bill Foley, managing director of consulting firm Huron Healthcare. Instead of going to a clinic or a primary care physician, patients without homes or who are in strained situations may end up in the emergency department. \u201cHospitals have a policy of treating everyone that comes through the door, whether they have insurance or not.\u201d\n\nEastern Maine Healthcare Systems (EMHS), a rural healthcare system based in northern Maine, has experienced a recent increase in uncompensated care, according to Suzanne Spruce, chief communications officer at EMHS.\n\nSpruce said it's difficult to pinpoint any one reason for the increase in uncompensated care, but undoubtedly some of it can be attributed to cuts in various government programs.\n\nSince it is unlikely cuts to social services programs are going to go away, strong communication between social agencies and healthcare providers and care coordination among providers is critical to the health of these vulnerable patients and to managing healthcare costs, McDonald said.\n\n\u201cHaving the technology to access health records across the city at different healthcare agencies ensures that medical tests aren\u2019t being repeated or there aren\u2019t problems with a patient\u2019s medications,\u201d she said. \u201cCase management for the most vulnerable patients, especially in the mental health realm, is extremely important. There are high utilizers in the medical world, so to be able to have the resources to case manage these people can keep them out of the ED.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/budget-cuts-impact-hospital-charity-care", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The new budget deal passed by lawmakers last week doesn't restore funding to various government discretionary programs that support social services - such as healthcare programs for the homeless.
