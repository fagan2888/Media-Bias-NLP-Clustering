It was unclear Friday where Robinson was from, Martin said.\n\nThe shooting on Leslie Street was reported shortly before 1:30 a.m., according to North Charleston Police Department spokesman Spencer Pryor. The neighborhood is off Dorchester Road west of Interstate 526.\n\nAn initial investigation found that three men walked up to two men in the yard, started shooting and fled in a black Ford Mustang and a gray car, Pryor said. Officers found Robinson in the yard and another man walking around with a gunshot wound in a shoulder.\n\nThe three suspects were described by Pryor only as black.\n\nThe death was the 14th slaying in North Charleston\u2019s jurisdiction this year and the 68th in the tri-county area, according to The Post and Courier\u2019s homicide database.\n\nReach Dave Munday at 843-937-5553.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Coroner identifies man, 29, killed in North Charleston shooting, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, fatal shooting,North Charleston Police Department", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Investigators were canvassing a North Charleston neighborhood for leads Friday morning after a man was killed and another wounded while standing in a yard.", "title": "Coroner identifies man, 29, killed in North Charleston shooting", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151127/151129469/coroner-identifies-man-29-killed-in-north-charleston-shooting", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151127/PC16/151129469/AR/0/AR-151129469.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151127/PC16/151129469/AR/0/AR-151129469.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Investigators were canvassing a North Charleston neighborhood for leads Friday morning after a man was killed and another wounded while standing in a yard.", "title": "Coroner identifies man, 29, killed in North Charleston shooting", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151127/PC16/151129469/AR/0/AR-151129469.jpg?201511271727", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151129469}}, "keywords": "Coroner identifies man, 29, killed in North Charleston shooting , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, fatal shooting,North Charleston Police Department", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T07:03:41Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T17:27:00Z", "author": "Dave Munday"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Investigators were canvassing a North Charleston neighborhood for leads Friday morning after a man was killed and another wounded while standing in a yard."}, "article_summary": "Investigators were canvassing a North Charleston neighborhood for leads Friday morning after a man was killed and another wounded while standing in a yard.\nNorth Charleston police detectives Al Kuechler, left, and Charlie Benton compare notes near the mobile home (seen on the left) where the shooting occurred.\nThe shooting on Leslie Street was reported shortly before 1:30 a.m., according to North Charleston Police Department spokesman Spencer Pryor.\nJohn Robinson II, 29, died at the scene, Charleston County Deputy Coroner Brittney Martin said.\nOfficers found Robinson in the yard and another man walking around with a gunshot wound in a shoulder."}
