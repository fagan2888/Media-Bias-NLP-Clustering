Sen. Joe Manchin said that fellow Democrats may have an obstructionist plan in mind for the upcoming two years, but he’s not buying into it.

In fact, the West Virginia Democrat said he’s staunchly opposed.

“That’s bull[expletive],” he said, Politico reported. “I’m not going to put up with that.”

Mr. Manchin made the remarks in reference to the quietly talked-about Democratic Party plan to simply block all GOP legislation in the next two years — a strategy aimed at painting Republicans in a poor light with voters for the 2016 elections.

Several other Democrats, meanwhile, have expressed the desire to work with Republicans on such issues as the Keystone XL pipeline and the repeal of the medical device tax in Obamacare, The Blaze reported.
