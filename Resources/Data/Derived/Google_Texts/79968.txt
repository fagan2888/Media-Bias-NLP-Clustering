Last week, “Batman v Superman” director Zack Snyder tweeted a monochrome picture of Ben Affleck’s Batman costume from the upcoming film. Superfans questioned its uniqueness; after all, the previous cinematic iterations of the uniform going back to Tim Burton’s 1989 version have been similarly monochromatic. This week on his podcast, Kevin Smith, citing intimate knowledge of the project, stepped up to assuage such weighty concerns: The suit, Smith assures us, will be more akin to the uniform that Batman wore in Frank Miller’s “The Dark Knight Returns” comic book series. Translation for the non-geek: It’ll have at least two colors. Smith is likely to be only the first of many experts and prognosticators on the subject.

Today Warner Bros. revealed the full title of the film — “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” — and its promotional logo, Supe’s gilded “S” centered inside a version of the Bat’s familiar icon. The details unleashed a torrent of commentary about the title and its effectiveness — or lack thereof. Some have speculated that the use of the word “Justice” is a deliberate reference to a Justice League super-film to come soon after. (Again, translation for the non-geek: Just think “The Avengers” but with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman et al.) But other than that, there is little else that can be deduced from the title and the accompanying logo no matter how steady the trending stream of Batman v Superman and Dawn of Justice hashtags remains this afternoon. (Warner Bros. has let go info about the cast already.)

So we have a title...Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I feel bad for Superman. Batman gets top billing. pic.twitter.com/O2cGe79Gdw — Convention Scene (@conventionscene) May 21, 2014
