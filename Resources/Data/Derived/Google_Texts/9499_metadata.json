(AP) - Arkansas voters next year will decide on proposals regarding the governor\u2019s power, tax breaks for corporations and longer terms for elected county officials after the House and Senate Thursday advanced three constitutional amendments.\n\nThe Senate voted 33-0 Thursday for an amendment to change local elections. It would increase the terms of most county offices from two to four years. The definition of a provision of the constitution that could disqualify a person from holding office for a so-called \u201cinfamous crime\u201d would be narrowed so that minor offenses such as writing a bad check would be excluded and the focus of the provision would be on major crimes such as felonies or abuse of power.\n\nThe House voted 80-0 to allow the governor to retain power and duties while out of state. Proponents have said the constitution is antiquated and that modern technology allows the governor to conduct state business while abroad. It would also prevent a scenario that pitted former Gov. Mike Beebe against Lt. Gov. Mark Darr in 2013 when Darr signed a firearm bill while Beebe was out of state.\n\nThe most contentious issue was a proposal to eliminate the cap on bonds the state can issue to attract employers. It would remove the cap to the state budget on Super Project Obligation Bonds, which now is about $250 million, that lawmakers have used to attract businesses such as Big River Steel in Osceola. Supporters said it will give the state greater flexibility to create jobs and boost the economy. The proceeds for the bonds are used to finance project such as infrastructure and draw businesses to Arkansas.\n\nThat amendment, however, splintered House Republicans, some of whom called the incentives anti-free market.\n\n\u201cCorporate welfare is just wrong,\u201d said Rep. Nate Bell, R-Mena. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally wrong to take money from the taxpayers and give it to corporations.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Douglas House of North Little Rock worried that businesses aren\u2019t accountable to voters and that the state could lose money in the deals.\n\n\u201cJust to give away money in hopes things will work out great is a disaster waiting to happen,\u201d House said.\n\nRep. Dan Douglas, R-Bentonville, said the change would help create jobs and that the state could lose businesses to its neighbors.\n\n\u201cIt is repugnant we have to buy people off to come to this state but it\u2019s a fact of life,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it someone else will.\u201d\n\nThe House voted 70-22 in favor of the amendment.\n\nThe issues will ultimately be decided by the voters in November 2016.\n\n___\n\nFollow Allen Reed on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Allen_Reed", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas voters next year will decide on proposals regarding the governor's power, tax breaks for corporations and longer terms for elected county officials after the House and Senate Thursday advanced three constitutional amendments.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/2/arkansas-house-senate-advance-proposed-amendments/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Arkansas voters next year will decide on proposals regarding the governor\u2019s power, tax breaks for corporations and longer terms for elected county officials after the House and Senate Thursday advanced three constitutional amendments.", "title": "Arkansas lawmakers pass proposed constitutional amendments"}, "twitter": {"title": "Arkansas lawmakers pass proposed constitutional amendments", "description": "Arkansas voters next year will decide on proposals regarding the governor's power, tax breaks for corporations and longer terms for elected county officials after the House and Senate Thursday advance", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it someone else will.\u201dThe House voted 70-22 in favor of the amendment.\nThe House voted 80-0 to allow the governor to retain power and duties while out of state.\nThe proceeds for the bonds are used to finance project such as infrastructure and draw businesses to Arkansas.\nThe most contentious issue was a proposal to eliminate the cap on bonds the state can issue to attract employers.\n(AP) - Arkansas voters next year will decide on proposals regarding the governor\u2019s power, tax breaks for corporations and longer terms for elected county officials after the House and Senate Thursday advanced three constitutional amendments."}
