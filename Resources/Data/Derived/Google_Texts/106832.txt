Saturday was the first day Southwest offered service to and from Dallas, Texas. Southwest also added flights to St. Louis, Baltimore, and additional flights to Nashville and Houston. The first departing and arriving plane were greeted with a water cannon salute.

Wednesday, United Airlines began service out of ECP. Airport officials say the new flights and airlines were strategically added in March and so far the flights have been packed.

"We've had a quiet two months, January and February, but this month starts off our community in total with increased hotels and condo rentals, a lot more people in and the airport is a beneficiary of that," said ECP Executive Director, Parker McClellan.

ECP will also be welcoming in Silver Airways on March 19th. They will be offering instate flights to and from Orlando and Tampa.
