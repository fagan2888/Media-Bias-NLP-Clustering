As part of a U.S.-led coalition, it is fighting Islamic State in neighboring Syria and Iraq as well as Kurdish militants in its own southeast, where a 2-1/2-year ceasefire collapsed last July, triggering the worst violence since the 1990s.\n\n(Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Rockets crashed in the southeastern Turkish town of Kil", "title": "Four dead as rockets hit teachers' dormitory in Turkish border town", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/18/Two-killed-after-rockets-hit-teachers-dormitory-Turkish-border-town-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-talks_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/18/Two-killed-after-rockets-hit-teachers-dormitory-Turkish-border-town-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-talks_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Rockets crashed in the southeastern Turkish town of Kil", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Rockets crashed in the southeastern Turkish town of Kilis near the Syrian border on Monday, one of them hitting a teachers' dormitory, and four people were killed, hospital and security sources said.\nSecurity sources said that five rockets landed in Kilis, including one in an area near the state hospital, and another striking the teachers' dormitory near the town center.\nSeparately, Dogan reported that the Turkish military fired artillery into Syria after a mortar landed near an army outpost in the southern province of Hatay.\nKilis, just across the border from an area of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants, has been frequently hit by rocket fire in recent weeks, prompting the Turkish military to return fire on militant positions.\nTurkey's Dogan news agency said a Syrian national was among the dead and a child among the injured."}
