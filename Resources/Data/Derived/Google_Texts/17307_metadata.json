(ADAM LAU/NEWS SENTINEL)</p>\n\nCherokee Health Systems has received a $419,345 grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to increase access to preventive and primary care in East Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWe plan to add an entire primary-care team to our Center City office in Knoxville (2018 Western Avenue),\u201d said Bob Franko, Cherokee Health\u2019s vice president for marketing.\n\n\u201cThis will include a total of six full-time-equivalent staff including a primary care physician, a behavioral health consultant, nursing staff and community health coordinators.\u201d\n\nThat mixture of staff is part of the organization\u2019s service delivery model, which allows teams to treat the \u201cwhole person,\u201d both physically and mentally, he said, which can save 26 percent to 28 percent of costs compared with traditional approaches.\n\nThe new team will let Cherokee see an additional 1,500-1,800 patients annually. The Knoxville site normally serves about 15,000 patients per year.\n\nCurrently, Cherokee Health Systems has a staff of more than 600 employees who serve 66,300 patients annually across 13 East Tennessee counties.\n\nTennessee got a total of $7.45 million through the same program to serve an estimated 16,848 new patients statewide. Besides Cherokee, Choto Community Health Services in Vonore received $266,914; Dayspring Family Health Center in Jellico, $259,600; East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, $263,895; the Department of Health in Cookeville, $347,436; the Morgan County Health Council in Wartburg, $251,638; Mountain People\u2019s Health Councils in Huntsville, $266,242; and Rural Medical Services in Newport, $264,512; along with several organizations in Middle and West Tennessee.\n\nThe grants are part of the Health Center Expanded Services initiative using funds from the Affordable Care Act to expand services by HRSA. The awards include approximately $350 million for 1,184 health centers to increase access to services such as medical, oral, behavioral, pharmacy and vision care.\n\nNearly $150 million will be awarded to 160 health centers for facility renovation, expansion, or construction to increase patient or service capacity. The awards are projected to increase access to care for 1.4 million people nationwide.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Cherokee Health gets grant to expand services", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/business/cherokee-health-gets-grant-to-expand-services-ep-1289328816-353481901.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/cherokee_24358314_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 431}, "type": "article", "description": "Cherokee Health Systems has received a $419,345 grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to increase access to preventative and primary care in East Tennessee.", "title": "Cherokee Health gets grant to expand services"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/cherokee_24358314_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Cherokee Health Systems has received a $419,345 grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to increase access to preventative and primary care in East Tennessee.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cherokee Health gets grant to expand services"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3a94\"", "article_summary": "<p>Evan Browning, 11, receives an allergy shot from nurse Charlene Norris at Cherokee Health Center in Seymour on May 28.\nThe grants are part of the Health Center Expanded Services initiative using funds from the Affordable Care Act to expand services by HRSA.\n(ADAM LAU/NEWS SENTINEL)</p>Cherokee Health Systems has received a $419,345 grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to increase access to preventive and primary care in East Tennessee.\nCurrently, Cherokee Health Systems has a staff of more than 600 employees who serve 66,300 patients annually across 13 East Tennessee counties.\nBesides Cherokee, Choto Community Health Services in Vonore received $266,914; Dayspring Family Health Center in Jellico, $259,600; East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, $263,895; the Department of Health in Cookeville, $347,436; the Morgan County Health Council in Wartburg, $251,638; Mountain People\u2019s Health Councils in Huntsville, $266,242; and Rural Medical Services in Newport, $264,512; along with several organizations in Middle and West Tennessee."}
