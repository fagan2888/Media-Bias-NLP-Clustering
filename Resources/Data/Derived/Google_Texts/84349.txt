Most pleasant win, for me as a viewer, was Julianna Margulies for "The Good Wife." She saluted her series writers for coming up with 22 episodes a season. "Breaking Bad" and "True Detective" just did eight apiece, and "Mad Men" delivered seven. There's real divide in how cable and broadcast make the series.
