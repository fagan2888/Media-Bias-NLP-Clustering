It was a rule that affected 105 million Americans with health insurance.\n\nBefore that, the lifetime benefit in Texas had to be at least $3 million. That seems like plenty of cushion. But a new report from Sun Life Financial, the nation\u2019s largest \u201cstop-loss\u201d health insurer, makes plain that million-dollar hospital bills are not as rare as they used to be.\n\nSun Life specializes in covering self-insured companies against catastrophic losses. When someone has a severe injury or illness requiring a long hospitalization, the bills add up quickly. Anything beyond $175,000 is generally considered a catastrophic claim, though for some companies it\u2019s a lot less than that. Employers turn in such cases to a second line of insurance defense for help (to \u201cstop the losses\u201d). That\u2019s what Sun Life offers.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act phased out lifetime and annual health insurance limits between 2010 and 2014. During that period, the number of million-dollar plus claims reaching Sun Life went up 68 percent. Claims exceeding $2 million more than doubled.\n\n\u201cThat certainly shows a pretty telling trend for very large catastrophic claims,\u201d said Brad Nieland, Sun Life\u2019s vice president for stop-loss claims. \u201cCertainly, it is our belief that the provision under the Affordable Care Act that requires employers to provide unlimited benefits has had an impact.\u201d\n\nThese big claims are hospital bills. When there were lifetime caps on benefits, a patient caught in one of these hospital stays could be in considerable financial peril when the benefit ran out. Sometimes, bankruptcy followed.\n\nFrom the hospital\u2019s perspective, there was considerable uncertainty about whether those bills would get paid.\n\nCancer care\n\nNot anymore. Now that there\u2019s no ceiling on benefits for treatment of critical conditions, insurers (or, typically, self-insured employers) have to pay.\n\nThe leading cause of these catastrophic care episodes is cancer care. Between 2011 and 2014, Sun Life paid out $536 million for cancer patients.\n\nNext was end-stage kidney failure or renal disease, a condition that typically leads to intensive dialysis treatment. The average patient goes through $368,000 a year in care.\n\nBirth defects and premature births took the next two spots.\n\nOrgan transplants remain hugely expensive. The average cost of care for a heart transplant is about $550,000. A bone marrow-stem cell transplant runs about $475,000.\n\nThe billed charges are much higher. Hospitals\u2019 charges are often almost double what insurers will reimburse. Sun Life handled claims for $8.3 billion between 2011 and 2014, but payments were just $4.8 billion. The stop-loss portion of those claim payments was $2.1 billion, while employers typically picked up the difference.\n\nDrug costs\n\nWhy do these cases cost so much? Nieland didn\u2019t offer much insight.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate directly with the hospitals. We don\u2019t see all of that day to day,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the report does highlight large payments for cancer drugs. The average cost for newer medications treating advanced cancers exceeds $10,000 a month.\n\nEven insured patients can be in for a shock with these prices. Deductibles and co-payments of thousands of dollars are getting commonplace.\n\nOn Monday, the American Society of Clinical Oncologists issued a draft rating system to help doctors and patients determine the best value in cancer treatments. Drugs are rated on effectiveness, toxicity and the length of time between treatments. A numerical score is assessed, ranging from 0 to 130. Set against that is the cost of the medication, both to the insurer and the patient.\n\n\u201cPeople with cancer are about 2.5 times more likely to face bankruptcy than people without,\u201d said Dr. Richard Schilsky, the society\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cIn 2013, a study of cancer patients found cost concerns led to lower compliance with medication. Twenty percent said they took less medicine than they were prescribed. \u2026 Twenty-four percent avoided filling prescriptions altogether.\u201d\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Affordable Care Act phased out lifetime and annual health insurance limits between 2010 and 2014, the number of catastrophic loss claims reaching Sun Life Financial went up 68 percent.", "og": {"description": "As the Affordable Care Act phased out lifetime and annual health insurance limits between 2010 and 2014, the number of catastrophic loss claims reaching Sun Life Financial went up 68 percent.", "title": "Landers: Million-dollar bills for hospital care surge in U.S.", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150622-landers-million-dollar-bills-for-hospital-care-surge-in-u.s..ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-06-23T03:11:59Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-06-23T02:55:54Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Landers: Million-dollar bills for hospital care surge in U.S.\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150622-landers-million-dollar-bills-for-hospital-care-surge-in-u.s..ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2342858\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-23T02:55:54Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-23T02:55:54Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4b4c\"", "article_summary": "The leading cause of these catastrophic care episodes is cancer care.\n\u201cThat certainly shows a pretty telling trend for very large catastrophic claims,\u201d said Brad Nieland, Sun Life\u2019s vice president for stop-loss claims.\nBut a new report from Sun Life Financial, the nation\u2019s largest \u201cstop-loss\u201d health insurer, makes plain that million-dollar hospital bills are not as rare as they used to be.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Affordable Care Act prohibited lifetime and annual limits on health insurance payouts beginning in 2014.\n\u201cCertainly, it is our belief that the provision under the Affordable Care Act that requires employers to provide unlimited benefits has had an impact.\u201dThese big claims are hospital bills."}
