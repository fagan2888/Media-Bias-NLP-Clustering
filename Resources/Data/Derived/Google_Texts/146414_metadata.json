Another January, another J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference \u2014 where this year\u2019s biggest biopharma deals are just a cocktail and a handshake away. As swaths of C-suite execs descend upon San Francisco, here\u2019s an overview of some of the ideas we expect to see in motion at the conference (cattle yard) this week:\n\nSome news is obviously in store.\n\nJ.P. Morgan week is unfailingly the top biotech news week of the year \u2013 in which the biggest players either announce real news or, more often, create news in order to juice stock prices. However, the tone this year may be a bit more morose, thanks to the downtick in biotech share prices in the past several months. As Meg Tirrell of CNBC points out:\n\n\u201cSentiment will be weary, but not funeralesque,\u201d said Les Funtleyder, portfolio manager of E Squared Asset Management and author of the book \u201cHealth-Care Investing.\u201d \u201cNormally, sentiment is extremely bullish at JPMorgan, but once every few years you get a situation like this.\u201d The situation: a 23 percent decline in biotech stocks from highs in July, driven by concerns over pressure on drug prices, valuations that have been rising for six years, and some stock-crushing clinical trial setbacks toward the end of the year. The Nasdaq biotechnology index sank 9.4 percent this week through Thursday as geopolitical issues weighed on the broader market.\n\nThat said, the week\u2019s kicking off with a mystery announcement from Illumina on Sunday \u2013 in which it plans to unveil \u201ca significant breakthrough for the company and healthcare industry.\u201d\n\nTwo JPMs ago, Illumina made the somewhat erroneous announcement that it had cracked the $1,000 genome sequencing barrier. Fast-forward to today, and Illumina\u2019s grown significantly, particularly in chasing the consumer genetics market with new startup Helix.\n\nBut given this past week\u2019s news from Thermo Fisher that it plans to acquire microarray company Affymetrix for $1.3 billion, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Illumina\u2019s announcement is as sticky as its competitor. Indeed, Thermo Fisher made the move to boost its multiplexing and genetic analysis capabilities \u2014 making it more of a contender against genomics kingpin Illumina.\n\nBeyond that, we\u2019ve got wind of some exciting collaborations that are set to debut at JPM, so stay tuned. Big pharma seems to be working together \u2014 perhaps an indicator that open sourcing data could actually be possible in this industry?\n\nThe main question will remain, though: Where does the industry stand in terms of the burst biotech bubble?\n\nSome of the big news has already hit.\n\nLike that Affymetrix acquisition.\n\nCompanies often leverage J.P. Morgan week as prime time to announce major deals and partnerships. However, the week prior\u2019s been rich with dealmaking. As Ron Leuty at the San Francisco Business Times points out, some companies have indeed made big splashes purposely in advance of #JPM16.\n\n\u201cEvery biotech has its day \u2014 and many are trying to grab headlines now, before they get swept away by the tidal wave of news at next week\u2019s biotechapalooza,\u201d he writes.\n\nAnd last week was a bumper week for biotech news. Several initial public offerings filings on the docket \u2014 including, notably, CRISPR player Editas Medicine raising $100 million.\n\nA number of venture financings were announced. Alzheimer\u2019s immunotherapy startup Alector nabbed $29.5 million, New York-based Petra Pharma launched with an impressive $48 million. Diagnostics firm Guardant Health raised $100 million. Pathway Genomics brought in a $40 million Series E round, with a notable investor being IBM Watson. Xeris Pharmaceuticals raised $41 million for its new glucagon formulation. GlySens closed a $20 million Series D round.\n\nIn all of these cases, it made more sense to make their announcements in the days prior to, ah, biotechapalooza.\n\nSome newish trends will be in focus.\n\nJudging by some of the panels we\u2019re seeing at JPM and the ancillary conferences like Biotech Showcase and Startup Health Festival, some topics we\u2019ll certainly hear about include consumer genomics, the digitization of the pharmaceutical industry and tech melding with biotech, applications of the hotter technologies like CRISPR gene editing and, of course, the temperature of the venture community.\n\nAs Tirrell points out, there will be much talk about how the biotech industry will weather the recent stock downturn \u2013 last year, after all, was highly speculative over whether the biotech bubble had burst.\n\nWith a new FDA Commissioner in the fray, there will undoubtedly be much talk about changes to the regulatory process \u2013 particularly as the Food and Drug Administration has recently announced it\u2019ll crack down on diagnostics approval processes (thanks a bunch, Theranos).\n\nSome of the same old tropes will be in play.\n\nSuch as frequent comparisons of the Westin St. Francis to a cattle yard. Can\u2019t avoid those. Also, over the years there have been several guides to surviving JP Morgan HealthCon. Here\u2019s the highlight reel:\n\nAtlas Ventures\u2019 Bruce Booth\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Little White Lies told at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference\u201d is biotech investment humor at its finest:\n\n\u201cThat was a great discussion of your portfolio/company; thanks \u2013 we\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d Translation: We won\u2019t likely be in touch, at least until scheduling the [next] JPM meeting. But thanks for chatting with us.\n\nLuke Timmerman\u2019s \u201c10 Tips for Maximizing the JP Morgan Healthcare Experience\u201d remains a handy tool.\n\nMeet some new people, some old people, some random people doing cool stuff you know little about. This is about strategic networking. Part of the magic of JP Morgan is the sheer density, and diversity, of people in one place doing so many interesting things. It\u2019s a great opportunity to strengthen your network by seeking out new people you want to know, and staying in touch with people who live far away.\n\nVenture Valkyrie (and capitalist) Lisa Suennen rightly pointed out that JPM is typically a male-dominated affair, which is why she\u2019s written \u201cJP Morgan: Where the Boys are\u2026 And not the Girls.\u201d\n\nIn a field where women hold many senior positions in actual US healthcare corporations, they are drowned out at this conference by the advancing horde of finance guys in red ties and the CEOs that love them.\n\nTirrell and Timmerman\u2019s new Signal podcast on Stat News is a good overview of the event as well \u2013 outlining the evolution of JPM from its earliest days when Genentech\u2019s IPO sent 1980s investors atwitter. It\u2019s worth a listen, if you\u2019re looking for some context as to why Union Square this week is the nexus of the biotech industry.\n\nOh, and since it\u2019s such a schmooze-and-booze-fest, here\u2019s a highly handy party guide, compiled by the kind folks at MacDougall Biomedical Communications.\n\nThe end. For now.\n\n[Image courtesy of Flickr user Ryan McDonald]", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's J.P. Morgan week!
