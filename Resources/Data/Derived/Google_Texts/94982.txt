CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Interior Secretary Sally Jewell is headed to Wyoming to tour ranchlands where landowners are protecting habitat for the greater sage grouse.

Gov. Matt Mead and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe also will take part in Wednesday’s events near Pinedale.

The events will include the ceremonial signing of nine long-term, sage grouse protection plans.

Fish and Wildlife faces a court-ordered deadline next year to decide whether to protect sage grouse as a threatened or endangered species.
