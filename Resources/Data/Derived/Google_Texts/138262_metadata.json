Here\u2019s why.\n\nSince its official implementation, we\u2019ve been arguing about whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is working. In general, I agree with USC\u2019s Dr. Cary Presant and his recent ACA report card, which is worth reading.\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing missing with his opinion and nearly every other analysis out there. Almost no one is focusing on how the ACA impacts dental care, or rather, how it doesn\u2019t.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you take a closer look, you may be surprised to find that the ACA barely addresses dental at all. Herein lies my biggest concern: either no one knows that dental insurance is slighted in the legislation, or worse, they don\u2019t care.\n\nYes, the Affordable Care Act has resulted in a meaningful reduction in the number of uninsured Americans, but under the law adults do not have to be offered dental insurance. And although it must be offered for children, you don\u2019t have to buy it.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, millions have been left without dental coverage \u2013 over 100 million Americanshave no dental insurance. When we talk about a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d (definition here) dental care should be front and center.\n\nRight now, states have very little financial motivation to add dental offerings. As a result, even if you\u2019re on the side of the fence that agrees the ACA is working, it\u2019s unlikely that the increase in Medicaid enrollment has resulted in an increase in dental benefits.\n\nThe 2015 Federal Reserve Board of Governor\u2019s Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households found that dental care access has stayed alarmingly stagnant over the past decade, and socioeconomic factors often play a key role in whether you have access or not.\n\nThis has an unfortunate ripple effect as inaccessibility means people don\u2019t go to the dentist, and what would otherwise be a minor issue then becomes a major problem. The more significant the problem becomes, the larger financial and medical impact that results.\n\nA root canal alone, which is avoidable with the right preventative care, can cost nearly $1,000. When you\u2019re paying out of pocket, that number might hurt more than the procedure itself.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board report also noted that medical emergencies were the primary reason for financial hardship. Forgoing medical care due to cost has been directly correlated with income \u2013 ie., the less you make, the less preventative care you take advantage of.\n\nAs the number of people seeking dental treatment through emergency room visits increases, not having dental coverage will cost Medicaid more money in the long run. This stat always astounds me: dental-related emergency-room visits nearly doubled from 1.1 million in 2000 to 2.1 million in 2010 per the ADA (report).\n\nDid you know that oral health has direct ties to overall health?\n\nMedical issues including heart disease, diabetes, and more are impacted by oral bacteria and disease. This is not to mention the fact that your general wellbeing, confidence, and self-worth are often tied to how you feel about your smile \u2013 these qualities impact further life achievements like establishing healthy relationships and stable income.\n\nWhen you consider that tooth decay is the number one chronic disease affecting children, you can hopefully begin to see why I care so much about this topic. It\u2019s not just about today, it\u2019s about setting ourselves up for a healthier future.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: everything described here is absolutely attainable. Oral disease is largely preventable, which means that by simply brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing, and regularly visiting a dentist, many of the residual problems that result from poor dental care can be avoided in the first place.\n\nDental insurance is the other key piece of the puzzle \u2013 when you have it, you\u2019re much more likely to go to the dentist for routine care. When you don\u2019t\u2026 you get the point.\n\nRemember when I mentioned that more than 100 million people don\u2019t have dental insurance?\n\nThe unfortunate fact is that dental insurance is usually the first thing cut from everyone\u2019s budget, whether from Medicaid (link) or from employers that offer corporate benefits.\n\nDo you have dental benefits? Are you sure? And either way, have you given them much thought? Given the chain reaction that can occur when you don\u2019t have access to good dental care, I hope you will.\n\nWhether or not you think about dental benefits every day, make sure you and your family are covered, as you may end up paying dearly long term without it.\n\nFrommeyer is founder and CEO of Beam, a different kind of dental care plan for employers large and small.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The ACA barely addresses dental at all.", "description": "The ACA barely addresses dental at all.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The ACA barely addresses dental at all.", "title": "Dental care is an afterthought, and that\u2019s a big problem", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/251699-dental-care-is-an-afterthought-and-thats-a-big-problem", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/251699-dental-care-is-an-afterthought-and-thats-a-big-problem", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-24T15:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Alex Frommeyer", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-24T15:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/251699-dental-care-is-an-afterthought-and-thats-a-big-problem", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The ACA barely addresses dental at all.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dental care is an afterthought, and that\u2019s a big problem"}, "dcterms.title": "Dental care is an afterthought, and that\u2019s a big problem"}, "article_summary": "Frommeyer is founder and CEO of Beam, a different kind of dental care plan for employers large and small.\nHerein lies my biggest concern: either no one knows that dental insurance is slighted in the legislation, or worse, they don\u2019t care.\nThe fact of the matter is, millions have been left without dental coverage \u2013 over 100 million Americanshave no dental insurance.\nWhen we talk about a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d (definition here) dental care should be front and center.\nAlmost no one is focusing on how the ACA impacts dental care, or rather, how it doesn\u2019t."}
