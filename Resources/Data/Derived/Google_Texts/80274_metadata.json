Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) said full military divisions won\u2019t have to be sent to Iraq and Syria, but that it will require putting U.S. soldiers in harm's way.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt will not take divisions. But there\u2019s no way around it; American boots will be standing on sand,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans will be shot at, and they will be shooting back. There\u2019s simply no other way to do this.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Obama has already sent more than 1,000 military advisers to Iraq to counter the threat of terrorists with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn a prime-time address Wednesday night, Obama announced he would send another 475 advisers to the country.\n\nMcKeon confessed that his strategy \u201cisn\u2019t without risk\u201d but that the U.S. can\u2019t rely solely on counterterrorism efforts because it would not stop ISIS from spreading.\n\n\u201cI would much rather fight ISIL in Iraq and Syria today than fight them in Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Kurdistan tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need a comprehensive strategy \u2014 one that pins ISIL down and knocks them out,\u201d he said, using another acronym for the terrorist organization.\n\nAmerican voters have been leery of using ground troops after long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, though recent polls have shown support for more muscular actions against ISIS, which has brutally executive two American journalists.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have said ground troops should not be ruled out, but Obama in his speech insisted they would not be sent to Iraq.\n\nMcKeon was critical of Obama\u2019s approach to ISIS, arguing he had repeatedly bowed to policies and suggesting he wasn\u2019t doing enough to counter the threat.\n\n\u201cAs much as I want the president\u2019s approach to work, I believe the minimalist strategy he outlined last night will not get us there,\u201d McKeon said in a speech at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMcKeon accused Obama of allowing \u201cpolitics to limit our chances for success.\u201d\n\nHe endorsed a few pieces of Obama\u2019s plan, including acting through an international coalition; ordering more airstrikes; stepping up intelligence collection; and training and equipping moderate rebel forces in Syria.\n\nBut he said Obama\u2019s strategy should acknowledge that ISIS is \u201can immediate threat to U.S. national security.\u201d Obama\u2019s remarks Wednesday night stopped short of that, saying ISIS had the potential to threaten the homeland.\n\nThe outgoing lawmaker said the U.S. must \u201ckick ISIL hard in both Iraq and Syria\u201d simultaneously.\n\nWhile he admitted that striking militants in Syria would \u201cnot be easy,\u201d McKeon said an \u201c 'Iraq-first' or an \u2018Iraq only\u2019 approach won\u2019t work\u201d and backed the president\u2019s push to arm and train moderate Syrian forces.\n\nHe later predicted Obama's legacy would be determined on how he fights ISIS over the rest of his term.\n\n\"He needs to zero in on this,\" according to McKeon.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Full divisions aren't necessary, but \"there's no way around\" ground troops, says McKeon.", "description": "Full divisions aren't necessary, but \"there's no way around\" ground troops, says McKeon.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Matishak", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Full divisions aren't necessary, but \"there's no way around\" ground troops, says McKeon.", "title": "Republican: ISIS can't be stopped without troops on the ground", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217402-republican-isis-cant-be-stopped-without-ground-troops", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-11T11:33:35-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-09-11T11:33-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217402-republican-isis-cant-be-stopped-without-ground-troops", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-11T10:27-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,Buck McKeon, Barack Obama,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-11T10:27:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-11T11:33:35-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217402-republican-isis-cant-be-stopped-without-ground-troops", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Full divisions aren't necessary, but \"there's no way around\" ground troops, says McKeon.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republican: ISIS can't be stopped without troops on the ground"}, "dcterms.title": "Republican: ISIS can't be stopped without troops on the ground"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb03c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI would much rather fight ISIL in Iraq and Syria today than fight them in Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Kurdistan tomorrow,\u201d he said.\nIn a prime-time address Wednesday night, Obama announced he would send another 475 advisers to the country.\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have said ground troops should not be ruled out, but Obama in his speech insisted they would not be sent to Iraq.\nBut he said Obama\u2019s strategy should acknowledge that ISIS is \u201can immediate threat to U.S. national security.\u201d Obama\u2019s remarks Wednesday night stopped short of that, saying ISIS had the potential to threaten the homeland.\nThe Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday said U.S. ground troops will be required to meet President Obama\u2019s objective of destroying Islamic State terrorists."}
