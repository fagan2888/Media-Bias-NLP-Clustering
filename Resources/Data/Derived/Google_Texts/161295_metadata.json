(REUTERS/Larry Downing)\n\n3952446\n\nObamacare could lead more people enrolling in assistance programs, like food stamps, cash assistance and childcare.\n\nObamacare\u2019s individual mandate \u2014 which compels more people to seek out health insurance \u2014 paired with the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare has created a perfect storm for an increase in low-income assistance program participation, Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 Senate Budget Committee staff explained to The Daily Caller this week.\n\n\u201cMany states use an online system to streamline the enrollment process for low-income assistance programs. After entering some information about your family structure and financial resources, these systems guide individuals through an application for a series of programs, Medicaid and [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps] included,\u201d the staffers explained. Once people learn they are eligible for a program, they are more likely to enroll.\n\nIndividuals who enroll in Medicaid are not automatically eligible for other programs. However, their lower income levels make them more likely to be eligible for other assistance programs.\n\nThe Obama administration is aware that the president\u2019s signature law could lead to more food stamp participation \u2014 with the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently seeking a review from the Office of Management and Budget on \u201ca new information data collection to access the impact of implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program operations and participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cACA could potentially have a profound impact on SNAP participation among [nondisabled adults aged 19 to 64] in many ways,\u201d FNS\u2019 submission for review reads. \u201cThe main research objectives for this study are grouped into the following three categories: (1) Describe the coordination of SNAP and Medicaid enrollment and renewal processes in the state and whether this changes due to ACA; (2) Describe the process of directing Medicaid applicants to SNAP; and (3) Determine the impact of ACA implementation on the number of SNAP applications.\u201d\n\nPolitico first reported about the administration\u2019s interest in the intersection of Obamacare and SNAP on Tuesday, highlighting Greg Miller, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who is currently researching the effects Obamacare will have on food stamp participation on behalf of the USDA.\n\nMiller told Politico that his study could find enrollment in some states increase by as much as five percent as low-income people learn of their eligibility and enroll \u2014 small percentage to be sure, but for a nearly $80 billion a year program, small percentages can mean big bucks.\n\nTo Miller, however, \u201cthis is a favorable byproduct of the Affordable Care Act, bringing people into federal programs which they are already eligible for,\u201d he told Politico.\n\nAnd according to Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, it is not just SNAP but also other assistance programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, child care and energy assistance that people signing up for Medicaid could be offered.\n\n\u201cThis is one more policy that will replace middle class growth with welfare growth. It is one more example of why you don\u2019t pass a 2,700 page government takeover to find out what\u2019s in it,\u201d Stephen Miller the Senate Budget Committee\u2019s GOP spokesman said. \u201cAnd it is one more reason why Obamacare\u2019s promised price tag isn\u2019t even close to its bleak reality.\u201d\n\nA USDA spokesperson stressed to TheDC that the ACA does not change eligibility for SNAP.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not change the eligibility requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),\u201d the spokesperson explained in an emailed statement. \u201cPeople who are enrolled in Medicaid are not automatically eligible for the program. Any change in SNAP participation would be the result of low-income families, who have met rigorous eligibility requirements, making an informed decision to participate.\u201d\n\nParticipation in the food stamp program, along with the cost, has skyrocketed in recent years, from an average monthly individual participation rate of 28.2 million in 2008 to 46.6 million in 2012.\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "Obamacare could lead more people to enroll in welfare programs, like food stamps, cash assistance, and childcare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare could lead more people enrolling in assistance programs, like food stamps, cash assistance and childcare.
