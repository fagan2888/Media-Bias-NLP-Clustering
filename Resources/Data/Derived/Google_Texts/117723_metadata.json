For a couple with three children, the penalty can range from $285 to $12,240.\n\nPenalties are steeper next year and beyond. But on this year\u2019s returns, filers merely have to check a box that they have minimal essential coverage that meets ACA standards.\n\nFew submissions required\n\nOnly the 69,221 Oklahomans who bought insurance on the exchange last year are required to submit forms, including Form 1095-A issued from the exchange and any forms for underestimating or overestimating their 2014 income for the tax credits that 79 percent received. Also, those taxpayers who choose to claim one of 33 exemptions to the requirement to carry insurance must file Form 8965.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service estimates three of four filers legitimately should be able to check the box. Most individual health plans and employer-plans, along with Medicare and Medicaid meet standards, officials say.\n\nConfusion reigns\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma City tax professionals say many area consumers are more than confused about the new tax penalty.\n\nRex Lykins of H&R Block said his office is fielding three to four calls a day.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking how it will impact their taxes. But there\u2019s no blanket answer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t compute the penalty unless we know who in their family, including their spouse and dependents, have coverage and who doesn\u2019t, and what their household income is.\u201d\n\nTax prep fees vary with the complexity of returns, Lykins said. Each additional form is an additional cost, he said.\n\nACA uncertainty\n\nMidwest City enrolled agent Sean Reed said the biggest confusion is about the ACA itself.\n\n\u201cSurveys show only two in 10 people know what it is, but 8 in 10 know Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking due diligence measures, Reed is asking his customers, for his own office files, to sign and date additional forms verifying they have insurance.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re randomly audited, I don\u2019t want them to scream their tax preparer did this,\u201d Reed said.\n\nMost unaffected\n\nEdmond certified professional accountant Mike Bell estimates the health insurance verification will add five to 10 minutes to every return preparation, but he said most of his clientele won\u2019t be affected.\n\nBell said he has talked with some adult children of clients, who\u2019ve \u201cdone the math\u201d and are opting to go without insurance and pay the penalty because it\u2019s less than the premiums for bronze plans on the exchange.\n\n\u201cThey figure they\u2019re healthy now and will buy it when and if they need it,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s true that with the new ACA laws, sick consumers can\u2019t be denied health insurance or charged higher premiums because of pre-existing conditions, said Leah-Anne Janway, Oklahoma City independent agent.\n\n\u201cBut, with few exceptions, they (those opting to go without coverage) would have to wait until the next enrollment period to get it,\u201d she said. The rules are the same for insurance bought on or off the exchange, Janway said.\n\nCoverage \u2018worthless\u2019\n\nKevin Hughes, 57, of Oklahoma City, has decided to go uninsured this year after the health insurance he bought on the exchange last year failed to cover $5,000 in heart tests for his wife. Before benefits kicked in for her, she had to meet a $6,000 deductible, to which premiums and co-pays didn\u2019t apply, he said.\n\n\u201cThe coverage was worthless,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObamacare is a farce except for those at or below the poverty level,\u201d Hughes said. He said a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan for him and his wife would cost them $432 monthly with a deductible of $12,700, which he said amounts to 31 percent of his gross income at a small machine shop. His wife stays home with their adopted daughters, who because of special needs are insured through Medicaid.\n\nHughes said the new mandate gives unfair preferential treatment to federal employees. He said the same plan he considered buying on the exchange is offered to federal employees for $426 a month with a family deductible of only $700.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Additional forms are required only for taxpayers who bought insurance on the exchange last year and for those filing exemptions to the new law.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
