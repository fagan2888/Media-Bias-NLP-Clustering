After Schobert questioned whether the health risk assessment was voluntary and whether the medical information obtained would be kept confidential, Orion managers told Schobert not to share her qualms with co-workers and to quash any potential \u201cattitude\u201d about the wellness program, the EEOC alleged.\n\nOrion violated the ADA because the medical exam and disability-related inquiries connected with its wellness program weren't \u201cvoluntary,\u201d the EEOC alleged. By subjecting Schobert to about $463 per month in financial penalties and subsequently firing her, Orion rendered the wellness program involuntary and therefore not compliant with the ADA, the EEOC alleged.\n\n\u2018Voluntary' Programs Permitted\n\nIn a January 2013 informal agency discussion letter, the EEOC said medical inquiries and exams connected to voluntary wellness programs are permissible under the ADA, and that \u201cvoluntary\u201d means the employer neither requires participation nor penalizes employees who don't participate. But the EEOC cautioned that its letter wasn't an official agency opinion.\n\n\u201cEmployers certainly may have voluntary wellness programs,\u201d said John Hendrickson, EEOC's regional attorney in Chicago. \u201cBut they actually have to be voluntary. They can't compel participation by imposing enormous penalties such as shifting 100 percent of the premium cost for health benefits onto the back of the employee or by just firing the employee who chooses not to participate.\u201d\n\nIn its 2010 final regulations under GINA, the EEOC said a wellness program can be voluntary even if employers offer limited financial incentives or rewards for participation provided they don't penalize employees who opt not to participate.\n\n\u201cEmployers certainly may have voluntary wellness programs\u2014there's no dispute about that\u2014and many see such programs as a positive development,\u201d said John Hendrickson, the EEOC regional attorney in Chicago.\n\n\u201cBut they actually have to be voluntary. They can't compel participation by imposing enormous penalties such as shifting 100 percent of the premium cost for health benefits onto the back of the employee or by just firing the employee who chooses not to participate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving to choose between responding to medical exams and inquiries\u2014which are not job-related\u2014in a wellness program, on the one hand, or being fired, on the other hand, is no choice at all,\u201d Hendrickson said in an Aug. 20 statement.\n\nOrion didn't respond to Bloomberg BNA's Aug. 22 request for comment on the suit.\n\nThe case has been assigned to Judge William C. Griesbach.\n\nLaurie A. Vasichek of the EEOC's Minneapolis office represents the agency. No attorney entered a court appearance for Orion as of Aug. 22.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kevin McGowan in Washington at kmcgowan@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan J.
