In fact, it was on Dec. 7, 2012, when shares were trading near $33.50. As one of the nation\u2019s largest health care service providers, I expected HCA to benefit from the reelection of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEven though Obamacare has been challenged since then, and continues to be, HCA\u2019s excellent management supports higher prices. The stock is a great example of why investors should buy good quality, well-managed companies \u2014 and hold on to them. Readers who took my advice to buy HCA as a \u201ccornerstone holding in the health care industry\u201d are sitting on 85% gains.\n\nS&P estimates earnings per share will increase to $4.15 in 2014, up from $3.37 in 2013, due to \u201csuperior economies of scale and improving admission trends.\u201d Its analysts raised their 12-month price target by $10 to $68 on July 16, following upwardly revised 2014 guidance by management.\n\nThat announcement resulted in a breakout from the gradual bull channel that began in January, and a bullish flag breakout on very high volume. The breakouts were supported by a strong MACD buy signal. The trading target for HCA is $70, but long-term investors could achieve much higher returns by holding.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Add HCA Holdings (HCA) to your portfolio as a cornerstone holding in the health care sector.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "InvestorPlace", "description": "Add HCA Holdings (HCA) to your portfolio as a cornerstone holding in the health care sector.", "title": "Trade of the Day - HCA Holdings (HCA) | InvestorPlace", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chart-key-300x84.gif", "updated_time": "2014-07-23T19:16:09-04:00", "url": "http://investorplace.com/2014/07/trade-day-hca-holdings-hca/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Add HCA Holdings (HCA) to your portfolio as a cornerstone holding in the health care sector.", "creator": "@InvestorPlace", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/07-23-14-hca-300x196.jpg", "title": "Trade of the Day - HCA Holdings (HCA) | InvestorPlace", "site": "@InvestorPlace", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002035369734}, "yandex-verification": "7449d54f0a1869d7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/investorplace", "section": "Trading Advice", "published_time": "2014-07-24T01:23:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-23T19:16:09-04:00"}, "keywords": "Markets, trade of the day, stocks to buy, HCA Holdings, hca stock, hca", "google-site-verification": "5MtKaaO4K0OK-C2y-n9MKUc_WzF9GSkH0fLgruR0TKM", "pubdate": 20140724, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "markets, trade of the day, stocks to buy, hca holdings, hca stock, hca"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea3e\"", "article_summary": "HCA Holdings (HCA) \u2014 It\u2019s been a long time since I reviewed this health care stock.\nReaders who took my advice to buy HCA as a \u201ccornerstone holding in the health care industry\u201d are sitting on 85% gains.\nThe trading target for HCA is $70, but long-term investors could achieve much higher returns by holding.\nAs one of the nation\u2019s largest health care service providers, I expected HCA to benefit from the reelection of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act.\nThe stock is a great example of why investors should buy good quality, well-managed companies \u2014 and hold on to them."}
