MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — From the first GOP debate Thursday night to the latest in the Tennessee theater shooting, here are the four stories to know for Thursday, Aug. 6.

GOP DEBATE

Ten Republican presidential hopefuls share the stage tonight in Ohio for the first moderated primetime debate.

Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and seven others are expected to discuss foreign policy, Obamacare, and rival Hillary Clinton.

The main debate starts at 8 p.m. while a secondary debate, made up of the seven candidates whose poll numbers weren’t high enough to make the top 10, starts at 4 p.m.

TENNESSEE THEATER SHOOTING

Police in Tennessee are searching for a motive after a man stormed a movie theater in suburban Nashville, Tennessee.

A SWAT team shot and killed 29-year-old Vincente Montano after he blasted movie goers with pepper spray and cut one man with a hatchet.

Police say Montano had been committed for mental issues four times in the past.

This theater attack comes less than two weeks after a deadly theater shooting in Louisiana.

WINTER CLASSIC

Start saving up for some outdoor hockey! The NHL has unveiled the 2016 Winter Classic.

The league’s signature outdoor game will pin the Minnesota Wild against the Chicago Blackhawks at TCF Bank Stadium on Feb. 21, 2016.

Ticket costs will run about $100 to $450. But that also gets you a ticket to the special alumni game featuring past Wild, Blackhawks and Minnesota North Star greats.

The ticket sales date hasn’t been announced yet.

JON STEWART’S LAST SHOW

Jon Stewart hosts the ‘Daily Show’ for the last time Thursday night.

Stewart’s 16-year run on the “fake news” show jump-started the careers of correspondents Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver.

South African comedian Trevor Noah is set to take over as new host on Sept. 28.

And while Stewart’s run may be ending, the show’s iconic set will live on in Washington D.C.’s Newseum.
