Donald Trump made a complete break from reality in his New Hampshire victory speech by declaring that the unemployment numbers are a lie, and unemployment is really 42%.

Trump said, “I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. Remember that. Don’t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number is probably 28-29 as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently the number may be as high as 42%. Do you think we’d have a gathering like? If we had 5% unemployment, do you think we’d have gatherings like this?”

Donald Trump also proclaimed that the American people are miserable with Obamacare, and generally gave a speech that was full of empty self-hype, paranoia, and delusion. In other words, it was a typical Donald Trump speech. It is easy to brush off Trump as just another paranoid loon, but this paranoid loon just won the New Hampshire Republican primary and is leading the delegate count for the nomination.

Trump is a symptom of the larger Republican disease. Donald Trump can call the unemployment numbers fake because Republicans no longer believe in facts. If Republicans disagree with a fact, they proclaim that the fact isn’t real.

The man who could be the Republican nominee thinks that branch of the federal government that he wants to lead is cooking the books on unemployment. Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and the former Grand Old Party is completely unhinged from reality.
