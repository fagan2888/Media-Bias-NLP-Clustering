GOP shut out of Obamacare briefing

House Republicans say they’re being left out of an Obamacare briefing from a White House officials who are coming to the Hill to brief Democratic allies on Wednesday.

Mike Hash, who leads the HHS Office of Health Reform, is scheduled to brief Democrats on implementation of the law at the Democrats’ weekly caucus meeting.

Upon hearing the news, Republicans requested a similar briefing with Obama administration officials.

“Far too much information about Obamacare’s rollout is being concealed from the public,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, who chided Democrats for not including Republicans. “This snub is all the more offensive after Secretary Sebelius declined to testify at a House hearing this week. It’s time for the Obama administration to honor its promises of transparency and face some accountability.”

House Democrats requested the meeting with Hash.

“For months now, House Democrats have held briefings on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and tomorrow’s Caucus meeting is yet another in this series of discussions,” said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. “While we appreciate House Republicans’ newfound interest in the implementation of health reform, it is clear they are not interested in anything other than continuing their desperate drive to sabotage this law, which so far has included shutting down the government.”
