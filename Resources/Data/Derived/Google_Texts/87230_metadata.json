He almost seems to be reinventing politics in a way that makes both major parties seem hidebound, sluggish and concerned mostly with self-perpetuation \u2014 which, in fact, they are.\n\nWhen he announced his candidacy, no one outside of Trump\u2019s household dreamed he would be dominating the Republican field with three weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses. Given the way he has set the agenda for the campaign, it\u2019s tempting to call him a master strategist \u2014 except I don\u2019t believe he has a strategy. Or needs one.\n\nInstead, Trump is guided by instinct. The whole campaign has been like his stream-of-consciousness Twitter feed or his improvisational jazz-riff campaign speeches. He tests a new theme and gauges the response. If it\u2019s working, he pushes harder; if not, he moves on. Kick out the illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border. Bar Muslims from entry because they might be terrorists. Abolish gun-free zones, even in schools.\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s positions are abhorrent. Many are inconsistent with traditional American values, Republican Party dogma, various articles of the Constitution and Trump\u2019s own views in the past. But substance is, in a way, less important than style. Trump couldn\u2019t possibly do half of what he promises, and probably doesn\u2019t really want to do much of the rest.\n\nThe important thing is that Trump, by being transgressive in the way he speaks, gives listeners the license to be transgressive in the way they think. When he rails against \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d he\u2019s talking about the manners and courtesies that many of us would call being \u201ccivil.\u201d But his in-your-face bullying strikes a chord with the large segment of the Republican electorate that is tired of being polite: middle-class, non-college-educated white voters who have not prospered over the past two decades and see demographic change as a threat.\n\nTrump was quick to understand how angry the Republican base is with the party establishment. Vote for us, GOP leaders said, and we\u2019ll stop illegal immigration, repeal the Affordable Care Act, slash spending to the bone, reduce the long-term federal debt and basically stop everything President Barack Obama is trying to do. They failed to deliver \u2014 and now someone is calling them on it.\n\nFor Trump, saying outrageous things that would end any other politician\u2019s campaign or career is no risk. On the contrary, it\u2019s a necessity. His appeal to primary voters involves a bald-faced appeal to racial and ethnic animus; he gives his supporters permission to bemoan the fact that \u201cthey\u201d \u2014 Mexicans and Muslims, primarily, but also blacks and uppity women \u2014 are changing the nation.\n\nTrump\u2019s arena-size rallies have become set pieces in which big, boisterous crowds get to act out their \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d fantasies. If protesters didn\u2019t show up to advocate the Black Lives Matter movement or tolerance toward Muslims, Trump would have to hire actors to play those parts. Antagonists are necessary for the moments of catharsis when interlopers are identified, scorned and physically ejected. It is theater, not politics, a symbolic enactment of the grand purification Trump promises.\n\nThe other candidate touching a nerve with the cultural and economic left-behinds \u2014 minus the racism \u2014 is Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, who is also kind of an un-politician. This is a bad year to rule anything out, so maybe Sanders will win both Iowa and New Hampshire and go on to seriously challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. But if he falls short, the eventual GOP nominee will face a formidable and experienced politician who cannot possibly run as anti-establishment.\n\nIf the Republican nominee is Trump, do you believe for a minute he would consider himself bound by the things he said during the primaries? I don\u2019t.\n\nTrump can hardly back away from his categorical pledge on immigration \u2014 to expel 11 million undocumented migrants and build a wall along the border with Mexico \u2014 so maybe that would energize Latino voters in support of Clinton. But he would do everything possible to lower passions among other loyal Democrats \u2014 while stoking them among the new \u201ctake back the country\u201d voters he hopes to turn out.\n\nHow disgusted is the country with traditional politics and politicians? Democrats had better explore that question \u2014 or be surprised by the answer.\n\nEugene Robinson is a columnist for The Washington Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For Democrats who might be rooting for Donald Trump, thinking he would be easy to beat in November, I have some advice: Be careful what you wish for.", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "For Democrats who might be rooting for Donald Trump, thinking he would be easy to beat in November, I have some advice: Be careful what you wish for.", "title": "Trump is toxic for both major parties", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2016/jan/17/trump-is-toxic-for-both-major-parties/", "image": "http://asset.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/sun-app-large.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "site": "@LasVegasSun"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T02:00"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "article_summary": "If protesters didn\u2019t show up to advocate the Black Lives Matter movement or tolerance toward Muslims, Trump would have to hire actors to play those parts.\nIn his campaign, or rampage, Trump has done more than take a sledgehammer to the Republican Party.\nHe almost seems to be reinventing politics in a way that makes both major parties seem hidebound, sluggish and concerned mostly with self-perpetuation \u2014 which, in fact, they are.\nMany are inconsistent with traditional American values, Republican Party dogma, various articles of the Constitution and Trump\u2019s own views in the past.\nTrump couldn\u2019t possibly do half of what he promises, and probably doesn\u2019t really want to do much of the rest."}
