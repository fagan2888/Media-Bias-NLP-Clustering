The award is to be handed out in New York on May 9.\n\n\u201cThomas Roberts isn\u2019t afraid to put a spotlight on injustices faced by LGBT people that all too often go unreported,\u201d said GLAAD president & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. \u201cAs a journalist and anchor who reaches millions of viewers, he bring stories to national attention, leading the conversation and accelerating acceptance of the LGBT community.\u201d\n\nRoberts has spoken out publicly against anti-LGBT laws in Russia, and this year walked with fellow NBC employees as the first LGBT group admitted to walk in the New York St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve reached a tipping point and these are stories we see more commonly discussed and covered,\u201d Roberts told TVNewser. \u201cHowever, it all starts at home. It begins when LGBTI people speak up for their authentic selves. The ignition switch has been flipped and we will keep seeing honest conversation about how LGBTI people are woven importantly into the world fabric.\u201d\n\nThe Vito Russo Award, named for a co-founder of GLAAD, has previously gone to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, and celebrities including George Takei, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Tom Ford, Ricky Martin and Cynthia Nixon.\n\nIf all those folks were gathered at one cocktail party, we asked Roberts, who would he talk to first? \u201cI would talk to Anderson first because I\u2019ve known him the longest both personally and professionally. And then I\u2019d say can you introduce me to Ricky.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://adweek.it/1O95O5T", "image": "http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/04/thomas-roberts.jpg", "description": "\"Thomas Roberts isn't afraid to put a spotlight on injustices faced by LGBT people that all too often go unreported.\"", "title": "First on TVNewser: GLAAD to Honor MSNBC\u2019s Thomas Roberts"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wp-content/images/tvnewser/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf2d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think we\u2019ve reached a tipping point and these are stories we see more commonly discussed and covered,\u201d Roberts told TVNewser.\n\u201cThomas Roberts isn\u2019t afraid to put a spotlight on injustices faced by LGBT people that all too often go unreported,\u201d said GLAAD president & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis.\nFIRST ON TVNEWSER: GLAAD will announce this morning that the group has chosen MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts for the group\u2019s Vito Russo Award, given to an \u201cout LGBT media professional who has made a significant difference in promoting equality for the LGBT community.\nIf all those folks were gathered at one cocktail party, we asked Roberts, who would he talk to first?\nThe award is to be handed out in New York on May 9."}
