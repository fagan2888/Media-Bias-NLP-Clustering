NOBSA, Colombia (AP) — It was a not so baaad performance for Colombia’s wooly warriors.

To celebrate the country’s return to the World Cup after a 16-year absence, artisans in the high Andean town of Nobsa put on what they billed as the first soccer match played by sheep Sunday.

On one side, dressed in specially made yellow jerseys and red shorts for Colombia’s national colors, were 10 four-legged players each named in honor of one of the country’s top soccer talents. Their rivals represented powerhouse Brazil, which hosts the monthlong tournament beginning June 12.

Some 500 beer-soused spectators cheered on the farmyard footballers, which were trained for two weeks to recognize and kick a foam soccer ball through a rustic goalpost made of wooden logs.

The hard work was little in evidence, though. Sheep are highly social animals, seeking safety from predators in large herds, and their shepherd handlers had to keep pulling on ropes tied to the animals’ necks to keep the bleating players scattered and moving so they wouldn’t end up munching lazily on what grass remained on the improvised pitch.
