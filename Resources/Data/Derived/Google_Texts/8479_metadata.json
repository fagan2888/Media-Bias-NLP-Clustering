Irwin stressed the importance of keeping the issue at the forefront of pubic discussion and fighting misinformation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will only help \u2013 it will not hurt,\u201d said Jeremiah Group member Dr. Torin Sanders, of the expansion. \u201cIt will bring money. It will bring jobs. But more than that it will keep people from dying.\u201d\n\n\n\nCouncilmember Latoya Cantrell joined the group on the trip. Cantrell noted the high rates of HIV and AIDS in Baton Rouge and New Orleans \u2013 some of the highest rates in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need health care for all people,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cPeople deserve that. This is about saving lives. This is about making the city and state healthy. It\u2019s time for Louisiana to be at the top instead of the bottom.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Jeremiah Group\u2019s letter lists several facts, including that Louisiana has the second highest rate of uninsured residents in the country, and some of the nation\u2019s highest rates of diabetes, cancer, infectious disease, preventable hospitalizations, low infant birth weight and premature death.\n\n\n\nThe letter also reminds Jindal that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion for the first three years and 90 percent of the cost after 10 years: \u201cThe state of Louisiana will SAVE money by accepting Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is tantamount to killing people,\u201d said community activist Barbara Major. \u201cThe poor and most vulnerable are being thrown away.\u201d Major chided Jindal for his \u201clack of humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nJacqueline Jones, executive director and lead organizer for the Jeremiah Group, said that Friday\u2019s trip to Baton Rouge is just one step. \u201cThe work is just beginning,\u201d Jones said. She described the group\u2019s plans for a massive voter registration drive followed by delivering voters to the polls for the 2015 gubernatorial election.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Obama, it\u2019s about the care,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernor Jindal,\u201d the letter concludes, \u201cyou have the opportunity to save thousands of lives by accepting Medicaid Expansion for the State of Louisiana.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "louisianna, jindal, expand medicaid, activists, healthcare, new orleans, aca, reform, politics", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
