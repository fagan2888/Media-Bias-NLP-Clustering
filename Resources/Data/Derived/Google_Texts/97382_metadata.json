However, current trends suggest that the increase in spending growth from these changes may well be transitory.\u201d\n\nHealthcare expenditures increased because individuals who were under- or uninsured before ACA were able to obtain quality healthcare insurance coverage and greater access to care. HHS reports that the slight increase in spending will moderate over time as the initial demand for health insurance under ACA subsides.\n\nFederal programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, benefitted from the period of slight growth, HHS reports.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014, Medicare spent $473.1 billion less on personal healthcare expenditures compared to what it would have spent under the 2000 to 2008 average growth rate.\n\n\u201cUsing data from the Treasury Department on Medicare benefit outlays in 2015, we estimate that per enrollee spending growth will continue to be low at around 1 percent, leading to a cumulative reduction in spending of approximately $648.6 billion between 2009 and 2015,\u201d HHS reports.\n\n\u201cTo put this in context, this reduction in spending represents an amount that is greater than total Medicare spending on personal health expenditures in 2015.\u201d\n\nIn addition, HHS found that hospital outpatient and ambulatory service growth was higher than inpatient spending growth.\n\nThe growth trends reflect the shift to outpatient settings for care and the transition to value-based payment policies, such as the Hospital Readmissions Reduction program.\n\nPrivate insurance spending per personal also increased by 2.9 percent in 2014.\n\nHHS stated that this growth rate is also transitory because ACA reforms granted more access to quality care for individuals with private insurance plans.\n\n\u201cNotably, the 2014 coverage year was the first year in which the Affordable Care Act\u2019s most important reforms to the individual (and small group) markets were in place,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThese reforms increased the comprehensiveness of benefit packages available to consumers and eliminated barriers to coverage, such as pre-existing condition exclusions.\u201d\n\nAnother factor in growth rate increases was the introduction of specialty drugs in 2014, such as Hepatitis C and anti-cholesterol prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cThe prescription drug spending growth rate for traditional Medicare would have remained the same in 2014 and 2013 in the absence of new Hepatitis C drugs, but instead increased by 4.5 percentage points,\u201d HHS wrote.\n\nIn 2014, prescription drug spending was 56 percent of Medicare spending growth per enrollee. For private insurance, it accounted for 47 percent of spending growth per person.\n\nHowever, while prescription drug spending was high in 2014 for both federal and private insurance programs, the increase represented only 2 percent of total spending per person.\n\nDue to decreases in spending in other categories, overall spending on prescriptions was moderate for the time period.\n\nHHS reports that 2014 growth rates are transitory as ACA implementation and new treatments stabilize. ACA could potentially reduce Medicare spending as the transition period ends.\n\nRecently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that ACA has reduced healthcare spending for Medicare beneficiaries. In the past six years, beneficiaries have saved an estimated $20 billion in prescription drug spending under the ACA, CMS states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An HHS report found that Medicare spending experienced a transitory increase in 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act and new specialty prescription drugs.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/medicare-spending-increases-slightly-under-affordable-care-act", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2016-01-14-HHS-green.png", "type": "article", "title": "Medicare Spending Increases Slightly under Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"description": "An HHS report found that Medicare spending experienced a transitory increase in 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act and new specialty prescription drugs.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2016-01-14-HHS-green.png"}, "title": "Medicare Spending Increases Slightly under Affordable Care Act", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In 2014, prescription drug spending was 56 percent of Medicare spending growth per enrollee.\nRecently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that ACA has reduced healthcare spending for Medicare beneficiaries.\nIn comparison, overall national healthcare spending increased by a moderate 4.3 percent per person.\n\u201cThe ACA\u2019s coverage expansions were posited to increase national health care expenditures as previously uninsured Americans gained access to quality health coverage,\u201d the report explains.\nHHS found that the significant gains in health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the development of specialty drugs caused a temporary increase in federal and private healthcare spending."}
