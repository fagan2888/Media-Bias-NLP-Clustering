This holiday season marks the 50th annual Ghirardelli Square Tree Lighting Ceremony, a special event that has become a tradition for many Bay Area families. The ceremony will feature the lighting of a magnificent 35-foot Christmas tree, decorated by ribbons, ornaments and over 2,500 lights. Singing and music from choirs, carolers, and live bands companied with great food, shopping, and visits with Santa Claus are just a few of the fun and memorable activities you and your loved ones can enjoy together.

With Santa’s help, NBC Bay Area’s own morning meteorologist Christina Loren has the honor of returning to this year’s ceremony to light the Ghirardelli Square Christmas tree. Holiday festivities begin at 4:00 PM, with the lighting ceremony at 5:30. Admission is free for all.
