The study has found a 100% increase in criminal attacks on health care organizations since 2010. But if that weren\u2019t enough, they also found something far more disturbing.\n\n\u201cDespite concerns about employee negligence and the use of insecure mobile devices, 88 percent of organizations permit employees and medical staff to use their own mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets to connect to their organization\u2019s networks or enterprise systems such as email. Similar to last year more than half of (these) organizations are not confident that the personally-owned mobile devices or BYOD are secure.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, very few organizations require their employees to install anti-virus/anti-malware software on their smartphones or tablets, scan them for viruses and malware, or scan and remove all mobile apps that present a security threat before allowing them to be connected their networks or systems.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but that scares me to death. Because we live in a time when breaches have joined death and taxes as the third certainty in life, this is foolhardy at best.\n\nWhat should concern you about these findings (and several others in the report) is that assaults on health care systems don\u2019t simply create the potential to have credit cards stolen or checks redirected: it\u2019s that hackers are getting access to your health care data (\u201cprotected health information,\u201d or \u201cPHI\u201d in regulatory speak), and the real world consequences of that are far more devastating.\n\nThe scary truth\n\nMedical identity theft is on the rise, just as the rise in criminal breaches of health care providers is spiking. Medical identity theft accounted for 43% of all identity theft reported in 2013, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that somewhere between 27.8 and 67.7 million people\u2019s medical records have been breached since 2009 (and that\u2019s before the flawed rollout of the Affordable Care Act).\n\nSo what happens if a criminal gets his or her dirty little hands on your pristine medical records?\n\nTo some extent, it depends upon how much information you have shared with your doctor. While it goes without saying that your physician will have all the requisite contact and insurance information for billing, he or she might also have information that they don\u2019t necessarily need to have such as your Social Security number, your family names and/or birthdays (which are often passwords or challenge questions for your bank, credit card and brokerage accounts) and even financial information that could be used to access your bank or credit card accounts.\n\nYour name, address, Social Security number and family information can be used not only to access your existing financial accounts (either directly or via social engineering), but also to open new lines of credit in your name. This is why it\u2019s important to check your free annual credit reports , as allowed by law. You can also monitor your credit by using a free tool like Credit.com\u2018s Credit Report Card, which updates two of your credit scores every month. Any unexpected change in your scores can signal identity theft.\n\nOn top of these financial risks, your medical records provide a veritable cornucopia of information that can be used in other ways. For instance, once a criminal has your personal and insurance information, he or she can use it or enable another to gain access to the health care system in your name, contaminating your medical records with his or their co-mingled information. Nothing is more dangerous than going to a hospital and having \u201cyour\u201d medical records, as used by an identity thief or his/her customer, reflect an inaccurate blood type, medical history or the existence or absence of certain allergies as you are trying to access care, particularly in an emergency situation.\n\nIf an impostor uses your insurance to gain access to health care, it can also affect your own ability to access care: many insurance plans have yearly caps on certain types of care \u2014 and no insurance company is going to pay for \u201cone person\u201d to have an appendectomy twice. An identity thief with access to your insurance could drain your coverage before you even know it\u2019s happened \u2014 and leave you in the lurch when you need it.\n\nThere is of course another big target here, namely your prescription history. Prescription drug abuse was up 10% last year, according to the federal government, and the value of some prescription drugs on the street is on the rise. An identity thief could very well use their access to your medical records to get the prescription drugs you need for your own health and well-being \u2014 leaving you both without your meds and with a suspicious doctor or pharmacist wondering why you maxed out all your refills so quickly and are coming back for more.\n\nMassive cyberattacks resulting in the types of breaches we saw at retailers during the past three months generate a great deal more headlines and arguably create a greater sense of urgency today than ever before, In reality, once credit and debit cards are replaced, for the most part, the immediate danger has passed. Subsequent phishing attacks by email, phone and text are more problematic but if consumers exercise care, damage can be contained and issues resolved. However, when it involves medical identity theft, the crime can be nearly invisible until there\u2019s an emergency and the consequences can literally be life threatening.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Credit.com.\n\nMore from Credit.com:\n\nHow Can You Tell If Your Identity Has Been Stolen?\n\nCan You Really Monitor Your Credit for Free?\n\nIdentity Theft: What You Need to Know\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "A study has found a 100% increase in criminal attacks on health care organizations since 2010.
