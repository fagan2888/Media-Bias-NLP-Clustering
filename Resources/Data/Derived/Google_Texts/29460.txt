An Oklahoma City teen is in custody, accused of sexually abusing a 9-year-old neighbor at an apartment complex on the northwest side of the metro.

The alleged crime happened at an apartment complex located in the 3700 block of NW 22nd St., near N. Portland Ave. and just east of I-44, on Feb. 29.

According to court documents, the 16-year-old suspect was visiting at the victim’s apartment that day. After the suspect went home, the 9-year-old victim told his mom that he had been abused.

The mother immediately filed a report and a forensic interview was conducted with the victim at Children’s Hospital.

Based on the victim’s extremely detailed and graphic story with police, investigators also collected clothing and other evidence from the apartment.

At a follow-up interview on March 3, police say the suspect confessed to all of the acts the victim had claimed. The teen was then arrested on three counts of lewd acts with a child. He was booked into the Oklahoma County Jail. The report did not indicate if he would be charged as a juvenile.

As part of the investigation, authorities obtained a warrant for DNA swabs of the suspect on March 3. The results of those DNA swabs have not been disclosed.
