Wal-Mart has cruelly denied its workers legally required breaks during their shifts, forced them into hours of unpaid overtime, and ruthlessly cracked down on union organizing attempts by firing tens of thousands of employees under illegal false pretenses.\n\nNone of these things helped Wal-Mart\u2019s image, but here\u2019s what really doomed it in New York City: It sells cheap crap and its brand is deeply uncool and synonymous with red-state America to Brooklyn\u2019s upwardly mobile population. Even the true leaders of the Republican Party \u2013 Wall Street\u2019s laissez-faire Masters of the Universe \u2013 would certainly invest in Wal-Mart, but wouldn\u2019t be caught dead shopping in one.\n\nI mention Wal-Mart because there\u2019s another soulless labor abuser set to waltz into town \u2013 Wegmans. But rather than continuing the sharp rhetoric that kept Wal-Mart at bay, we\u2019re welcoming the big-box grocery store with flattery and a generous helping of public subsidies.\n\nAnd the only difference? The upper-middle-class creative set has declared them cool.\n\nWegmans\u2019 labor record is weak enough that it would be more appropriate to call them \u201cWeg-Mart.\u201d And yet, with the support of the pro-labor de Blasio administration, Wegmans is coming to the Brooklyn Navy Yard next year, even after the mayor gave his word he would only back a union shop.\n\nSo let\u2019s see how Weg-Mart stacks up to Wal-Mart\u2019s impressive record of screwing over working America:\n\nRuthless business practices? Check. Just like Wal-Mart, Wegmans\u2019 arrival in inner cities has plunged locally owned small businesses across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic into bankruptcy.\n\nPutting worker safety at risk for profits? Check. The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration is set to fine Wegmans $188,000 for failing to address ongoing safety hazards that have resulted in worker injuries. Its not the first time OSHA has sounded the alarm about unsafe practices at Wegmans \u2013 they also fined the company in 2007, 2010 and 2011.\n\nCutting benefits and shifting costs to taxpayers? Check. In 2013, Wegmans unceremoniously eliminated health care benefits for part-time workers, and recommended their employees seek Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHostility to labor unions? Check. Wegmans has aggressively fought off worker representation in its stores.\n\nFalse promises? Check. Wegmans has promised the Navy Yard location will create 450 jobs, but industry experts say the real number will be more like 100.\n\nSome of Brooklyn\u2019s affluent new arrivals might be willing to overlook worker exploitation in exchange for a few artisanal cheeses, but longtime Brooklynites have no interest in giving this gentrification-accelerator a free pass. Shamefully, the company had to resort to astroturfing local support from the Farragut Houses and other nearby NYCHA developments.\n\nIf our mayor is truly serious about fixing inequality, then he should revisit his decision to turn down the pro-union bidders that promised to create well-paying jobs with benefits.\n\nAnd he should forfeit his right to complain when even more of the surrounding neighborhood\u2019s affordable housing is lost. After all Mr. Mayor, \u201cas you eat, so you shall sow.\u201d\n\nBertha Lewis is the founder and president of The Black Institute.", "article_metadata": {"description": "City&State, the only media company solely devoted to government and politics in New York, provides insightful coverage of the state's politics, policies and people.", "author": "Bertha Lewis", "og": {"image": "http://cityandstateny.com/assets/image-cache/_img/cityandstate-og2.jpg", "title": "Opinion: Cool or not, Wal-Mart-esque stores have no place in Brooklyn"}, "sailthru.date": "Nov 02, 2015", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "keywords": "Politics,Policy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Just like Wal-Mart, Wegmans\u2019 arrival in inner cities has plunged locally owned small businesses across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic into bankruptcy.\nPutting worker safety at risk for profits?\nI mention Wal-Mart because there\u2019s another soulless labor abuser set to waltz into town \u2013 Wegmans.\nAfter all Mr. Mayor, \u201cas you eat, so you shall sow.\u201dBertha Lewis is the founder and president of The Black Institute.\nAnd he should forfeit his right to complain when even more of the surrounding neighborhood\u2019s affordable housing is lost."}
