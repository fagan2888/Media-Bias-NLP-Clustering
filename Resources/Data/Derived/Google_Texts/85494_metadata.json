And second, he suggested that this proves that Jon Stewart \u2014 and all liberals, for that matter \u2014 don\u2019t really care about people. He cited the news as \u201cevidence of the left\u2019s hypocrisy; they don\u2019t really care.\u201d Referencing the way that Stewart had mocked his weeklong coverage of spring break the year prior, Hannity went on to call Stewart a \u201csanctimonious jackass.\u201d\n\nBut the real sanctimonious jackass in this story is Hannity. Let\u2019s start with Hannity\u2019s choice of epithet, since it is there that we can discover the core of the debate. Hannity chose to marry two key concepts: the idea of being morally superior to others (sanctimonious) and the idea of being a stupid person willing to perform stunts in order to look cool (jackass). It\u2019s really an amazing insult when you think about it \u2014 because it defines precisely all that is wrong with Hannity\u2019s public persona.\n\nHannity was thrilled to be able to report that something on his show had a real-life impact. Too thrilled, really, since his glee reminds us how rare it is for his show to report anything that is remotely news-like. His reaction, though, is proof of his need to reiterate that he is above others \u2014 especially liberal adversaries like Stewart. And then there are Hannity\u2019s innate jackass qualities \u2014 his constant need to call attention to himself even when doing so simply makes him look like an idiot.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Hannity chose this one moment when his show\u2019s coverage may have done some good to go after Stewart. Hannity had long been a target of Stewart\u2019s sharp satire. There was the time that Stewart busted Hannity for using fake footage to exaggerate the crowds at an anti-health care reform rally in November 2009, causing Hannity to make a rare on-air apology. Stewart has also repeatedly gone after Hannity for his racist coverage of Obama and his constant need to refer to Obama as \u201cthe worst president ever.\u201d Then there are Hannity\u2019s repeated appearances on \u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d Moment of Zen. (For example, see this and this.)\n\nBut the best showdown between them was over Hannity\u2019s embrace of Cliven Bundy. Bundy, as you may recall, was a Nevada rancher who refused to pay grazing fees on federally owned land. The dispute began back in 1993 when Bundy began protesting the fees by refusing to renew his permit. The standoff reached a peak in March 2014 when the Bureau of Land Management closed down acres of land to capture trespassing cattle and caused Bundy supporters to stage armed protest. Hannity quickly moved to champion Bundy, showcasing him as a patriot.\n\nHannity\u2019s support of Bundy was covered by Stewart on three consecutive days. At the heart of Stewart\u2019s critique was the fact that Hannity seemed to be excited by the idea of Bundy\u2019s disrespect for the law \u2014 when Hannity himself often went after immigrants and student protesters for not obeying the law. Stewart also showed astonishment that uber-patriot Hannity would defend a man who explicitly claimed that he did not recognize the U.S. government as existing.\n\nBundy wasn\u2019t just an anarchist; he was also an outright racist. Shortly after the protests he was quoted saying about black people, \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy?\u201d Even though Hannity called the racist remarks repugnant, he still defended his view that Bundy had exposed \u201cgovernment overreach.\u201d Of course, given that Hannity paid $300,000 for a portrait of Obama burning the Constitution, we might wonder the extent to which he personally links racism and dislike for government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oh, how funny it is when a Fox News blowhard tries to take down \"The Daily Show\" and just embarrasses himself", "title": "Jon Stewart vs Sean Hannity: We all know who the real \u201csanctimonious jackass\u201d is", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Oh, how funny it is when a Fox News blowhard tries to take down \"The Daily Show\" and just embarrasses himself", "title": "Jon Stewart vs Sean Hannity: We all know who the real \u201csanctimonious jackass\u201d is", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/jon_stewart_vs_sean_hannity_we_all_know_who_the_real_sanctimonious_jackass_is/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/hannity_stewart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oh, how funny it is when a Fox News blowhard tries to take down \"The Daily Show\" and just embarrasses himself", "title": "Jon Stewart vs Sean Hannity: We all know who the real \u201csanctimonious jackass\u201d is", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/hannity_stewart.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia A.
