The official, calling it an isolated case, said the child is responding to treatment and being monitored.\n\nAs politicians on both sides point fingers \u2013 the title of yesterday\u2019s House hearing, \u201cAn Administration-Made Disaster: The South Texas Border Surge of Unaccompanied Alien Minors,\u201d spoke to that \u2013 border officials charged with managing the crisis say the facts on the ground are more clear.\n\n\u201cOnly one thing can end the frenzy of law-breaking at the border \u2013 an end to the \u2018catch-and-release policy\u2019 for illegal-alien juveniles,\u201d Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told The Daily Signal. Krikorian added:\n\nEvery illegal alien caught at the border must be detained until his hearing, so that word gets back to Central America that it\u2019s no longer worth making the trip.\n\nPresident Obama has added capacity to process and place the border crossers, directing Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson to coordinate assistance from various sections of the government, including HHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Coast Guard. Even so, officials at the border say, they face a shortage of manpower.\n\n\u2018Motivated by Rumors of Amnesty\u2019\n\nOfficials, based on recorded interviews with the children, can\u2019t definitively declare a reason for the surge. But those who testified said misinformation about current U.S. immigration law and the prospect of amnesty for illegal immigrants have been motivators.\n\n\u201cReports from ICE officers and agents on the ground corroborate reports that the majority are motivated more by rumors of amnesty than the situation in their countries,\u201d said Chris Crane, president of National ICE Council 118 of the American Federation of Government Employees. The union leader added:\n\nImpoverished countries don\u2019t read our laws or read cut-off dates. This crisis is putting a tremendous strain on ICE ERO [Enforcement and Removal Operations] and its limited manpower and resources nationwide.\n\nBrandon Judd, president of the AFGE National Border Patrol Council, who represents 16,500 border agents, said diverting resources to the child migrant problem has hurt enforcement resources where it matters.\n\n\u201cWe are adequately staffed to process them, but we have to strip the line to do it,\u201d Judd said. \u201cThe actual border takes a hit because we have to take people out of the field to do it.\u201d\n\nThe influx of child migrants has spotlighted another shortage: a lack of immigration judges.\n\nHoman said that once the children arrive here, they likely won\u2019t leave for a while \u2013 if at all \u2013 because there are too few immigration judges to see them.\n\nHearings can take several years, Homan said.\n\nEach child receives his own hearing. Most of the children do not have lawyers, though they have the right to a counsel at their own expense.\n\n\u2018They Blend Into the Community\u2019\n\nBut just bringing the children to court can be a challenge, because Border Patrol agents sometimes have no means to verify their identity.\n\n\u201cMost will never appear in court,\u201d Judd said. \u201cThey fail to appear and then they blend into the community. The chance they are deported is small.\u201d\n\nSome of the children \u2013 and separately, women traveling with children \u2013 seek asylum. Based on a screening interview with the border crossers, an officer determines whether a credible fear exists.If so, the officer may refer the minor or adult to an asylum hearing at an immigration court.\n\nRonald Vitiello, deputy chief of border control for customs and border protection at the Department of Homeland Security, said unless the children carry documentation or have prior history in the U.S., agents can\u2019t confirm their ages and names.\n\nMost of the minors say they are between 14 and 17 years old, though some report being as young as 5.To add to the challenge, children under 14 cannot be fingerprinted under U.S. law.\n\nThe White House announced plans to expedite removals and said it will expand use of monitoring devices such as ankle bracelets to track the illegal immigrants while they wait for court proceedings.\n\nVice President Joe Biden traveled to Guatemala on June 20 to meet with regional leaders and ask for help quelling rumors of achieving legal status in America.\n\nTo coincide with Biden\u2019s trip, the Obama administration pledged $93 million in new programs to reduce violence in Central America. The funding includes $40 million to reduce gang membership in Guatemala, $25 million to build 77 youth centers in El Salvador and $18.5 million to build 77 youth centers in Honduras.\n\n\u2018No Free Passes\u2019\n\nThis week Johnson, the DHS secretary, sent an open letter warning Central American parents who consider sending their children here: \u201cThere are no \u2018permits\u2019 or free passes at the end.\u201d\n\nJanet Murguia, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, said the reason for the crisis is \u201cabundantly clear,\u201d but the solution is more complex. The head of the Hispanic civil rights organization said that solution involves \u201cnot just law enforcement and U.S. domestic policy, but also U.S. foreign policy and the participation of international agencies.\u201d\n\nMarguia said a new plan from Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., \u201cis an important step forward in addressing this crisis,\u201d adding:\n\nIt calls for, among other things, focusing immediately on the welfare of the children, cracking down on smugglers and a renewed emphasis on fostering social and economic development in the region.\n\nAltogether, the border surge brings circumstances different than years past.\n\nThis batch of border crossers likely don\u2019t have criminal intentions, officials addressing the surge said, because they don\u2019t try to be elusive. They come, rather, because they know they can stay.\n\n\u201cThey are giving themselves up,\u201d Vitiello said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of the more than 24,000 unaccompanied children who illegally entered the U.S. last year, most haven\u2019t left -- even after being detained, officials say.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Of the more than 24,000 unaccompanied children who illegally entered the U.S. last year, most haven\u2019t left -- even after being detained, officials say.", "title": "Most in Surge of Child Border Crossers Don't Leave, Officials Say", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140616-AlienMinors-Siegel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1izxm5E"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Of the more than 24,000 unaccompanied children who illegally entered the U.S. last year, most haven\u2019t left -- even after being detained, officials say.", "title": "Most in Surge of Child Border Crossers Don't Leave, Officials Say", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140616-AlienMinors-Siegel.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "homeland,immigration", "published_time": "2014-06-26T18:51:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Homeland Security, amnesty, immigration reform, border security, Rio Grande, child migrant, ICE"}, "article_summary": "This batch of border crossers likely don\u2019t have criminal intentions, officials addressing the surge said, because they don\u2019t try to be elusive.\nAltogether, the border surge brings circumstances different than years past.\nAs politicians on both sides point fingers \u2013 the title of yesterday\u2019s House hearing, \u201cAn Administration-Made Disaster: The South Texas Border Surge of Unaccompanied Alien Minors,\u201d spoke to that \u2013 border officials charged with managing the crisis say the facts on the ground are more clear.\n\u2018Motivated by Rumors of Amnesty\u2019Officials, based on recorded interviews with the children, can\u2019t definitively declare a reason for the surge.\nEven so, officials at the border say, they face a shortage of manpower."}
