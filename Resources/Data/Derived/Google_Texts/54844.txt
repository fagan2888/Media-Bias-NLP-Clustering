It’s been a rough start to the season for the CSU Rams: An overtime loss to Minnesota. The death of mascot CAM the Ram. And now, blowing a 14-0 lead to lose the Rocky Mountain Showdown in overtime in front of 66,253 at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

In fact, one might even say, “It sucks to be a CSU Ram,” right now. And that’s exactly what thousands of CU Buffs fans (and some players) chanted after Colorado’s 27-24 overtime victory in Denver.

Paging Dr. Schadenfreude.
