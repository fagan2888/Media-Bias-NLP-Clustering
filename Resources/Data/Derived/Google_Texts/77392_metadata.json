A senior vice-president of CGI Federal testified before Congress that it was the government\u2019s responsibility \u2013 not the contractor\u2019s \u2013 to test the website and make sure it worked.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these challenges will largely be offset by an improving backdrop in Europe (not to mention the tail wind of an appreciating euro), which is a much larger component of CGI\u2019s business,\u201d Thanos Moschopoulos of BMO Capital Markets wrote in a report.\n\nEurope accounts for 55 per cent CGI\u2019s total revenues, compared with 13.5 per cent for U.S. federal government business.\n\nBut the analyst said questions about CGI\u2019s performance could undermine the medium-term prospects for its U.S. federal business. He suggests CGI Federal\u2019s revenues will decrease by eight per cent this fiscal year and by 12 per cent in fiscal 2015.\n\nMoschopoulos said he doesn\u2019t think CGI will be found to be the main party at fault because other companies were responsible for key portions of the system, including system testing.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, we hardly expect CGI to emerge blameless once the full post-mortem is complete,\u201d he wrote, pointing to testimony from a project manager that CGI Federal had \u201csome issues with timely delivery.\u201d\n\nCGI (TSX:GIB.A) will report its fourth-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nIts adjusted earnings are expected to soar to 62 cents per share, up from 39 cents per share a year earlier before it acquired Europe\u2019s Logica, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was forecast to increase 56 per cent to $2.5 billion.\n\nPre-tax operating income (EBITDA) was estimated at $388.4 million, up from $192.7 million a year earlier.\n\nFor the full year, CGI was expected to earn $2.25 per share, or $711.7 million, in adjusted profits on $10.14 billion of revenues. Including one-time items, net income was expected to reach $497.5 million while EBITDA was forecast to nearly double to $1.46 billion.\n\nPaul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets agrees there\u2019s a risk that CGI\u2019s reputation may take a hit in the near-term, \u201cbut long-term impact likely nominal.\u201d\n\nHe said CGI\u2019s U.S. Federal business is much broader than Obamacare and health care. The Department of Health accounted for 17 per cent of U.S. Federal contracts, below the 41 per cent by the U.S. Defense Department and 23 per cent by the State Department.\n\nThe person appointed by the White House to manage the health-care project has said the website will be fully functional by the end of November.\n\n\u201cA properly functioning website will further reduce the media attention on CGI\u2019s role in the website,\u201d he wrote. \u201cConversely, negative headlines may flare up again if the website continues to malfunction.\u201d\n\nOn the Toronto Stock Exchange, CGI\u2019s shares closed up 97 cents, or 2.68 per cent, at $37.11.\n\nFounded in 1976, CGI Group is one of the largest independent IT and business process services firms in the world with about C$4.1 billion in annual revenues.\n\nIt has some 31,000 employees in Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "iPolitics", "description": "MONTREAL \u2013 CGI\u2019s reputation has taken a short-term beating due to its role in launching the Obamacare website in the U.S., but the informaton technology company\u2019s long-term forecasts remain bright because of a blockbuster European acquisition, industry analysts say.
