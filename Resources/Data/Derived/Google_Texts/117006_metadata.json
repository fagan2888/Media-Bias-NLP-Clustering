He gathered himself and eked out the decision with solid work from a more cautious distance at the outdoor StubHub Center south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nGuerrero said his corner \u201cwanted me to get on my jab more, box more, and that\u2019s what I did. I don\u2019t know what it is about this arena, man. It makes me want to stand and trade.\u201d\n\nJudge Max DeLuca scored the bout 95-94 for Martinez, while Eddie Hernandez favored Guerrero 95-94. Judge Jerry Cantu also gave it to Guerrero, 97-92.\n\nGuerrero was blown out by Floyd Mayweather Jr. in May 2013, and he won a brutal decision over Yoshihiro Kamegai at StubHub Center last year before losing a one-sided decision to Keith Thurman in March.\n\nGuerrero developed swelling around his left eye in the first round, and his nose was bleeding by the third while he fought with his back against the ropes. Late in the fourth, Martinez caught Guerrero with a combination of uppercuts and short punches to the body, sending him to the canvas.\n\nGuerrero beat the count and made it to the fifth, and he had better success when he didn\u2019t fight in close.\n\nEarlier, heavyweight Dominic Breazeale remained unbeaten with a third-round stoppage victory, knocking down Cuba\u2019s Yasmany Consuegra three times.\n\nAfter getting hit hard the opening round, Breazeale (15-0, 14 KOs) knocked down Consuegra with a right to the head in the second. The 2012 U.S. Olympian hit Consuegra (17-1) with a right uppercut early in the third before ending it with a left to the head.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Robert Guerrero wins split decision over Aron Martinez", "title": "Robert Guerrero wins split decision over Aron Martinez", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/robert-guerrero-wins-split-decision-over-aron-martinez/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_032446_robert-guerrero.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_032446_robert-guerrero.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T15:22:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:09:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CARSON, Calif. \u2014 Robert Guerrero rebounded from a fourth-round knockdown and won a split decision over Aron Martinez in a welterweight bout Saturday.\nLate in the fourth, Martinez caught Guerrero with a combination of uppercuts and short punches to the body, sending him to the canvas.\nIt makes me want to stand and trade.\u201dJudge Max DeLuca scored the bout 95-94 for Martinez, while Eddie Hernandez favored Guerrero 95-94.\nGuerrero went down from a heavy combination of Martinez\u2019s punches right before the fourth-round bell after extensive fighting in close.\nGuerrero said his corner \u201cwanted me to get on my jab more, box more, and that\u2019s what I did."}
