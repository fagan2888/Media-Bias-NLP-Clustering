The planned expansion is expected to cost $200 million.\n\nFor DHR to expand, it must petition the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to allow its growth \u2014 a restriction enacted under the Affordable Care Act that prevents doctor-owned hospitals from expanding without government approval.\n\nDoctor\u2019s Hospital wants to have a Level I Trauma center \u2014 the highest level \u2014 which would be able to handle large-scale motor vehicle accidents or gunshot wounds, providing treatment for patients from prevention to treatment, all the way to rehabilitation.\n\nBut before that can happen, DHR needs to catch up with its local peers by becoming a Level III trauma center \u2014 a hospital that shows it can perform emergency intensive care and stabilization of patients.\n\nMcAllen Medical Center, Rio Grande Regional and Knapp Medical Center are all Level III trauma centers. The closest Level II trauma unit is in Corpus Christi and the nearest Level I trauma center is in San Antonio.\n\nDHR is still applying for its level III certification, but officials expect to receive the certification soon.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the community in South Texas deserves that level of care and we are willing to invest in it,\u201d said Israel Rocha, chief executive officer at Doctor\u2019s Hospital at Renaissance.\n\nHEALTHCARE NEED?\n\nAhead of any decision by the federal government, DHR faces opposition from other local, privately-owned hospitals, which criticized the doctor-owned hospital model and how much it contributes to providing healthcare for the poor.\n\nSeveral Rio Grande Valley hospitals have fought against the request, with nearly all local hospitals submitted scathing letters during the public comment period that closed last month.\n\nIf approved by the government, DHR would grow larger than South Texas Health System \u2014 currently Hidalgo County\u2019s largest hospital owner \u2014 which has 848 beds at several local hospitals.\n\n\u201cDHR currently does not contribute its fair share of uncompensated and charity care to the people of Hidalgo County,\u201d wrote Douglas Matney, regional vice president of South Texas Health System. \u201cWhile it may not be DHR\u2019s policy that the hospital does not discriminate\u2026it is clear that DHR permits its medical staff physicians to discriminate against such beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n>> Read DHR's request to the government.\n\n>> Read the public comments on DHR's request.\n\n>> Read DHR's rebuttal to its critics.\n\nRepresentatives with Knapp Medical Center in Weslaco provided the government with photographs of new buildings at Doctor\u2019s Hospital\u2019s campus where a new outpatient surgery complex was being built and asserted that the hospital was already expanding outside of the law.\n\n\u201cAllowing DHR to expand, especially the magnitude of expansion its requesting will in no way expand access to care for uninsured patients in Hidalgo County,\u201d wrote Bill Adams, regional chief executive of Knapp Medical Center in a June 5 letter.\n\nDoctor\u2019s Hospital officials deny that the buildings under construction skirt the requirements and provided amended hospital bed licenses they say allow for the new construction.\n\nMost of the other hospitals also argued that data provided by DHR to the federal government was misleading, including its nondiscrimination policy, which they claim is spotty. Hospital administrators signed affidavits, saying they called the offices of three DHR-affiliated doctors asking if they accept Medicaid, the federal insurance program for the poor, and saying they do not.\n\nMedicaid typically reimburses hospitals less for medical procedures than private insurance companies. More than a third of Hidalgo County residents live below the federal poverty line and qualify for Medicaid if they have legal immigration status.\n\nRocha defended DHR-affiliated doctors\u2019 practices regarding Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cEvery physician who is on our medical staff is required to see those patients \u2014 if they choose not to participate in the Medicaid program, they have to treat them free of cost. I think they were splitting hairs on that fact,\u201d Rocha said.\n\nkmosbrucker@themonitor.com\n\nFor the most complete version of this story, log in or subscribe to MyMonitorNews.com.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Monitor", "description": "EDINBURG \u2014 Doctor\u2019s Hospital at Renaissance is seeking to double the number of beds at its main campus within the next two years, but only if federal regulators bless its plan.", "title": "DHR hopes to double size, but faces opposition from other local hospitals", "url": "http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/dhr-hopes-to-double-size-but-faces-opposition-from-other/article_c3292206-2cfa-11e5-8846-771e64b97fd1.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themonitor.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/04/2041aa6e-80a2-11e3-9e07-0019bb30f31a/52db1eb725a44.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C417", "height": 417}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@monitornews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "EDINBURG \u2014 Doctor\u2019s Hospital at Renaissance is seeking to double the number of beds at its main campus within the next two years, but only if federal regulators bless its plan.", "fb": {"app_id": 108049775881002}, "keywords": "local,business,business_news,top_story", "google-site-verification": "V8P2NNokGINCTv-r9xQHek8dzZWwYYMCQbh2f7o4PGQ", "news_keywords": "local,business,business_news,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb126\"", "article_summary": "McAllen Medical Center, Rio Grande Regional and Knapp Medical Center are all Level III trauma centers.\nThe closest Level II trauma unit is in Corpus Christi and the nearest Level I trauma center is in San Antonio.\nDoctor\u2019s Hospital officials deny that the buildings under construction skirt the requirements and provided amended hospital bed licenses they say allow for the new construction.\nAhead of any decision by the federal government, DHR faces opposition from other local, privately-owned hospitals, which criticized the doctor-owned hospital model and how much it contributes to providing healthcare for the poor.\nEDINBURG \u2014 Doctor\u2019s Hospital at Renaissance is seeking to double the number of beds at its main campus within the next two years, but only if federal regulators bless its plan."}
