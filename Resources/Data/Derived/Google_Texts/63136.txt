Assurant Health, new to the Illinois health insurance exchange this year, will either be sold or closed in 2016.

If there is no buyer, Milwaukee-based Assurant will not be selling plans on the Illinois exchange in 2016, Assurant spokeswoman Vera Carley said. That means consumers with an Assurant plan will have to shop elsewhere for coverage when enrollment begins again on Nov. 1.

“Absent a sale, we will discontinue the filing process for 2016 and work towards a withdrawal,” Carley said.

With nearly 1 million customers nationwide, Assurant Health sells insurance to individuals, families and small businesses.

Assurant is one of eight companies that offered more than 400 plans this year on the Illinois exchange, Get Covered Illinois. The online marketplace has enrolled nearly 350,000 consumers so far, up about 60 percent from its debut in 2014. A special enrollment period ends tomorrow.

Nationwide, nearly 11.7 million consumers picked or were automatically re-enrolled in a plan, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in March.

Assurant Inc., the New York-based parent company of Assurant Health, announced today that following a strategic review of its business, it plans to focus on niche housing and lifestyle protection offerings, where it's a market leader, according to a statement.

The health insurance and employee benefits segments of Assurant Inc. could be sold as part of the process. If the health business segment isn't sold, Assurant Inc. plans to “substantially complete its exit” from the health insurance market in 2016, the statement said.

Assurant Inc. was the 16th-largest health and accident insurer in Illinois in 2013, with less than 1 percent of the market, according to national insurance regulators.
