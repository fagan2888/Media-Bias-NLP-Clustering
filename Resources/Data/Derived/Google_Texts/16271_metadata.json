It\u2019s sure to trigger a lot of quizzical looks from lawmakers, and the following questions:\n\nWho\u2019s taking away midsize companies\u2019 ability to buy stop-loss policies? And why?\n\nFor that matter, what is stop-loss insurance?\n\nFor the answers, the Insider turned to Patrick Gillespie, director of state government affairs for Cigna, one of the insurers that sells stop-loss policies in New York. He could probably talk about stop-loss for weeks, were anyone inclined to listen that long. Fear not\u2014the Insider boiled the explanations he gave during a 40-minute phone interview into a ready-to-eat meal.\n\nThe big picture: Stop-loss insurance protects employers who self-fund\u2014that is, pay their workers\u2019 health-care bills directly, rather than cover them through a traditional insurance policy. Self-funding can save companies money, but can destroy them if one or more employees racks up extraordinarily high medical bills. A stop-loss policy kicks in if that happens, limiting what they\u2019ll have to pay in any given year.\n\nIf the legislature doesn\u2019t pass (and Gov. Andrew Cuomo doesn\u2019t sign) S.2366 and A.1154 this year, on Jan. 1, about 1,700 businesses with nearly 130,000 employees will stop self-funding because they\u2014along with about 9,300 other midsize firms\u2014will lose their legal right to buy stop-loss policies.\n\nThese companies would then have several choices. Those willing to pay more could buy a traditional policy that keeps the same level of benefits for their workers. Those looking to keep their costs the same could turn to a less-generous plan (say, bronze instead of silver, in the parlance of the Affordable Care Act). Some might drop coverage altogether and ask their workers to shop for policies on the state\u2019s health care exchange.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. Nobody set out to take away stop-loss insurance from midsize businesses. But in 1992 New York did take it away from small businesses\u2014those with 2 to 50 employees. On Jan. 1, 2016, the Affordable Care Act will require New York to expand its definition of small businesses to include those with up to 100 workers. An unintended effect will be to subject the newly defined small businesses to the 1992 law.\n\nThe irony is that the Affordable Care Act was designed to broaden health insurance coverage. \u201cThe intention of the ACA seems to be the opposite of what it would achieve here,\u201d noted Mr. Gillespie.\n\nThe Cuomo administration is investigating whether that will actually happen. The fate of stop-loss for midsize firms may ultimately be decided by the Department of Financial Services, which regulates the insurance industry. If DFS chief Benjamin Lawsky doesn't buy insurers' arguments, he could ask legislators or the governor to kill the bills.\n\nCurious legislators might wonder why their predecessors 23 years ago banned stop-loss policies for small businesses in the first place. The idea was to rescue Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which was in financial straits and needed more customers. It worked: Unable to self-fund, small businesses bought more BC/BS policies. The insurer survived.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why insurance brokers will be knocking on lawmakers\u2019 doors today and Tuesday, explaining what this is all about.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it: If I were to walk down the street in Manhattan, there\u2019s not a whole lot of people worried about stop-loss,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very important to our employers.\u201d\n\nGet Crain's Morning Insider Sign up for the Morning Insider email and receive political news and musings every morning at 6 a.m. More Newsletters \u203a\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"date": "May 4, 2015", "description": "Companies with 51 to 100 employees could find themselves swept into an old law that prevents smaller firms from paying workers' medical bills directly.", "pubDate": 20150504, "author": "Erik Engquist", "headline": "Midsize businesses face loss of lower-cost health insurance", "section": "The Insider", "title": "Midsize businesses face loss of lower-cost health insurance - Crain's New York Business", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's New York Business", "description": "Companies with 51 to 100 employees could find themselves swept into an old law that prevents smaller firms from paying workers' medical bills directly.", "title": "Midsize businesses face loss of lower-cost health insurance - Crain's New York Business", "url": "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150504/BLOGS04/150509970/midsize-businesses-face-loss-of-lower-cost-health-insurance", "image": "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/assets/logos/main-logo/C-200x200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/assets/logos/main-logo/C-200x200.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=626240088, app-argument=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crains-new-york-business/id626240088?ls=1&mt=8", "keywords": "CIGNA, Andrew Cuomo, Benjamin Lawsky, Health Care, Insurance, Opinion, Politics, Small Business, The Insider Blog", "type": "article", "twitter": {"domain": "crainsnewyork.com", "description": "Companies with 51 to 100 employees could find themselves swept into an old law that prevents smaller firms from paying workers' medical bills directly.", "site": "@crainsnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Midsize businesses face loss of lower-cost health insurance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca32d\"", "article_summary": "Nobody set out to take away stop-loss insurance from midsize businesses.\nCurious legislators might wonder why their predecessors 23 years ago banned stop-loss policies for small businesses in the first place.\nThe measure would allow businesses with 51 to 100 employees to continue purchasing stop-loss insurance next year.\nIt\u2019s sure to trigger a lot of quizzical looks from lawmakers, and the following questions:Who\u2019s taking away midsize companies\u2019 ability to buy stop-loss policies?\nAn unintended effect will be to subject the newly defined small businesses to the 1992 law."}
