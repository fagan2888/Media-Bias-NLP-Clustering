A 40-unit town home development was approved in south Oxnard by the City Council on Tuesday.

The project will have five three-story buildings, each with eight town homes having two or three bedrooms. The for-sale condominiums will range from about 1,530 to 1,900 square feet and have two-car garages. Eight units will be affordable and the 32 others will be market rate. Pricing was estimated between $245,000 to $299,000.

Developer Steve Topor of Apchanco 18 LLC was represented at the meeting by Henry Casillas of Aldersgate Investment LLC.

City planning commissioners had denied the project in April over concerns about compatibility, water, density and parking. Developers appealed the decision to the City Council.

City staff told the council state laws that encourage affordable housing construction mandate density bonuses and parking concessions. The council unanimously OKâ€™d the project.
