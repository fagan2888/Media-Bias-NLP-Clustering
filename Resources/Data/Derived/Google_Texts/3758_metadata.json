Unlike any solution on the market, HealthSparq Clean is designed to help health plans avoid significant fines from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), while giving members a directory they can trust.\n\nRecent studies indicated that provider directory data is inaccurate and outdated by as much as 50 percent. Patients rely on provider directories to find doctors who are in their network and accepting new patients, among other things, and inaccurate directories can lead to patients ultimately shouldering a much higher portion of the cost of their care. As a result, CMS is requiring health plans to continuously update provider directory information in real-time beginning January 1, 2016, with many states enacting their own mandates and fines.\n\nTo avoid fines as high as $25,000 for each individual inaccuracy found in a directory, health plans can use HealthSparq Clean to establish a structured and proactive process to ensure compliance with all of the disparate CMS, state-level, and pending Affordable Care Act (ACA) regulations and mandates.\n\nThe solution can do the following for health plans:\n\nContact providers\u2019 offices directly \u2013 including by phone \u2013 to obtain any information required to list in a directory (in-network status, current contact information, new patient acceptance status, all locations for the provider, etc.). This also includes identifying the right person in an office to provide this information on an ongoing basis, as it is often not the provider him or herself.\n\nCreate an automated outreach program that obtains and updates this information at regular intervals \u2013 while managing the operation costs through automation \u2013 as requested by the plan to meet mandates (at least monthly per CMS guidelines).\n\nGathers all of the above data in whatever format the health plan wishes to receive it to meet their current (or future) database structure.\n\nDelivers this data via a sophisticated, tailored, and secure portal.\n\n\u201cWhat CMS is asking of health plans isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s going to take tremendous effort for them to meet these mandates, especially considering that some mandates have not been fully defined,\u201d said Dan Medin, service products director for HealthSparq. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed this service to be as tailored and nuanced as possible so a health plan in California can meet both CMS and its own strict state guidelines, and a health plan in New York can do the same, all without having to redesign their directories or create a custom solution.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about HealthSparq Clean, please visit http://www.healthsparq.com/solutions/healthplans/clean.\n\nAbout HealthSparq:\n\nHealthSparq empowers people to make smarter health care choices by providing the cost and quality information they need to truly compare health providers and services.
