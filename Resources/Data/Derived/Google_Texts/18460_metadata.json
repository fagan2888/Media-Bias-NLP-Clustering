A move by Wisconsin\u2019s Group Insurance Board to substantially increase how much state employees pay for their health insurance is drawing unqualified and sharp opposition from labor leaders but could once have drawn criticism from Sarah Palin, as well. That\u2019s because the proposal includes \u201cconsultations about end-of-life care, which some called \u2018death panels,\u2019\u201d as the Wisconsin State Journal put it .\n\nDeath panels?! In the great Badger State? Putting Badger Staters to death? How could this be? One may have asked, as some on the right did during the debate over the Affordable Care Act. But here we are, with the Wisconsin state government overseeing what\u2019s set to be the controversy-free implementation of new policies designed to save the state money through its employees\u2019 end-of-life decisions.\n\nQuick background: The Wisconsin state government is having some tough fiscal times, and Walker\u2019s budget proposal suggested substantial cuts in a number of areas, including to the University of Wisconsin system and to K-12 education. The governor\u2019s budget proposal also called for savings of $81 million on the state employees\u2019 group health insurance program. (Remember that in 2011 the governor oversaw the passage of Act 10, which virtually ended collective bargaining for most of the state\u2019s public sector unions.) But the budget wasn\u2019t too specific about how to save that $81 million. Instead, Walker\u2019s proposal directed the state\u2019s Group Insurance Board to work with Atlanta-based Segal Consulting to figure it out.\n\nThe most buzzed-about change, the Wisconsin State Journal reported , will require public sector employees to pay twice as much out of pocket for their health care than they do now. These changes are projected to save the state $85 million over the next two years (Wisconsin passes budgets biennially), and most of the savings \u201cwill come from increasing out-of-pocket limits and introducing deductibles for the vast majority of state workers who don\u2019t have them,\u201d according to the paper. Individual employees will have new $250 deductibles, and family deductibles will be $500.\n\nThe Group Insurance Board voted for the changes on May 19, and unless the legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee moves to require legislative approval for the changes, they will go into effect Jan. 1, 2016, according to Mark Lamkins, communications director for the state\u2019s Department of Employee Trust Funds. The board that approved the changes has 11 members, some of whom are Walker appointees. The majority of the Walker appointees on the board voted in favor.\n\nAnd the change has labor leaders irate.\n\n\u201cWhat the group insurance board did today is unconscionable,\u201d said Wisconsin AFSCME executive Marty Beil, according to THOnline . \u201cI\u2019d also call it evil that they\u2019re treating state employees at that level. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nBut Walker\u2019s critics on the left aren\u2019t just going after him for increasing public sector employees\u2019 expenditures for their health care. They\u2019ve also targeted him for a tiny provision the board approved that seeks to save a bit of money through end-of-life care. The memo laying out the cost-cutting health-care proposal doesn\u2019t detail how these changes would work, and the State Journal reported that \u201c[e]nd-of-life care consultations, also called advanced care planning or palliative care, would save $292,500.\u201d That\u2019s hardly a hefty sum. Lamkins said the changes would involve \u201ckeeping people out of institutions near the end of life, giving them more opportunities to manage their care-treatment plan.\u201d\n\nHe added that the change is designed \u201cto ensure that members facing serious illness and survival of less than six months are informed of care options and are able to make treatment decisions based on their individual values and goals of care.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, Laurel Patrick, a spokeswoman for the governor, pointed out that the phrase \u201cdeath panels\u201d is nowhere to be found in any of the health care change proposals. But that hasn\u2019t defused liberal ire about the panel\u2019s move.\n\nThat\u2019s because Walker has been one of the most outspoken conservative opponents of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen Sarah Palin was trying to derail Obamacare over \u2018death panels,\u2019 Scott Walker didn\u2019t say a word defending the need for people to have end-of-life counseling and instead on his first day as governor wasted taxpayer dollars suing the federal government over Obamacare,\u201d said Scot Ross, executive director of One Wisconsin Now. \u201cBut wrapped in a scheme that would make cash-strapped middle-class workers in Wisconsin pay even more for health care, Team Walker quietly slides this into the mix. The inclusion of the palliative counseling is critical, but Scott Walker would have saved families a lot of grief if he would have stood up to the Tea Party in 2010 instead of this backdoor deal now.\u201d\n\nRobert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin, voiced support for Walker\u2019s so-called death panels but said he was frustrated the governor didn\u2019t do more to defend the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe right, using Sarah Palin, shamelessly tried to call simple voluntary end-of-life consultation a \u2018death panel\u2019 early in the debate over Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a great irony that the Walker administration would now come forward with an end-of-life consultation provision. I still have to say that it\u2019s good policy, most likely, it\u2019s just incredible hypocrisy for them to come out with that after Walker has been one of the most disingenuous critics of the ACA.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "woodruffbets"}, "keywords": "Scott Walker, u.s. poli, Sarah Palin, 2016 Election", "publicationDate": 201505210915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Wisconsin governor and Obamacare critic is catching flak over a proposal to include consultations about end-of-life care\u2014aka Sarah Palin\u2019s dreaded \u201cdeath panels\u201d\u2014in his budget.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Are Death Panels Coming to Scott Walkers Wisconsin?", "tags": "entity:person/scott_walker,topic:politics,entity:person/sarah_palin,obsessional:2016-election", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Are \u2018Death Panels\u2019 Coming to Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin?\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/21/are-death-panels-coming-to-scott-walker-s-wisconsin.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/21/are-death-panels-coming-to-scott-walker-s-wisconsin/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47741494.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/21/are-death-panels-coming-to-scott-walker-s-wisconsin\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-21T09:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Betsy Woodruff\",\"tags\":[\"scott_walker\",\"politics\",\"sarah_palin\",\"2016-election\"]}", "news_keywords": "Scott Walker, US Politics, Sarah Palin, 2016 Election", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Betsy Woodruff", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-05-21T09:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/betsy-woodruffhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/21/are-death-panels-coming-to-scott-walker-s-wisconsin", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The Wisconsin governor and Obamacare critic is catching flak over a proposal to include consultations about end-of-life care\u2014aka Sarah Palin\u2019s dreaded \u201cdeath panels\u201d\u2014in his budget.", "title": "Are \u2018Death Panels\u2019 Coming to Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin?", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/21/are-death-panels-coming-to-scott-walker-s-wisconsin.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/21/are-death-panels-coming-to-scott-walker-s-wisconsin/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1432244834958.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/betsy-woodruff", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc08f\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s because the proposal includes \u201cconsultations about end-of-life care, which some called \u2018death panels,\u2019\u201d as the Wisconsin State Journal put it .\nDeath panels?!\n\u201cI\u2019d also call it evil that they\u2019re treating state employees at that level.\nQuick background: The Wisconsin state government is having some tough fiscal times, and Walker\u2019s budget proposal suggested substantial cuts in a number of areas, including to the University of Wisconsin system and to K-12 education.\nBut here we are, with the Wisconsin state government overseeing what\u2019s set to be the controversy-free implementation of new policies designed to save the state money through its employees\u2019 end-of-life decisions."}
