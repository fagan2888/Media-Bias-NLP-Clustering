The year is 1994. The U.S. economy is in the early years of a 16-year long period of expansion, the Cold War is over, globalization is kicking into high gear and the Internet is emerging as the Thing That Changes All Things. Sounds like a pretty good time to start a business, right?

Indeed it was, as members of the Class of ’94, which includes Amazon and Yahoo, will tell you. But 20 years later, here’s something to chew on: according to data from S&P CapitalIQ, of all the companies founded in 1994 that are still traded on a major index today, only six have made more than a billion dollars in cumulative profit in the two decades since.

And Amazon is far from the leader of that pack. In fact, if you’re looking for pure profit, you’d have been better off with video game retailer GameStop, or kidney dialysis provider DaVita HealthCare Partners. And Yahoo, long derided in the media for losing touch with the cutting edge of the dotcom business, is running rings around all of them.

Here are the details of the six members of 1994′s billion-dollar club:

1) Yahoo

$12.98bn in cumulative profit, $36bn market cap

If you read the technology press it may feel like Yahoo has been in perpetual crisis mode, teetering on the edge of irrelevance for much of the last decade. But one thing the company has been consistently able to do is make money, reporting annual profits of more than $500 million every year since 2004 (and more than $1 billion every year since 2010). They last year Yahoo reported a loss was way back in 2001.

2) Liberty Interactive Corp.

$5.28bn in cumulative profit, $14bn market cap

Formerly known as Liberty Media Corporation, the company has a convoluted history as part of media tycoon John Malone’s decades of complex deal making and restructuring. The present iteration of the company includes a portfolio of home shopping and e-commerce brands, as well as controlling stakes in TripAdvisor and Expedia and investments in both Time Warner and Time Warner Cable. Its total profit since 1994 is a tale of two very different decades: It lost about $12.5 billion from 1995 to 2004, and then pulled in about $17.7 billion in profit from 2005 to 2013.

$4.39bn in cumulative profit, $15.3bn market cap

If you want a nice stable way to earn money, offering dialysis services for patients suffering from kidney failure seems like a good way to do it: the company now serves 165,000 patients in almost 2,100 clinics around the country, and hasn’t reported an annual loss since 1999.

4) GameStop

$2.34bn in cumulative profit, $5.3 billion market cap

The video game retailer has been profitable for 12 of the 15 years it has been reporting results, but is dealing with with a slowdown in physical game sales. The company is trying to navigate the transition to mobile gaming and the rise of app stores, downloads and streaming games, and has been trimming its store count by 1% to 2% each year in recent years.

5) Amazon

$2.2bn in cumulative profit, $147bn in market cap

The magic of Amazon’s giant revenues, sky-high valuation and almost comical indifference to making a profit has been well documented. It made less money than GameStop in the last 20 years, but its investors are much more interested in the next 20, when its dominance of online retailing should, they hope, eventually turn into a river of profits.

6) Apartment Investment & Management Company (Aimco)

$1.83bn in cumulative profit, $5bn market cap

Aimco, a Denver-based real estate investment trust, owns about 41,000 apartments spread across 117 apartment communities. And as any rent-paying observer knows, the landlord rarely loses: In the case of Aimco, it has only lost money in three of the 20 years it has reported annual results, during the housing crisis years of 2009-12.
