But a thinning project sizzles every day in the middle of Rapid City, with barely a hint of smoke or public notice\n\nThe 70-acre project on city land in Skyline Wilderness Park began last September and is scheduled for completion in November.\n\nAnd as it progresses, a timber crew from Colorado disposes of slash from the tree cutting with a portable incinerator called the BurnBoss.\n\nIt burns with very little sign of smoke at any distance from the machine.\n\n\"Sometimes, when they load the machine it breaks the air curtain, so you do get brief period of smoke,\" Lt. Tim Weaver, a wildfire mitigation officer for the Rapid City Fire Department said. \"But it's really much, much less than if we were open-burning the material.\"\n\nThere's a lot of material coming out of the Skyline Drive Wilderness right now. And a lot more to come. Weaver says the dense pine trees have the potential to explode into a wildfire with the right ignition. And they also were more susceptible to the spread of mountain pine beetles that have moved into the area.\n\nThe project serves the dual purpose of slowing the spread of the mountain pine beetles and reducing the threat of fire. Along with reducing wildfire danger and slowing the spread of beetles, the project will clear pine from some areas to allow hardwoods varieties to grow.\n\nThe project is good news to nearby homeowner Ray Berberich, who has worried about the thick forest and its wildfire potential in the Skyline area.\n\n\"Yeah, overall, I think this whole skyline project and thinning it out is a good thing,\" Berberich said. \"Not only for fire but also for bugs.\"\n\nBerberich and several of his neighbors have thinned trees on their property. He's glad the public land is being thinned as well.\n\nAnd the BurnBoss is essential to the work. The firebox offers efficient disposal of slash, and also eliminates the possible spread of pine beetles, because the wood is burned on sight rather than being transported.\n\nThe diesel-powered blower in the BurnBoss creates a curtain of air that gets things cooking at 1,800 degrees in an open concrete box. Wood goes in, but other than small puffs of smoke and barely noticeable ash, little else comes out.\n\n\"Because it burns so hot, it consumes all of the products of combustion,\" Weaver said. \"So you don't have any smoke, you don't have any ash.\"\n\nAt least not enough for most people to notice.\n\nNews\n\nOutdoors {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
