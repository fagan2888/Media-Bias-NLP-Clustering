Ted Cruz, and we found some more claims about Obamacare that are false:\n\nCruz said unions, including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, want to \u201crepeal\u201d the health care law \u201cbecause it is a nightmare.\u201d Three unions used the word \u201cnightmare\u201d in a letter to Democratic leaders in Congress. But they asked that the law be fixed, not repealed.\n\nSen. Rand Paul incorrectly claimed \u201cyou will go to jail\u201d if you don\u2019t buy health insurance and refuse to pay the tax penalty. The law specifically states that those who do not pay the penalty \u201cshall not be subject to any criminal prosecution.\u201d Shortly after the law passed, the IRS commissioner at the time said the law precludes jail, but violators will likely face offsets against future tax refunds.\n\nThe lengthy speech by Cruz \u2014 which started Sept. 24, ended Sept. 25 and was occasionally supplemented by some of his Senate colleagues \u2014 was dominated mainly by generalities and opinions. But we found plenty of misleading claims in our first review of the record. Upon closer inspection, we\u2019ve found a few more.\n\nUnions Want to \u2018Repeal\u2019 Obamacare?\n\n\n\nCruz said unions, including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, want to \u201crepeal\u201d the health care law \u201cbecause it is a nightmare.\u201d Three unions used the word \u201cnightmare\u201d in a letter to Democratic leaders in Congress. But they asked that the law be fixed, not repealed. James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, has asked Cruz to stop \u201cmisusing\u201d the unions\u2019 words.\n\nCruz, Sept. 24: There is a reason why labor unions want out. There is a reason the Teamsters, who describe that they have been knocking on doors as loyal foot soldiers for the Democratic Party, are saying: This is a nightmare. Repeal Obamacare. Repeal it because it is a nightmare.\n\nPresidents of three labor unions criticized parts of the health care law in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The union leaders said the law had \u201cunintended consequences\u201d that will lead to several \u201cnightmare scenarios.\u201d They complained the law will \u201cdestroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week\u201d by creating incentives for employers to schedule workers for less than 30 hours a week. And they said the law taxes union workers with nonprofit health insurance plans to help pay for government subsidies those workers will not be eligible to receive.\n\nBut the letter didn\u2019t say lawmakers should \u201crepeal\u201d the law. Hoffa, Joseph Hansen of the United Food and Commercial Workers, and D. Taylor of UNITE HERE said they \u201ccontinue to stand behind real health care reform, but the law as it stands will hurt millions of Americans including the members of our respective unions.\u201d In conclusion, they wrote: \u201cWe are looking to you to make sure these changes are made.\u201d\n\nOn the same day that Cruz concluded his floor speech, Hoffa issued a statement telling the senator to stop misrepresenting what he and the other union presidents had said.\n\nHoffa, Sept. 25: Though we may have concerns with specific provisions of the ACA, we share the president\u2019s goal of ensuring that every American has affordable access to top-quality health care. It is on this main point that we disagree wholeheartedly with the efforts of extreme right-wing Republicans to gut the ACA. Any suggestion otherwise is simply political posturing. I call on Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. David Vitter and others to cease and desist from misusing our constructive comments in their destructive campaign to hobble the president and the nation.\n\nCruz didn\u2019t listen. He was back to using the words of Hoffa and company in a speech on the Senate floor on Sept. 27.\n\nBuy Insurance/ Pay Penalty/ or Jail?\n\n\n\nFor his part, Paul incorrectly claimed that people who do not buy health insurance next year and refuse to pay the tax penalty \u201cwill go to jail.\u201d The law specifically states that those who do not pay the tax penalty \u201cshall not be subject to any criminal prosecution.\u201d In 2010, then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman said the law precludes jail, and that enforcement will amount to offsets against future tax refunds.\n\nBut, according to Paul, jail is exactly what awaits those who refuse to buy insurance or pay the tax penalty.\n\nPaul, Sept. 25: That is what I think the senator from Texas has started, hopefully a rebellion against coercion, rebellion against mandates, a rebellion against everything that says that big government wants to shove something down your throat, they say take it or we will put people in jail. People say we aren\u2019t going to put anybody in jail. The heck they won\u2019t. You will get fined first. If you don\u2019t pay your fines, you will go to jail.\n\nAs we have written before, the law specifically precludes jail as a penalty for those who do not pay the fine for failing to buy insurance. It is spelled out in a section called \u201cWaiver of Criminal Penalties.\u201d (See page 131)\n\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act: In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by this section, such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure.\n\nThe law also spells out that the IRS can\u2019t use liens or levies as enforcement tools.\n\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act: The Secretary [of Health and Human Services] shall not file notice of lien with respect to any property of a taxpayer by reason of any failure to pay the penalty imposed by this section \u2026 or levy on any such property with respect to such failure.\n\nSo what exactly can the IRS do if people refuse to pay the tax penalty for non-compliance? Nasty letters, for starters, but ultimately the IRS says it would deduct the penalty amount from a person\u2019s future refunds, if the individual has any.\n\nThe IRS commissioner at the time was asked about enforcement options at a National Press Club event on April 5, 2010 (at the 35:50 mark).\n\nShulman, April 5, 2010: I think there\u2019s a couple important points that I would make, though, about our role in health reform. One is that these are not the kinds of things \u2014 check the box whether you\u2019re here or not [whether you have bought insurance] \u2014 that we send agents out about. These are things where you get a letter from us. Second is Congress was very careful to make sure that there was nothing too punitive in this bill. \u2026 First of all, there\u2019s no criminal sanctions for not paying this, and there\u2019s no ability to levy a bank account or do seizures, some of the other tools.\n\nLater in the same event, Shulman was asked, \u201cIf you can\u2019t use sanctions to collect health care fees, what will keep people from getting away with not signing up for insurance coverage?\u201d Shulman said the IRS may dock future tax refunds.\n\nShulman, April 5, 2010: My belief is while some people may play with the kind of question that was asked, the vast majority of American people have a healthy respect for the law and want to be compliant with their tax obligations and whatever else the law holds. People will get letters from us. We can actually do collection if need be. People can get offsets of their tax returns in future years, so there\u2019s a variety of ways for us to focus on things like fraud, things like abuse, and we\u2019re gonna run a balanced program.\n\nIn short, Paul\u2019s warning about health insurance scofflaws going to jail is simply incorrect.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley and D\u2019Angelo Gore\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Buy Insurance/ Pay Penalty/ or Jail?\nSen.
