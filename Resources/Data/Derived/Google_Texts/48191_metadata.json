There are roughly 3,700 American troops there now, compared to 2,300 in January 2015.\n\nThat number of military contractors represents just a fraction of the contractors employed by the U.S. in Iraq. In addition to the 2,028 Pentagon contractors, another 5,800 are employed by other agencies, including the State Department.\n\nIn the 1980s, the U.S. military decided to hire contractors to work in support roles that had historically been done by troops. That includes jobs like food services, maintaining housing units, water purification and \u201call those those other things that go with maintaining troops in the field for a long time,\u201d Brennan said. The plus-up in Iraq is likely for contractors in those types of roles.\n\nRelated: U.S.-led coalition aims to recapture ISIS 'caliphate' in Iraq, Syria\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s occurred then is as you deploy more forces to theater, you have to provide increased total number of contractors,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, there was a little bit more than one-to-one ratio of contractors to soldiers, he said. Now in Iraq, more than 30 percent (618) of the contractors are working in maintenance and logistics jobs. Nearly 20 percent (381) are translators and 13 percent (263) are in base support positions, according to the data. Contractors are also working in security, transportation, construction, communication support, training, management and administrative roles.\n\nNearly 70 percent of the contractors are American citizens, 20 percent are third-country nationals and the remaining are local Iraqis. The number of contractors the Pentagon can employ in Iraq is not capped, according to Col. Steve Warren, spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve.\n\nMany of the contractors in Iraq and neighboring countries are from well known warzone companies like KBR, DynCorp, and Fluor Corporation, the three firms hired by the Army\u2019s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or LogCap. The Pentagon awards individual \u201ctask order\u201d deals to these each time it needs to support troops overseas.\n\nRelated: Iraq's troubled finances slow efforts to rebuild Ramadi\n\n\u201cIt makes tailoring a unit much more responsive to the needs of the commander because you don\u2019t have to try to rip people [with a trade specialty] from other installations,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nKBR, in a November presentation to investors, said its LogCap services work in Iraq \u201cgrew in the period with further growth possible.\u201d\n\nBesides the LogCap contractors, the Pentagon can award independent contracts, according to Andrew Hunter, a former Pentagon official who now director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington. In some instances, the Pentagon hires contractors already working for the government in order to speed up the process.\n\nEven though U.S. troops withdrew fully from Iraq in 2011, many contractors stayed behind working at the American embassy or in logistical roles maintaining Iraq\u2019s military equipment.\n\nCongress ordered the Pentagon to provide detailed information about battlefield contractors following an incident in which private military contractors working for Blackwater USA killed 17 Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square in Baghdad in September 2007.\n\nNot all contractors in the warzone are base guards, laundry workers or chefs. The CIA and other intelligence agencies still use contractors like the former Blackwater or $2.2 billion firm DynCorp and other for paramilitary services. The number of those contractors, some who are closer to the battlefield than the military advisors, is classified and unknown to the public.\n\nU.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, has sent Congress regular updates about the number of contractors being employed in Iraq and Afghanistan since August 2008. In July 2008, just following the 2007 troop surge, there were 162,428 Pentagon-funded contractors in Iraq, according to the data.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.
