The way he played in Week 1, it's difficult to imagine how much better he'll get.\n\nThe Andover Trojans have begun their journey toward a repeat playoff appearance, where they won a playoff game in 2012 before losing to eventual 5A champion Bishop Carroll. In order to improve on last year's achievements, Eli Renoux will play a major part.\n\nHe is a wing back, meaning he'll line up as a running back and wide receiver, while serving as the team's special teams returner as well. Basically, Andover head coach Mike Lee just wants to get the ball in his hands, and let him do his magic.\n\nNever was that magic on greater display than against Campus in the Trojans' first game, when Renoux returned a punt 66 yards for a touchdown and dropped every jaw in the stadium to do it.\n\nThe sophomore stiff-armed two potential tacklers away, navigated through tight holes, hurdled another defender, and executed a spin move to deke two other Colts before running free for the final 40 yards.\n\nRenoux helped Andover defeat Campus 41-12.\n\nTo view the KAKE News story on Renoux, click the video box above.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "September 11, 2013 - \n\n Eli Renoux is just a sophomore, experiencing the beginning of his high school football career.
