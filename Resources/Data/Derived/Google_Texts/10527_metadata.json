At one point, it even looked like Bettis might pitch the Rockies\u2019 first-ever solo one-hitter.\n\nBut Bettis faltered in the ninth, giving up two runs on four hits. Still, there was no wiping the smile off his face after he led the Rockies to an 11-2 victory over San Francisco, giving them a split in the four-game series.\n\n\u201cI felt great and I had everything working,\u201d Bettis said. \u201cI was able to throw my curve for strikes and throw my fastball down and away. I was in a really good place today.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies and Giants endured 7 hours, 7 minutes of rain delays during the series, including a delay of 2 hours, 10 minutes before Sunday\u2019s game. But once the sun peeked through, the Rockies came out swinging. Their 11 runs were a season high and came on 11 hits, including four from Nolan Arenado, who was a double short of hitting for the cycle.\n\n\u201cIt would have been cool, but the most important thing is that we broke out and got back on track,\u201d said Arenado, who tied a career high with four RBIs. \u201cChad was amazing. He was throwing strike after strike, and his curveball was great.\u201d\n\nBettis\u2019 first pitch of the game was a 91 mph fastball to Nori Aoki, who drove it up the middle for a single. After that, the Giants couldn\u2019t touch Bettis, at least not until Matt Duffy scooted a single to right to lead off the eighth. Duffy was quickly erased when Bettis coaxed a double-play grounder out of Joaquin Arias.\n\n\u201cThat was about as good as it gets today with Chad. That was a big-time performance against a very good club,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cI was hoping to get him through that ninth (inning) there, but he came up just a little bit short.\u201d\n\nBettis was bidding to become the first Rockies pitcher to throw a shutout since Tyler Matzek did it against San Diego last season on Sept. 14. The Giants ended Bettis\u2019 quest when Aoki led off the ninth with a double and subsequently scored on Joe Panik\u2019s single.\n\nBettis pitched 8 innings, and ultimately surrendered six hits as he notched his second career victory, his first as a starter.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got a little tired there in the eighth and ninth,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite have my legs under me.\u201d\n\nArenado\u2019s big game began in the second inning with a leadoff triple off Giants right-hander Tim Hudson. He scored on Ben Paulsen\u2019s groundout.\n\nThen the Rockies exploded for eight runs in the fourth, highlighted by Arenado\u2019s three-run shot off Hudson, Arenado\u2019s team-leading eighth homer of the season. Arenado also singled in the fourth as the Rockies sent 10 men to the plate. The eight runs were the most in an inning for the Rockies this season, and their most since scoring eight against the Dodgers at Coors Field last Sept. 17.\n\nArenado stalked a double in the sixth, trying to become the eighth Rockie to hit for the cycle, but had to settle for a single up the middle. He popped out to center on his final at-bat in the eighth but received a nice ovation from the baseball-savvy fans behind the Rockies\u2019 dugout.\n\nHudson, 39, remained winless in Denver after 10 starts. After giving up eight runs on six hits in 3 innings, his LoDo record fell to 0-3 while his ERA rose to 7.69. He is 5-1 with 2.15 ERA in eight starts against the Rockies away from Coors Field.\n\nThe Rockies finished their homestand 4-4, and their offense is finally getting cranked up. They begin a three-game series at Cincinnati on Monday.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nHitting their stride\n\nThe Rockies finally cranked up their offense over the weekend during a four-game series against the Giants at Coors Field:\n\n\u2022 Scored a season-high 11 runs Sunday\n\n\u2022 Averaged eight runs per game\n\n\u2022 Averaged 11.5 hits per game\n\n\u2022 Batted .364", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chad Bettis leads Rockies to win over Giants", "title": "Chad Bettis leads Rockies to win over Giants", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/24/chad-bettis-leads-rockies-to-win-over-giants/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__chad-bettisp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__chad-bettisp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T19:32:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T10:18:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c77\"", "article_summary": "The Giants ended Bettis\u2019 quest when Aoki led off the ninth with a double and subsequently scored on Joe Panik\u2019s single.\nThe sun finally broke through at Coors Field on Sunday afternoon, and it shined directly on Chad Bettis.\nAt one point, it even looked like Bettis might pitch the Rockies\u2019 first-ever solo one-hitter.\nAfter that, the Giants couldn\u2019t touch Bettis, at least not until Matt Duffy scooted a single to right to lead off the eighth.\nBut Bettis faltered in the ninth, giving up two runs on four hits."}
