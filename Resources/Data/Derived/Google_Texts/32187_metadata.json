What he came up with, and has stuck with since, is \u201cmiddle-out economics,\u201d or sometimes \u201cmiddle-class economics,\u201d which is supposed to communicate his and the Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to seeing the middle class \u2014 and not the 1 percent \u2014 as the true fount of economic growth.\n\nBut although Obama and other Democrats are evidently happy enough with the branding, the actual policy approach that defines a middle-out economics has remained somewhat fuzzy. And that\u2019s where \u201cHollowed Out: Why the Economy Doesn\u2019t Work without a Strong Middle Class,\u201d the new book from the Center for American Progress\u2019s David Madland, steps in. While politicians\u2019 focus on the middle class can sometimes feel like empty pandering, Madland\u2019s book makes a strong and clear argument that an economy geared around the middle class is not only more in keeping with democratic and liberal norms, but it\u2019s simply better economics, too.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with Madland about his book, inequality, and what he sees as the right economic agenda for liberalism in the 21st century. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhen did you start thinking about a strong middle class as not only a good thing unto itself but as a necessary component of keeping the U.S. economy healthy?\n\nIt actually started way back when I was in high school.\n\nI coached baseball camps throughout the summers, and I had this sense that in the more middle-class neighborhoods where we would do the camps \u2014 because we would move all around \u2014 things worked better. The kids would immediately trust each other and knew how to work together well. So I had this germ of an idea, way back then, that there was something about a strong middle class that led to better outcomes.\n\nWhat kind of outcomes do you have in mind?\n\nOne of the key things is that a strong middle class leads to greater trust, and trust might seem a bit abstract, but, really, it\u2019s essential to any functioning economy and society. You need to be able to work with people that you don\u2019t already know, that aren\u2019t part of your family, etc.\n\nYou can see over the past several decades that trust has declined sharply in the U.S., and a key factor in that has been rising inequality, because people have far different experiences \u2014 or they don\u2019t think others are like them.\n\nSome of the costs of that [lack of trust] for our society \u2014 think of the number of lawyers we have.\n\nThe share of lawyers in our economy has doubled over the past several decades. It was steady from the early 1900s to the \u201860s, and since inequality started rising, the share of lawyers in the economy has risen sharply. While lawyers might do important things, they really are just a cost, a burden that makes business transactions harder.\n\nI want to continue on this trust theme in a moment, but first I wanted to ask you to explain why the trickle-down theory of economic management is wrong.\n\nThe underlying idea behind trickle-down, really, is that high levels of economic inequality are good and that if you help the rich get richer through things like tax cuts and less regulation, that will buy some greater economic growth.\n\nThe premise that inequality is good is fundamentally wrong. It might be true in a very narrow sense that, yes, [it provides] some incentive to work harder; but that ignores the larger context. When inequality gets to extreme levels, you have all these harms that happen as a result. I talked about trust; you have governance getting corrupted, you have fewer people able to develop their human capital. And you also have weakening of demand, which we saw that in the Great Recession\u2019s aftermath.\n\nOkay, so how does that kind of extreme inequality result in lower levels of trust?\n\nThe basic idea behind trust is this idea of reciprocity. You do unto others as they would do unto you. They treat you well, you treat them well. If they don\u2019t treat you well, you know, an eye for an eye. Behind that is this idea that you think you share things in common. Inequality erodes that idea. [It makes] you think people are far less like you.\n\nWe can see the evidence for this in lots of different ways. In one of the studies that I think is most interesting, [researchers] left a wallet in cities throughout the world. In regions that had greater inequality, fewer wallets were returned. What\u2019s happening is people think [other] people are not like them when they live in an unequal society; and they\u2019re less likely to trust them, which leads to all sorts of harmful consequences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tackling inequality isn't just a moral necessity -- it's an economic one, author-expert David Madland tells Salon", "title": "Plutocrats torched the economy: Our new Gilded Age & the hollowing out of America\u2019s middle class", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tackling inequality isn't just a moral necessity -- it's an economic one, author-expert David Madland tells Salon", "title": "Plutocrats torched the economy: Our new Gilded Age & the hollowing out of America\u2019s middle class", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/plutocrats_torched_the_economy_our_new_gilded_age_the_hollowing_out_of_americas_middle_class/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/jeb_dimon_capitol_building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tackling inequality isn't just a moral necessity -- it's an economic one, author-expert David Madland tells Salon", "title": "Plutocrats torched the economy: Our new Gilded Age & the hollowing out of America\u2019s middle class", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/jeb_dimon_capitol_building.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Capitalism, david madland, Editor's Picks, Inequality, Labor Rights, Middle Class, trickle-down economics, wage theft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb22\"", "article_summary": "And that\u2019s where \u201cHollowed Out: Why the Economy Doesn\u2019t Work without a Strong Middle Class,\u201d the new book from the Center for American Progress\u2019s David Madland, steps in.\nWhen did you start thinking about a strong middle class as not only a good thing unto itself but as a necessary component of keeping the U.S. economy healthy?\nSo I had this germ of an idea, way back then, that there was something about a strong middle class that led to better outcomes.\nWhile politicians\u2019 focus on the middle class can sometimes feel like empty pandering, Madland\u2019s book makes a strong and clear argument that an economy geared around the middle class is not only more in keeping with democratic and liberal norms, but it\u2019s simply better economics, too.\nOne of the key things is that a strong middle class leads to greater trust, and trust might seem a bit abstract, but, really, it\u2019s essential to any functioning economy and society."}
