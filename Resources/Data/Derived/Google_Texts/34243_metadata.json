This remarkably slow growth in Medicare spending stems from a number of factors, including a reduction in the average age of the Medicare population (reflecting the influx of baby boomers) and payment cuts to providers--particularly physicians, who are slated to receive a 20 percent pay cut this April.\n\nBut another important factor is the phenomenally slow growth in Medicare spending in recent years, as shown below. Although some of this slowdown is well understood\u2014reflecting payment cuts under the Affordable Care Act and the expiration of patents of a number of blockbuster drugs\u2014much of the slowdown in Medicare spending is not understood by analysts. CBO\u2019s research suggests that the Medicare slowdown does not appear to be attributable to the recession, and my work, using a variety of data sources, concurs.\n\n\n\nSource: CMS/BEA. Note: The chart omits 2006, the year Medicare Part D was introduced.\n\nCBO has made the not-unreasonable assumption that this slowdown will persist for some time. But, because we don\u2019t understand why Medicare spending has slowed, this assumption must be viewed as highly uncertain. It is possible that, rather than persisting, the slowdown could reverse itself, and spending growth could surprise us on the upside in coming years.\n\nFor a simple explanation of the implication of health spending growth for the sustainability of the federal budget, see my new, short video:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louise Sheiner explains that uncertainty around health care spending's decline in the Congressional Budget Office's budget projections has huge implications for fiscal policy as the difference between current path and historic patterns could mean a spending difference of 2 percent of GDP.", "title": "An Uncertain Outlook for Medicare Spending", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "Louise Sheiner explains that uncertainty around health care spending's decline in the Congressional Budget Office's budget projections has huge implications for fiscal policy as the difference between current path and historic patterns could mean a spending difference of 2 percent of GDP.", "title": "An Uncertain Outlook for Medicare Spending", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2015/01/26-health-spending-trajectories-sheiner", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/s/sf%20sj/sheiner_video001/sheiner_video001_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "website", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 151106990, "title": "An Uncertain Outlook for Medicare Spending", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/images/s/sf%20sj/sheiner_video001/sheiner_video001_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Louise Sheiner explains that uncertainty around health care spending's decline in the Congressional Budget Office's budget projections has huge implications for fiscal policy as the difference between current path and historic patterns could mean a spending difference of 2 percent of GDP."}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Blog Posts", "title": "An Uncertain Outlook for Medicare Spending", "topicsspecialized": "The Federal Budget ; U.S. Budget Deficit ; Medicare ; U.S. Economic Performance", "topicsbroad": "Fiscal Policy ; Economics ; Health", "centers": "The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy", "experts": "Louise Sheiner", "programs": "Economic Studies", "authors": "Louise Sheiner", "contentdate": "2015/01/26 16:22:00", "researchactivities": "The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy ; Economic Studies", "topics": "Fiscal Policy ; Economics ; Health ; The Federal Budget ; U.S. Budget Deficit ; Medicare ; U.S. Economic Performance"}, "article": {"tag": "U.S. Economic Performance", "published_time": "2015-01-26", "modified_time": "2015-1-26", "author": "Louise Sheiner"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ed2\"", "article_summary": "But, because we don\u2019t understand why Medicare spending has slowed, this assumption must be viewed as highly uncertain.\nBut another important factor is the phenomenally slow growth in Medicare spending in recent years, as shown below.\nCBO\u2019s research suggests that the Medicare slowdown does not appear to be attributable to the recession, and my work, using a variety of data sources, concurs.\nFor a simple explanation of the implication of health spending growth for the sustainability of the federal budget, see my new, short video:\nIt is possible that, rather than persisting, the slowdown could reverse itself, and spending growth could surprise us on the upside in coming years."}
