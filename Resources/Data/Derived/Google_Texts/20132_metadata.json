Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nI feel bad for Charlie Sheen. Despite his reckless behavior, I wouldn\u2019t wish bad health or a deadly disease on anyone. But it is interesting to remember that not too long ago Charlie Sheen\u2019s catch-phrase was \u201cWINNING!\u201d That didn\u2019t turn out so well, did it?\n\nWhat appeared to be \u201cwinning\u201d was actually losing. When you\u2019re in a mental haze, either due to mentally illness, or your mind is shrouded by the fog of drugs and alcohol, things aren\u2019t what they appear to be.\n\nI\u2019m been giving a lot of thought to what President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and leading Democrats are doing and saying. Some conservatives have compared liberalism to mental illness. Just like Charlie Sheen, Democrats think they are winning. But they are suffering from delusion. They may be headed for a similar rude awakening.\n\nHillary\u2019s husband Bill was elected twice by hiding his true liberal views and trying to appear like a moderate Southern Democrat. Obama was elected twice by hiding his true ultra-liberal views and trying to appear as a moderate and \u201ca uniter, not divider.\u201d Today those lessons are lost or forgotten.\n\nToday virtually every position taken by Obama and Hillary, is in direct opposition to the wishes of the majority of American people. That\u2019s not my opinion. Just look at the polls on each issue. The views and policies spewed and supported by Obama and Hillary are getting more and more extreme. America may be a center right nation, or perhaps at times dead center. But one thing it\u2019s not is extreme radical left.\n\nYet Obama, Hillary and leading Democrats aren\u2019t even attempting to hide or moderate their views anymore. They are out of the closet. It\u2019s the \u201cFull Monty.\u201d There\u2019s no hiding it anymore. They are loud, proud and extreme left. Democrats can\u2019t even see \u201ccenter\u201d from their homes anymore.\n\nHere are 15 key points and policies where Obama and Hillary and their socialist cabal think they are \u201cwinning\u201d but are actually badly out of step with the America people:\n\nAmazingly, Hillary is not only on board with Obama\u2019s agenda, in many instances she wants to go further to the left (with spending, illegal immigration, importation of Syrian refugees, and gun control). These views run clearly counter to the majority of Americans\u2026and yet Democrats no longer care.\n\nDemocrats are fooling themselves. Republican landslides in virtually every race in both November 2014 and just this past November 2015 are signs of the displeasure and anger. It\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn reaction to this indifference, Obama has turned the vast majority of America almost completely red on a local basis. In seven years under President Obama, Democrats have lost an unheard of 900+ state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69 House seats, and 13 Senate seats.\n\nThe so-called \u201cSilent Majority\u201d has been awakened and they\u2019re focused and motivated like never before to save America for their children and grandchildren. They will also show up and vote in 2016 like never before. Because they understand this indifference to the wishes of the American people must be punished like never before.\n\nCharlie Sheen was never winning. It only looked that way in his foggy, delusional state. Obama, Hillary and their socialist cabal aren\u2019t winning either. It may look like it to them right now. But this isn\u2019t even close to winning. It is pure madness.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
