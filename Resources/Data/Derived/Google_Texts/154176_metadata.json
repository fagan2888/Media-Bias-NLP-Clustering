A packed schedule came with the job, as did a long title: executive director of the Destination Medical Center\u2019s Economic Development Agency.\n\nThe title probably doesn\u2019t ring a bell for most Minnesotans, but it should. The DMC will cost taxpayers more than the Vikings stadium. It will double Rochester\u2019s population in a generation. It will bring tens of thousands of jobs. And, if all goes well, it will rain billions in new tax revenue as it cements the Mayo Clinic\u2019s reputation for being the world\u2019s premier hospital.\n\nStanding at the intersection of all the groups trying to make this happen is Clarke, the project\u2019s caretaker, traffic cop and chief cheerleader. Clarke isn\u2019t the visionary behind the project \u2014 that falls to the Mayo and the city of Rochester \u2014 but Clarke is the project\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cCertainly if I wanted to connect with anything DMC related, I would go right to Lisa,\u201d said Tim Tripp, of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Office of University Economic Development. \u201cThere would be no one else who would even come into my mind.\u201d\n\nDestination Medical Center EDA director Lisa Clarke, right, and communications chief Mary Welder crossed Broadway Avenue in Rochester. The DMC has two approved projects: a hotel, retail and housing complex that will replace three buildings on Broadway, below left, and an overhaul of the historic Chateau Theater, right.\n\nRural childhood\n\nGrowing up the daughter of a banker and homemaker in rural Wells, Minn., Clarke was the third child of four. She spent her school years taking advantage of what she considered the benefit of growing up in a small town: \u201cYou kind of get to try everything,\u201d she said. That meant drama, cross-country running, basketball and track and field at Wells-Easton high school, home of the Wildcats. She played the bassoon in the school band and still loves the instrument\u2019s distinct sound. \u201cLove, love, love it.\u201d\n\nIt was in college at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse that Clarke found her interests spreading across several disciplines. Science, health, communications: \u201cIt was hard for me to pick one area. I could probably still be there,\u201d she said. She left La Crosse with a bachelor of science degree. She later got an MBA at the University of St. Thomas.\n\nAfter school, Clarke stopped playing music but kept running and saw her personal exercise rituals grow to include yoga and walking in the summer and swimming in the winter. She usually starts each day at 5:22 a.m., kicking off the day with a homemade double-skim latte (no froth).\n\nToday, getting outside for a run is what she calls her creative time. \u201cIt\u2019s just beautiful think time,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was working for the YMCA when a friend told her about a public affairs job at Mayo. She would go on to spend 17 years there.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to be a banner waver of Mayo Clinic,\u201d she said. She had grown up knowing Mayo\u2019s reputation, but it wasn\u2019t until she started working there that she saw how Mayo handled patients, constantly asking if the hospital was serving the patient best.\n\nThe move to Mayo required leaving Minneapolis for Rochester, and her first impressions were mostly positive, she said. No traffic jams, for one thing, plus friendly people.\n\nIn 2009, when Mayo started talking about the health care environment, the DMC began to take shape. Clarke was there from the beginning. Mayo, in order to stay competitive with places like Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, said it needed a massive reinvestment program that included a public commitment to make Rochester a first-class city.\n\nIn 2013, the Legislature approved the 20-year project: $585 million in public funds for infrastructure fixes with $3.5 billion in Mayo investments, and another $2 billion in private investment.\n\nIt was Clarke who helped marshal DMC through the Legislature, said Gary Smith, president of Rochester Area Economic Development Inc.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good listener, number one; she believes in what she\u2019s doing, number two; and, number three, she knows what she doesn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. That last point means Clarke doesn\u2019t try to take on tasks she\u2019s not suited for, but instead delegates to good people, said Smith. \u201cShe\u2019s not trying to do all this herself,\u201d he said.\n\nJust a few months after DMC\u2019s passage in 2013, Clarke led a series of public meetings. Eight committees were created, each made up of locals representing a wide range of careers and backgrounds.\n\nRochester businessman Brandon Sampson, the founder of a prosthetics business called the Limb Lab, sat on a committee and recalls Clarke keeping everyone focused.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest fears people said is, \u2018Is this just going to be something that\u2019s forced upon the community?\u2019 and I think they did a really good job of putting that fear at ease,\u201d he said.\n\nClarke opened a street-level office in downtown Rochester this summer. It\u2019s connected to the Rochester skyway, and, perhaps more significantly, it sits halfway between the Mayo Clinic and Rochester City Hall.\n\nRochester agreed in May to pay $6 million for the Chateau Theater, a former vaudeville and movie house, as part of the city\u2019s Destination Medical Center redevelopment.\n\nTying together that partnership between the city and Mayo Clinic is a complicated, exhausting job, said Dr. Clark Otley, chairman of Mayo\u2019s dermatology department and a DMC-EDA board member.\n\n\u201cShe has a gigantic amount of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job she is doing is herculean, and we need a herculean person to do a job as busy and complex as this is.\u201d\n\nSome have lamented the project\u2019s pace: It likely won\u2019t reach the $200 million in private funding needed to release promised state funds until 2017. Clarke and others say more investment is coming, and that the size of the plan required a cautious and exhaustive planning process first.\n\nIn the past few months, Clarke has hired three staffers to handle communications, finance and administrative tasks. She also nabbed Patrick Seeb from the St. Paul Riverfront Corp., which he led for 20 years. Credited with helping to steer $4 billion of investment in St. Paul, Seeb has nursing degrees and has led medical organizations.\n\nR.T. Rybak, the former Minneapolis mayor and current DMC Corp. board member, praised Clarke for her hiring of Seeb, calling him an \u201cexceptionally strong\u201d hire.\n\n\u201cSometimes efforts like this have a very opinionated visionary at the center who tries to convince all the players of a direction. That\u2019s not her,\u201d Rybak said of Clarke.\n\nIt\u2019s been Clarke\u2019s job instead to get the state, the clinic and the community working together, making sure everyone feels they\u2019re being heard, responding to the board\u2019s concerns while seeking out public opinion, he said. In a city of 111,000 people with a clinic that employs 32,000, and a DMC board chaired by Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, there\u2019s no shortage of opinions about what Rochester should become.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been about facilitating \u2026 and I think that\u2019s been a very smart choice in this case,\u201d said Rybak. \u201cI\u2019m not positive Lisa sleeps, but I know she gets a lot done.\u201d\n\nLisa Clarke Age: 54 Lives: Eyota, Minn.
