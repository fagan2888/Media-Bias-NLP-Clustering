Tess Stynes reports the $450 million deal with Tolaram Africa Foods includes a 50% stake in Nigeria-based food distributor Multipro and an option to acquire a stake in Tolaram in the future. Kellogg CEO John Bryant said sub-Saharan Africa offers a \u201ctremendous\u201d opportunity for growth.\n\nThe founder of Mara Group, Ashish Thakkar, shares Bryant\u2019s optimism about Africa\u2019s growth prospects and is launching a pan-African e-commerce company to capitalize on that growth. Thakkar unveiled his plans in an interview with WSJ Frontiers in New York, explaining that the new company, Mara Sokoni, would create an online \u201cmarketplace for global brands to plug into to sell locally in Africa, and for local brands to sell nationally, regionally and globally.\u201d\n\nIn tandem with the launch of the e-commerce platform, Mara is building a logistics company, Mara Xpress, to handle \u201clast-mile delivery\u201d across the continent.\n\nUganda\u2019s mission to capitalize on its oil reserves took a step forward with the news that the deal to construct a planned 30,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery should soon be sealed. The WSJ\u2019s Nicholas Bariyo reports that the Russian firm RT Global Resources expects to reach a final deal in October for the $2.5 billion refinery.\n\nThe country\u2019s plans for a pipeline to deliver future crude production to the coast appeared to take a step backward, though. After agreeing with Nairobi last month to route the pipeline through northern Kenya, Uganda revealed it is now is considering a pipeline through Tanzania as a cheaper option.\n\nGhana\u2019s struggles continued. Fitch Ratings this week affirmed its negative outlook on the country, noting that \u201cfiscal and external risks remain high, complicated by a slowing economy and low commodity prices.\u201d\n\nCocoa farmers in Ghana. Reuters\n\nGhana has also struggled to meet its cocoa production targets. The Journal\u2019s Katherine Dunn reports that cocoa farmers had been expected to produce 800,000 tons over the past season, which ends this month, but fell short by 100,000 tons. The country\u2019s cocoa board did, however, manage to secure a $1.8 billion syndicated loan this week to fund the next cocoa-growing season, which is expected to yield 850,000 tons.\n\nWith its currency still under pressure, the country\u2019s central bank pushed up interest rates by one percentage point to a lofty 25.0% this week. London-based analyst Capital Economics predicts that monetary conditions in Ghana will remain tight \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d.\n\nFitch also presented a bleak picture for the Republic of Congo\u2019s growth prospects and revised its outlook for the country to negative. \u201cGDP growth is set to decelerate rapidly in 2015, hindered by a temporary slump in oil production, a sharp fall in public investment and struggling exports, Fitch said. The agency slashed its GDP growth forecast for 2015 to 2.5%\u2014the lowest rate in eight years.\n\nBurkina Faso\u2019s future turned sharply bleaker this week after supporters of former president Blaise Compaore ousted the country\u2019s transitional government just weeks before elections aimed at establishing democracy there. The WSJ\u2019s Heidi Vogt and Drew Hinshaw report that world leaders condemned the coup, which triggered a wave of violence through the country.\n\nThe risk of political conflict is rising in Argentina, writes the Journal\u2019s Taos Turner, after a provincial court annulled the recent election of ruling-party candidate Juan Manzur to the governorship of Tucuman province, citing vote fraud. Presidential Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez called the ruling \u201ccoup-mongering\u201d and the leader of Argentina\u2019s Lower House charged it\u2019s \u201cthe gravest thing to happen since the return of democracy.\u201d\n\nTension between Venezuela and Colombia, heightened by Venezuela\u2019s recent closure of sections of the border, looks set to ease. Juan Forero reports that the two countries\u2019 presidents have agreed to meet in Ecuador next week to discuss the issue.\n\nPeople carrying their household belongings across the T\u00e1chira River that separates Venezuela from the city of C\u00facuta, Colombia. Eliecer Mantilla/Associated Press\n\nVenezuela\u2019s president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro may have been hoping the issue would divert attention from the dire state of his country\u2019s economy. Analyst GlobalSource Partners forecasts that inflation will approach 300% this year, Kejal Vyas writes. The firm also expects GDP to shrink by 10.3%, 7.4% and 5.1% in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and warns \u201cthe risk of social unrest is high.\u201d\n\nFrontier-market investors excited by the prospect that Peru might soon be joining the ranks of frontier markets may be disappointed, Ryan Dube writes. Peruvian officials and business leaders are stepping up efforts to convince index provider MSCI that the country\u2019s market shouldn\u2019t be relegated to frontier status from its current position as an emerging market. But some analysts say the concerns are overblown\u2014and the change could actually be positive.\n\nThose looking to tap opportunities in Iran could also find their hopes are misplaced, Nick Elliott reports. According to Henry Balani, head of innovation at Accuity, a compliance data and screening company, as the nuclear deal takes effect there will be a piecemeal lifting of sanctions by different countries that will make the sanctions regime more complicated rather than less.\n\nThe next hot frontier? Associated Press\n\nCuba is suffering no such confusion, however. The Obama administration late this week announced plans to further loosen sanctions. The latest changes will further facilitate travel to the island, expand telecommunications and Internet services as well as allow some to establish offices and bank accounts there, Felicia Schwartz writes.\n\nWith Cuba and Iran tiptoeing back into the fold of countries that are open for investment, the most adventurous of frontier investors are having to look further afield. In an interview with the Journal\u2019s Tim Puko and Tatyana Shumsky, Jim Rogers, renowned as the co-founder with George Soros of the Quantum Fund, reveals he is doing just that\u2014and makes the case for the ultimate frontier market.\n\nKey Stories from the WSJ\n\nEgypt Swears in New Government\n\nGerman Businesses Press Hard to Build Their Presence in Iran\n\nLiberia\u2019s Port Shows Surge in Trade as Nation Recovers from Ebola\n\nTPG Chooses Morocco for Debut Africa Investment\n\nVietnam Cozies Up to Japan in South China Sea Strategy\n\nUS Buyout Firm Takes First Steps Into Vietnam\n\nSri Lanka Plans Legal and Political Change to Foster Postwar Reconciliation\n\nYemen\u2019s Prime Minister Returns From Exile\n\nIn Africa, So Much Sun, So Little Electricity\n\nCongolese Symphony Hits High Notes Around the Globe\n\nAround the Web\n\nNigeria To Renegotiate Oil Contracts\n\nKenya Inks Nuclear Power Deal With China\n\nPakistan Cuts Interest Rates to 42-year Low\n\nBangladesh May Choose Japan Over China for Port and Power Projects\n\nArgentina Wins In U.S. Court; Bad Time For Bonds?\n\nCorrea: Ecuador\u2018s Economy Will Not Grow This Year\n\nSign up here to have This Week on the Frontiers delivered to your inbox.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Kellogg launches a $450m African deal, Burkina Faso's government is ousted, Mara Group plans a pan-African online marketplace, Venezuela and Colombia look to mend fences, and a veteran investor touts the ultimate frontier market.", "title": "This Week on the Frontiers: Opportunities and Costs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/09/19/this-week-on-the-frontiers-opportunities-and-costs/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KJ720_ghanac_P_20150919100932.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "This Week on the Frontiers: Opportunities and Costs", "description": "Kellogg launches a $450m African deal, Burkina Faso's government is ousted, Mara Group plans a pan-African online marketplace, Venezuela and Colombia look to mend fences, and a veteran investor touts the ultimate frontier market.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Dan Keeler", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Kellogg launches a $450m African deal, Burkina Faso's government is ousted, Mara Group plans a pan-African online marketplace, Venezuela and Colombia look to mend fences, and a veteran investor touts the ultimate frontier market.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-09-19T14:49:23-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/09/19/this-week-on-the-frontiers-opportunities-and-costs/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-2225", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Kellogg launches a $450m African deal, Burkina Faso's government is ousted, Mara Group plans a pan-African online marketplace, Venezuela and Colombia look to mend fences, and a veteran investor touts the ultimate frontier market.", "title": "This Week on the Frontiers: Opportunities and Costs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/09/19/this-week-on-the-frontiers-opportunities-and-costs/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KJ720_ghanac_P_20150919100932.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-2225", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-19T14:54:38-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The country\u2019s plans for a pipeline to deliver future crude production to the coast appeared to take a step backward, though.\nCorrea: Ecuador\u2018s Economy Will Not Grow This YearSign up here to have This Week on the Frontiers delivered to your inbox.\nJuan Forero reports that the two countries\u2019 presidents have agreed to meet in Ecuador next week to discuss the issue.\nThe Obama administration late this week announced plans to further loosen sanctions.\nWith its currency still under pressure, the country\u2019s central bank pushed up interest rates by one percentage point to a lofty 25.0% this week."}
