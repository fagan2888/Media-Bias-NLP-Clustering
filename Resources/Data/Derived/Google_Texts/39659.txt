Ted Cruz's campaign is out with a new Christmas video — a parody ad that earned more than 1 million views on YouTube over the weekend.

The ad, which was first reported by the Independent Journal Review and actually ran on TV, is well-produced and well-written, playing off Cruz having read "Green Eggs and Ham" to his two young girls on the Senate floor during a 2013 filibuster.

Oh, and it also happens to fondly recall the 2013 shutdown in which Cruz was instrumental, and it depicts Hillary Clinton as the Grinch and John Boehner as a cigarette-smoking, Merlot-sipping Frosty the Snowman — "melting before Congress," in Cruz's words.

And then, the clincher: "If you are not completely satisfied with this collection of Cruz Christmas Classics, you probably hate Christmas — and America."

The video is already by far the most popular video produced by the Cruz campaign.
