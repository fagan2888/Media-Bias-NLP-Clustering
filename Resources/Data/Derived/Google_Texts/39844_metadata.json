By wide margins the American people want action, not more refugees.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOnly 43% of Americans are in favor of additional Syrian refugees, while a clear majority of 54% oppose the idea. A majority of 52% are \u201cdubious\u201d about the government\u2019s ability to properly screen refugees that ISIS has promised to seed with terrorists; and after watching the roll-out of ObamaCare and the collapse of the Veterans Administration, who can blame them.\n\nOn the action front, huge majorities are in direct opposition to President Obama\u2019s non-action.\n\nA whopping 73% support U.S. participation in a military response to ISIS. The same number want increased airstrikes. Up from 37%, a full 60% now want an increased use of ground forces against ISIS. The basis for this appears to be the fear of 81% that a major terror attack is likely against the United States. Only once since 9/11 has that number been higher.\n\nDisapproval of Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism has jumped 9 points to 54%. Only 40% approve. A full 57% disapprove of his handling of ISIS specifically.\n\nThis poll was taken between November 16-19 with 1,004 adults and mirrors a Bloomberg poll that showed an even wider margin opposed to additional Syrian refugees.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "WaPo/ABC ISIS Poll: Americans Want Action, Not More Syrian Refugees", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "WaPo/ABC ISIS Poll: Americans Want Action, Not More Syrian Refugees", "title": "WaPo/ABC ISIS Poll: Americans Want Action, Not More Syrian Refugees - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/ap_ap-photo1203-wi.jpg", "height": 903}, "updated_time": "2015-11-20T13:03:50-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/20/wapoabc-poll-americas-want-war-against-isis-not-more-syrian-refugees/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WaPo/ABC ISIS Poll: Americans Want Action, Not More Syrian Refugees", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/ap_ap-photo1203-wi.jpg", "title": "WaPo/ABC ISIS Poll: Americans Want Action, Not More Syrian Refugees - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 Poll, Media Bias, Syrian migrants, Syrian refugees vetting,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-11-20T12:59:35-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-11-20T13:03:50-07:00", "tag": "Syrian refugees vetting", "categories": "Big Government,National Security,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "This poll was taken between November 16-19 with 1,004 adults and mirrors a Bloomberg poll that showed an even wider margin opposed to additional Syrian refugees.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROnly 43% of Americans are in favor of additional Syrian refugees, while a clear majority of 54% oppose the idea.\nDisapproval of Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism has jumped 9 points to 54%.\nBy wide margins the American people want action, not more refugees.\nUp from 37%, a full 60% now want an increased use of ground forces against ISIS."}
