O\u2019Reilly wants these two justices to remove themselves from a group of pending cases challenging anti-gay marriage discrimination. In the unlikely event that Ginsburg and Kagan heed O\u2019Reilly\u2019s call; that would give the justices who dissented in the Court\u2019s 2013 decision striking down such discrimination at the federal level a 4-3 majority \u2014 most likely changing the outcome of the case.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s attempt to pressure justices who are likely to support equality off a major gay rights case is not a new strategy. The American Family Association (AFA), a leading anti-gay group, called for both justices to recuse the very same day that the Court announced that it was taking up marriage equality last January. \u201cBoth of these justices\u2019 personal and private actions that actively endorse gay marriage clearly indicate how they would vote on same-sex marriage cases before the Supreme Court,\u201d the AFA claimed in a statement. This, they claim, is sufficient reason for the justices to remove themselves from the case.\n\nIf the mere fact that a justice\u2019s political views can be determined by their actions were a reason to remove that justice from a case, then Ginsburg and Kagan wouldn\u2019t be the only justices who need to recuse from the marriage equality cases. Justice Antonin Scalia, with his rants about the \u201chomosexual agenda,\u201d hasn\u2019t exactly been shy about his own views on gay rights. Scalia, however, like Ginsburg and Kagan, can rest assured that he is not required to recuse himself from these cases either.\n\nThe federal law governing judicial recusals, as one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s guests stated repeatedly and, at times, very loudly, provides that \u201c[a]ny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d The AFA, O\u2019Reilly, and O\u2019Reilly\u2019s boisterous guest all hang their argument on the word \u201creasonably,\u201d claiming that Ginsburg and Kagan\u2019s impartiality is reasonably in question because their actions indicate support for marriage equality. There are a number of reasons why it would be entirely unreasonable to expect justices to recuse under these circumstances, however. Indeed, it\u2019s unlikely that the Supreme Court could function at all under the standard that O\u2019Reilly and the AFA propose.\n\nFor starters, as another one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s guests points out, O\u2019Reilly and the AFA blur the line between support for a particular policy and belief that this policy is required under the Constitution. Though this distinction is frequently blurred, even by prominent Supreme Court practitioners, it is an important one. Consider the words of the conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented in the major gay rights case Lawrence v. Texas:\n\n[T]he law before the Court today \u201cis \u2026 uncommonly silly.\u201d If I were a member of the Texas Legislature, I would vote to repeal it. Punishing someone for expressing his sexual preference through noncommercial consensual conduct with another adult does not appear to be a worthy way to expend valuable law enforcement resources. Notwithstanding this, I recognize that as a member of this Court I am not empowered to help petitioners and others similarly situated. My duty, rather, is to \u201cdecide cases \u2018agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u2019 \u201d And, just like Justice Stewart, I \u201ccan find [neither in the Bill of Rights nor any other part of the Constitution a] general right of privacy,\u201d or as the Court terms it today, the \u201cliberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.\u201d\n\nThomas\u2019s views did not carry the day in Lawrence \u2014 the Court voted 6-3 to strike down the sex ban at issue in that case \u2014 and his views are, to say the least, controversial. But Thomas\u2019s broader point, that a justice\u2019s job is not to hunt through the laws of various states seeking out decisions they personally disagree with and then strike them down, is apt. Nor have Ginsburg and Kagan demonstrated that they are unable to make this distinction. Kagan, for example, sent an email prior to joining the Court which suggests that she supports the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a fact that the law\u2019s opponents also pointed to quite vociferously in an effort to get her to recuse from the first Obamacare challenge \u2014 yet she voted to render the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion optional in NFIB v. Sebelius.\n\nBut what of the argument that Ginsburg and Kagan have personally participated in same-sex weddings by officiating them? If mere participation in a legal institution was grounds for recusal, then it would be difficult to find judges or justices who weren\u2019t recused from many cases. The speed limit in the state of Colorado, for example, is 75 mph, while other states have lower speed limits. Yet, if a litigant were to challenge one of these lower speed limits in court, a judge would not be required to recuse themselves simply because they once drove on Colorado\u2019s roads and took advantage of its higher speed limits.\n\nTo use a more politically charged example, both Justice Thomas and Justice Sonia Sotomayor have, in the past, benefited from affirmative action. Sotomayor, who has argued in favor of affirmative action both in her judicial opinions and in the press, credits race conscious admissions policies with the fact that she was able to rise from Bronx housing projects to attend Ivy League universities (Sotomayor completed her undergraduate degree summa cum laude at Princeton, and then attended Yale Law School). Justice Thomas, by contrast, is a vocal opponent of affirmative action. He believes that it created a stigma that prevented him from finding jobs after his own graduation from Yale Law.\n\nNeither Thomas nor Sotomayor are required to recuse from affirmative action cases. Indeed, they\u2019ve sat together in two such cases in the last two years.\n\nThe litigants defending discrimination, in other words, will need to rely on their actual legal arguments in order to make their case, rather than hoping that the case can be rigged by changing the composition of the bench. If the Court\u2019s recent actions are any indication, that\u2019s good news for equality.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "If you can't win, rig the game.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "If you can't win, rig the game.", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly Has A Plan To Rig The Supreme Court\u2019s Marriage Equality Decision", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/04/22/3649757/bill-oreilly-plan-rig-supreme-courts-marriage-equality-decision/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Bill-OReilly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you can't win, rig the game.", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly Has A Plan To Rig The Supreme Court\u2019s Marriage Equality Decision", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Bill-OReilly-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@imillhiser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Bill-OReilly.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Bill-OReilly.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-22T10:45:24+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf257\"", "article_summary": "Justice Bill O\u2019Reilly Has A Plan To Rig The Supreme Court\u2019s Marriage Equality Decision CREDIT: AP Images/Matt Sayles\u201cThese ladies have to recuse themselves,\u201d an indignant Bill O\u2019Reilly proclaimed on his Fox News show Tuesday night.\nO\u2019Reilly wants these two justices to remove themselves from a group of pending cases challenging anti-gay marriage discrimination.\n\u201cBoth of these justices\u2019 personal and private actions that actively endorse gay marriage clearly indicate how they would vote on same-sex marriage cases before the Supreme Court,\u201d the AFA claimed in a statement.\nIndeed, it\u2019s unlikely that the Supreme Court could function at all under the standard that O\u2019Reilly and the AFA propose.\nThe American Family Association (AFA), a leading anti-gay group, called for both justices to recuse the very same day that the Court announced that it was taking up marriage equality last January."}
