But just like with most numbers cited to support the government takeover of health care in America, that \u201c9 million\u201d figure is deceptive.\n\nWe were told that 48 million Americans lacked affordable health insurance and something had to be done, but even five years after the passage of Obamacare, 33 million Americans are still uninsured.\n\nIf you dig deeper into the actual numbers and realize what really happened with those 9 million \u201cnewly insured\u201d, there\u2019s little reason to cheer.\n\nThe number of Americans with health insurance increased by 9.25 million in 2014, the first year that two key provisions of Obamacare took place: the subsidies for coverage purchased through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion. And according to recent research by The Heritage Foundation, out of that 9.25 million, \u201cthe vast majority of the increase was the result of 8.99 million individuals being added to the Medicaid rolls.\u201d\n\nIn other words, over 97 percent of last year\u2019s newly insured Americans were from Medicaid expansion.\n\nI\u2019ve written extensively about the numerous ways Medicaid fails the poor, and actually traps them in poverty \u2013 and Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid makes the difficulties much, much worse.\n\nWhile Medicaid was originally designed to help needy mothers, children, and the disabled, Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion opened up the program to able-bodied, working age adults, the majority of whom have no dependent children and also don\u2019t work. Adding several million people into Medicaid while failing to address the program\u2019s systemic problems with financial solvency and access to doctors is bad enough. But every dollar spent incentivizing a healthy young adult not to work is a dollar taken away from someone who is truly needy and has no other options.\n\nEven looking at the roughly 3 percent of the newly insured who aren\u2019t part of Medicaid reveals Obamacare\u2019s inherent shortcomings.\n\nThere were almost 4.79 million new enrollees in private individual market plans in 2014. However, as Heritage\u2019s researchers noted, 4.53 million people lost their employment-based group coverage during that same time. This leaves a paltry 260,000 people with new private health insurance.\n\nObamacare has wasted billions of dollars, increased premiums and deductibles on millions of families, and has likely frustrated countless doctors into early retirement. This administration tore apart our country\u2019s entire health care system, all to provide insurance for roughly the number of people who will attend a game at two major college football stadiums this Saturday.\n\nRonald Reagan once said, \u201cWe should measure welfare\u2019s success by how many people leave welfare, not by how many are added.\u201d\n\nBy this standard, President Obama is an utter failure. We\u2019ve added nearly 9 million work-able adults without children onto the welfare rolls \u2013 a new entitlement class that has never been eligible for benefits before and in 2013 a record 48 million Americans were also dependent on food stamps \u2013 a record high.\n\nThis Administration can claim that their domestic policies are a success, but the only thing they\u2019re really successful in doing is trapping millions more Americans in government dependence.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.
