They\u2019d bring that to Washington.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high alright. But voter turnout, in this non-Presidential year, is projected to be low.\n\nThat gap\u2014between the urgency of the moment from the insider political and policy point of view, and the rampant alienation out in America\u2019s voting precincts\u2014has set off a familiar cycle of hand-wringing and argument.\n\nOn a recent public affairs call-in show on Wisconsin Public Radio, callers all over the state registered their frustration and alienation from the Democratic Party. One caller asserted that this year, he might not even vote. A series of outraged NPR listeners rushed to the phones to scold him, and express outrage at nonvoters everywhere, who allow our elections and our democracy to be taken over by the big-money interests so they can suppress wages, export jobs, destroy public schools, and tear up what\u2019s left of regulatory protections and the safety net.\n\nThe host joined the chorus: voting is a sacred obligation, and not voting is not just irresponsible, it\u2019s immoral.\n\nIt\u2019s an understandable emotional response. But threatening, scolding, even pleading, does not actually motivate people to go to the polls.\n\nVoter turnout in the United States lags all other established democracies.\n\nOur turnout hovers around 40 percent in Congressional midterm years, and reached a thirty-year high of 63 percent in 2008. We are suffering from a more serious problem than can be addressed with appeals to individual morality.\n\nAs Mike McCabe, the executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, puts it, \u201cWe have one party that\u2019s scary and another that\u2019s scared.\u201d\n\nIn his new book, Blue Jeans in High Places: The Coming Makeover of American Politics, McCabe does his best to explain the condition of \u201cpolitically homeless\u201d voters like the people in the poor, rural Wisconsin county where he grew up. These farmers and small-town workers, to the everlasting consternation of far-away political analysts, either don\u2019t vote or vote against their own interests.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s dad, a struggling farmer with an eighth-grade education, never forgot the New Deal. In his view, McCabe says, \u201cthe Democrats were the party of the poor and the Republicans were the party of the rich.\u201d\n\nBut today\u2019s political landscape is utterly different.\n\nTwo generations ago, McCabe observes, rural Clark County sent fiery progressive populist Frank Nikolay to the state legislature. A generation later, the county was still represented by a Democrat. More recently, Clark County elected rabid rightwing tea partier Scott Suder, who went on to become majority leader in the state senate.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn McCabe\u2019s analysis, it\u2019s not disaffected voters who lost their way. It\u2019s the Democratic party that used to earn their support.\n\n\u201cWhen Democrats won the hearts of a majority of people in the past, it was because the party had a big hand in creating things that tangibly benefited everyone or at least directly touched every American family in a major way,\u201d McCabe writes. \u201cSocial Security and Medicare. Rural electrification. The GI Bill. The interstate highway system.\u201d\n\nToday, McCabe writes, a much bigger problem for the Democrats than God Guns and Gays is their own party\u2019s lack of ambition to help people who are not rich.\n\nRepublicans like Scott Walker have built a winning \u201crich-poor alliance,\u201d by exploiting the anxiety and resentment of strapped, non-union private sector workers by talking about government workers\u2019 pensions and health-care benefits, and by reinforcing their suspicions that government doesn\u2019t work for them and politicians are corrupt.\n\nUntil that changes, it\u2019s going to be hard to get poor farmers and small-town waitresses to rush out and vote for the next bland, good-looking, corporate Democrat.\n\nMcCabe talks about one young Democraic candidate who was coached to be \u201cpresent and pleasant\u201d and avoid taking controversial stands. She lost.\n\nBut there are signs that the situation McCabe describes may be improving. Progressive Senator Tammy Baldwin won in Wisconsin by taking a strong stand against job-killing trade agreements and for expanding access to health care.\n\nElizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders won their campaigns with cross-over appeal to socially conservative voters who responded to their progressive, populist message.\n\nAs John Nichols reports in the October issue of The Progressive, Mitch McConnell himself may be toppled by a progressive populist with deep roots in rural Kentucky.\n\nIn the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race, the not-so-populist Mary Burke seems to be turning Scott Walker\u2019s cynical politics against him, as the depths of his administration\u2019s corruption and its fecklessness in producing jobs emerges.\n\nBurke was the first gubernatorial candidate in the nation to grab onto an issue that harkens back to the Democrats\u2019 New Deal heritage: freeing a generation of students from the burden of crushing college debt.\n\nScolding people to vote is not enough. They need something to vote for.\n\nBesides which, people resent being told they have to vote for a corporate Democrat because of the long list of horrible things that will happen if they don\u2019t.\n\nDemocrats found that out, to their lasting anger, in 2000, when Ralph Nader tilted the election to George W. Bush, despite the pleas, cajoling and threats by high-profile Dems deployed to lecture voters in swing states.\n\nNader was a rock star on the campaign trail in 2000, expressing people\u2019s pent-up frustration with the bank-deregulating, job-exporting, corporate-coddling, welfare-slashing Democrats.\n\nBut by 2004 it was clear to most of his supporters that his campaign was not actually building a bigger movement. And the consequences of the Bush presidency were, in fact, catastrophic.\n\nTo a handful of students who were still turned on by Nader enough to support his 2004 presidential run, a vote for Kerry still sounded like capitulation.\n\nUnless we break with the corporate Democratic party, we will never get truly progressive policies again, they argued passionately. And they quoted Howard Zinn: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s sitting in the White House. What matters is who\u2019s sitting in.\u201d\n\nBut Zinn himself took a gentler, and more complex view of the situation, in his characteristic kindly, softpoken way.\n\n\u201cThat quote is a little misleading, because it suggests I don\u2019t care who\u2019s in the White House,\u201d he told me when I called him on the phone back in 2004.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s really important to elect the right candidate, Zinn said (which is why he voted for Kerry, not Nader, in 2004.)\n\nBut, he hastened to add, \u201cIt\u2019s more important to have a social movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can understand their feeling,\u201d he said of the students for Nader. \u201cThe Democratic Party is a pitiful example of an opposition, and when you look at what Kerry stands for and what Nader stands for, I understand perfectly why people might find it repugnant to vote for Kerry and not for Nader,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m in great sympathy with these young people who maybe are not thinking in terms of tactics as much as some of us are. I\u2019m sort of with them emotionally.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, the point is not emotion, or ideological purity in the voting booth, Zinn said.\n\nOf Nader, he said, \u201che\u2019s been seduced by the last thing he should be seduced by, which is electoral politics, He\u2019s not about that, he\u2019s about movement politics.\n\nForseeing the outcome of the election, Zinn added, \u201cI believe a majority of people in this country believe in the things Nader believes in. And therefore for Nader to put himself on a ballot and get 2 or 3 or 4 percent of the vote misleads everybody as to how much support he has.\u201d\n\nThis year, if the progressive populist campaigns like Grimes\u2019s succeed, we might be in different territory.\n\nAt the end of his book, Mike McCabe lays out a plan to build a savvy, innovative populist movement, that can coalesce behind a \u201cblue-jean candidate\u201d\u2014someone who genuinely represents our interests.\n\nNow is the time, he writes. We have one party trying to take us back to the Nineteenth Century, and another one that\u2019s stuck in the Twentieth.\n\nThis could be the year we being to move the clock ahead.", "article_metadata": {"apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "fb": {"pages": 200548226627766}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "The host joined the chorus: voting is a sacred obligation, and not voting is not just irresponsible, it\u2019s immoral.\nAs John Nichols reports in the October issue of The Progressive, Mitch McConnell himself may be toppled by a progressive populist with deep roots in rural Kentucky.\nTwo generations ago, McCabe observes, rural Clark County sent fiery progressive populist Frank Nikolay to the state legislature.\nI\u2019m sort of with them emotionally.\u201dBut in the end, the point is not emotion, or ideological purity in the voting booth, Zinn said.\nForseeing the outcome of the election, Zinn added, \u201cI believe a majority of people in this country believe in the things Nader believes in."}
