SAN DIEGO â€” A U.S. Navy commander has pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy in a massive scheme involving a military contractor in Asia.

Jose Luis Sanchez entered the plea at a Tuesday hearing in San Diego federal court. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison when he is sentenced March 27.

A judge agreed to let Sanchez remove a GPS monitor while free on bond.

Sanchez was accused of accepting bribes including prostitutes and travel for steering Navy ships to Leonard Glenn Francis, chief executive of a Singapore-based company that provided services to vessels at ports. Francis has pleaded not guilty.

Sanchez, a Navy commander, held key positions in Singapore and Japan before he was reassigned to Tampa, Florida, in 2013.
