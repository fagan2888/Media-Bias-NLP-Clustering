The effort to bring Medicare Advantage in line with traditional Medicare began in 2012, and payment reductions were scheduled to take place each year until 2017. But 2015 is the second year that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has cancelled the scheduled cuts following political pressure. Instead, insurers will see a slight increase in payments.\n\nThroughout the health care debate, Democrats maintained that while the health care law would not reduce seniors\u2019 traditional Medicare benefits, scaling back overpayments to private insurers participating in the Medicare program was necessary because the government was paying private insurers 14 percent more on average to provide the same benefits available under the traditional Medicare program. While some Medicare Advantage plans do offer seniors additional benefits efficiently, a number of government reports and independent estimates found that other insurers used the additional payments to increase profits. A recent analysis from three economists the Wharton School, for instance, concluded \u201cthat only about one-fifth of the extra reimbursement gets passed through to patients in the form of lower premiums, better care or more services.\u201d\n\nObama repeatedly criticized the overpayments in his public comments and sought to reassure seniors that the reductions would extend the life of the Medicare trust fund.\n\n\u201c[W]e\u2019ll eliminate billions in unwarranted subsidies to insurance companies in the Medicare Advantage program \u2013giveaways that boost insurance company profits but don\u2019t make you any healthier,\u201d Obama told an AARP town hall in 2009. \u201cSo what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s at least have some sort of competitive bidding process where these insurance companies who are participating, they\u2019re not being subsidized on the taxpayer dime; if they got better services \u2014 they have better services that they can provide to seniors rather than through the traditional Medicare program, they\u2019re free to participate, but we shouldn\u2019t be giving them billions of dollars worth of subsidies.\u201d\n\nBut in February, after the Department of Health and Human Services announced cuts totaling approximately 5 percent, private insurers launched their \u201clargest-ever mobilization.\u201d Though a Barclay\u2019s report found that plans \u201chave ample room to adjust benefits downward while maintaining benefit levels that are better for their members than the traditional (Medicare) fee for service program,\u201d the industry ran \u2018seniors are watching\u2019 ads and, joined by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, argued that that any reductions would raise costs and reduce services. Republicans in particular began to use the cuts as a way to attack Democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIn many parts of the country, including New York, Medicare Advantage works very well. They\u2019ve shouldered their share already and this proposed cut would have been disproportionate, hurting seniors who would lose doctors or pay more,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement following the reversal. \u201cWe\u2019re glad the administration heeded our call and reversed the policy.\u201d The Republican National Committee, however, promptly labeled the change \u201cpolitical cover for vulnerable Democrats.\u201d\n\nLawmakers who voted against the ACA had initially predicted that lowering the subsidy to private insurers would force companies to stop offering coverage, causing 10 million seniors to lose their Medicare benefits. Republicans introduced numerous amendments instructing Congress to remove the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) even urged seniors to rip up their AARP cards in protest of the organization\u2019s support for the reductions.\n\nThose predictions did not come to pass. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage has grown every year since the ACA was enacted in 2010, premiums have decreased, and 99.1 percent of beneficiaries maintained access to their desired plans. The government\u2019s overpayments to private insurers also decreased over this period from 14 percent on average when the law passed to 6 percent on average today.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans earned an average profit of 4.5 percent in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The decision represents a huge victory for private insurers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The decision represents a huge victory for private insurers.", "title": "Obama Makes Surprise Reversal On Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/08/3423974/obama-surprise-reversal-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Obama-AARP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The decision represents a huge victory for private insurers.", "title": "Obama Makes Surprise Reversal On Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Obama-AARP-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Obama-AARP.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Obama-AARP.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-08T08:10:26+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3a4\"", "article_summary": "Health Obama Makes Surprise Reversal On Obamacare CREDIT: APThe Obama administration announced on Monday that it would be reversing scheduled reductions to the Medicare Advantage program, dealing a huge victory to private insurers and the bipartisan group of lawmakers who advocated for maintaining the higher reimbursement rates that President Obama claimed only padded company profits.\nThe Affordable Care Act is supposed to reduce excess payments to private insurers participating in Medicare Advantage, saving the government $156 billion over a decade.\nThe effort to bring Medicare Advantage in line with traditional Medicare began in 2012, and payment reductions were scheduled to take place each year until 2017.\nMedicare Advantage plans earned an average profit of 4.5 percent in 2011.\nThe government\u2019s overpayments to private insurers also decreased over this period from 14 percent on average when the law passed to 6 percent on average today."}
