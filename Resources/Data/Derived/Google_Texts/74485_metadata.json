But in recent days, there\u2019s been a burst of unexpected activity on this issue.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) struck a deal with the Obama administration that will allow Medicaid expansion to cover another half-million low-income Americans in the Keystone State. A day later, Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) said he expects to follow suit in the coming weeks.\n\nRuby-red Wyoming generally resists any voluntary federal program, but it, too, is starting to come around on Medicaid expansion. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), a fierce \u201cObamacare\u201d critic, recently did the same\n\nAnd even Utah is moving forward with its Medicaid-expansion plans, though not without an unintentionally amusing debate\n\nUtah\u2019s health care debate took an unexpected turn at the State Capitol, where a lawmaker who is also a doctor argued that access to health care can be a bad thing. Representative Mike Kennedy, a Republican from Alpine, made the comments in a Health Reform Task Force meeting, in reaction to a story from another doctor\u2026. \u201cSometimes access actually can mean harm,\u201d said Representative Mike Kennedy, a family physician.\n\nI\u2019ve followed this debate closely for quite a while, and I have to admit, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen an elected official argue \u2013 out loud and on purpose \u2013 that medical care may be bad for people. But in this case, a Utah state Republican and physician tried to defeat Medicaid expansion by sincerely making the case that hospitals can make Americans sicker.\n\n\u201cSometimes access to health care can be damaging and dangerous,\u201d the GOP lawmaker said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a perspective for the [Legislative] body to consider is that, I\u2019ve heard from National Institutes of Health and otherwise that we\u2019re killing up to a million, a million and a half people every year in our hospitals. And it\u2019s access to hospitals that\u2019s killing those people.\u201d\n\nRidiculous arguments notwithstanding, there is a larger trend here that\u2019s hard to overlook.\n\nJustin Green, writing in the conservative Washington Examiner, noted over the weekend that the Republican fight against Medicaid expansion may soon be \u201c over .\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he trend is quite clear: Red states are gradually accepting Obamacare, and no states are reversing their decisions,\u201d Green said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The arithmetic is becoming unavoidable, even for Republican governors in red states who hate \"Obamacare.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/falling-dominoes-red-state-govs-expanding-obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The arithmetic is becoming unavoidable, even for Republican governors in red states who hate \"Obamacare.\"", "title": "Falling like dominoes: Red-state govs expanding Obamacare", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/falling-dominoes-red-state-govs-expanding-obamacare", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=r7ZUIbER", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Falling like dominoes: Red-state govs expanding Obamacare", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/falling-dominoes-red-state-govs-expanding-obamacare", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=VlkmNjZk", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The arithmetic is becoming unavoidable, even for Republican governors in red states who hate \"Obamacare.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-02T09:19:51-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The arithmetic is becoming unavoidable, even for Republican governors in red states who hate \"Obamacare.\"", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Falling like dominoes: Red-state govs expanding Obamacare", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-policy,health-care-reform,medicaid,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "09/02/2014 09:19:51 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/falling-dominoes-red-state-govs-expanding-obamacare"}, "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Health Care Policy, Medicaid, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3be6\"", "article_summary": "Ruby-red Wyoming generally resists any voluntary federal program, but it, too, is starting to come around on Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cSometimes access to health care can be damaging and dangerous,\u201d the GOP lawmaker said.\nBut in this case, a Utah state Republican and physician tried to defeat Medicaid expansion by sincerely making the case that hospitals can make Americans sicker.\nTom Corbett (R) struck a deal with the Obama administration that will allow Medicaid expansion to cover another half-million low-income Americans in the Keystone State.\nAnd it\u2019s access to hospitals that\u2019s killing those people.\u201dRidiculous arguments notwithstanding, there is a larger trend here that\u2019s hard to overlook."}
