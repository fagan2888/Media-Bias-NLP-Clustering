The Virginia legislature has approved a set of rules for daily fantasy sports leagues, declaring that those contests which follow the guidelines are not illegal gambling. SB 646 requires clear explanation of prizes to be awarded, prohibits athletes involved from participation, and requires operators of fantasy contests to register annually with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

Virginia is the first state to pass such a bill, but it still needs a signature from Governor Terry McAuliffe.
