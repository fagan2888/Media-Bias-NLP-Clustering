At this store, there were a lot of people buying last minute gifts.\n\nOne customer needed to buy food but since all of the grocery stores were closed they ran to this store to get anything they could, WTOC even ran into someone buying charcoal to put something on the grill in December.\n\nOne employee said customers were grateful.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been extra, extra busy you know you wouldn\u2019t expect this many people to come in here on Christmas, but I guess people forget things. Plus you know the kids need to open their toys you know they need batteries so that had been a high selling item today,\u201d said Andrea, employee.\n\nAndrea says she also ran into some customers that were shocked they were open.\n\nMany places, like fast food restaurants and grocery stores, closed their doors for the day. But some have welcomed customers with opened arms, like the Huddle House on Abercorn Street. Not only are the open every day the owner said, Christmas is actually their busiest day of the year.\n\nSome customers said they just wanted to get some breakfast, others saying they don\u2019t celebrate Christmas, and for others it is a Christmas tradition to get out of the house after opening gifts to eat at Huddle House or Waffle House, which was also crowded.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to support the community that doesn\u2019t have family to go to and visit. And being the only one out here you know were 24 hours every single day not just Christmas, Christmas Eve, New Year\u2019s, New Year\u2019s Eve, so were always here for the community just in case they don\u2019t have a place to go,\u201d said Sam Ali, Huddle House owner.\n\nThere are plenty of other stores open on Christmas including pharmacies like Walgreens, Rite Aid, and CVS. The movies are open and there are also plenty of restaurants open until late Christmas night.\n\nCopyright 2015 WTOC.
