He can be a wrestler, he can be an Egyptian scorpion monster, he can be a tough action guy, he can be a tough action guy who makes jokes, and, well, that\u2019s really the gist of it. One thing he hasn\u2019t been too often, though, is a guy in space. We\u2019ve seen him punch dudes on Earth, in the center of the Earth, and in a wrestling ring, but why is it so rare that we get to see him punch dudes in space?\n\nWell, finally, that\u2019s going to change soon. According to The Hollywood Reporter, DreamWorks has just picked up the rights to Alpha Squad Seven, a \u201csci-fi action comedy pitch\u201d that Johnson is attached to star in. We don\u2019t know any specifics about the project, but THR\u2019s sources say it\u2019s being compared to Independence Day, Armageddon, and Guardians Of The Galaxy. Plus, the writers behind the pitch (Jeremiah Friedman and Nick Palmer) supposedly sold it with a \u201ca one-line idea.\u201d\n\nIf we had to guess, we\u2019d say the one-line idea was \u201cIndependence Day meets Armageddon meets Guardians Of The Galaxy, with The Rock as the star.\u201d That certainly sounds like something a movie studio would like. Whatever it\u2019s about, we\u2019re just really excited to see The Rock punch some aliens while wearing a super tight and/or sleeveless space suit.\n\nSend your Newswire tips to tips@avclub.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/dwayne-johnson-attached-star-sci-fi-action-comedy-219215", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5427/27/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dwayne \u201cThe Rocket\u201d Johnson is the kind of superstar who is talented enough, popular enough, and intimidating enough that he can probably do whatever he wants in Hollywood.
