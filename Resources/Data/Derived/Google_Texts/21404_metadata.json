According to new reports Rahim planned to use that knife, which resembles the black knives used by ISIS, to behead a police officer. More from Fox News:\n\nThe man shot and killed Tuesday by Boston police was plotting with another suspect to behead a cop, a law enforcement source told FoxNews.com\n\n\n\nAuthorities in Massachusetts arrested a man in connection with a counterterror investigation late Tuesday, hours after another man under surveillance by the Joint Terrorism Task Force was shot and killed after he refused to put down a military-style knife while approaching two officers.\n\n\n\n\"We believe the intent was to behead a police officer,\" one official told The Boston Globe. \"We knew the plot had to be stopped. They were planning to take action Tuesday.\"\n\nThis plot comes just weeks after an Muhammed cartoon contest and free speech event was attacked in Texas by two Islamic men inspired by ISIS. Luckily, police were able to kill those suspects immediately as well.\n\nIn May, FBI Director James Comey said the influence of ISIS inside the United States is growing exponentially through the use of social media. Comey also admitted the agency is having a hard time keeping up with the number of threats and terror connections. The FBI is reportedly monitoring Americans who have traveled to Iraq or Syria to train with ISIS and then flown back home on U.S. passports.\n\nBoston is of course the same place where the Tsarnaev brother's carried out the Boston Bombing in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're here. .05/27/2016 6:14:20AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "They're here.", "title": "- Islamic Terror Suspect Killed in Boston Plotted to Behead a Police Officer", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/06/03/islamic-man-arrested-on-terror-charges-planned-to-behead-boston-police-officer-n2007553", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/6/3/1.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "They're here.", "title": "- Islamic Terror Suspect Killed in Boston Plotted to Behead a Police Officer", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/06/03/islamic-man-arrested-on-terror-charges-planned-to-behead-boston-police-officer-n2007553", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/6/3/1.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Islamic Terror Suspect Killed in Boston Plotted to Behead a Police Officer, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\"We believe the intent was to behead a police officer,\" one official told The Boston Globe.\nAn Islamic man engaged in Jihad, Usaama Rahim, was shot and killed by police yesterday after lunging at them with a large knife.\nAccording to new reports Rahim planned to use that knife, which resembles the black knives used by ISIS, to behead a police officer.\nBoston is of course the same place where the Tsarnaev brother's carried out the Boston Bombing in 2013.\nComey also admitted the agency is having a hard time keeping up with the number of threats and terror connections."}
