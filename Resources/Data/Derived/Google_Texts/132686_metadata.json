Seeking accreditation allowed the Quality Alliance to see where it had gaps and more work to do to provide quality care, Dr Massey said.As of now, this voluntary ACO accreditation is just in the beginning stages and most valuable for the ACOs to look internally and see how they can improve, Dennis Scanlon, PhD, professor of health policy and administration and director of the Center for Health Care and Policy at the Pennsylvania State University, explained during the panel discussion following Dr Massey\u2019s presentation.Lysette Cournoyer, a consultant, added that the voluntary accreditation for ACOs is similar to how accreditation started for patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), and similar to PCMHs, accreditation for ACOs is likely to expand in the coming years.",
