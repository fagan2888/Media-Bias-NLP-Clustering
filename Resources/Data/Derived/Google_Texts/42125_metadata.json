The way the chips fell might tell us something useful in 2015.\n\nSource: The Wall Street Journal, 1/2/2015\n\n***\n\nIn some ways, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a relic. Its 30 components don\u2019t reflect the U.S. economy as well as they used to, and its arcane price-weighted calculation gives some stocks too much influence.\n\nProfessional investors usually look at the S&P 500 when they want a market \u201csnapshot,\u201c but \u201cthe Dow\u201c is still popular. Last year it rose 7.5%. The graph above shows you how bumpy the ride was at times.\n\nThe index return is a composite of the 30 stocks, each of which has its own yearly return. This table shows them all, from best to worst. Scan through the list and see what you notice. I\u2019ll give you my own thoughts below.\n\nAny investor who owned only those first seven stocks had a very happy New Year\u2019s Eve. Anyone who stuck with the last few names probably spent the night drowning their sorrows.\n\n(Note: The figures in the table reflect only the share price, not dividends. That means total returns would have been a little higher in most cases.)\n\nHow did the \u201caverage\u201c Dow stock perform last year? I\u2019ll save you the math; it was 9.4%.\n\nYou might wonder why all the newspapers say the Dow rose only 7.5% last year. The answer lies in that price-weighting methodology I mentioned.\n\nThe Dow isn\u2019t just a simple average. Stocks with higher share prices get a higher weighting.\n\nAnother wrinkle to the Dow is that it excludes utility and transportation stocks. They\u2019re in separate indexes. Utilities had a good year, so their absence is one reason the Dow lagged the S&P 500 \u2014 which does include utility stocks.\n\nA few other random thoughts on the Dow:\n\nThree of the top five performers were technology stocks. We live in a tech-driven economy and Intel, Microsoft and Cisco own critical parts of it.\n\nUnitedHealth Group ended way ahead of the Dow\u2019s three pharmaceutical names (Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Pfizer). Under Obamacare, health insurers may be gaining an upper hand over drug-makers.\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s great year shows that \u201cold\u201c media stocks are still in the game. Disney owns the ABC and ESPN television networks as well as theme parks and film studios.\n\nFinancial services were a mixed bag. Visa and Travelers did well, but the banking components like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase along with American Express are in the bottom half of the list.\n\nThe Dow\u2019s telecom stocks, AT&T and Verizon, both suffered in a brutal price war for mobile phone customers. Phone service is effectively a commodity now, with consumers buying from the lowest bidder.\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron were having subpar years even before oil prices collapsed. Both ended near the bottom. Relative to other energy stocks outside the Dow, they would be near the top.\n\n***\n\nThose are a few of my quick observations from the Dow\u2019s 2014 scoreboard. What are yours? I\u2019d love to know what you see in the data. You can leave a comment on our website or send me an e-mail.\n\n***\n\nToday was odd. A lone session sandwiched between a holiday and a weekend would usually be inconsequential, but this one was also the first day of a calendar year. That makes it doubly hard to analyze the day\u2019s events. I\u2019ll give it a stab, though.\n\nNegative news from Europe started U.S. trading on a downbeat. The euro tumbled after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi told a German newspaper the ECB would make \u201ctechnical preparation\u201c to deal with low inflation.\n\nTo German ears, Draghi\u2019s comments suggest the ECB will soon launch a \u201cQE\u201c program that buys sovereign debt. German leaders are firmly against any such plan.\n\nU.S. data wasn\u2019t so great, either. The ISM Manufacturing Index dropped to a six-month low in November. That suggests October\u2019s impressive report might have been a fluke.\n\nChinese manufacturing data disappointed, too, but had less impact on share prices. Traders think it will spur Beijing to take further stimulus actions.\n\nSmall caps started the year rough. The Russell 2000 Index, which lagged large-cap benchmarks last year, lagged them again today.\n\nTechnology was among today\u2019s weakest sectors. Profit-taking pushed mega-cap Apple (AAPL) lower on the day.\n\nOil prices stayed weak. The West Texas Intermediate spot contract went as low as $52.03 at midday.\n\nGood Luck and Happy Investing,\n\nBrad Hoppmann\n\nPublisher\n\nUncommon Wisdom Daily", "article_metadata": {"revised": "Wednesday, May 27th, 2015, 11:39 am", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2014 with a gain, but a deeper look shows some blue chips had a \u201cbluer\u201c year than others.", "application-name": "Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "author": "Brad Hoppmann", "og": {"site_name": "Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2014 with a gain, but a deeper look shows some blue chips had a \u201cbluer\u201c year than others.", "title": "Dissecting the Dow's Year - Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "url": "http://www.uncommonwisdomdaily.com/dissecting-the-dows-year-19577", "image": "http://www.uncommonwisdomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/010215-pm-img-01.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-27T11:39:36-04:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2014 with a gain, but a deeper look shows some blue chips had a \u201cbluer\u201c year than others.", "title": "Dissecting the Dow's Year - Uncommon Wisdom Daily", "image": {"src": "http://www.uncommonwisdomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/010215-pm-img-01.jpg"}, "site": "@uncommon_wisdom", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/windows-tile.png", "keywords": "Afternoon Edition, General, Issues", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T16:29:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T11:39:36-04:00"}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) January 2015", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fc0\"", "article_summary": "Dissecting the Dow\u2019s YearThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2014 with a gain, but a deeper look shows some blue chips were much bluer than others.\nThe Dow\u2019s telecom stocks, AT&T and Verizon, both suffered in a brutal price war for mobile phone customers.\nHow did the \u201caverage\u201c Dow stock perform last year?\nUnitedHealth Group ended way ahead of the Dow\u2019s three pharmaceutical names (Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Pfizer).\nChinese manufacturing data disappointed, too, but had less impact on share prices."}
