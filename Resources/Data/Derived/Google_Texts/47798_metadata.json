This troubling reality is not taken lightly in Massachusetts, one of the first states to implement policy innovations for this age group. The Commonwealth\u2019s promising steps are well grounded in science regarding young adult brain development \u2013 and this science suggests that even bolder approaches should be taken.\n\nA report from the Harvard Kennedy School issued last fall offered compelling evidence that a focus on this population is warranted. Studies in psychology and neurobiology from the past decade revealed that young adults are a distinct group. Although they are intellectually mature, their impulse regulation is still developing. They tend to take more risks, pay less attention to the consequences of their actions, and are more susceptible to peer pressure. Combined with the fact that starting a family, finishing school, and holding a steady job \u2013 all bridges to maturing out of delinquent behavior \u2013 are now happening later in life, our youth are at higher risk for engaging in crime. Without age-responsive policies and programs across all parts of the justice system, more of these young people are likely to reoffend and hinder public safety.\n\nSociety has recognized and responded to these realities in other areas of law and practice outside of criminal justice. Young people can\u2019t legally consume alcohol, buy a handgun in a gun store, or, increasingly, purchase tobacco until they\u2019re age 21. You need to be 25 years old to serve in Congress and can stay on your parents\u2019 health insurance under the Affordable Care Act until age 26. Even businesses have caught on \u2013 it is very difficult to rent a car until age 25 and auto insurance for those under 25 is prohibitively expensive.\n\nMassachusetts is starting to recognize the need for innovation around justice-involved youth. Through the Juvenile Justice Pay For Success project, the state and private funders partnered with the nonprofit organization Roca, to deliver Roca\u2019s data-driven intervention model to hundreds of high-risk young men. The Commonwealth\u2019s Safe and Successful Youth Initiative also serves justice-involved young adults, in partnership between nonprofits and local police departments across 12 urban communities. To fully address the needs of young adults in the justice system, more can be done.\n\nA new report released by Roca explores what a developmentally-appropriate justice system could look like. The report explores 10 promising initiatives across the country and beyond that specifically target justice-involved 18-24 year olds. Specialized courts focused on the developmental needs of young adults have been established in California, Nebraska, and Texas. These courts offer intensive supervision programs instead of incarceration, which help young people who committed crimes to gain education, employment, and life skills that will keep them out of harm\u2019s way. Such programs often allow young people who redirected their lives to have their records sealed or expunged, and to get a second chance.\n\nYoung adult policies cover multiple aspects of the justice system. Some European countries allow judges or prosecutors to decide whether adult or juvenile law should apply in a young person\u2019s case, based on the offender\u2019s maturity level. In Maine and Pennsylvania, separate young adult correctional facilities were established, and New York and San Francisco have started specialized young adult caseloads in their probation departments. Policymakers in Connecticut and Illinois have recently proposed raising the age of juvenile court jurisdiction to 21, something unprecedented in the history of the US Juvenile Court.\n\nThe options are abundant, but the direction is clear. It is time for policy innovation, which will build on the Commonwealth\u2019s experience in tackling hard problems in a courageous way. Responsible and effective policies must take into account offenders\u2019 age and maturity level, and pay special attention to the early years of adulthood. Raising the age of the juvenile court, starting young adult courts, and establishing special programs for this age group should all be considered. A safe path for young people out of the justice system is a safe path towards a healthy and thriving society.\n\nMolly Baldwin is founder and CEO of Roca Inc.
