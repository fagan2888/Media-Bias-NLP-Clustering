LOUDON — Jim Reynolds and Chuck Carty were having a good time at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, getting ready for the weekend NASCAR races, until a reporter mentioned the issue of Confederate flags flying at NASCAR events...The mere mention of the emotionally charged issue made both angry.“There’s nothing wrong with that flag,” Reynolds said.On July 2, following the Charleston church shootings, NASCAR issued a statement asking racing fans to “refrain from displaying the Confederate flag at our facilities and NASCAR events.”..The request from NASCAR came as South Carolina was deciding to remove the flag from its capitol grounds, after the alleged shooter, who killed nine people, was seen in a photo draped in the flag. The flag was removed from the grounds of the South Carolina State House on July 10...“We are asking our fans and partners to join us in a renewed effort to create an all-inclusive, even more welcoming atmosphere for all who attend our events,” NASCAR said in its statement. “This is an opportunity for NASCAR Nation to demonstrate its sense of mutual respect and acceptance for all who attend our events while collectively sharing the tremendous experience of NASCAR racing.”..Reynolds and Carty, who had come to the speedway in an RV from their homes in Amsterdam, N.Y., and were parked in the speedway’s RV Park, were talking happily about the races Friday when the subject of the flag came up. Both immediately said they had just bought Confederate flag stickers for their cars from a nearby fan gear retailer...The flag, which has been one of many sold by vendors near the speedway and was popular with fans, was not displayed by many in the park. Both said most fans are respecting NASCAR’s wishes.But both were furious at the idea that the flag represented racism...“Because a few people made it racist,” said Carty. “There is nothing negative about the Confederate flag. It’s really not about racism, but a few people went crazy about it and this is what we have, and it’s not right.”..“If you go back into family histories in the South,” Reynolds said, “you’ll see someone in the family died fighting for that flag, and they weren’t fighting for racism, they were fighting for what they saw as their country.”..Kristen Lestock, the speedway’s communications director, noted that the NASCAR advisory “is not a ban.”“Though we have never experienced a complaint or problem during our NASCAR events here at New Hampshire Motor Speedway regarding the Confederate flag, the NASCAR industry certainly recognizes the potential divisive nature of this symbol,” she said...“Our goal is always to provide a fan-friendly atmosphere to all of our guests here, so we’re simply asking NASCAR fans to focus on the one flag we all support with pride — the American flag. In addition, we encourage the flags of the NASCAR Nation, including driver and speedway flags,” she said...The speedway offered an exchange program over the weekend which would have allowed fans to exchange their Confederate flags for an American flag or a racing flag of their choosing in the speedway gift shop. There was also a “souvenir unit” in campgrounds providing a free American flag to fans with a purchase of a souvenir, she said...The exchange program was not visited often over the weekend, speedway officials said.dseufert@newstote.com..
