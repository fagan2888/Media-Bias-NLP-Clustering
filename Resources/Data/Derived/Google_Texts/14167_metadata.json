(Nadaq: EVRY) is planning to file for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe company, which defaulted on its loans last year, has entered into a restructuring support agreement (RSA) with lenders that support the bankruptcy plan.\n\nThe Lancaster, Ohio-based business sells a line of tabletop and food preparation products under the Anchor Hocking, Anchor, Anchor Home, FireKing, Oneida, Buffalo China, Delco and Sant' Andrea brands.\n\nThe bankruptcy decision was prompted by a warning from the company\u0092s auditor that it would cast doubt about EveryWare\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern in the annual audit \u0096 a circumstance that would violate EveryWare\u0092s loan agreement and cause it to default.\n\nEveryWare's auditor told the business that this year's opinion would contain a paragraph about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, which would cause the business to default on its term loan. On March 31, when EveryWare announced the RSA, the company said that it had agreements from lenders that hold 65.6 percent of its debt ($163.1 million) for a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan.\n\nIf approved, EveryWare plans to use $40 million in debtor-in-possession financing from some of its term lenders to get through the case.\n\nThe company's bankruptcy plan would provide unsecured creditors full repayment. Preferred stock holders would receive 2.5 percent of the company's stock after the restructuring on a pro-rata basis. Holders of common stock (can we say 'Common stock holders') would receive 1.5 percent of the company's shares on a pro rata basis.\n\nIn the April 1 SEC filing that announces the agreement, EveryWare says it would need to file for bankruptcy on or before April 7 under the RSA.\n\nLast August, an EveryWare subsidiary Oneida International Ltd. sold its U.K. unit to Hilco Capital Ltd. for about $6.15 million. That price included debt repayment, and was part of the company's effort to refocus on North American operations.\n\nNew York private equity firm Monomoy Capital Partners LP invested $20 million in the business, also in August, through a securities purchase agreement. That deal helped EveryWare get a waiver after it defaulted on its term loan. The company hadn't complied with the loan's consolidated leverage ratio and interest-cover ratio covenants for the first half of 2014.\n\nA representative for EveryWare did not immediately return a call for comment.\n\nFor the previous edition of Turnaround Tuesday, see Out of Bankruptcy, Dex Media Shows New Signs of Struggle.\n\nFor more information on struggling companies, check out our Distressed Company Watch List.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/restructurings/facing-default-everyware-plans-pre-packaged-bankruptcy-255501-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/oneida.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Turnaround Tuesday: Facing Default, EveryWare Plans Pre-Packaged Bankruptcy"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca021\"", "article_summary": "Turnaround Tuesday: Facing Default, EveryWare Plans Pre-Packaged BankruptcyThe kitchenware retailer plans to use $40M from existing lenders to get through the caseKitchenware business EveryWare Global Inc.
