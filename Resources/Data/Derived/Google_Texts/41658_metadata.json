(POOL PHOTOS/RICH BEAUCHESNE)\n\nCredibility expected to be key issue for star witness in Mazzaglia trial\n\n\n\nDOVER \u2014 Kathryn McDonough is expected to undergo a long and perhaps brutal interrogation this week about her sex life and motivation to become a star witness in the first-degree murder trial of her ex-boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia.\n\n..\n\nMcDonough struck a plea deal with state prosecutors to testify about how Mazzaglia, her former live-in boyfriend, raped and strangled 19-year-old University of New Hampshire sophomore Elizabeth \u201cLizzi\u201d Marriott on the night of Oct. 9, 2012, during a game of strip poker.\n\n..\n\nWhile legal experts say every trial is fact-specific, they expect McDonough\u2019s credibility will be what Mazzaglia\u2019s public defenders will try to undermine the most.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou want to make that jury believe that she wasn\u2019t paid with money. She was paid with her freedom,\u201d Salem defense attorney Steven Shadallah said.\n\n..\n\nMcDonough\u2019s testimony \u2014 expected to begin this week in Strafford County Superior Court \u2014 comes after jurors heard statements about her sexual relationship with Mazzaglia, which included dominance, submission and inviting others to join them.\n\n..\n\nDefense lawyers are expected to attack McDonough about how she lied to police during the homicide investigation, only to eventually accuse Mazzaglia of murdering Marriott after the UNH student rebuffed a sexual encounter with them.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIf it was a long drawn-out process, then the defense could say she is coming up with a story to get herself out of trouble,\u201d said defense attorney James Moir, who has defended numerous murder cases in his 30-year career.\n\n..\n\nMcDonough, 20, is currently serving a 1\u00bd to three-year prison term after pleading guilty last July to three charges, including witness tampering and hindering the murder investigation. Her plea agreement requires her to provide truthful testimony against Mazzaglia or spend an additional 5\u00bd to 11 years in state prison, according to prosecutors.\n\n..\n\nMazzaglia, 31, is facing charges of first- and second-degree murder. His public defenders argue that McDonough actually killed Marriott during erotic asphyxiation, using restraints, a harness and choker.\n\n..\n\nMark Howard, a former state and federal prosecutor, said while defense lawyers try to portray McDonough as someone who was given a free pass on potential murder charges, \u201cyou have to give the jury a reason not to accept what she has to say.\u201d\n\n..\n\n\u201cJurors have no difficulty in getting over the fact that cooperators have a motive of self-preservation,\u201d Howard said.\n\n\n\nJuries are often able to measure witnesses testimony against other facts presented in a case, asking themselves: \u201cWhat has that person told me that corroborates with objective facts in the case?\u201d Howard said.\n\n..\n\nThat calculus may include comparing statements McDonough and Mazzaglia made to police during the investigation to testimony given in court, legal experts said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf (Mazzaglia\u2019s) level of specificity doesn\u2019t match what he is saying now, that\u2019s going to be a problem,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI can tell you based on my experience as a prosecutor and defense lawyer, an interview lasting more than an hour is not going to be helpful (to him).\u201d\n\n..\n\nDefense lawyer Adam Bernstein said if he was questioning McDonough at trial, he would be quizzing her about the details of her group-sexual encounters with Mazzaglia to pick apart her account of the murder.\n\n..\n\n\u201cHow many times did you do this? Was this a common practice?\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cPresumably, they engaged in this behavior for a period of time.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe more details that the defense can provide to the jury about their sex encounters, the more they can possibly cast doubt on the state\u2019s theory about the murder, according to Bernstein.\n\n..\n\nMcDonough\u2019s conviction can be used for the defense\u2019s theory that what she says cannot be trusted, Bernstein said.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget she pleaded guilty to hindering apprehension and witness tampering. She\u2019s clearly not honest,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is she telling the truth this time?\u201d\n\n..\n\nWith defense lawyers claiming that McDonough \u2014 not Mazzaglia \u2014 committed the murder, jurors may also end up weighing more than just facts presented to them in the courtroom.\n\n\n\nMeasuring the size and strength of Mazzaglia versus McDonough\u2019s could be another way that jurors assess the competing narratives about Marriott\u2019s death.\n\n..\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. She is this little girl,\u201d Shadallah said of McDonough. \u201cIt seems to me, that defense may backfire.\u201d\n\n\n\nProsecutors may be relying on witnesses more than usual in the Mazzaglia trial. Marriott\u2019s body was dumped from the shores of Peirce Island in Portsmouth shortly after the murder and never recovered.\n\n..\n\n\u201cWithout the body, it comes down to people\u2019s statements,\u201d Moir said.\n\n\n\njkimble@newstote.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kathryn McDonough is expected to undergo a long and perhaps brutal interrogation this week about her sex life and motivation to become a star witness in the first-degree murder trial of her ex-boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia.", "title": "Credibility expected to be key issue for star witness in Mazzaglia trial | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Kathryn McDonough is expected to undergo a long and perhaps brutal interrogation this week about her sex life and motivation to become a star witness in the first-degree murder trial of her ex-boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia.", "title": "Credibility expected to be key issue for star witness in Mazzaglia trial | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140601/NEWS03/140609894", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20140601/NEWS03/140609894/AR/0/AR-140609894.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Crime", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Courts, Crime, Social issues, Dover, Portsmouth, Top Section Stories,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2014-06-01 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "Kathryn McDonough is expected to undergo a long and perhaps brutal interrogation this week about her sex life and motivation to become a star witness in the first-degree murder trial of her ex-boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia.", "title": "Credibility expected to be key issue for star witness in Mazzaglia trial | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140601/NEWS03/140609894", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20140601/NEWS03/140609894/AR/0/AR-140609894.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6a1\"", "article_summary": "The credibility of Kathryn McDonough, 20, is expected to be attacked during Seth Mazzaglia's first-degree murder trial this week.\n(POOL PHOTOS/RICH BEAUCHESNE)Credibility expected to be key issue for star witness in Mazzaglia trialDOVER \u2014 Kathryn McDonough is expected to undergo a long and perhaps brutal interrogation this week about her sex life and motivation to become a star witness in the first-degree murder trial of her ex-boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia.\n\u201cIt seems to me, that defense may backfire.\u201dProsecutors may be relying on witnesses more than usual in the Mazzaglia trial.\nWhile legal experts say every trial is fact-specific, they expect McDonough\u2019s credibility will be what Mazzaglia\u2019s public defenders will try to undermine the most.\n..McDonough\u2019s testimony \u2014 expected to begin this week in Strafford County Superior Court \u2014 comes after jurors heard statements about her sexual relationship with Mazzaglia, which included dominance, submission and inviting others to join them."}
