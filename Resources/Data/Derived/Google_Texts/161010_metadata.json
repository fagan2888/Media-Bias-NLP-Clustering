As the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports (and Andrew Johnson highlights at NRO), an Obamacare exchange employee in Minnesota accidentally sent out an email containing 2,400 Americans\u2019 Social Security numbers.\n\nThe Star Tribune writes:\n\n\u201cA MNsure employee accidentally sent an e-mail file to an Apple Valley insurance broker\u2019s office on Thursday that contained Social Security numbers, names, business addresses and other identifying information on more than 2,400 insurance agents.\n\n\u201cAn official at MNsure, the state\u2019s new online health insurance exchange, acknowledged it had mishandled private data. A MNsure security manager called the broker, Jim Koester, and walked him and his assistant through a process of deleting the file from their computer hard drives.\n\n\u201cKoester said he willingly complied, but was unnerved.\n\n\u201c\u2018The more I thought about it, the more troubled I was,\u2019 he said. \u2018What if this had fallen into the wrong hands? It\u2019s scary. If this is happening now, how can clients of MNsure be confident their data is safe?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Star Tribune continues:\n\n\u201cUsers of the exchange will need to provide sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, that will be sent to a federal hub to verify such things as citizenship and household income\u2026.\n\n\u201cAll states and the federal government, which also is setting up exchanges for some states, are scurrying to get the complex system running in less than three weeks.\n\n\u201c\u2018The people who believe in this are so driven that there\u2019s a subcontext of \u201cJust let us do our job and get as many people signed up as possible, and we\u2019ll pick up the debris later,\u201d\u2019 said Steve Parente, a University of Minnesota finance professor who specializes in health IT issues.\n\n\u201cParente testified on Capitol Hill earlier this week, urging caution in pushing the federal hub online before it has been thoroughly tested.\n\nThe Star Tribune reports that the recipient of the mishandled privacy data was applying to become an Obamacare \u201cnavigator\u201d:\n\n\u201cKoester, the agent, had been working with MNsure staff because he was having trouble registering for classes to get trained as a certified \u2018navigator\u2019 to help people sign up for coverage.\n\n\u201cKoester said there had been some back-and-forth with a MNsure staffer when he received an e-mail and attachment that took him by surprise: page after page of names, business addresses, license numbers and Social Security numbers.\n\n\u2026\u201c\u2018[T]he gorilla in the room is that they sent me something that\u2019s not even encrypted. It\u2019s unsecured, on an Excel spreadsheet \u2014 which is using outdated technology to transfer that information in the first place.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019ve got to realize they have a huge problem.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barack Obama,Health Care,insurance,Jeffrey H.
