INDIANAPOLIS -- A Senate committee voted Tuesday to amend and send forward a proposed repeal of Indiana's common construction wage.

The Senate Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee voted 8-5 in favor of the bill, which would scrap Indiana's decades-old pay scale for public projects.

The bill would also change the way public construction projects are bid in the future.

The issue has drawn heated debate inside the Statehouse. Outside supporters and opponents have ramped up efforts to reach the public with a flurry of competing television ads from unions, and one from the governor himself.

"By repealing the common construction law, we'll put hardworking taxpayers first. We'll put local governments and local schools in charge of their own destiny. And we'll open doors for businesses across our state," Gov. Mike Pence says in the ad.

With three and a half weeks left in the legislative session, the measure now moves to the full Senate for consideration.

The proposal would eliminate the five-member boards that are appointed under law to establish wages for public works projects costing $350,000 or more. It also requires workers to be "e-verified" to show they are U.S. citizens.

Supporters say it would save local governments 10 to 20 percent on public works projects, but opponents argue the savings would come on the backs of workers.

The proposal also outlines contractor penalties for workerâ€™s compensation fraud and other violations. It requires contractors with 10 or more employees to maintain an ongoing training program.
