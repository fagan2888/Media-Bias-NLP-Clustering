(Ramirez Group)\n\nFebruary 4, 2016\n\nCARSON CITY, Nev. \u2013 Nevada has the best record in the country when it comes to reducing the percentage of uninsured Hispanic children, according to a new report.\n\n\n\nThe study, called Historic Gains in Health Coverage for Hispanic Children in the Affordable Care Act's First Year, is from the Georgetown Center for Children and Families and the National Council of La Raza.\n\n\n\nIt shows the rate of Nevada's Hispanic children without health insurance fell by 33 percent from 2013 to 2014, the largest percentage point decline in the nation.\n\n\n\nDenise Tanata, executive director of the Children's Advocacy Alliance, credits Nevada's expansion of Medicaid, which covered many of those children's parents.\n\n\n\n\"There was this assumption that if we had more adults who were enrolling in Medicaid that they then would enroll their children as well, and the numbers that we're seeing now are actually playing that out,\" she states.\n\n\n\nTanata also credits the enormous bilingual outreach efforts launched in the state to enroll Hispanic families in Medicaid after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nHowever, Sonya Schwartz, a spokeswoman with the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, notes that as of 2014, 36,000 Hispanic children in Nevada remained uninsured.\n\n\n\n\"Nevada still has a long way to go,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cThat state still has the ninth largest number of uninsured Hispanic kids, but if it keeps going at this pace, it's going to make a significant dent again next year.\"\n\n\n\nNationally, the report found the number of uninsured Hispanic children dropped by approximately 300,000 children, from approximately 2 million in 2013 to 1.7 million in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Potter, Public News Service - NV", "article_metadata": {"description": "CARSON CITY, Nev. \u2013 Nevada has the best record in the country when it comes to reducing the percentage of uninsured Hispanic children, according to a new report.
