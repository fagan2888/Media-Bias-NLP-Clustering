Welcome to the Workcation!

With Americans taking fewer and shorter vacations, it was bound to happen. Workcations, a hybrid of work and vacation time, mean you can still get away to a dreamy and relaxing locale with the family while still keeping up with pressing (or not-so-pressing) work obligations. To make sure the employee actually gets to spend some time off, the expected work hours are defined beforehand.

Workcation days donâ€™t count as vacation days, making the prospect of attending a conference call or putting in eight-hour days from an exotic destination sounds a lot less grueling.
