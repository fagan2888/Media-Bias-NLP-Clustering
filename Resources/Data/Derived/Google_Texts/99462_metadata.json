So what will?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMedicaid expansion remains the Affordable Care Act's most high-wire political fight. Just look at the battle lines: Nineteen states \u2014 essentially all led by Republicans \u2014 are holding out. More than 5 million uninsured Americans fall in the resulting coverage gap, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, including more than 1.3 million people in Texas alone.\n\nSeeking to close that gap, the White House early today announced a new proposal: States can take advantage of three years of full federal funding whenever they join. It's an incentive that would be worth billions in additional federal dollars, if Congress goes for it \u2014 and if the holdout states opt in. Pro's Rachana Pradhan has the story here. http://politico.pro/1Zm9qla\n\nNOT A NEW FIGHT \u2014 Of course, the White House has already spent years trying to induce these states to join the Medicaid expansion. The Obama administration's most vocal ally in this push? Probably hospitals and health care systems, which have lobbied, long and loud, for expansion. When hospital giant HCA reported a recent spike in uninsured volumes, it blamed Texas's decision to not expand Medicaid.\n\nBut with few exceptions, politicians in holdout states aren't budging.\n\nLAMENT OVER MEDICAID \u2014 So what would get a state like Texas to expand Medicaid?\n\nI asked someone who'd know: John Davidson, the health policy director for the Texas Public Policy Foundation. (We spoke before the White House released its plan, so our conversation was focused on hypotheticals.)\n\n\"Before we can even begin having a debate\" about expansion, Davidson told me, \"we need to reform the way [Medicaid] is funded and the way it's run.\" Like many conservative critics of Obamacare, he argues that states lack the tools to rein in spending. Texas, for instance, has two blunt ways to control its rising Medicaid costs: Cut its rates or change how it pays providers. Neither strategy is popular among patients and providers.\n\nSo from Davidson's perspective, a tactic like temporarily increasing federal matching dollars won't make Medicaid expansion more palatable. Instead, growing the program will eventually exacerbate existing problems.\n\nAnd leaders in Medicaid holdout states say they don't want to be even more dependent on federal funds. Alabama legislators on Wednesday grilled that state's Medicaid director over whether the current 70 percent match rate gives the federal government too much control over Alabama's program.\n\nA CONSERVATIVE WISH LIST \u2014 Davidson believes that states should be able to add requirements for Medicaid applicants, like proof that they're seeking work, or penalize them for using too many emergency services. And he thinks that CMS should award Medicaid funds as block grants, so states would gain more control over eligibility and benefits.\n\nHowever, these ideas have been non-starters with the Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers. So who's going to budge? Maybe no one for now. And that's one reason why at this point, Medicaid expansion seems like a clash between a resistable force and an immovable object.\n\nENROLLMENT NUMBERS HEAD THE WRONG DIRECTION \u2014 CMS on Wednesday reported the latest open enrollment numbers: There were 74,239 plan selections through the federal exchange last week. For context, that's the third straight week when enrollment dipped below 84,000 sign-ups, and it's a turnaround from the \"unprecedented demand\" that CMS was celebrating when nearly 6 million consumers signed up for coverage by Dec. 17. What's going on, and what does it mean? Chalk one or two slow weeks up to the holidays, but three makes a trend \u2014 and that's why prognosticator Charles Gaba says he's dropping his estimate for total open enrollment by about 700,000 sign-ups. There are still a few weeks for the numbers to rebound. Barring an extension, open enrollment ends Jan. 31.\n\nHappy Thursday morning \u2014 where I'm still getting mileage out of this \"West Wing\"-themed tweet.

The city of Flint is already reeling over dangerous levels of lead in the water, but on Wednesday, Gov. Rick Snyder announced that there's also been a significant spike in cases of Legionnaires' disease in the surrounding county, leading to 10 deaths across the past 18 months. It's not clear if the two problems are connected \u2014 but it's not clear that they're not connected either, if you catch my drift. Our story for Pros.\n\nBIO'S ON BOARD FOR 'MOON SHOT' \u2014 ON ONE CONDITION \u2014 How\u2019s industry reacting to the White House's big cancer initiative? Pro\u2019s Sarah Karlin checked in with BIO\u2019s Jim Greenwood, who said that he personally approached Vice President Biden after the State of the Union to say that the biotech industry was \"delighted\" to work on the cancer initiative. But Greenwood, a former GOP congressman, warns that policymakers can't ask biotech firms to cure cancer one day and \"beat up\" on them the next, especially given the current climate. \"Industry is under tremendous pressure now on pricing and we are an easy political target,\" he told POLITICO. Our story for Pros.\n\nPhRMA: WE'RE DRIVING INNOVATION, TOO \u2014 CEO Steven Ubl on Wednesday also applauded the White House's cancer plan, while touting the biopharma industry's own record of innovation. The PhRMA chief points out one eye-catching statistic: The association's members invested more than $51 million in R&D in 2014, well outpacing the roughly $30 billion operating budget for the National Institutes of Health. http://onphr.ma/1UQb5yb\n\nCHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES AWAIT WHITE HOUSE \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden may announce more specifics about the cancer plan as soon as Friday, when he visits a cancer center in Philadelphia. While we (and the scientific community) anxiously await those details, POLITICO's Brett Norman, Arthur Allen, and Sarah Karlin dug into how the White House\u2019s support could change the status quo and identified some of the barriers that Biden and team are about to encounter. The full story for Pros.\n\nTWO BIG PLAYERS CONTINUE CLASH OVER SINGLE-PAYER \u2014 With the Iowa caucuses looming, and the Democratic race tightening, Hillary Clinton's campaign is ramping up attacks on Bernie Sanders' universal coverage plan \u2014 an unusual fight, given that coverage expansion is traditionally popular for Democrats. How Clinton's team is framing it: Sanders' plan is unrealistically expensive and could roll back major elements of Obamacare. Pro's Nancy Cook has the story here.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Coverage does not necessarily mean access to care.

But I didn't go into one contributing factor: Depression. It's widespread \u2014 a recent study found that nearly 30 percent of residents show signs of clinical depression \u2014 even if doctors don't want to talk about it. Aaron Carroll wrote about this in the New York Times this week, and we briefly caught up on Wednesday to discuss takeaways from his widely shared story.\n\nThe doctors' culture of silence is one major problem. \"I see far too many physicians who are depressed,\" Carroll told me, and \"not enough who seem open to recognizing that.\" He added that some doctors even seem to celebrate dysfunction. Carroll says he's heard about a residency program that bragged that its divorce rate was greater than 100 percent \u2014 because some residents divorced twice. \"They bragged about that,\" Carroll repeated for emphasis. \"I, on the other hand, was horrified.\"\n\nCOMMENTS SPLIT ON CDC OPIOID GUIDELINES \u2014 Pro's Brett Norman notes that more than 3,300 comments have been filed on CDC\u2019s draft opioid prescribing guidelines, including challenges from major physician organizations like the American Medical Association and the osteopathic societies. Other doc groups, including the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, are supportive as are some advocates including Consumers Union. The osteopaths register a host of objections and urge CDC to \"rethink\" the guideline and convene a \"broader panel of experts with equal representation of all relevant specialties and stakeholders.\" The AMA supports some of the 12 recommendations but objects to including recommended dosage thresholds and other key provisions aimed at reining in overprescribing. Wading through the mountain of docs is a tall order for the working group tasked to report back on Jan. 28.

The letter from Chair Fred Upton and colleagues notes that states received nearly $5 billion in grants to help establish their own insurance exchanges, but four of those states \u2014 Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon \u2014 have since opted to use Healthcare.gov instead. And it's a newly relevant issue, as Kentucky prepares to transition away from Kynect and join the federal exchange too.http://1.usa.gov/1Rmt80R\n\nCHOCOLATE MILK DOES A BODY GOOD. THE BRAIN, ON THE OTHER HAND \u2026 \u2014 The University of Maryland has launched an institutional review of an unusual study, which claimed that chocolate milk could improve brain function and reduce concussion-related problems. That's baffling enough, but what's weirder: The university sent out press releases before the study was peer reviewed, published in a journal, or even written up in full. Maybe there's a simple explanation: School officials didn't drink their chocolate milk that day.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Erin Mershon\n\nDrug companies are asking hemophilia patients and their relatives to help sell the drugs to others with the disease \u2014 which patient advocates warn can create conflicts of interest.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
