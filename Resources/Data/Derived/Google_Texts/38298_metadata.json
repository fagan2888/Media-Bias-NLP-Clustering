(AP) \u2014 The next time you order a drink at Firehouse Subs, take a close look at the cup. You might recognize the face looking back at you.\n\nBoulder police Officer Jenny Paddock\u2019s image now graces a series of drink cups served around the country to promote the fast-food chain\u2019s foundation that helps buy equipment for law enforcement and emergency personnel.\n\nThe Boulder Police Department was awarded $11,531.32 from the Ironman Foundation and Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation in 2014, and used the money to buy 12 new police bicycles.\n\nPaddock, who often bikes while on her patrol in downtown Boulder and was one of the people involved in securing the grant, said that officers carry about 25 pounds of equipment, so having the newer bicycles helped with their response time.\n\n\u201cHaving a new, light-weight bike really helps in everyday response,\u201d she said.\n\nFounded in 1994 by firefighting brothers Robin and Chris Sorensen in Florida, Firehouse Subs has more than 900 locations across the U.S. and Canada, including a location at 1695 29th St. in Boulder.\n\nIn 2005, the Sorensens helped feed first responders in Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina devastated the area, and the brothers were inspired to create the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation to provide money for agencies to buy equipment.\n\n\u201cThey came back and often referred to (the visit) as a game changer, and they knew we were in a position to do more,\u201d said Meghan Vargas, senior manager of foundation development for Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to improving the life-saving capabilities of our local heroes as well as improving the lives of the communities that they serve.\u201d\n\nTo help raise awareness of the foundation, Firehouse Subs decided to feature several first responders from agencies around the country on its cups posing with their equipment. Vargas, who works in Denver, had worked with Paddock on the grant for the bicycles, so she knew who at least one of the subjects would be.\n\n\u201cWe already had a relationship so it was easy to reach out to Jenny to see if she would be featured on our cups,\u201d Vargas said.\n\nThough Paddock was initially hesitant \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m shy,\u201d she said \u2014 she agreed to be on the cup. While eating a sandwich at the Boulder Firehouse location this week, Paddock recounted going to her shoot and discovering the photographer wasn\u2019t exactly used to taking photos of people.\n\n\u201cHe normally does these,\u201d Paddock said, pointing at a photo of a sandwich on one of the restaurant\u2019s signs. \u201cThen we had to figure out, how do you fit a bike and an officer in a profile on a cup?\u201d\n\nBut after an hour-long shoot Paddock and the photographer got the shot they needed, and by the start of the year her photo was featured in Firehouse locations around the country.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Paddock has gotten recognition for her work. She was also the recipient of the department\u2019s City Value Award of Respect for her work with the homeless population.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been involved in a lot of good things in this community, not just this campaign,\u201d said Boulder police spokeswoman Shannon Cordingly.\n\nVargas said the cup campaign\u2019s goal is to raise awareness for the foundation, which provides about 70 percent of the donations by donating change, rounding up bills or even buying the restaurants\u2019 recycled pickle jars.\n\n\u201cI thought it turned out well,\u201d said Paddock, who has heard from friends as far away as Louisiana who spotted her on the cups. \u201cI had a friend who was almost to the trash when she just looked down and said, \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019 and she takes a picture and of course posts it on Facebook and saying, \u2018Hey, look who I found.'\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Daily Camera, http://www.dailycamera.com/", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Firehouse Subs features Boulder officer on cups nationwide", "title": "Firehouse Subs features Boulder officer on cups nationwide", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/firehouse-subs-features-boulder-officer-on-cups-nationwide/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T09:24:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-06T09:24:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BOULDER, Colo.
