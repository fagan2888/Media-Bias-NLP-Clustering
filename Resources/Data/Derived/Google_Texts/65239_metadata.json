That\u2019s compared to a statewide average increase of 9.3 percent.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s saw an increase in bad debt of 17.2 percent.\n\nSimon said she couldn\u2019t speculate on debt figures for specific hospitals, but bad debt in general has been rising for the past decade statewide.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we have seen changes in cost-sharing where people who have health insurance tend to have higher cost-sharing\u201d such as higher deductibles or higher co-pays, Simon said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a relationship.\u201d\n\nEric Lohn, chief financial officer at St. Luke\u2019s, agreed.\n\nPlans have come with increasingly higher deductibles, ranging as high as $15,000, Lohn said.\n\n\u201cEven an insured person cannot afford that deductible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tends to gravitate toward bad debt.\u201d\n\nKevin Boren, chief financial officer for Essentia Health\u2019s East Region, said bad debt fluctuates from year to year, and will be lower at St. Mary\u2019s in 2015. There\u2019s a \u201creally thin line,\u201d he said between cases that are written off as charity care in the first place and those for which payment is expected but that end up being written off as bad debt.\n\n\u201cWe serve all patients regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d Boren said.\n\nAlthough bad debt increased, charity care dropped 22.4 percent statewide, according to the health department. That was only the second time since 2001 that charity care fell in Minnesota.\n\nThe percentage of charity care fell as the percentage of uninsured Minnesotans also dropped since the establishment of the Affordable Care Act, said Stefan Gildemeister, the state\u2019s health economist. Although the data aren\u2019t sufficient to show a direct link between the two, \u201cthere appears to be a correlation,\u201d he said.\n\nCharity care declined by 70.8 percent from 2013 to 2014 at St. Luke\u2019s, according to the data. That didn\u2019t result from any policy change at the hospital, Lohn said. He attributed the decline largely to the expansion of Medicaid in the state.\n\n\u201cSo a lot of patients who historically had qualified for charity care were (now) qualified through Medicaid,\u201d Lohn said.\n\nAt St. Mary\u2019s, charity care actually increased, by 1.6 percent.\n\nBoren agreed that Medicaid expansion has moved some patients statewide out of the charity care category.\n\nBut Essentia Health has been identifying more patients as eligible for charity care early in the process, Boren said.\n\n\u201cOver time we\u2019d like to make sure that the folks that deserve charity care are in that charity care bucket,\u201d he said.\n\nCharity care and bad debt combined produce a hospital\u2019s uncompensated costs. At St. Mary\u2019s, bad debt in 2014 was $8.4 million and charity care $2.7 million, for a total of $11.1 million in uncompensated care, according to the state data. At St. Luke\u2019s, the totals were $2.1 million in bad debt and $2.1 million in charity care, for a total of $4.2 million.\n\nThose numbers amounted to 3.3 percent of operating expenses for St. Mary\u2019s and 1.4 percent for St. Luke\u2019s.\n\n\u201cNeither of those numbers are alarming,\u201d Simon said. In comparison, Hennepin County Medical Center, the state\u2019s largest provider of uncompensated care, spent 5.1 percent of its operating costs in charity care and bad debt, she said.\n\nThe percentages would be higher in other states, such as Texas, Boren said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to live in a state where we have rather robust safety net programs.\u201d\n\nBut bad debt and charity care don\u2019t truly make up all of a hospital\u2019s uncompensated costs, Lohn said. Last year, the hospital spent almost $11 million more than it was reimbursed on Medicaid cases and $48 million more on Medicare cases, he said.\n\nAll told, \u201cthe number gets in excess of $80 million,\u201d Lohn said. \u201cThen you\u2019re getting into a percentage that\u2019s more than 10 percent, and that\u2019s concerning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,duluth,Debt,Minnesota,hospitals", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lundy", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Globe", "description": "DULUTH \u2014 Duluth\u2019s largest hospital experienced an increase in bad debt more than six times the statewide average last year, according to data released by the Minnesota Department of Health last week.\r\n\r\nBad debt \u2014 payments that hospitals expect but never receive \u2014 continues to climb statewid...", "title": "Bad debt up at Minnesota hospitals", "url": "http://www.dglobe.com/news/3853584-bad-debt-minnesota-hospitals", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.dglobe.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/100515.N.DNT_.BadDebt.jpg?itok=YMzYUSps", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "DULUTH \u2014 Duluth\u2019s largest hospital experienced an increase in bad debt more than six times the statewide average last year, according to data released by the Minnesota Department of Health last week.\r\n\r\nBad debt \u2014 payments that hospitals expect but never receive \u2014 continues to climb statewid...", "title": "Bad debt up at Minnesota hospitals", "url": "http://www.dglobe.com/news/3853584-bad-debt-minnesota-hospitals", "image": "http://www.dglobe.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/100515.N.DNT_.BadDebt.jpg?itok=rM0Pi5VQ", "site": "dglobe", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 609347255798029}, "keywords": "News,duluth,Debt,Minnesota,hospitals", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyglobe", "tag": "News,duluth,Debt,Minnesota,hospitals", "modified_time": "2015-10-04T20:24:13-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "The statistics of two Duluth hospitals show rising bad debt in Minnesota."}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "DULUTH \u2014 Duluth\u2019s largest hospital experienced an increase in bad debt more than six times the statewide average last year, according to data released by..."}, "article_summary": "Bad debt up at Minnesota hospitalsThe statistics of two Duluth hospitals show rising bad debt in Minnesota.\nSimon said she couldn\u2019t speculate on debt figures for specific hospitals, but bad debt in general has been rising for the past decade statewide.\n\u201cOver time we\u2019d like to make sure that the folks that deserve charity care are in that charity care bucket,\u201d he said.\nCharity care and bad debt combined produce a hospital\u2019s uncompensated costs.\nBad debt \u2014 payments that hospitals expect but never receive \u2014 continues to climb statewide in Minnesota, said Alisha Baines Simon, a supervisor in the health department\u2019s economics program."}
