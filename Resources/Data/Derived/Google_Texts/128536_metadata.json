Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And we\u2019re going to stay there in Vermont, where the incumbent Democratic governor, Peter Shumlin, has nearly been unseated in a shocking upset. In a process unique to Vermont, projections now show the governor\u2019s race will be decided by the state Legislature after neither Shumlin nor his Republican challenger, Scott Milne, reached the necessary threshold of 50 percent. In other states, it might be a runoff. In Vermont, the state Legislature will decide. It remains solidly Democratic, so Shumlin will likely keep his seat.\n\nThe election is seen as a possible referendum on healthcare reform, after Governor Shumlin has vowed to make Vermont the first state with a single-payer healthcare system. The state\u2019s embattled health insurance exchange implemented under Obamacare has been down since September.\n\nFor more, we\u2019re going to Peter Sterling, executive director of Vermont Leads, an organization that advocates for single-payer healthcare in Vermont. He\u2019s in the nation\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s in the state\u2019s capital, Montpelier.\n\nWelcome, Peter Sterling, to Democracy Now! We only have a minute before we go to Colorado, some other stunning results there. But talk about the significance of what\u2019s taken place in Vermont.\n\nPETER STERLING: Well, coming into this year, the governor seemed to have the wind at his back. Vermonters and polling really showed we wanted to move toward single-payer healthcare. And this election result does seem to take some of the wind away from Governor Shumlin and his plans, the centerpiece of his administration.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, talk about\u2014I mean, there\u2019s two things that have gone on here. Vermont could be the first single-payer state, but you, unlike a number of states, have had a complete crisis with the Obamacare exchange, with the Vermont healthcare exchange. How did that happen? And even if Governor Shumlin has made the point that, you know, it\u2019s complicated, and that\u2019s why we need single payer\u2014that\u2019s a very fine distinction\u2014people see that the government can\u2019t run healthcare in Vermont. And will he be able to carry out this mandate if indeed the Legislature chooses him?\n\nPETER STERLING: I mean, it\u2019s a good point. And, I mean, we\u2019re a small state. You\u2019re largely going to see the same people who have been leading on the exchange lead on the movement to single-payer healthcare and to implementing it. But at the end of the day, the exchange is a problem with the website, which is on a very short timeline set up by the Affordable Care Act. We have many\u2014a few years to do Green Mountain Care, so I think the governor can re-establish that confidence in his administration to implement up the nation\u2019s first universal, publicly financed healthcare system.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And just the response\u2014we have 20 seconds\u2014to what has happened, that this race will be decided, as Peter Shumlin\u2019s first governorship was decided, by the Vermont Legislature?\n\nPETER STERLING: It\u2019s certainly shocking to everyone here in the state that it was this close. But I would say that most voters did not go to the polls on a referendum on universal healthcare; they went there on property taxes and other local issues. So I\u2019m not sure that the governor\u2019s result was a referendum on the popularity of universal healthcare.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Peter Sterling, thanks for being with us, executive director of Vermont Leads, the organization that advocates for single-payer healthcare in Vermont.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Democracy Now!", "description": "In Vermont, incumbent Democratic Gov.
