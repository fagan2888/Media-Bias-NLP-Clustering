While Marvel president Kevin Feige has been too busy to prioritize a superhero movie exclusively starring a woman, Sony is reportedly gearing up for a female-led superhero movie within the “Spider-Man” universe. Deadline reports that the movie will come some time in 2017 as part of a “top-to-bottom revamp of its most important property,” which includes a set of “Sinister Six” spin-offs as well.

Screenwriter Lisa Joy Nolan will pen the script, but there’s no word on which female will get her own lead role. As Deadline reports, there are a few characters Sony might choose:

Spider-Woman is known in the comics both as Jennifer Drew, then Julia Carpenter, Mattie Franklin, Veranke and also as Charlotte Witter, a fashion designer who is genetically altered by Dr. Octopus. Silver Sable has virtually no superhuman powers but is an adept fighter, skilled in martial arts and sword play who wears a lot of techno gizmo weaponry. Black Cat was introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as Felicia, Harry Osborn’s assistant, and was played by Felicity Jones; she is also a trained fighter and acrobat. Stunner was a video store clerk who ended up getting a makeover by Dr. Octopus to make her a powerful evil.
