I\u2019ve been playing this game since I was 5. I know how to be a runner. I just stopped thinking and stopped trying to make things happen that weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nMorris rattled off runs of 30, 22 and 16 yards on the afternoon, eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and the 11th time in his career. He had not run more than 100 yards since Week 10 of last season, when he finished with 139 yards on 26 carries in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nSEE ALSO: RG3 can\u2019t make decisive plays as Redskins fall at San Francisco\n\nThe third-year running back was effective both inside and outside the tackles, showing a knack for identifying and utilizing cutback lanes that he has lacked for most of this season.\n\n\u201cAlfred has been running really hard the last few weeks,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cI really want to commend Alfred, the way he\u2019s running and his ball security has been excellent. It helps our play action and our boot calls.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s running game struggled early in the season before taking noticeable strides in its previous two games, after the return of quarterback Robert Griffin III. Morris ran for 92 yards in a loss to the Vikings on Nov. 2 and 96 yards last week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nSEE ALSO: David Amerson misses Redskins\u2019 game at San Francisco\n\nOn Sunday, he broke through the 100-yard barrier, an achievement he downplayed after the game.\n\n\u201cI could care less about stats, honestly,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThe only thing I care about is winning. That\u2019s the type of league that we\u2019re in: if you\u2019re not winning, it really doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWith Williams out, Moses makes first start at tackle\n\nLeft tackle Trent Williams did not play Sunday because of a sprained MCL in his right knee and a sprained right ankle, leaving rookie Morgan Moses to fill in for Williams and make his first NFL start.\n\nWilliams sprained the MCL in his right knee and also sprained his right ankle in the first quarter of the Redskins\u2019 loss to Tampa Bay last week. Unable to practice at any point during the week, Williams showed a noticeable limp and was listed as questionable on the Redskins\u2019 injury report.\n\nMoses replaced Williams for all but seven snaps against Tampa Bay. Taken in the third round out of Virginia in the NFL Draft in May, it was the most extensive action Moses has seen on offense all season.\n\nFor most of the game, Moses was lined up against Pro Bowl defensive end Aldon Smith, who finished with two of San Francisco\u2019s five sacks.\n\n\u201cBeing able to get your first start away from home definitely is a learning experience, especially when you\u2019re going against great players that have played this game for a long time,\u201d Moses said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to go into the offense, look at the tape, evaluate yourself and be honest with yourself and just go back at it and work on the techniques.\u201d\n\nJackson makes Redskins debut as punt returner\n\nDeSean Jackson\u2019s punt-returning prowess was well-documented before he arrived in Washington, but the Redskins had never used him as a returner \u2014 until Sunday.\n\nJackson said the coaching staff approached him during the week about the possibility of returning punts, and he was happy to oblige. He replaced Andre Roberts in the third quarter and fielded three punts, twice waving for a fair catch and returning the third for no gain.\n\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m asked to do whatever it is, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt was good to get back there. I haven\u2019t been back there for a while. So it was kind of good to get those opportunities again.\u201d\n\nJackson also finished with two catches and 39 yards in the game.\n\nSpecial teams captain Hayward leaves with injury to right leg\n\nInside linebacker and special teams captain Adam Hayward sustained a tibial plateau fracture in his right leg in the third quarter when he landed awkwardly while trying to down a punt. He believes he will miss the final five games of the season.\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m letting everybody down. That\u2019s the worst part.\u201d\n\nThe break occurred at very top of the tibia, just below where the bone meets the knee. Hayward was attempting to down a punt at the end of the 49ers\u2019 first drive of the quarter when he leapt for the ball, grabbed it and landed awkwardly.\n\nHayward said he will undergo additional examinations on Monday to see if there\u2019s any damage to the ligaments in the knee.\n\nGruden, Redskins finally win replay challenge\n\nThe Redskins won an instant replay challenge for the first time this season.\n\nGruden challenged a spot that gave San Francisco a first down with 5:28 to play in the fourth quarter. Replay showed that Vernon Davis had actually come up a half yard short on the play and the call was reversed, making it fourth down. But the 49ers went for it and Frank Gore converted on their way to what proved to be the game-winning touchdown.\n\nGruden had lost his first six challenges as Redskins coach.\n\nExtra points\n\nRunning back Silas Redd exited the game with a rib contusion and did not return. \u2026 With a sack late in the second quarter, Ryan Kerrigan matched his career-high with 8.5 sacks in a single season. \u2026 The Redskins had previously ruled out nose tackle Chris Baker and tight end Jordan Reed because of injury. Wide receivers Leonard Hankerson and Aldrick Robinson and quarterback Kirk Cousins were also inactive; Hankerson made his first appearance last week after spending the first nine games on the physically-unable-to-perform list. \u2026 Tight end Niles Paul, linebacker Keenan Robinson and fullback Darrel Young were named team captains for Sunday\u2019s game alongside usual captains Hayward and Ryan Clark. \u2026 Tress Way matched career-highs with eight punts and three punts downed inside the 20-yard line.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Morris rattled off runs of 30, 22 and 16 yards on the afternoon, eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and the 11th time in his career.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Morris rattled off runs of 30, 22 and 16 yards on the afternoon, eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and the 11th time in his career.", "title": "Redskins notes: Alfred Morris eclipses 100-yard mark in rushing for first time this season", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/23/alfred-morris-eclipses-100-yard-mark-in-rushing-fo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/23/redskins-49ers-footba_lanc2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/23/redskins-49ers-footba_lanc2.jpg", "description": "Morris rattled off runs of 30, 22 and 16 yards on the afternoon, eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and the 11th time in his career.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins notes: Alfred Morris eclipses 100-yard mark in rushing for fi"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer and Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Alf Morris, Jay Gruden"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7f9\"", "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: David Amerson misses Redskins\u2019 game at San FranciscoOn Sunday, he broke through the 100-yard barrier, an achievement he downplayed after the game.\nUnable to practice at any point during the week, Williams showed a noticeable limp and was listed as questionable on the Redskins\u2019 injury report.\nGruden, Redskins finally win replay challengeThe Redskins won an instant replay challenge for the first time this season.\nMorris ran for 92 yards in a loss to the Vikings on Nov. 2 and 96 yards last week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\u2026 With a sack late in the second quarter, Ryan Kerrigan matched his career-high with 8.5 sacks in a single season."}
