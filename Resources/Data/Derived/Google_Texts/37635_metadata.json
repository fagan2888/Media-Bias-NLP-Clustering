The Nuggets missed you.\n\nAfter being MIA the previous two games, the Nuggets were able to find some of it again Saturday night in an effort that gained steam as the game progressed and ended with a 103-92 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good. It\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve won on the second night of a back-to-back all season,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you have to have. We were down a man with Ty Lawson being out so guys knew that they would go a little bit deeper into our bench.\u201d\n\nIt was a gritty victory and the first time the Nuggets (12-8) eclipsed the 100-point mark in the past three games.\n\nIt snapped a two-game losing streak and made certain the Nuggets will go home with no worse than a .500 record on this six-game Eastern Conference road swing. They can make a winning trek with a victory at Washington on Monday night.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nThis win was a much-needed reprieve from a couple of tough outings filled with self-inflicted wounds. They again inflicted a few on themselves in this one before things started to work themselves out.\n\nMost notably, allowing Philadelphia free reign in the paint. For about two and a half quarters, the Sixers (7-14) did whatever they wanted inside and opened up as much as a 10-point lead. But free throws, oddly enough for the team that struggles to hit them, kept the Nuggets close.\n\n\u201cWe talked about the fact that this was kind of an unorthodox team in that their paint points mainly come from their guards,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThey\u2019re attacking the paint; (Spencer) Hawes and Thaddeus Young pick-and-pop a lot. We were up on guys and they were just driving around us and into the paint. We weren\u2019t having any weakside awareness with our weakside defenders, but we did a better job of that in the second half with Anthony Randolph\u2019s activity and alertness.\u201d\n\nAnd in the third quarter, the Nuggets began figuring things out defensively.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t rocket science. The Nuggets simply needed to cut off the lane, and they started to do that in the third. When that happened, Philadelphia\u2019s lead began to erode. At the same time, guard Nate Robinson was making plays that mattered, scoring and finding players in positions where they could score.\n\nBy the end of the third, Robinson had scored eight points in the quarter, pushing his total to 20 for the game and the game was tied at 77.\n\nJordan Hamilton delivered the knockout blows in the fourth quarter, nailing three consecutive 3-pointers to take the Nuggets from a 90-88 lead to a 99-88 lead with 3:21 left.\n\n\u201d The first one went in when (Andre Miller) found me on the baseline, Hamilton said. \u201d Then the second one fell. Then in transition, Evan Turner didn\u2019t step up so I was like \u2018I\u2019m getting this off.\u2019 And it went it and they called timeout. I was just feeling it.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets outscored the 76ers 26-15 in the final quarter to pull away.\n\n\u201cOnce again, it was a good team effort,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cGuys, they stayed ready. We just were searching all night for a combination of guys to be effective, and I think the biggest thing, holding them to 15 points in the fourth quarter was huge for us.\u201d\n\nThe free-throw line turned out to be the Nuggets\u2019 friend all night. They marched to the line for 34 shots, far outpacing their Philadelphia counterparts (14). And the Nuggets made 26, a respectable enough percentage \u2014 .765 \u2014 that they were able to withstand shaky play until they ironed out the wrinkles.\n\n\u201cWe just found a way to get some stops,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey came out aggressive early, attacking the basket, a lot of paint points early. We found a way to contain them and force them to take some tough shots. Jordan caught a little fire and kind of rode him the rest of the game.\u201d\n\nNuggets Recap\n\nWhat you might have missed\n\nEvan Fournier got his first taste of significant court time in a long while, playing 21 minutes. It was the most minutes he played since Nov. 16. \u2026 The 76ers had 40 points in the paint \u2014 by halftime. \u2026 The Nuggets had 19 second-chance points.\n\nFinal thought\n\nNot always pretty, but the Nuggets sorted through the muck to get a needed win.\n\nUp next\n\nAt Washington, 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets rally past Philadelphia 76ers for a road victory", "title": "Nuggets rally past Philadelphia 76ers for a road victory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/07/nuggets-rally-past-philadelphia-76ers-for-a-road-victory/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131207__nuggets-nate-robinsonp1.jpg", "height": 648}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131207__nuggets-nate-robinsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-07T19:39:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T06:49:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac28\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe talked about the fact that this was kind of an unorthodox team in that their paint points mainly come from their guards,\u201d Shaw said.\n\u201cThey came out aggressive early, attacking the basket, a lot of paint points early.\nIt\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve won on the second night of a back-to-back all season,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said.\nI was just feeling it.\u201dThe Nuggets outscored the 76ers 26-15 in the final quarter to pull away.\nIt snapped a two-game losing streak and made certain the Nuggets will go home with no worse than a .500 record on this six-game Eastern Conference road swing."}
