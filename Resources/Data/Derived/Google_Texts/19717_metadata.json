The company is issuing a nationwide call since the locations of the stores that purchased these products are unknown. They urge consumers to throw away the fruit immediately, which can be identified through this list.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of no illnesses related to the consumption of these products,\u201d Brent Smittcamp, president of Wawona Packing Co., said in the FDA news release. \u201cBy taking the precautionary step of recalling product, we will minimize even the slightest risk to public health, and that is our priority.\u201d In order to prevent future concerns, Wawona has reportedly cleaned packing lines as well as any equipment linked to possible contamination. They\u2019ve been testing their products daily and haven\u2019t found any further traces of the bacteria.\n\nThe bacteria, L. monocytogenes, causes listeriosis, a serious infection that can be fatal. Children, elderly people, and pregnant women are more likely to get infected with the bacteria, especially after eating contaminated food. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1,600 people in the U.S. get infected with Listeria every year. It\u2019s the third leading cause of death from food poisoning, and up to 90 percent of these people are pregnant women or their newborns.
