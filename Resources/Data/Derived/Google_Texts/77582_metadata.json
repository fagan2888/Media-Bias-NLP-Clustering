It's a big job that takes dozens of volunteers. This year one of them was an 84-year-old Okmulgee woman. Though Hazel Rissler will tell you, she\u2019s not your typical 84 year old.\n\n\u201cGod just granted me good health, and I like to do things and I like to volunteer,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nSigns of the season are in every room of Hazel's home.\n\n\u201cI think Christmas all year,\u201d Hazel said. \u201cI love Christmas.\u201d\n\nShe also loves to decorate for Christmas and makes most of her decorations herself. The most special, perhaps, is the tree skirt she made with her late husband's neckties.\n\n\u201cIt also looks really great on the dining room table with a centerpiece in the middle,\u201d she said.\n\nHer creativity, along with her love for Christmas, are likely why Hazel was invited to help decorate the White House.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting. I had a fun time doing everything,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nIt's a tradition that started in 1889. Hazel says it was forgotten for a while and then Jackie Kennedy started it up again.\n\nIn recent years, HGTV aired a special about the White House\u2019s transition to Christmas and the volunteers who help make it happen. Hazel has always wanted to go. She mentioned it to her son, Paul, then he and his wife spent all winter and spring working on the application.\n\nOut of 8,000 applications, Hazel was one of 93 accepted. Paul called her in mid-October with the good news.\n\n\u201cHe said, 'Well, sit down mother, you've been accepted,\u2019\u201d Hazel recalled.\n\n\n\nShe says Paul was so confident she'd be selected, he bought her tickets to Washington D.C. before she'd even been invited to volunteer. Hazel admits she did some shopping ahead of time, too.\n\n\u201cI got eight new Christmas sweaters. I had one for every day,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nOne was an OSU sweater. She also took an Oklahoma State ornament with her. It hung on one of the White House trees briefly, but it couldn\u2019t stay because it didn\u2019t go with the color scheme.\n\nIn all, Hazel spent 10 days in Washington D.C., a week of that was at the White House decorating, helping create mantle masterpieces, stringing ornaments for garland and, more than anything, just taking it all in.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk those halls, you just feel so little, everything is just so great there,\u201d Hazel said. \u201cJust knowing who has walked through those doors. It is our White House and what it represents.\u201d\n\nShe saw Michelle Obama when the First Lady came down to thank the volunteers. She also got a glimpse of the president when he left the White House one day.\n\n\u201cWe saw his back and of course, the good looking Marines that escorted him out,\u201d she said.\n\nHer last night was spent at a White House reception with her son, Paul, who helped her get there.\n\nHazel calls it a once-in-a-lifetime experience, although she hopes she might get the opportunity a second time.\n\n\n\n\u201cI'd go back in a heartbeat. They act like they like me,\u201d she said laughing.\n\nShe says some have been volunteers have been selected more than once, so she plans to apply again next year. Part of the application process includes a 2,000-word letter. She also submitted pictures of her decorations.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "It's a yearly tradition to decorate the White House for Christmas.
