No one is poisoned or drowned or stabbed in If/Then, Menzel\u2019s new show which opened on Broadway this week, plus her character is named Elizabeth, the show is set in the present-day New York, and it\u2019s a musical. But that said, you won\u2019t find a more conflicted, more hesitant, more self-doubting, more soliloquy-prone character on a New York stage this season\u2014certainly not one who can belt out a song like this.\n\nIf/Then is a product of the same creative team that brought Next to Normal to Broadway five years ago, winning three Tony awards as well as a Pulitzer. The new show borrows a split narrative device from the 1998 Gwyneth Paltrow movie Sliding Doors (and there must be older antecedents than that) with twin stories about the same heroine diverging from a single point in time: here\u2019s what happens if Elizabeth, a romantically-bruised single woman \u201cflirting with 40,\u201d goes with one friend to listen to a street musician in a park; and here\u2019s what happens if Elizabeth accompanies a second friend to an affordable-housing protest. (Those are her choices? No wonder she\u2019s depressed.) Will she find love? Will she find a job that actually makes use of her talents? Will the audience care enough to return from their intermission Milk Duds?\n\nThis ambitious mixed bag of a show is ostensibly about fate, destiny, chance, choice, alternate lives, stuff like that. The characters talk about \u201csigns,\u201d about their destinies being written in \u201cthe stars,\u201d and, of course, since this is in essence a romantic comedy-drama, about finding \u201cthe one\u201d \u2014if \u201cthe one\u201d even exists. (Spoiler: he does, but it\u2019s complicated.) Are these questions interesting, even by the relatively low philosophical standards of the Broadway musical? (Personally, I believe in inertia, not fate.) At times, the first act played like a cross between a dorm-room bull session and an oratorio, at once abstract and jejune\u2014and staged in a style that was spare yet irritatingly busy. A mirrored backdrop, which sometimes became a ceiling, maybe made conceptual sense\u2014mirrored lives, mirrored destinies! \u2014but looked like it belonged in an 80s night club and proved distracting. I\u2019d wager front-row audiences aren\u2019t paying top-ticket Broadway prices to see themselves over Idina Menzel\u2019s shoulder.\n\nSo, the good news: If/Then is the rare musical with a second act much stronger than its first. It focuses rather than fizzles. Cosmic concerns are trumped by psychological ones; questions of fate and destiny devolve into nittier-grittier issues of regret, ambivalence, conflicting emotions, hesitancy, risk-taking. A partial list of song titles will give you some flavor:\n\n\u201cYou Never Know\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the Fuck?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I Go\u201d\n\n\u201cBest Worst Mistake\u201d\n\n\u201cI Hate You\u201d\n\nA chorus of \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d wouldn\u2019t be out of place here. The songs, by composer Tom Kitt and lyricist Brian Yorkey (who also wrote the book) have less of a rock edge than their score for Next to Normal; it fits more easily into the pop/rock/show-tune m\u00e9lange that has become Broadway\u2019s contemporary normal. Come to think of it, Menzel\u2019s big hit from Frozen, \u201cLet It Go,\u201d wouldn\u2019t be out of place here either, thematically or musically.\n\nSpeaking of the star, this is clearly designed to be her show, from the first spotlight and line of dialogue\u2014\u201cI get lost in what might be\u201d\u2014but, at times, given the complexities of forming twin stories while introducing a half dozen or so other characters whose lives are also twinned, Menzel gets lost in a literal shuffle of characters and scenic elements and the figurative gear-grinding of plot mechanics. Once things slow down, however, and once she\u2019s given an actual character to play, rather than a conceit, she blossoms, and the show blossoms with her\u2014jokes land, emotions are felt rather than telegraphed, the audience maybe feels something too.\n\nNot that If/Then is ever as moving as the devastating Next to Normal, which was held together by Alice Ripley\u2019s performance as a mother suffering from bipolar disorder\u2014and If/Then is not really meant to be as moving, I think. But in the penultimate number, \u201cAlways Starting Over,\u201d which Menzel sings solo, spotlighted on an otherwise dark stage, she holds the audience not just with her voice\u2014big, but not that big\u2014but through sheer force of will. I felt as if I were in the grip of a diva tractor beam, as if star power had a gravitational pull. This is a genuine physical sensation by the way. I've felt it twice before, with Sutton Foster, in the 2011 revival of Anything Goes, and Liza Minnelli in a one-woman show several lifetimes ago. Broadway legend has it that Ethel Merman's gravitation pull was so strong she would bend light waves.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bruce Handy on Idina Menzel\u2019s hypnotizing performance in If/Then, and the disappointing Heathers: the Musical.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Bruce Handy", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "Bruce Handy on Idina Menzel\u2019s hypnotizing performance in If/Then, and the disappointing Heathers: the Musical.", "title": "What\u2019s Holding Idina Menzel Back in If/Then?
