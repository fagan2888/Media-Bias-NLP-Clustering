TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - Tucson police say someone intentionally placed spikes on five manhole covers around the city on Tuesday, causing tires to blow out on 10 cars.

This marks the third time this year that spikes have been left on roads, severely damaging cars and posing a serious threat, spokesman Sgt. Pete Dugan said.

So far only tires have fallen victim to the spikes.

“But it’s only a matter of time. If somebody hits that with speed and causes the car to veer off it can definitely cause a collision,” Dugan said.

Police believe the same person left spikes on manhole covers in January and last month. The spikes appear to be bolts that were sharpened and are the same as those found in the prior incidents. They were also found in the same general area, the city’s east side. In total, around 15 cars have fallen victim to the scheme. Dugan said cars that run over the spikes lose not just one but two tires.

“Somebody’s doing a little prank that could be extremely serious,” Dugan said.

Police are asking for the public’s help in identifying the person or people who have left the spikes on roads.
