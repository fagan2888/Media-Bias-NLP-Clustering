MARCO RUBIO: Well, it depends what you mean by an immigration bill. I think we can pass \u2013 I think we can pass bills that reform our legal immigration system, which is completely broken. I think there\u2019s an emerging consensus that we need to have an immigration system that is more based on economics and job skill and merit and less on family connection, not totally discard family, but it has to be less of a factor.\n\nI think there has to be a consensus, and I think there is, that the enforcement mechanisms we have in place don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t work. We don\u2019t have a viable entry/exit tracking system for visitors. We don\u2019t have \u2014 there are sectors of the border that remain highly insecure. And we don\u2019t have an electronic system for employers to verify.\n\nGWEN IFILL: What \u2014 am I missing the consensus part? I heard the speaker of the House say there are things that everyone agrees on, but they don\u2019t trust the president.\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: No, no, on those issues, I think there\u2019s a consensus. Here\u2019s where the trust factor comes in, the third aspect of the problem, right? We have to modernize legal immigration. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s controversial. We have to have better enforcement mechanisms. That in and of itself is not controversial. And then the third question, which is the toughest: What do you do with 12 million human beings that are here now, who are illegally here in the country today? What do you do with them?\n\nSo no one is advocating you round them up and deport them. Nobody reasonable is advocating that. And no one\u2019s saying we should \u2014 or blanket amnesty either. So what the emerging consensus has been is we understand we have to deal with that. We understand we have to create a system to somehow accommodate the people that are here already, but we\u2019re only willing to do that if we can ensure that this problem never happens again. And they push \u2013 and they point back to 1986, when in fact 3 million people were given status, but then the enforcement measures didn\u2019t happen, and that led to 12 million.\n\nSo the trust factor that the speaker\u2019s talking about is the argument that I got last year when we were pushing on this. People would say to me, we agree with the outline of what you\u2019ve put forth, but we don\u2019t believe that \u2014 we think the president will simply ignore the enforcement aspects of the law \u2014\n\nGWEN IFILL: In the way that Ronald Reagan did? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: Yeah, they\u2019d say that. They\u2019ll say that even under Reagan, they didn\u2019t enforce the law and that this president wouldn\u2019t either, and as a result, you\u2019ll have the legalization, but you\u2019ll never get the enforcement. So we came up with a \u2014 the idea of a trigger. First the enforcement happens, and that would trigger the legalization process. Again, people didn\u2019t trust that because they believe that the trigger is in the eye of the beholder \u2014\n\nGWEN IFILL: Is it that they don\u2019t trust the way of getting to it, or they just don\u2019t trust the president?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: I think there\u2019s a general mistrust of the federal government given the historical reality that neither party has effectively enforced immigration laws. You don\u2019t get to 12 million people without \u2014 across four presidencies if you don\u2019t have some level of, you know, both sides having some responsibility for it.\n\nAnd then it goes beyond that. It goes to a distrust of this president. And the reason why is they\u2019ll say \u2014 and rightfully so \u2014 look at \u201cObamacare,\u201d his own signature law. He is unilaterally picking and choosing which parts of it go into effect and which parts do not. So once again, just a few days ago, he waives another requirement of \u201cObamacare.\u201d What if he does that to the entry/exit tracking system? What if he does that to the border security?\n\nGWEN IFILL: So that\u2019s an argument to do nothing?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: That\u2019s an argument that\u2019s being used to say it\u2019s undoable under this president. My argument is, and continues to be \u2014 and this was my preference from the beginning. Now, the Senate began to work on a comprehensive approach, and I decided to work on that because I wanted to influence what it looked like and hopefully use that to create momentum to solve the problem. And I still want us to solve the problem. But the argument that I make is why don\u2019t we start working on the things we agree on?\n\nAnd I \u2014 so people who resist that say, well, then you\u2019ll only do that stuff, and you\u2019ll never get to the legalization part. But my argument is if we start to do some of these things, I believe we can create the space, the confidence and the momentum to finish the job. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll take one year or two years. I can tell you this issue\u2019s been out there now for 12 years. And I can tell you this all-or-nothing approach has not worked for 12 years. Now, we can continue the all-or-nothing attitude towards this, but I think you\u2019re going to wind up with nothing.\n\nAnd the problem gets harder to solve every year that goes by. It truly does. These kids, when they first started debating this, the kids that were brought here as youngsters \u2014 they\u2019re not kids anymore. They\u2019ve grown up now. They\u2019ve started lives and families, perhaps gotten married. The human part of this gets harder to solve as well because of these factors. So these are all things that we need to take into consideration.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Senator Marco Rubio, thank you.\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican Sen.
