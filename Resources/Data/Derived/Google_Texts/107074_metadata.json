In the second article, you quoted firewood \u201csellers\u201d but failed to get information from firewood \u201cusers.\u201d\n\nAdvice from a person who burns a fire every cold morning and most cold evenings should be included. That\u2019s where I come in.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two kinds of fires people want: The first is a roaring fire that puts out heat. No wood beats mesquite for this purpose. The second is a real wood fire that does not use a lot of wood. One where a little (very local, very cheap) wood will last a long time. That kind comes from elm \u2014 the kind that grows in most back yards.\n\nElm, particularly \u201cgreen\u201d elm, rarely has a flame, it must be nurtured by a very slow gas flame, but glows a long time with slow burning coals. If you want to build a fire in the evening and have glowing coals the next morning, nothing beats elm.\n\nNeither mesquite nor elm will \u201cpop\u201d and create a spark danger, a claim that cannot be made for either pinion or oak.\n\nCARL ANDERSON/Lubbock", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Editorial / Letters", "og": {"url": "http://lubbockonline.com/editorial-letters/2014-11-29/letter-elm-and-mesquite-make-good-firewood", "site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "type": "article", "description": "You have recently run two articles concerning firewood.
