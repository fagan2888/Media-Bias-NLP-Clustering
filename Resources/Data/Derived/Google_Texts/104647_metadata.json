She did the latter. Several days later, they were in the emergency room, where Jaxon was treated for a fracture.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has reduced the number of uninsured Americans significantly, but many insured Americans are making difficult decisions \u2013 avoiding or postponing health care because of cost concerns. High deductibles certainly play a role, but so do static incomes that can\u2019t keep up with the rising cost of health care.\n\nAccording to an October 2014 Associated Press survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults, 1 in 8 privately insured adults under age 65 face \u201dmajor financial hardship\u201d due to medical bills. That\u2019s more than 16 million people who may think twice about seeing the doctor when they don\u2019t feel well or getting a costly procedure when their health is on the line.\n\nFor Ananda, an engineer consultant for a major telecommunications company, avoiding medical care or prioritizing by cost and necessity is the new normal.\n\n\u201cWe used to have more comprehensive coverage through my work\u2019s insurance, but now my deductible is $2,500,\u201d says the mother of three. \u201cBefore, we would almost overuse health care, going to the doctor for any ache or illness, but now it\u2019s a different story.\u201d\n\nWhen Costs Are High, Some Avoid Care\n\nNineteen percent of privately insured adults don\u2019t go to the doctor when they're sick, according to the AP survey, and higher cost-sharing responsibilities are largely to blame. This is true whether you get your health insurance through a broker, the ACA marketplace or state exchanges, or through your employer.\n\nDeductibles are both more common and higher than ever before. In 2003, only about half of employers offered health care plans with deductibles, and those deductibles averaged around $518. Ten years later, 81 percent of employer-based plans came with a deductible, and the average cost had risen 146 percent to $1,273, according to a trends analysis from The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that supports health care research. Similar rises were seen in nonemployer-based private health plans, and it\u2019s these deductibles that are often to blame for patient financial hardship.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was that people who were privately insured who had deductibles that were 5 percent or more of their income delayed or avoided getting needed health care at much higher rates than people whose deductibles were less than 5 percent of their income,\u201d says Sara Collins, vice president of health care coverage and access at The Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund analysis found that nearly one-third of privately insured adults whose deductibles were more than 5 percent of their income skipped a doctor-recommended medical test, treatment or follow-up because of cost.\n\nThese people are at the middle to low end of income distribution, Collins says. Some of them may be eligible for Medicaid but are receiving coverage through their employer instead. Many consider themselves within the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d as Ananda does.\n\nFor Jaxon, who plays six sports and is about to enter high school, a recommended foot surgery to correct a \u201cmild deformity\u201d has been placed on the back burner.\n\n\u201cI want to get it done before he enters high school, as it causes him pain and could ultimately affect his sports and potential college scholarships,\u201d Ananda says. \u201cBut budgeting for the deductible plus a 20 percent coinsurance isn\u2019t easy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Nearly a quarter of strokes occur in people younger than 65.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Nineteen percent of privately insured adults don\u2019t go to the doctor when they're sick, and higher cost-sharing responsibilities are largely to blame.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Elizabeth Renter", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Nineteen percent of privately insured adults don\u2019t go to the doctor when they're sick, and higher cost-sharing responsibilities are largely to blame.", "title": "How Can Insured Americans Lack Medical Care?", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2015/03/17/how-can-insured-americans-lack-medical-care", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/26/4e/1061eb1743078f6c3da0ccacae69/150317-medicalcosts-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nineteen percent of privately insured adults don\u2019t go to the doctor when they're sick, and higher cost-sharing responsibilities are largely to blame.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "How Can Insured Americans Lack Medical Care? - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-03-17", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/0f8187c/2147483647/crop/330x330%2B112%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F26%2F4e%2F1061eb1743078f6c3da0ccacae69%2Fresizes%2F500%2F150317-medicalcosts-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],health savings accounts,health insurance,Affordable Care Act,HealthInsurance-Bucket-LowCost [Consumer Advice],Elizabeth Renter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-03-17"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z7m5we", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ee6\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act has reduced the number of uninsured Americans significantly, but many insured Americans are making difficult decisions \u2013 avoiding or postponing health care because of cost concerns.\nAccording to an October 2014 Associated Press survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults, 1 in 8 privately insured adults under age 65 face \u201dmajor financial hardship\u201d due to medical bills.\nIn 2003, only about half of employers offered health care plans with deductibles, and those deductibles averaged around $518.\nHigh deductibles certainly play a role, but so do static incomes that can\u2019t keep up with the rising cost of health care.\nFor Ananda, an engineer consultant for a major telecommunications company, avoiding medical care or prioritizing by cost and necessity is the new normal."}
