Last month, Radio Disney went on tour with the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, treating elementary school students to an interactive program aimed at promoting the state’s rich reserves of shale gas. Organizers of the program, called “Rocking in Ohio,” called it a fun way to teach kids about science of gas and oil production. Others are calling it pure propaganda for the fracking industry.

Taking issue with Disney’s involvement in the controversial program, the Sierra Club put out a call on Twitter for its followers to rename the brand’s classic movies. And just like that, #DisneyFracked was born.

Most are just plays on the (admittedly funny) word — “Fracktasia,” “Fracktatouille,” etc. But others got more pointed in their political message. Check out some of the more clever contributions, below:
