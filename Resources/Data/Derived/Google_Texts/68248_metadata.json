Klain's job is slated to wrap up this week.\n\nObama secured more than $5.4 billion from Congress to fight the disease in West Africa and at home. Some of those funds are being used to support the development of Ebola vaccines and therapeutic drugs.\n\n\"This money will still be used as we do the hard work of trying to get to zero [Ebola cases] and continue to invest in domestic preparedness for this and other highly infectious diseases,\" an administration official said, speaking on background.\n\nThe government has worked to train U.S. hospital workers to detect and handle Ebola cases, and ramped up screening of people returning from countries where Ebola raged.\n\nAbout 7,700 people returning from Ebola-afflicted countries were screened at U.S. airports and were required to watch for symptoms and report to health authorities for 21 days.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reuters \u2013\u00a0President Barack Obama is set to announce on Wednesday that he will bring back nearly all of the 1,300 U.S. troops deployed in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic by April 30, the White House said late on Tuesday.", "author": "Emma Forrest", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Reuters \u2013\u00a0President Barack Obama is set to announce on Wednesday that he will bring back nearly all of the 1,300 U.S. troops deployed in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic by April 30, the White House said late on Tuesday.", "title": "Obama to withdraw troops from West Africa as Ebola epidemic eases", "url": "http://www.metro.us/news/obama-to-withdraw-troops-from-west-africa-as-ebola-epidemic-eases/zsJobk---yavl0XgtuSNPg/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$5snn4o8o4h3sgzamr5f0cx33g5sxjor/2015-02-10T191106Z_2_LYNXMPEB190VT_RTROPTP_4_UKRAINE-CRISIS-OBAMA.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Reuters \u2013\u00a0President Barack Obama is set to announce on Wednesday that he will bring back nearly all of the 1,300 U.S. troops deployed in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic by April 30, the White House said late on Tuesday.", "creator": "Emma Forrest", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$5snn4o8o4h3sgzamr5f0cx33g5sxjor/2015-02-10T191106Z_2_LYNXMPEB190VT_RTROPTP_4_UKRAINE-CRISIS-OBAMA.jpeg"}, "title": "Obama to withdraw troops from West Africa as Ebola epidemic eases", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Obama, to, withdraw, troops, from, West, Africa, as, Ebola, epidemic, eases", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2015-02-11", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,Barack Obama,President Barack Obama,Health,National ,News,topic:Ebola,Health workers,International", "section": "/news", "published_time": "2015-02-11T09:22:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-11T09:34:39Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama, to, withdraw, troops, from, West, Africa, as, Ebola, epidemic, eases"}, "article_summary": "Obama secured more than $5.4 billion from Congress to fight the disease in West Africa and at home.\nThe government has worked to train U.S. hospital workers to detect and handle Ebola cases, and ramped up screening of people returning from countries where Ebola raged.\nAt the height of the epidemic, about 2,800 military personnel were deployed to West Africa.\nAfter that incident, which happened during the U.S. midterm election campaign, Obama named former White House adviser Ron Klain to coordinate government activities.\nReuters \u2013 President Barack Obama is set to announce on Wednesday that he will bring back nearly all of the 1,300 U.S. troops deployed in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic by April 30, the White House said late on Tuesday."}
