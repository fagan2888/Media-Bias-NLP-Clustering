And Kate should be proud because her man did his thang!\n\nApparently we all shouldn't be so shocked about that because Swifty pointed out he's quite the regular, fun-loving guy once you get past the crown. She commented:\n\n\"[He] was really funny. So cool.\"\n\nBut it sounds like Wills almost got upstaged by the palace itself because it had Taylor under its spell as she added:\n\n\"It's positively magical here. There are fairy lights and there is fake snow falling from the sky and everything is just gorgeous. I am just very lucky to be here.\"\n\nAnd we're just lucky someone caught the trio on video! Ch-ch-check it out (below)!\n\nP.S.
