Across the country, businesses in tight-knit communities are attempting to cope with a barrage of taxes and regulations that sometimes do more harm than good.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nRestaurant owner Scott Wise in Muncie, Ind. says he makes four cents on every dollar and with new regulations as well as the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that profit margin could get even smaller.\n\n\n\nWise, 40, opened Scotty\u2019s Brewhouse in 1996, when he was 22 years old. Today, he is getting ready to open his twelfth restaurant in Indiana.\n\nWise says his restaurants operate under the same four-cent profit margin that is the industry\u2019s average. Whenever new regulations are put into place such as the new healthcare law, it hurts the bottom line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the rich are getting richer, it\u2019s just a small thin margin for restaurants,\u201d Wise said.\n\nWise oversees a total of 1,000 employees and says the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate has impacted him indirectly. The mandate that requires companies with 50 employees or more to provide health coverage is set to kick in Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere was a guy who wanted to open a Scotty\u2019s with me, and he decided against it simply because it was going to put him over the 50 employee threshold and he would have to take care of health insurance. That\u2019s kind of a bummer,\u201d Wise said.\n\nBut Wise won\u2019t let new regulations discourage his entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\u201cAs an entrepreneur and small business owner you want the government out of your business as much as you can, Wise said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have to deal with and I\u2019m not going to complain about it.\u201d\n\nFor other restaurants in the heartland, the impact of our national government\u2019s regulations usually depends on one thing: size.\n\nVera Mae\u2019s Bistro is an upscale restaurant located just a couple miles away from Scotty\u2019s in downtown Muncie. Owners Kent Shuff and Steve Fennimore opened Vera Mae\u2019s fifteen years ago and maintain a staff of 18 full-time employees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an administration, either way, has had a significant positive or negative impact on me,\u201d Shuff said. \u201cLocal policy will always have a larger impact.\u201d\n\nShuff and Fennimore are comfortable with the current space that they are in and unlike Scott Wise, are not looking to expand. The new healthcare law has had \u201cvirtually no impact\u201d on Vera Mae\u2019s according to Shuff.\n\nFor Wise, the sheer uncertainty surrounding the new healthcare law is what has business owners concerned. The recent elections, which now pit a Republican-controlled Congress against President Obama, also cause uneasiness.\n\n\u201cTime will tell, in 2015 and when this law goes into effect, I think you\u2019re going see some places not make it because this is a whole new extent that they\u2019re not prepared for,\u201d Wise said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just the costs of the healthcare, there\u2019s even an administration cost where you have to have another person in your office administrate the whole piece.\u201d\n\nVera Mae\u2019s likely won\u2019t be one of those places that Wise is talking about. Kent Shuff says they have continued to be a go-to place for locals and visitors alike, and business has been good.\n\n\u201cIn the last 5 years, we\u2019ve experienced a 5% growth each year. Considering what some businesses have gone through each year, I will take that,\u201d Shuff said.\n\nAs small businesses continue to adjust to the new healthcare law requirements, among all the uncertainty Wise is still confident about one thing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the government to tell me how to run my business, I can do it myself,\u201d he said.\n\nWise does recognize the importance of adapting and progressing no matter what obstacles are thrown his way.\n\n\u201cIf it means that I\u2019m going to provide healthcare to employees and they\u2019re going to be happier and like their job more because I\u2019m doing that, at the end of the day, I\u2019m still a winner out of it,\u201d he said.\n\nEach business has its own share of hurdles and setbacks, but as the government expands its reach into the healthcare industry, small business owners like Wise will have to continue to find ways to keep their employees, and their slim profit margins, happy.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day I still have 1,000 employees to take care of and it\u2019s my job to figure it out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/Small Business",
