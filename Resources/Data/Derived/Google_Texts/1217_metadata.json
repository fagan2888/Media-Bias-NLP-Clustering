If the commitment to take in 800,000 migrants was meant to bring skeptical countries inline to share the burden, that hope has failed for now.\n\nOn Monday, Austria, Slovakia, and the Netherlands introduced similar border controls, temporarily doing away with a European convention that promises passport-free travel between member nations.\n\n\u201cMerkel\u2019s generous offer has prompted a great deal of nervousness,\u201d Gardiner said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cYou are seeing a sea change in Europe\u2014a rethinking of a deeply held belief of open borders.\u201d\n\n>>>Crisis Pressures US to Provide Haven For More Syrian Refugees\n\nIn an emergency meeting of the European Union on Monday, ministers did not explicitly endorse a plan offered last week by Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, ordering mandatory quotas for member nations to facilitate the resettlement of 120,000 refugees. According to The New York Times, interior ministers from across Europe agreed to take in this number but could not decide on how the refugees would be divided up.\n\nThe Times said that ministers did agree to share 40,000 migrants currently being sheltered in Greece and Italy, but only to distribute them voluntarily.\n\nThe fractured response has exposed divisions within the European Union that have grown since its founding in 1993.\n\nExperts say the lack of European consensus has been amplified by a brew of related concerns among members, including uneven recovery from the economic crisis, a rise of far-right political movements that have drummed up nationalism, and resistance to religious and racial diversity that have countries searching for an identity.\n\n\u201cHow does Europe respond to a crisis of people coming from different backgrounds?\u201d said Sebastian Mallaby, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nMallaby, speaking on a conference call with reporters Monday, continued: \u201cMigration has created a lot of conflict in Europe. Assimilation of non-Europeans has been less successful than it has been with the U.S.\u201d\n\nStewart M. Patrick, Mallaby\u2019s colleague and the director of the Council\u2019s International and Global Governance Program, added: \u201cYou are dealing with countries that have very little experience in handling migration, especially outside Europe.\u201d\n\nPoland, for example, is 98 percent white and 94 percent Catholic.\n\nResistant countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia face challenges at home that make them reluctant to help others.\n\nThe economic recovery is inconsistent across Europe. Official unemployment rates range from 4.7 percent in Germany to 25.6 percent in Greece.\n\nBut few migrants want to make a home in Eastern Europe, preferring Western countries with more generous welfare systems such as Germany and Sweden.\n\n\u201cThey are moving to where they are likely to be accepted and where they feel they will be taken care of the best,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\n\u201cBut undoubtedly, the influx of refugees will place a big burden on European welfare states. Europe is barely able to sustain its current welfare states. It is unsustainable with aging populations and huge, unfunded pension liabilities across Europe.\u201d\n\nOthers argue that the fears of welfare abuse are misguided.\n\n\u201cOne of the fascinating things about this crisis is that many of the refugees have smart phones, which is an indication that they have access to technology and relatives in these countries,\u201d Patrick said.\n\n\u201cThis suggests they are freed to not be wards of the state as dramatically as opponents are imagining.\u201d\n\nThese experts say Germany is smart in its motivation to welcome migrants. Though it is undoubtedly acting in good faith, observers claim that Germany is eager to replenish an older population with willing workers.\n\n\u201cThe literature consensus is that this is a good thing for economic growth,\u201d Mallaby said. \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent thing to have inward immigration. Particularly in Europe, where you have an older population that needs young workers to pay taxes and fund retirees.\u201d\n\nThe experts say Europe\u2019s choices on how to handle the refugee crisis could define its future.\n\n\u201cThere are 7 million internally displaced Syrians,\u201d Mallaby said. \u201cSo you can expect the flood of humanity is not going away. It\u2019s early to call the outcome. Maybe they realize if they don\u2019t respond to the challenge, the alternative is total mayhem.\u201d\n\nThough time remains for the response to change, Gardiner insists he has seen enough to speculate on the European Union\u2019s destiny.\n\n\u201cThe days when Germany can dictate what happens in the EU [are] long gone,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cThis crisis will exacerbate the breakup of the EU.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The refugee crisis is underscoring the shakiness of a union coming off recent battles over the euro and Greece's financial crisis.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The refugee crisis is underscoring the shakiness of a union coming off recent battles over the euro and Greece's financial crisis.", "title": "Refugee Crisis Has European Union Grappling With Its Destiny", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/EuropeRefugee.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T21:20:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VYtBWJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The refugee crisis is underscoring the shakiness of a union coming off recent battles over the euro and Greece's financial crisis.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/EuropeRefugee.jpg"}, "title": "Refugee Crisis Has European Union Grappling With Its Destiny", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-09-14T20:43:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T21:20:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "refugee crisis, migrant crisis, Europe, EU, Middle East, Syria, Germany, Angela Merkel, Hungary, border control, Austria"}, "article_summary": "The fractured response has exposed divisions within the European Union that have grown since its founding in 1993.\n\u201cBut undoubtedly, the influx of refugees will place a big burden on European welfare states.\nOn Monday, Austria, Slovakia, and the Netherlands introduced similar border controls, temporarily doing away with a European convention that promises passport-free travel between member nations.\nWith that pledge, German Chancellor Angela Merkel hoped to inspire the European Union\u2019s 27 other member nations to come together and accept more migrants, allocating refugees among themselves.\n\u201cMerkel\u2019s generous offer has prompted a great deal of nervousness,\u201d Gardiner said in an interview with The Daily Signal."}
