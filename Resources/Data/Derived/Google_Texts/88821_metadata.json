However, numbers started creeping up again in the 1990s, due to weak enforcement and mining companies exploiting loopholes.\n\nNow the disease is back at 1970s levels and affects not only the miners who go underground, but surface miners as well, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBlack lung disease is caused by inhaling coal dust which scars lung tissue.\n\nNew regulations went into effect last month that would reduce the amount of exposure miners have to dust and close previous loopholes.\n\nHere & Now\u2019s Jeremy Hobson speaks with Dr. Robert Cohen, a black lung disease expert and Gary Hairston, a retired miner from Beckley, WV, who was diagnosed with black lung disease.\n\nInterview Highlights: Robert Cohen & Gary Hairston\n\nCohen on why incidences of black lung disease are going up\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of theories about this, but the bottom line is that coal miners are being overexposed, and these are miners that are working \u2014 and had been working \u2014 under what we considered modern dust controls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that as the methodology for cleaning coal from rock has been improved, that the mines are taking a lot of rock with the coal, and overexposing the miners to a lot of silica dust. We are also mining seams that are narrower, therefore we are taking a lot of rock that is above and below the seams.\n\n\u201cMiners are working long, long shifts, so have less time to really get their lungs cleaned out between shifts. They\u2019re working a lot of overtime, that certainly could be part of it. And clearly, people are not paying attention to the levels of dust they are exposing miners to in these mines.\u201d\n\nHairston on the effect of black lung disease\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do the things I love to do, like even watching my grandson play basketball. I like to be out there playing with him, and I know I can\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cEven cutting the grass, I got to do it in intervals or just pace myself. Where I used to do it in an hour, now it takes me three or four hours.\u201d\n\nHairston on safety lapses in the mines\n\n\u201cOne of the mines I worked at, we didn\u2019t hang no [ventilation] curtain. Like I said, we pretty much run in dust, pretty much the whole shift. Like I said, working ten to 12 hours a shift.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when they had the dust meters, we either turned them off or covered the hole up, so that you really couldn\u2019t get the right reading. We didn\u2019t know what it was doing to us. We thought it was helping the company, and running the coal for them.\u201d\n\nCohen on keeping miners safe\n\nThere is no doubt that the technology exists to control the dust in the mines and to engineer it to safe levels in the atmosphere. Gary was talking about the ventilation curtains, which create a little tunnel to suck the dust and keep it out of the air, and there\u2019s water suppression sprays that knock the dust down out of the air.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but it does take investment, and it does take commitment on the part of the industry to do it. And I think that what Gary is describing is a situation in the mine that he worked in where the operators were carrying out activities to defeat the surveillance that is mandated by the Mine Safety Health Administration and providing fraudulent data.\u201d\n\nGuests", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most severe kind of black lung almost disappeared from Appalachia after regulations went into effect.
