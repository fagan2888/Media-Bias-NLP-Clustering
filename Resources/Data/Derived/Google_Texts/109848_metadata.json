With Denver clinging to a one-point lead, Manning hit Hakeem Nicks for 34-yard strike, then benefited from a Broncos penalty to put the Giants at the 28-yard line with 16 seconds left.\n\nThe team\u2019s MVP to that point \u2014 kicker Josh Brown \u2014 was well within range to give New York a halftime lead. But Eli forced a ball into the corner of the end zone, where Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie chased it down for the first of Manning\u2019s interceptions.\n\nNo poise, no points.\n\nLater, two more interceptions came with Manning desperate to force something deep.\n\nIt\u2019s not all Manning\u2019s fault. The Giants\u2019 anemic rushing game mustered only 23 yards and averaged 1.2 yards per carry, and Brandon Jacobs\u2019 rushing touchdown came only after Denver defensive tackle Terrance Knighton taunted the Giants inside the 5-yard line, giving them a fresh set of downs.\n\nBut Manning\u2019s calling card throughout his career has been his ability to recover from early inconsistency in the second half. His best chance \u2014 the team\u2019s best chance \u2014 to keep up with Denver came in the fourth quarter with the Broncos up 13. On second down, Manning sailed a ball over Victor Cruz\u2019s head out of bounds. The next play, he missed a wide-open Hakeem Nicks on a pass that would have extended the drive.\n\nReally, Manning\u2019s only highlights were a 51-yard bomb to Cruz on the Giants\u2019 first play from scrimmage and a touchdown to backup running back Da\u2019Rel Scott that came after Broncos returner Trindon Holliday had sent Giants fans heading for the exits after an 81-yard punt return touchdown.\n\nPeyton Manning\u2019s greatness was undeniable Sunday, as the future first-ballot Hall of Famer became the fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 60,000 passing yards.\n\nIt\u2019s Peyton who leads the league with nine passing touchdowns. Eli leads the league with seven interceptions and remains winless against his kin.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eli Manning falls to brother Petyon as Broncos defense nabs four INTs", "title": "Eli Manning falls to brother Petyon as Broncos defense nabs four INTs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/eli-manning-falls-to-brother-petyon-as-broncos-defense-nabs-four-ints/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__eli-manning-wesley-woodyard-broncos-giants-091513p1.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__eli-manning-wesley-woodyard-broncos-giants-091513p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-15T19:47:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:51:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd280c\"", "article_summary": "But Eli forced a ball into the corner of the end zone, where Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie chased it down for the first of Manning\u2019s interceptions.\nLater, two more interceptions came with Manning desperate to force something deep.\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 For the second consecutive week, with the weight of a game on his shoulders, Eli Manning sagged.\nPeyton Manning\u2019s greatness was undeniable Sunday, as the future first-ballot Hall of Famer became the fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 60,000 passing yards.\nHis best chance \u2014 the team\u2019s best chance \u2014 to keep up with Denver came in the fourth quarter with the Broncos up 13."}
