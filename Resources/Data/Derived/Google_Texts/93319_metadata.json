Now, \u201cwe help the physician track it in real time on their smartphones.\u201dThe health IT incubator movement (some business development cognoscenti call them accelerators) got its start in 2011. The catalytic events were the 2009 passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act with its $22.5 billion in health IT incentive money for adopting electronic health records and the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with its push toward payment models that reward care coordination and accountable care.The incubators provide the new companies with seed capital up to $100,000, office space, mentoring by experienced health IT entrepreneurs, legal and other business services. Their managers also provide introductions to potential healthcare industry customers and angel investors. In return, the incubator operator receives an ownership slice in the startup, with 6% to 7% being typical.The startups being nurtured by the incubators are chasing a growing pot of venture capital money looking to cash in on the health IT boom, according to Healthcare Growth Partners, an Elmhurst, Ill.-based investment bank focused on healthcare IT. Healthcare IT firms raised $2.7 billion last year in 267 private equity and venture capital transactions, both records, according to HGP.Incubators are \u201cserving a great need,\u201d HGP Managing Director Christopher McCord said. \u201cIt's very hard to fund companies, prerevenue. Statistically, a lot of those are going to fail, but it's better to fail small than fail big, and that's how they're set up. They're going to have some big wins and those are going to offset the small losses.\u201dPerhaps. The jury is still out on whether the incubators will be able to generate a steady stream of successful startups. \u201cI'd like to see a product working in a hospital, in a live environment, and then I might be interested in putting some money into it,\u201d said Todd Cozzens, a venture partner and senior adviser at Menlo Park, Calif.-based Sequoia Capital.Not-for-profit incubator RockHealth launched in 2011 in San Francisco as one of the pioneers in the field and recently published its first annual report. It claims 55 active companies in its portfolio with 436 jobs. Those firms have raised more than $100 million in follow-on funding from investors, including some that have graduated to their own digs in nearby Silicon Valley.\n\nOne of them is drchrono, a Mountain View, Calif., developer of a mobile EHR for the iPad. The firm graduated from RockHealth. \u201cWe found a large number of investors and a large amount of developers in a small amount of time,\u201d said Daniel Kivatinos, the chief operating officer of the firm.Dr. David Brailer, founder and CEO of the San Francisco-based healthcare investment firm Evolution Partners, is clear-eyed in that he assumes most of the incubator graduates \u201cwill disappear.\u201d But, for healthcare leaders, Brailer said, \u201cThis is learning. It's experimentation.\u201d It's the kind of thing you'd want, \u201cto have 100 experiments going on,\u201d if you're a healthcare organization CEO, and, \u201cif you want to learn.\u201dOf course, that's not the view from the startup workbench. Peace, 46, in Chicago already has a few paying customers after being part of several startups. This is \u201cthe first one that I've been bootstrapping,\u201d she said.The incubator's \u201cstrategic partners\u201d attracted Peace to HealthBox. They include St. Louis-based Ascension Health and Chicago affiliate Alexian Brothers Health System; the Community Health Network of Indianapolis and the Ridgeview Medical Center of Waconia, Minn., near Minneapolis. \u201cFor me, it's all about growth,\u201d Peace said.In addition to making contact with potential customers, Peace said a surprising benefit she's received from the incubator has been the close connections she's made with her incubator colleagues. \u201cIt's very lonely when you're out there on your own as a CEO,\u201d Peace said. \u201cThere's nobody to talk to about what you're going through.\u201dAt the incubator, \u201cwe work at a table in a loft. I'm running my business three feet away\u201d from the next startup. \u201cWe're able to learn from each other. If I ever go back into the hospital world, I'd have all the executives do the same thing.\u201dSince its founding in Chicago in January 2012, HealthBox has run similar programs in Boston, Nashville; Jacksonville, Fla.; and London. \u201cPart of the reason why we do this is we feel that healthcare innovation happens across the country and across the globe,\u201d HealthBox founder and CEO Nina Nashif said. \u201cHealthcare organizations are everywhere. Clients (that is, tech entrepreneurs) are everywhere.\u201dBut IT venture capital funding is concentrated in Silicon Valley and Boston. That allows incubators to serve the function of bringing a city's most promising startups into a one-stop shop where they can be showcased for investors. Strategic investors \u201cdon't want to miss the next opportunity,\u201d Nashif said. \u201cThe incubators are able to find the chosen few with promising ideas and businesses.\u201dSome of the firms, such as Peace's Ludi, already have customers and sales. Others are little more than an idea. Either way, no one is asked for a credit check. HealthBox selectors focus on only a few questions: \u201cIs there a market need for this (and) how much do we believe in the founders?\u201d Nashif said.Different regions have different strategic partners and investors. In Chicago, supporters for HealthBox operations and its investment fund include Walgreen Co. , the retail drugstore giant; Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager; Blue Cross and Blue Shield Venture Partners, an investment fund of 22 Blues plans; Merge Healthcare , a health IT developer; and SandBox Industries, a tech incubator working outside the healthcare industry. There are also several venture capital firms involved.At the end of the entrepreneurs' training period comes \u201cdemo day,\u201d when they get up in front of a roomful of potential investors and pitch their wares in five-minute spiels. \u201cI go to all the demo days,\u201d said Missy Krasner, a Mountain View, Calif.-based adviser at Mergenthaler Ventures who canvasses health IT incubators for investment opportunities. With more than a dozen incubators now in operation, \u201cthe independent accelerator is at its tipping point.\u201dFollow Joseph Conn on Twitter: @MHJConn", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "title": "Health IT incubators help boost startups", "og": {"url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140201/MAGAZINE/302019963", "site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140201/MAGAZINE/302019963/AR/0/Ludi's-DocTimeLog.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article", "title": "Health IT incubators help boost startups"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "title": "Health IT incubators help boost startups", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140201/MAGAZINE/302019963/AR/0/Ludi's-DocTimeLog.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140201/MAGAZINE/302019963", "published_at": "2014-02-01", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140201/MAGAZINE/302019963/AR/0/Ludi's-DocTimeLog.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb36c\"", "article_summary": "This is \u201cthe first one that I've been bootstrapping,\u201d she said.The incubator's \u201cstrategic partners\u201d attracted Peace to HealthBox.\n\u201cI go to all the demo days,\u201d said Missy Krasner, a Mountain View, Calif.-based adviser at Mergenthaler Ventures who canvasses health IT incubators for investment opportunities.\nTheir managers also provide introductions to potential healthcare industry customers and angel investors.\nThe jury is still out on whether the incubators will be able to generate a steady stream of successful startups.\nDavid Brailer, founder and CEO of the San Francisco-based healthcare investment firm Evolution Partners, is clear-eyed in that he assumes most of the incubator graduates \u201cwill disappear.\u201d But, for healthcare leaders, Brailer said, \u201cThis is learning."}
