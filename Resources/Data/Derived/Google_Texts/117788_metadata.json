Asai and a team of CGI experts, makeup artists, and graphic designers have used a 3D mesh they developed as well as laser scans of a model\u2019s face to create endless possibilities. Their state of the art technological development has earned the nickname \u201cliving makeup.\u201d\n\nDots that appear on the model\u2019s face are used to transform her face into robotic-like features, different makeup patterns, and even bubbling water via motion tracking. Asai has used a similar projection mapping system on cars, the stage, and buildings before. However, this is the first time his face tracking technology has been demonstrated on a human model. The digital makeup/illustrations stay consistent on the model\u2019s face, even as she moves left, right, up, and down.\n\nThe Omote team is unclear as to what their projection mapping system\u2019s real world applications will be. As of now they say it will not be available for general use and will only serve for a tech demo. Thanks to Asai\u2019s background in theater (Omote\u2019s inspiration came from Noh masks which are often featured in Japanese theater), the days of green screen and CGI in film could be numbered.
