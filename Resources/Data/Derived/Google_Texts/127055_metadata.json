Having a baby? Need a primary-care doctor? Shopping for an MRI scan?\n\nGuroo.org shows the average local cost for 70 common diagnoses and medical tests in most states. That\u2019s the real cost \u2014 not \u201ccharges\u201d that often get marked down \u2014 based on a giant database of what insurance companies actually pay.\n\nOK, this isn\u2019t like Priceline.com for knee replacements. What Guroo hopes to do for consumers is limited so far.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nIt won\u2019t reflect costs for particular hospitals or doctors, although officials say that\u2019s coming for some. And it doesn\u2019t have much to say initially about the quality of care.\n\nStill, Guroo should shed new light on the country\u2019s opaque, complex and maddening medical bazaar, say consumer advocates.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential to be a game-changer,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead, who analyzes health insurance for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s good for uninsured people. It\u2019s good for people with high deductibles. It\u2019s good for any person that\u2019s kind of wondering: If I go to see the doctor for such-and-such, what might happen next?\u201d\n\nGuroo is produced by the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI) working with three big insurance companies: UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana, soon to be joined by a fourth, Assurant. The idea is to eventually let members of these plans use a companion site to see how differing provider prices affect their co-payments.\n\n[Also: Which states earned the most Medicare bonuses?]\n\nA nonprofit known for its cost and utilization reports, HCCI receives some industry funding but is governed by an independent board. This is its first tool for consumers.\n\nConsumer advocates praised Guroo but cautioned that the movement toward \u201ctransparency\u201d in medical prices is still in its very early stages. Data on insurer, employer or government Web sites are often limited or inaccurate. Consumer information from Fair Health, which manages another huge commercial insurance database, is organized by procedure code.\n\nEven on Guroo.org, \u201cthe average user may not have a good sense of what they\u2019re looking at and what they\u2019re supposed to do with the resulting price,\u201d said Lynn Quincy, a health care specialist at Consumers Union.\n\nHCCI says its prices are what insurers pay for about 70 tests and \u201cbundles\u201d of services described in understandable terms so patients don\u2019t need a medical textbook to figure out what they are. Users get the average as well as a range for local and national prices.\n\nIt plans to add more procedures later \u2014 all for \u201cshoppable\u201d services that can be scheduled, not emergency treatment of a heart attack.\n\n\u201cThis at least arms consumers with information about the range of prices in their community [for] one of these care bundles,\u201d said David Newman, HCCI\u2019s executive director.\n\nIf you have a high deductible, for example, you might use Guroo.org as a starting point for checking prices from medical providers if your insurance company doesn\u2019t provide such a tool.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as seeing provider-specific prices online, of course. But within a year, HCCI expects to let members of UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Assurant and Humana track spending on a companion site and check how switching caregivers could lower their out-of-pocket costs.\n\nInitially Guroo.org doesn\u2019t have much information about quality of care, either, which is essential to help patients to make smart choices. Newman says that is coming, too. It\u2019s also missing information for Alabama, Michigan and several other states.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina set a high standard for disclosure recently by posting prices \u2014 doctor by doctor and hospital by hospital \u2014 based on its reimbursement rates, Quincy said. Guroo doesn\u2019t do that.\n\nStill, she said, it\u2019s an important step.\n\nGiven its size, influence and openness, Guroo could become a dominant portal for health care prices, said Hempstead.\n\n\u201cTheir stance as a neutral broker and the amount of data that they have and the amount of data that they\u2019re going to have really puts them in a difference place,\u201d she said.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service. It is an editorially independent program of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/guroo-latest-tool-healthcare-price-transparency-launches", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Guroo-screen-shot-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Within a year, HCCI expects to let members of UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Assurant and Humana track spending on a companion site and check how switching caregivers could lower their out-of-pocket costs.", "title": "Guroo, latest tool for healthcare price transparency, launches"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Guroo-screen-shot-feature.gif"}, "description": "Within a year, HCCI expects to let members of UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Assurant and Humana track spending on a companion site and check how switching caregivers could lower their out-of-pocket costs.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Guroo, latest tool for healthcare price transparency, launches"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Buying health care in America is like shopping blindfolded at Macy\u2019s and getting the bill months after you leave the store, economist Uwe Reinhardt likes to say.&#13; A tool that went online Wednesday is supposed to give patients a small peek at the products and prices before they open their wallets.&#13; Got a sore knee?
