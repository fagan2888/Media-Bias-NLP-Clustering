And many of the [immigrants] don\u2019t know any other place . . . so where are you going to send them back to in that situation?\u201d\n\nCarson, who is running second only to Trump in the latest NBC/ORC national poll of Republicans, hedged a bit in his criticism of the real estate magnate. He said he agreed with Trump that the courts should disregard the 14th Amendment and revoke birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants who are born in this country \u2014 an idea that some legal scholars believe borders on lunacy.\n\nBut then Carson seemingly went around the bend on Wednesday by suggesting during a helicopter tour of the Arizona desert bordering on Mexico that the military be ordered to launch drone air strikes on U.S. soil against drug cartel smugglers and lookouts. If Carson had his way, the U.S. military not only would be launching drone strikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq but would be wiping out emplacements for Mexican drug smugglers and other nefarious characters on American soil.\n\nRelated: 10 Things You Need to Know About Ben Carson\n\nIn a conversation with Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu about the challenges of weeding out the drug smugglers, Carson said, \u201cIf that requires getting rid of some of their hideouts, I\u2019ll get rid of some of their hideouts,\u201d according to a report by ABC15 news in Arizona.\n\nAlthough the sheriff had made it clear he considered the idea of drone strikes in his jurisdiction a bad one, Carson persisted in an interview with an ABC15 news team: \u201cWell here\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t seem to understand this. I suggest we use all the things that are available to us, but we use the military expertise.\u201d\n\nThis apparently wasn\u2019t the first time Carson raised the subject of using drone technology to help secure and safeguard the southern border with Mexico, according to media reports. Nor was it the first time he\u2019s startled some people with views he has shared during his steady climb in the polls \u2014 he has also said that homosexuality is a \u201cchoice,\u201d that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery and that it is \u201ccondescending\u201d not to tax poor people.\n\nRelated: Carson and Fiorina: Two Ankle Biters Join the GOP Pack\n\nCarson, a native Detroiter and the only African-American in the race, boasts a compelling personal narrative and success story has generated considerable interest among Republicans with his free-market economic views and strong conservative views on abortion, gay rights and foreign policy. But by proposing the unprecedented use of military drones to seek out and destroy caves and other havens for drug smugglers and lookouts within the U.S. border, Carson is further fueling an anything-goes debate over immigration policy that began with Trump\u2019s attacks on illegal immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d and criminals.\n\nCarson\u2019s suggestion also comes at a time when U.S. regulators and authorities are struggling with a mushrooming of unmanned aerial vehicles that are posing mid-air threats to commercial airliners and hazards to public safety. A new study by the Brookings Institution has dubbed it the \u201cWild West of Regulatory Experimentation.\u201d And several states, including Nevada and Wisconsin, have approved legislation to block the weaponization of drones, according to the report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For a while this week, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson sounded like the v", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s Idea for Controlling the Border: Military Drone Attacks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/Ben-Carson-s-Idea-Controlling-Border-Military-Drone-Attacks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/Ben-Carson-s-Idea-Controlling-Border-Military-Drone-Attacks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For a while this week, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson sounded like the v", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While a few of the other GOP contenders aligned themselves with Donald Trump\u2019s startling immigration proposals to build a wall along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border and then round up and deport more than 11 million illegal immigrants, Carson said that was crazy.\n\u201cThey have no idea what they\u2019re talking about, how much that costs and how impractical that is.\nFor a while this week, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson sounded like the voice of reason.\nAlthough the sheriff had made it clear he considered the idea of drone strikes in his jurisdiction a bad one, Carson persisted in an interview with an ABC15 news team: \u201cWell here\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d he said.\nIf Carson had his way, the U.S. military not only would be launching drone strikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq but would be wiping out emplacements for Mexican drug smugglers and other nefarious characters on American soil."}
