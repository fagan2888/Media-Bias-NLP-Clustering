As Founding Editor John Iglehart describes in the issue: \u201cEmergency departments seem like orphans in the US health care system, with few strong allies among policy makers; as an afterthought in the Affordable Care Act\u2026long popularized by television dramas but less recognized for the expanding array of activities in which its practitioners are engaged.\u201d\n\nThis theme issue, titled \u201cThe Future of Emergency Medicine: Challenges & Opportunities,\u201d explores and explodes these myths. It received support from the Hospital Corporation of America; the American Hospital Association; the American College of Surgeons; the Emergency Medicine Action Fund, a consortium sponsored by the American College of Emergency Physicians; the American College of Emergency Physicians; the Jewish Healthcare Foundation; the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine; and MEP.\n\nSeveral articles in the issue will be discussed at a December 4 Health Affairs briefing in Washington, D.C.\n\nHow an emergency department resembles Grand Central Station. Arthur Kellermann, dean of medicine at the Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences, and coauthors provide an issue overview, succinctly tracing the history of emergency care since World War II and looking ahead to the emergency departments of the future. \u201cLike Grand Central, modern hospital emergency departments (EDs) are constantly in motion,\u201d writes Kellermann. \u201cAnd, like Grand Central, EDs have purposeful order beneath their superficial chaos.\u201d Kellermann sees today\u2019s emergency departments as centers for lifesaving care and resources for disaster as well as the \u201csafety net of the safety net\u201d for millions of low-income and uninsured patients. To succeed in the future, Kellermann says that emergency care must become more integrated, regionalized, prevention oriented, and innovative.\n\nDispelling the urban legend of emergency department \u2018frequent fliers.\u2019 The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) guarantees all Americans the right to emergency medical care. This mandatory role has led to a common misperception that emergency rooms are frequented by a small number of patients\u2014mentally ill substance abusers, whose frequent use of emergency departments are a costly drain on the health care system. However, John Billings of NYU Wagner and Maria Raven of the University of California, San Francisco, paint a different picture of these ED \u201cfrequent fliers.\u201d They analyzed over 200,000 Medicaid fee-for-service claims from New York City in 2007 and found that behavioral health conditions are only responsible for a small portion of these users, accounting for less than 8 percent of all ED visits. What they found was that frequent users are quite sick, often with multiple comorbidities. Through predictive modeling, the authors maintain, emergency departments can determine who the repeat users will be and can target interventions to reduce their unnecessary visits.\n\nWant to reduce health care costs? Increase emergency department observation units. Many patients seeking emergency department treatment fall into a gray zone: They\u2019re not well enough for immediate discharge but not sick enough to be admitted as a hospital patient. Michael Ross of Atlanta\u2019s Emory University and Grady Memorial Hospital and coauthors compared patients cared for in \u201ctype 1\u201d observation units\u2014dedicated observation units with defined treatment protocols\u2014using 2010 data from local, state, and national clinical settings. The authors found that observation patients in \u201ctype 1\u201d units have a 23\u201338 percent shorter length of stay, a 17\u201344 percent lower probability of subsequent inpatient admission, and $950 million in potential national costs savings each year. They also found that these units could avoid 11.7 percent of inpatient admissions, saving the United States $5.5\u20138.5 billion annually. This level of treatment, conclude the authors, gives emergency department physicians a better option to care for the increasing portion of patients who are not sick enough to warrant inpatient care.\n\n.\n\nIn a study on a related topic, Jesse Pines of the George Washington University and coauthors examine how providers and organizations can reduce acute care costs without sacrificing quality. Reducing demands for acute care, they suggest, may be achieved through public health measures and educational initiatives. It will also be necessary to change providers\u2019 behavior, through the development of care pathways and other tactics such as providing feedback. The authors maintain that fee-for-service payment with new incentives, based on as-yet-undeveloped resource and quality measures, is the only feasible approach to paying for acute care.\n\nAlso in the December issue:\n\nCreating Integrated Networks Of Emergency Care: From Vision To Value, Ricardo Martinez of North Highland Worldwide Consulting and Brendan Carr of the University of Pennsylvania and the Department of Health and Human Services\n\nCare for Specialized Populations:\n\n.\n\nA Promising Approach For Emergency Departments To Care For Patients With Substance Use And Behavioral Disorders, Steven Bernstein and Gail D\u2019Onofrio of Yale University\n\nEmergency Care For Children In The United States, James Chamberlain of the George Washington University and Children\u2019s National Medical Center and coauthors\n\nTransforming Emergency Care For Older Adults, Ula Hwang of Mount Sinai and coauthors\n\nSome Global Lessons:\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/12/03/new-health-affairs-issue-focuses-on-emergency-medicine/", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "title": "New Health Affairs Issue Focuses On Emergency Medicine"}, "description": "New Health Affairs Issue Focuses On Emergency Medicine | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeedf\"", "article_summary": "Chris FlemingDecember 3, 2013The December issue of Health Affairs, released today, examines the state of emergency care in the United States.\nSeveral articles in the issue will be discussed at a December 4 Health Affairs briefing in Washington, D.C.How an emergency department resembles Grand Central Station.\nDispelling the urban legend of emergency department \u2018frequent fliers.\u2019 The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) guarantees all Americans the right to emergency medical care.\n\u201cLike Grand Central, modern hospital emergency departments (EDs) are constantly in motion,\u201d writes Kellermann.\nTo succeed in the future, Kellermann says that emergency care must become more integrated, regionalized, prevention oriented, and innovative."}
