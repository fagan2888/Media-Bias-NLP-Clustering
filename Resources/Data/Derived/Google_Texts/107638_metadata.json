As part of our reboot I am teaching my kids about mindful eating.\n\nNothing too \u201cadult\u201d that will squander their attention or too \u201cout there\u201d that will trigger eye-rolling, but rather simple reminders to actually taste, chew and enjoy the food they are consuming.\n\nAccording to Pavel G. Somov\u2019s \u201cEating the Moment,\u201d we eat for three main reasons:\n\nPhysical hunger: a true need to sustain the body.\n\nPsychological hunger: \u201cthe need to be entertained, comforted, or distracted.\u201d\n\nHabit: both the concept that we eat at certain times regardless of hunger, and the response to \u201ccertain environmental stimuli\u201d such as TV commercials that trigger us to eat.\n\nWhen people eat too quickly and do not chew, or eat when they aren\u2019t truly hungry, their satiety markers are blocked and they overeat.\n\nWhat does mindful eating look like for children? It is the simple things:\n\n\u25a0 Take a moment before eating to say thanks for the food or to take a breath.\n\n\u25a0 Ask your children how hungry they are before a meal so they begin to develop an awareness of true hunger vs. habitual or emotional eating.\n\n\u25a0 Allow children to serve themselves so they learn to regulate their portions.\n\n\u25a0 Eat without distraction, which means not in front of the TV or computer, or in the car. If the mind is distracted during eating, critical signs signaling satiety might not reach the brain.\n\n\u25a0 Ask your children how their food tastes, reminding them to taste and enjoy it.\n\n\u25a0 Encourage your children to thoroughly chew their food, as chewing contributes to satiety, which can prevent overeating.\n\n\u25a0 Teach children to put their fork down between bites so they eat more slowly, allowing their bodies to feel full.\n\n\u25a0 Allow enough time to eat so the meal is not rushed.\n\n\u25a0 Children should eat with caring adults in a happy setting. Parents, try not to nag about vegetables, criticize your child for the amount of food they are eating or lecture about something negative during dinner.\n\nHow many times do we adults feel worse after overeating or consuming items that are not good for us? Let\u2019s help our kids learn that food influences how we feel.\n\n\u2013 Casey Seidenberg, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/hftips09.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe4f64\"", "article_summary": "\u25a0 Ask your children how hungry they are before a meal so they begin to develop an awareness of true hunger vs. habitual or emotional eating.\nAccording to Pavel G.
