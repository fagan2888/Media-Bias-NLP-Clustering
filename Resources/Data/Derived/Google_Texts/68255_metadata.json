Hostile? Unsafe? The real world is going to eat these kids alive a la Walking Dead-style, but that\u2019s for another time. The vice president of the University of Missouri Students Association said this to MSNBC\u2019s Thomas Roberts:\n\nWhen asked about complaints from professors that universities are becoming \u201cplaces of censor and prohibition,\u201d Smith-Lezama said people are using the First Amendment to create a \u201chostile and unsafe learning environment.\u201d \u201cI personally am tired of hearing that First Amendment rights protect students when they are creating a hostile and unsafe learning environment for myself and for other students here,\u201d Smith-Lezama said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s important for us to create that distinction and create a space where we can all learn from one another and start to create a place of healing rather than a place where we are experiencing a lot of hate like we have in the past.\u201d The Mizzou student said the altercations between her school\u2019s faculty members and student journalists could be heralded as a \u201cteachable moment\u201d \u2014 including for members of the media. She said that what the now-viral video of a Mizzou journalism professor yelling at a student journalist didn\u2019t show was other members of the media who she described as \u201cpushy\u201d and \u201caggressive.\u201d \u201cAs student journalists, you cannot approach these situations with hostility and anger as it only escalates the situation,\u201d Smith-Lezama told MSNBC.\n\nFirst, I\u2019m not buying that these delicate snowflakes truly know the definitions of \u201cpushy\u201d or \u201caggressive.\u201d For goodness sake, Yale students, who also happen to be the most privileged given their admittance to one of the best learning institutions in the world, suffered mini-strokes over an email suggesting that maybe we shouldn\u2019t get too crazy about Halloween costumes that some might consider offensive. The email from associate master of Silliman, Erika Christakis, wasn\u2019t written in a \u201cpushy\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d way, though the way the students reacted to her husband, Nicholas, the Master of Silliman, was immensely rude and outright nasty. Silliman College is one of the residential colleges at the university.\n\nSecond, what is this whole creation of distinctions business between safe spaces that produce \u201ca place of healing rather than a place where we are experience a lot of hate\u201d from those allegedly (for lack of a better term) using First Amendment rights to create an unsafe \u201ca hostile and unsafe learning environment?\u201d In other words, these kids don\u2019t want people having other views. They don\u2019t want debate. And they think debate is poisonous, as evidenced by the Yale meltdown where some students wanted to end debate on the email about Halloween costumes. Oh, and did I mention that students spit on attendees at the William F. Buckley conference on free speech last weekend? Yeah, please tell me who is creating the unsafe and wholly incorrigible learning environment? If you feel like a gun is being held to your head for fear of offending these people, it\u2019s not a learning environment. It\u2019s the Gulag Archipelago. It\u2019s a North Korean re-education camp, with the exception that there are no matching uniforms, prolonged physical torture, and summary executions.\n\nLet\u2019s call this what is is: segregation. As Katie wrote earlier, the black and white students were segregated into different safe space/healing zones last night. \u201cBlack only healing space\u201d apparently is the official term. How is that different from \u201cwhite only\u201d or any other sign showing institutionalized race-based segregation? What\u2019s so frightening is that liberals are successful because they, ironically, strategize through that prism. As Ben Shapiro has said often, liberals think institutionally, conservative think individually. As a result, they\u2019re better at organizing, pushing a narrative, and entrenching their agenda within the institutions they wish to mutilate.\n\nDividing black and white students is a \u201cteachable moment?\u201d Has it really come to this? The irony is that these social justice warriors are probably against segregation, but when they do it\u2013it\u2019s the creation of healing zones. It\u2019s the classic \u201cbut that\u2019s different\u201d interjection progressive use to explain the aspects of their contradictory and hypocritical agenda. If you believe in freedom of speech, expression and of the press, you\u2019re going to see opinions that you might not like, you will get offended, and how you deal with it is something of a lost litmus test of American citizenship.\n\nBlacks in the segregated South didn\u2019t like being segregated in public buildings, restaurants, or public transit. They didn\u2019t feel like the world was ending and create safe spaces to cope. They boycotted public transit, used the legal system, and got the laws changed. They sat at those whites only booths and were subjected to horrific abuse that would probably send these kids into mental institutions for decades. The point is Americans of all backgrounds have experienced some level of hurt, or offense, in their struggle to make this country better. I mean, to repent for our most egregious sin, slavery, we had to actually kill one another to get that done.\n\nBut we have to tread carefully about that subject too, or any moment in American history, because that might offend \u2026 you people.\n\nLast Note: Yes, diversity is important (I guess), but I've never been one that felt weird entering a room full of white people. Often times, I've been the only minority in those rooms. I've never felt micoraggressed since I was among my fellow Americans. Cheesy? Yes\u2013but skin color has never made much of difference regarding gauging my level of comfortability concerning going outdoors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is the progressive left dicing the First Amendment to usher in an era of neo-segregation?\r\n.05/26/2016 18:07:35PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Is the progressive left dicing the First Amendment to usher in an era of neo-segregation?", "title": "Mizzou Student: First Amendment Rights Create \u2018Hostile\u2019 And \u2018Unsafe\u2019 Learning Environments", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/11/12/mizzou-student-first-amendment-rights-creates-hostile-and-unsafe-learning-environments-n2079815", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/12/18.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Is the progressive left dicing the First Amendment to usher in an era of neo-segregation?", "title": "Mizzou Student: First Amendment Rights Create \u2018Hostile\u2019 And \u2018Unsafe\u2019 Learning Environments", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/11/12/mizzou-student-first-amendment-rights-creates-hostile-and-unsafe-learning-environments-n2079815", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/12/18.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Mizzou Student: First Amendment Rights Create \u2018Hostile\u2019 And \u2018Unsafe\u2019 Learning Environments , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Via The Blaze, this fiasco occurring at the University of Missouri has entered the next stage of evolution: First Amendment rights are hostile, unsafe, and totally torpedo a productive learning environment.\nIf you feel like a gun is being held to your head for fear of offending these people, it\u2019s not a learning environment.\nAs Katie wrote earlier, the black and white students were segregated into different safe space/healing zones last night.\nYeah, please tell me who is creating the unsafe and wholly incorrigible learning environment?\nDividing black and white students is a \u201cteachable moment?\u201d Has it really come to this?"}
