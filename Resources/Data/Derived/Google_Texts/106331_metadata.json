It\u2019s largely a group of political veterans who in some cases have ties to the former congressman that go back decades.\n\nHere are some things to know about Ohio\u2019s delegates:\n\nALL HIS\n\nOhio\u2019s simple winner-take-all rules for this year\u2019s primary cut out the disputes seen in some caucus states or states with delegates awarded proportionally. They were made-to-order for Kasich, who took 100 percent of the delegates by winning 47 percent of the statewide vote to send the delegate slate he filed in December to the convention.\n\nThey are all bound to Kasich through the first convention ballot.\n\nWHO THEY ARE\n\nThere are three statewide elected officeholders in Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, Attorney General Mike DeWine and Auditor Dave Yost, and George Voinovich, a former governor and U.S. senator, and three other former members of Congress counting DeWine. There are eight state legislators, led by state Senate President Keith Faber.\n\nState Republican Party chairman Matt Borges and more than two dozen GOP state central committee members and county party chairs are also among the delegates, including Chairman Rob Frost of the GOP of hosting Cuyahoga County.\n\nAmong other delegates are Michael Gonidakis, president of the Ohio Right to Life, and Jerry Hruby, mayor of Brecksville in the Cleveland area for nearly three decades.\n\nEXPERIENCED, LOYAL\n\nMany of the delegates know their way around a convention, probably none more so than former Ohio House speaker Jo Ann Davidson. She is co-chair of the committee on the arrangements that does much of the convention planning and management. Davidson, 88, chaired that committee in 2008. Businessman James Dicke of Auglaize County, like Davidson and Borges a Republican National Committee member, has been to five conventions as a delegate.\n\nDelegates include Kasich campaign manager Beth Hansen and lobbyists and longtime Kasich friends Robert Klaffky and Donald Thibaut, the latter a former Kasich congressional chief of staff.\n\n\u201cI will vote for John Kasich on the first ballot, and I will continue to vote for John Kasich,\u201d said Janet Weir Creighton, a Stark County commissioner going to her fifth GOP national convention. \u201cI\u2019m a loyalist.\u201d\n\nTHE PITCH, THE PLAN, THE PITFALLS\n\nThe pitch by Kasich and his supporters is that he has more experience, is less divisive and has shown strength against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls. Also, he\u2019s popular in his home state, historically crucial for Republicans.\n\nThe plan as outlined by Kasich backers is to make sure neither outspoken businessman Donald Trump nor maverick Texas Sen. Ted Cruz can put together the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination while Kasich\u2019s folks woo delegates who could be drawn to him because they fear Trump or Cruz would take the party down in November.\n\nHowever, Kasich hasn\u2019t gotten much bounce in other states from his only win, in his home state. He\u2019s still fourth in delegates even behind Marco Rubio and his suspended candidacy, and needs to do better elsewhere.\n\nKaren Beckwith, who chairs the political science department at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said some influential Republicans around the country have talked about a convention alternative to Trump and Cruz, with names such as House Speaker Paul Ryan being floated, even as Kasich is actively running.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bode well for Gov. Kasich,\u201d she said, adding that while Ohio is a key swing state, hosting the convention seems unlikely to play a major role in the decision on the nominee.\n\nNO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT\n\nConvention rules won\u2019t be set until July.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a contested Republican convention in 40 years.\n\nAbout the only thing for sure is there won\u2019t be the complaints about tightly scripted pep rallies that characterized other recent national conventions.\n\n\u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be like any convention I\u2019ve been to before,\u201d said Creighton. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow the reporter at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell\n\nFor some of his other recent stories: http://bigstory.ap.org/content/dan-sewell", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Republican delegates still think Cleveland can rock for their hosting state governor, who's counting on emerging in a contested national convention to overtake the front-runners for the presidential nomination this July.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ohio Republican delegates still think Cleveland can rock for their hosting state governor, who\u2019s counting on emerging in a contested national convention to overtake the front-runners for the presidential nomination this July.", "title": "Can Ohio delegation help Cleveland rock for Kasich?", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/16/can-ohio-delegation-help-cleveland-rock-for-kasich/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/10/gop_2016_kasich.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/10/gop_2016_kasich.jpeg", "description": "Ohio Republican delegates still think Cleveland can rock for their hosting state governor, who's counting on emerging in a contested national convention to overtake the front-runners for the president", "card": "summary", "title": "Can Ohio delegation help Cleveland rock for Kasich?"}, "Author": "DAN SEWELL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9389\"", "article_summary": "Businessman James Dicke of Auglaize County, like Davidson and Borges a Republican National Committee member, has been to five conventions as a delegate.\nCINCINNATI (AP) - Ohio Republican delegates still think Cleveland can rock for their hosting state governor, who\u2019s counting on emerging in a contested national convention to overtake the front-runners for the presidential nomination this July.\nDelegates include Kasich campaign manager Beth Hansen and lobbyists and longtime Kasich friends Robert Klaffky and Donald Thibaut, the latter a former Kasich congressional chief of staff.\nJohn Kasich has what he\u2019s called a \u201crock solid\u201d base of support among the 66 delegates.\nThere hasn\u2019t been a contested Republican convention in 40 years."}
