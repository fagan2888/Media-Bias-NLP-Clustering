Matt Ryan completed 30-of-41 for 361 yards with two scores. Matt Bryant set a career high with five field goals, though most of them weren\u2019t much longer than extra points.\n\nThe Falcons (5-7) dominated against a team that had given up fewer than 300 yards in each of its four previous games.\n\n\u201cThese are the type of games you\u2019ve got to win in November and December in order to play in January,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nArizona still leads the NFC West after its second straight loss, but now by only one game over defending Super Bowl champion Seattle. More troubling for the Cardinals, they had gone more than 11 quarters without an offensive touchdown until a meaningless late score.\n\nAsked about his team\u2019s struggles, coach Bruce Arias said, \u201cEach man has to look in the mirror and find that answer.\u201d\n\nSteven Jackson broke off a 55-yard run on the Falcons\u2019 opening possession to set up Ryan\u2019s 1-yard touchdown pass to Levine Toilolo on fourth-and-goal.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Julio Jones helps Atlanta pull off stunner over Arizona Cardinals", "title": "Julio Jones helps Atlanta pull off stunner over Arizona Cardinals", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/30/julio-jones-helps-atlanta-pull-off-stunner-over-arizona-cardinals/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141130__20141201_B6_SP01FBNFALCONSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141130__20141201_B6_SP01FBNFALCONSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-30T20:37:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:06:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ATLANTA \u2014 Fighting for a division title even with a losing record, the Atlanta Falcons knew they couldn\u2019t afford another defeat.\nLed by Julio Jones, the Falcons came up with the matching victory Sunday to stay tied for first in the anemic NFC South.\nMore troubling for the Cardinals, they had gone more than 11 quarters without an offensive touchdown until a meaningless late score.\n\u201cThese are the type of games you\u2019ve got to win in November and December in order to play in January,\u201d Ryan said.\nMatt Bryant set a career high with five field goals, though most of them weren\u2019t much longer than extra points."}
