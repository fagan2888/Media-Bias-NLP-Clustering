No backup instrumentalists, no prerecorded tracks or backing vocals \u2014 just three fellows from Toronto fashioning rock \u2018n\u2019 roll symphonics unequalled anywhere in musicdom.\n\nBassist/vocalist/keyboardist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart are touring the U.S. and Canada to commemorate their ruby anniversary, with a sold-out stop Saturday at Newark, New Jersey\u2019s Prudential Center. The trio performed a three-hour show with but a halftime break. Each half had a \u201ctheme,\u201d with the first being \u201cThe World Is\u2026The World Is\u201d and the second \u201cNo Country for Old Hens,\u201d each offset by humorous videos the band made in various costumed attire \u2014 replete with character-breaking outtakes.\n\n\u201cThe World Is\u2026The World Is\u201d kicked off with \u201cThe Anarchist\u201d from the band\u2019s most recent album, 2012\u2019s \u201cClockwork Angels.\u201d Like much of their greater compositions, \u201cThe Anarchist\u201d commences with a bombastic instrumental intro and thematic vamping before Mr. Lee comes in with his trademark high-tenor vocals at the minute-and-a-half mark.\n\nFor a band with such a bevy of recognizable hits, Rush largely strayed deeper into the catalog for the Newark show, even busting out super-rarity \u201cBetween the Wheels,\u201d which Mr. Lee informed the fanatic crowd had only been played publicly one other time.\n\nIn a humorous turn, during \u201cRoll the Bones,\u201d celebs Peter Dinklage from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello and actors Paul Rudd and Jason Segel lip-synced in prerecorded video played behind the band. In fact, Mr. Rudd and Mr. Segel co-starred in the 2009 bromance comedy \u201cI Love You, Man\u201d as two rabid Rush fans, and in which the band itself provided a concert cameo.\n\nIn a surprise move, Mr. Lee brought to the stage violinist Jonathan Dinklage, brother of Peter, for the elegiac \u201cLosing It.\u201d Mr. Dinklage\u2019s mournful strains echoed across Prudential\u2019s walls as a rare guest artist for the trio.\n\nThe first half closed out with the hit \u201cSubdivisions,\u201d as Mr. Lee simultaneously played keys and bass while crooning of the rural ennui of malls, conformity and prefabricated houses and suburban lives.\n\nThe \u201cNo Country for Old Hens\u201d half began with \u201cSouth Park\u201d footage of the hell-raising animated youths waxing on the \u201ctrue\u201d lyrics of \u201cTom Sawyer,\u201d which dovetailed with the curtain rising on Mr. Lee, Mr. Lifeson and Mr. Peart assaying that very tune before segueing into \u201cCamera Eye.\u201d\n\nThe crowd reached a fever pitch as Mr. Lifeson thrashed the opening chords of 1980\u2019s \u201cThe Spirit of Radio,\u201d followed in short order by Mr. Peart\u2019s signature drum strikes and Mr. Lee\u2019s lyrics about the \u201ccompanion unobtrusive.\u201d Mr. Lee didn\u2019t reach for as many optional superhigh notes in the tune as usual \u2014 not that the concertgoers seemed to mind.\n\nThen came \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d off of \u201cPermanent Waves\u201d and two segments of \u201cCygnus X-1\u201d before a stunning rendition of \u201cCloser to the Heart,\u201d complete with Mr. Peart switching from drums to stand-up tubular bells where needed. The crowd roared as Mr. Lee took his tenor to its upper registers in the final refrain of the song\u2019s titular lyric.\n\nThe heart of the second half \u2014 and of the entire show \u2014 was the fantastical \u201cXanadu\u201d followed by several sections of the \u201c2112\u201d concept album from 1976 to cap \u201cNo Country for Old Hens.\u201d\n\nBefore the encore, more video played, this time of fellow Ontarian Eugene Levy in his SCTV character for a segment of \u201cMel\u2019s Rock Pile,\u201d as the actor comically re-introduced Rush as a band that \u201cmight\u201d be something someday. The trio then returned for a truncated version of \u201cLakeside Park,\u201d \u201cAnthem,\u201d \u201cWhat You\u2019re Doing\u201d and \u201cWorking Man\u201d before bidding the crowd of grateful Garden Staters adieu. Closing video showed the band attempting to retire to their dressing room, which had been co-opted by an obnoxious clown and a surreal assortment of animated artworks from the band\u2019s various album covers.\n\nFor three gentlemen over 60, Messrs. Lee, Lifeson and Peart played with the energy of teenagers first thrust upon the world\u2019s stage. The graying of Mr. Lifeson\u2019s hair, the cragginess of Mr. Lee\u2019s visage and the seemingly permanent grumpy face of Mr. Peart are all that belie the reality of their calendar ages, which is all but forgotten \u2014 or forgiven \u2014 as the triumvirate showcased an energy and vibrancy seem little elsewhere in rock. Mr. Lifeson\u2019s ax-wielding chops in particular are rivaled by few of his contemporaries with the notable exception of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Lindsey Buckingham, now 65. Mr. Peart is as polished as ever behind the drum kit, making up for his perceived lack of showmanship \u2014 though he did delight in frequent drumstick twirls and vertical tosses and catches \u2014 with the beat-setting and percussive backbone that has been his staple in the band since joining in 1974. (In the 2010 documentary \u201cRush: Beyond the Lighted Stage,\u201d Mr. Lifeson and Mr. Lee still referred to Mr. Peart as \u201cthe new guy.\u201d) And Mr. Lee is as competent as ever both with his instruments and his amazingly high voice, which somehow never strains for those upper notes.\n\nThere are rumblings this will likely be Rush\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d tour, what with Mr. Lifeson suffering from worsening arthritis and Mr. Peart\u2019s tendonitis making punishment of the drums night after night a painful ordeal for his elbow. Lest we forget, the Torontonians have before faced and overcome tragedy, most notably the near-simultaneous deaths of Mr. Peart\u2019s daughter and wife in the late \u201890s and his declaration that, for him, Rush was over. After nearly two years on his motorcycle, Mr. Peart met photographer Carrie Nuttall, who became his second wife and the mother of his daughter Olivia, returning to the band shortly thereafter.\n\nIf Rush has proven anything, it\u2019s that endings, to shows and in life, are complicated and sometimes messy business, especially for a group that has been continuously recording and touring for nearly a half-century. While this outing very well might be Rush\u2019s curtain call as a touring act, they may yet have longevity beyond the lighted stage. Judging from the rapturous audience at Saturday\u2019s Newark appearance, fans will warm overwhelmingly to their next inevitable chapter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rush bassist/vocalist/keyboardist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart are touring the U.S. and Canada to commemorate their ruby anniversary, with a sold-out stop Saturday at Newark, New Jersey's Prudential Center.
