EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Odell Beckham Jr. made a jaw-dropping one-handed touchdown catch that lit up social media and helped the struggling New York Giants take a 21-10 lead over the Dallas Cowboys at halftime on Sunday night.

The rookie receiver gained position on cornerback Brandon Carr along the right sideline, left his feet at about the 3-yard line and reached as far back as he could with his right hand and pulled in the 43-yard heave from Eli Manning :08 into the second quarter for a 14-3 lead.

The catch set the crowd at MetLife Stadium abuzz and set the internet ablaze:

“Man I just witnessed the greatest catch ever possibly by Odell Beckham Jr! WOW!!!!” LeBron James tweeted.

It was as good or even better than the helmet grab David Tyree made to help the Giants beat the then undefeated Patriots in the Super Bowl in 2008.

It also was Beckham’s second TD of the game. He scored on a routine 3-yarder on New York’s opening possession to cap an 80-yard drive. It marked the second straight game the Giants have scored a touchdown on their opening drive after failing to do so in their previous 20 games.
