Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is going to attempt to do it.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nUS Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R) of Wisconsin holds a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 10, 2015.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has one big goal for 2016 \u2013 coming up with a bold, positive Republican agenda so that \u201cMr. and Mrs. America,\u201d as he puts it, have a clear choice in the upcoming elections.\n\nRepublicans, deeply divided and shouldering a wide field of presidential candidates, could certainly use an affirming vision that unites and inspires them. As the party\u2019s acknowledged \u201cideas man\u201d and a former vice presidential candidate, the energetic speaker from Wisconsin is in a good position to outline that agenda, observers say.\n\n\u201cWith more than a dozen candidates for president going in different directions, the burden falls on Ryan to try to define a positive national message,\u201d says former House historian Raymond Smock in an e-mail. \u201cBig assignment.\u201d\n\nRecommended: So you think you know Congress? Take our quiz.\n\nThe speaker got started on this project last week, outlining his vision in a speech at the Library of Congress. It had its own Twitter hashtag, #ConfidentAmerica.\n\nSounding much like a presidential candidate, he laid down several markers: a greatly simplified tax code, a replacement for \u201cObamacare,\u201d welfare reform 2.0, and a strong America as the leader on the world stage.\n\nBut his words got drowned out by events \u2013 the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., and by the campaign rhetoric that followed \u2013 particularly Donald Trump\u2019s call to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States.\n\nAnd therein lies just one of the challenges that Speaker Ryan will have as he turns to his Republican colleagues to flesh out an agenda in January, when House members gather at their annual retreat.\n\n\u201cBreaking through the noise is definitely a problem,\u201d says GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak. \u201cThe presidential campaign dominates. It\u2019s hard for even candidates for governor and the US Senate to break through, and so it will be hard for him as well.\u201d\n\nRyan's clout\n\nAnother potential problem is the raucous caucus itself. Can he unite members behind a vision?\n\nDespite its many attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the GOP-controlled House was never able to agree on a replacement for it. Tax reform, too, is a really tough one \u2013 though it\u2019s Ryan\u2019s specialty.\n\nMany say that if anyone can unite Republicans behind a vision, it\u2019s the new conservative speaker. He has strong backing from all corners of his caucus, but is facing a test as he tries to carry a giant spending bill over the finish line by Dec. 16.\n\nIf he succeeds in his vision effort, it could significantly affect the Republican Party, says John Pitney, a congressional expert at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.\n\n\u201cHe has strong potential to drive the debate and get material out there that could become part of the Republican conversation. And if there\u2019s a Republican president in 2016, Ryan\u2019s ideas will become very consequential because that president may well adopt them,\u201d Professor Pitney says.\n\nIt\u2019s happened before.\n\nHow other leaders have succeeded\n\nRonald Reagan\u2019s signature \u201csupply side\u201d tax cuts started on the Hill, with then-Rep. Jack Kemp (R) of New York as a key player, Pitney says. Similarly, a prescription drug benefit and education reform were simmering in Congress before George W. Bush took office.\n\nAnd former Speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cContract With America\u201d helped lead to a Republican sweep of Congress in the midterm elections of 1994 \u2013 the so-called Republican revolution.\n\nThe contract came out six weeks before the election. Ryan wants his agenda out there much earlier than that. He told reporters on Thursday that his experience on a presidential ticket \u2013 he was Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012 \u2013 tells him voters need to hear the message early and often.\n\nIf he can produce it by February or March, he can perhaps begin to shape what the GOP platform will look like and what a presidential nominee might run on, Mr. Mackowiak says. All the better if it\u2019s a positive message, since Republicans in the Obama era have become known as the \u201cparty of \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMackowiak sees another advantage. If Mr. Trump becomes the nominee, candidates up and down the ballot would have an agenda to run on, given Trump\u2019s tendency to go against the grain. \u201cIn a way, this is a hedge against Trump,\u201d says Mackowiak, though he doubts Ryan is thinking of it that way.\n\nWhat will voters think?\n\nEven if Ryan can unite his party behind a vision and that vision can be seen in the dust storm of a presidential election year, the question remains: Will voters like it?\n\nDemocrats are sure to pounce, just as they did in 2012 with Ryan\u2019s plan to turn Medicare into a partial voucher system. The \u201cgranny\u201d ad, which depicted a Ryan look-alike pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair over a cliff, was politically devastating for Republicans.\n\nStill, Ryan could be just what Republicans need right now.\n\nHe\u2019s young and energetic. He\u2019s looked at politics from his office as a legislator and from the stage of a presidential nominating convention. So far, he\u2019s managed to tame the hard-right Freedom Caucus by including them in the decisionmaking process. And he\u2019s rapidly becoming \u201cMr. Sunday\u201d on the TV talk shows.\n\nMr. Smock, the historian, ventures that Ryan is trying to tilt the balance of power in Washington back to Congress.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone other than Newt, who planned to use the speakership to rival the presidency and shift agenda-setting from the White House to the House of Representatives,\u201d he writes.\n\nA big assignment, indeed.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "c81ecfaf1d39ac66339595c4976d25c2", "sailthru.author": "Francine Kiefer", "description": "Deeply divided Republicans could use a vision to unite them, political analysts say.
