Even for a city accustomed to doomsday budget scenarios, this year\u2019s fiscal crisis is staggering. The School District of Philadelphia, with a total budget of $2.4 billion, faces a shortfall of $300 million. In an effort to close this gap, the district has shuttered dozens of schools, laid-off thousands of employees, and made previously unimagined cuts to school-level programming and staffing. The consequences of these cutbacks were apparent when schools opened this September: in many schools, classrooms are severely overcrowded, secretaries and assistant principals are gone, materials are in short supply, key staff (such as guidance counselors and nurses) are dividing their time between several schools, and arts and other programs have been scaled back or cut altogether.\n\nThis year\u2019s budget crisis, like those that have preceded it and those that are likely to follow, can be traced to the vicious combination of middle-class flight to the suburbs and a school funding model that relies on declining local property taxes. The result is a cycle of underfunded schools and rising poverty. In 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Education, the School District of Philadelphia spent $13,000 per pupil on a student population that is 77 percent poor and 76 percent African American or Latino. A few miles away, in the affluent suburb of Lower Merion, where the student population is 7 percent poor and 10 percent African American or Latino, per-pupil spending neared $27,000. Is it any surprise Philadelphia\u2019s schools are struggling? In this context, the renewed interest in urban public schools among some middle- and upper-middle class families seems promising. As groups of middle-class families in cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston choose to remain in the city and send their children to public schools instead of fleeing to the suburbs, it is tempting to see this development as a solution to the problem of urban school failure. However, while more middle-class families in cities and city schools would certainly help, attracting such families does not and cannot substitute for reforms that address the root causes of concentrated poverty, budget shortfalls, and failing schools. Philadelphia\u2019s experience is a case in point. Young professionals have flocked to the revitalized downtown (\u201cCenter City\u201d) over the past few decades. So much so that the population of Center City increased by 26.6 percent. Center City residents tend to be well-educated: Only 22 percent of all Philadelphians aged 25 to 35 have college degrees, but 86 percent of young adults in Center City do. While this influx of young professionals bodes well for the on-going development of Center City, many still leave for the suburbs when their children reach school age, seeking higher-performing schools in the suburbs. From 2004 to 2008, business and education leaders in Philadelphia implemented a novel program to interrupt this pattern. Called the Center City Schools Initiative, it was designed to convince downtown middle- and upper-middle-class parents to invest in their local public schools rather than paying for private schools or moving to the suburbs. Related Story Even if Private Schools Didn't Exist, There Would Still Be Rich Suburbs In collaboration with school officials, a local business improvement district marketed a handful of relatively high-performing downtown elementary schools specifically to professional families with young children. The marketing campaign began with a professionally designed website, intended to provide parents with a \u201ccustomer-friendly virtual front door\u201d to the downtown schools. It also included a school fair and other public events, fliers promising parents that sending their children to Center City public schools would allow them to \u201cpersonally\u201d introduce their children to Philadelphia\u2019s rich culture and history and to enjoy the \u201cunique, shared experiences that come from working, playing, living, and learning right here.\u201d In addition, public and private funds supported staffers to serve as liaisons between Center City parents and the school district, often facilitating special access to district officials. Meanwhile, district leaders urged principals in the area to improve their customer service and changed the admissions policy for elementary school to provide Center City families with \u201cenhanced school choice.\u201d\n\nThe areas targeted by the initiative (Center City and its surrounding gentrifying neighborhoods) were largely white and middle- and upper-middle class. Proponents believed that if these parents became invested in their local public schools, all of Philadelphia would benefit from higher property tax income, increased downtown revitalization as more affluent families continued to live and spend in the city, and\u2014eventually\u2014a better school system. The marketing worked: According to my analysis of School District of Philadelphia data, by 2009 the number of Center City children enrolled in first grade in the three most desirable public schools had increased by 60 percent, from 111 to 177. Through fundraising and the activation of social and professional networks, these new families helped bring resources to the schools, including new playgrounds, libraries, and arts programs. But these Center City children weren\u2019t taking empty slots. When they enrolled, they left fewer spots for low-income students from North and West Philadelphia, who had for years used those schools to escape failing ones in their neighborhoods. During this period, the number of first graders in Center City schools from outside the neighborhood decreased by 42 percent, from 64 to 37. Not surprisingly, this shift had racial dimensions: The percentage of white students in these schools in the early grades increased by 30 percent, and the percentage of African American students decreased a corresponding 29 percent. Research I conducted at one of the targeted schools shows parents received very different messages about their importance to the school community. Recruitment efforts were so intense for one white, middle-class mother that she mused, \u201cIf I had been an athlete, maybe I\u2019d have gotten a car!\u201d In contrast, an African American, low-income mother who did not live in Center City was so frustrated by the fixation on \u201cneighborhood\u201d (or Center City families) that she exclaimed in an interview, \u201cWhat\u2019s so important about this person from the neighborhood coming here? It\u2019s not like this is a private school, where their money is cash and mine is from the government!\u201d Whereas middle-class parents received special treatment from school and district officials, low-income parents felt marginalized and excluded.\n\nIn addition, there is no evidence that middle-class parents\u2019 efforts reached beyond those their children attended. According to grant proposals, public and private spending on the initiative topped $500, 000 but the vast majority of Philadelphia\u2019s schools\u2014and especially its poorer students\u2014did not benefit. The marketing initiative targeted 13 elementary schools, and actually focused on only four or five in the most affluent downtown neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the other 160 elementary schools received no special attention. As a district official observed, comparing downtown schools to those in poorer neighborhoods, \u201cmaking sure the schools in Center City are successful is pretty high on the radar screen. As opposed to, say, Tilden [in impoverished Southwest Philadelphia]. Nobody is really that focused on Tilden, until there\u2019s a major incident.\u201d Finally, the greater investment on the part of middle-class families in some Philadelphia public schools did not prevent the district\u2019s latest\u2014and most severe\u2014budget crisis. The story of Philadelphia should remind us that the demographic shifts and fiscal policies that led to the current situation defy reforms or marketing efforts (however well-intentioned) that focus on a few schools or a small group of families. In other cities\u2014most notably Chicago and Boston\u2014school district officials and local leaders have reached out to middle- and upper-middle-class parents, hoping to convince them to remain in the city and enroll their children in the public schools. In the absence of comparable research on these efforts, it is difficult to know if they produced the same outcomes as Philadelphia\u2019s did. But in both cities, newspaper articles have extolled the improvements middle-class parents made to some schools, telling stories similar to those in Philadelphia of new libraries, refurbished facilities, and enrichment programs. However, research by Northeastern University sociologist Shelley Kimelberg suggests that, because middle-class parents tend to \u201ccluster\u201d in certain schools, their actions have the potential to increase racial segregation in Boston public schools. In her research on school reform in Chicago, University of Illinois professor Pauline Lipman has found large and growing disparities between schools serving poor students and those serving the more advantaged. In addition, while Boston\u2019s system appears to be relatively stable, Chicago\u2019s latest funding crisis and resulting budget cuts\u2014and its closing of dozens of schools this year\u2014have made national news.", "article_metadata": {"description": "These initiatives\u00a0cannot substitute for reforms that address the root causes of concentrated poverty, budget shortfalls, and failing schools.", "author": "Maia Bloomfield Cucchiara", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "These initiatives\u00a0cannot substitute for reforms that address the root causes of concentrated poverty, budget shortfalls, and failing schools.", "title": "Cities Are Trying to Fix Their Schools by Luring the Middle Class: It Won't Work", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/cucchiara_phillyschools_post/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/Cities-Are-Trying-to-Fix-Their-Schools-by-Luring-the-Middle-Class-It-Wont-Work/280390/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Center City residents tend to be well-educated: Only 22 percent of all Philadelphians aged 25 to 35 have college degrees, but 86 percent of young adults in Center City do.\nIn this context, the renewed interest in urban public schools among some middle- and upper-middle class families seems promising.\nDuring this period, the number of first graders in Center City schools from outside the neighborhood decreased by 42 percent, from 64 to 37.\nCalled the Center City Schools Initiative, it was designed to convince downtown middle- and upper-middle-class parents to invest in their local public schools rather than paying for private schools or moving to the suburbs.\nThe School District of Philadelphia, with a total budget of $2.4 billion, faces a shortfall of $300 million."}
