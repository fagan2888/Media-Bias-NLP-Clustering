She had the driver, Adnan Chaudhry drive her to Framingham, Mass., about 15 miles west of Boston.\n\nChaudhry estimated the ride would cost between $850 and $1,000, and she agreed, Boston.com reported.\n\nWhen the cab finally arrived at Rebelato's home, the fare was $980 and Rebelato allegedly told the Chaudhry the money was in her house.\n\nShe came back 10 minutes later and told the driver she didn't have enough money and her credit card was no good, the Metro West Daily News reported.\n\nChaudhry gave her another ride -- to the Framingham Police station. She told authorities she wanted to pay but said, \"I have so many problems. I just came from Brazil,\" according to the paper.\n\nPolice then charged Rebelato with larceny over $250, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPolice arrested her at 8:45 p.m. and charged her with larceny over $250.\n\nThis is her first offense.\n\nRebelato was released Thursday after striking a deal with Judge Robert Greco to pay back Chaudhry within 60 days.\n\nStill, the amount of the cab fare bewildered the judge.\n\n\"From New York? From New York, you said? That's how much it costs?\" Greco said, according to the Metro West Daily News. \"They have buses.\"\n\nThe incident is a first for Framingham Police spokesman Lt. Frank DiVitorio.\n\n\u201cI've been here 30 years and this is the first time I've seen someone taking a cab from that distance and try not to pay,\u201d DiVitorio told the New York Daily News. \u201cIf you were the cabbie, would you take $1,000 fare without getting any money up front?\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Dumb Criminals: Mugshot Gallery Dumb Criminals: Mugshot Gallery\n\n1 of 105 Quanta'e Powell Powell is accused of running naked around a Florida apartment complex in February, 2012.
