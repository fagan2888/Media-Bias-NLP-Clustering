Now patients have rights, although not necessarily the ones they need. Meanwhile, health care workers have none.\n\nAs a psychiatrist in a large urban hospital in a drug-ridden neighborhood across the street from a homeless shelter, I\u2019m often called upon to assist when patients\u2019 behavior is troublesome to the staff. Conflicts between health care workers and staff are a daily occurrence. Many patients intimidate staff with verbal threats, sexual harassment, and actual violence. Others refuse to leave the hospital after they have been released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen confronted about their behavior, patients often insist that they know their rights. In the nurses\u2019 stations, I hear hospital staff mutter, \u201cWhat about my rights?\u201d\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s dangerous to be a health care worker. A 2006 study in the Journal of Emergency Medicine reported that 67 percent of nurses and 51 percent of doctors in surveyed emergency rooms were physically assaulted during the six-month study period, and nearly 100 percent were verbally harassed.\n\nRecently, I was asked to see a patient who had just threatened to beat up a nurse if she didn\u2019t get a sandwich for herself and her husband. I listened to the couple\u2019s complaints and asked them if we could agree that it was not okay to threaten hospital staff. They replied that it was not acceptable that they were hungry, had had to ask for food so many times, and had not gotten any.\n\nParticularly in the emergency room, where this incident occurred, desperate patients frequently come into conflict with hospital staff, which cannot possibly meet everyone\u2019s needs at once. The patient and her husband felt that their rights had been violated, and that they had no recourse but to violate the rights of others.\n\nThe federal Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights takes a business-oriented, customer-service approach to health care. It highlights issues such as services provided, consent to and refusal of care, and billing \u2014 in other words, contractual arrangements. From that standpoint, the patient probably does have a right to receive a sandwich in a timely manner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot spelled out in the regulations, however \u2014 as is clear from the example above \u2014 is the protection of either patients or caregivers from harm. The patient who has injured a staff member has not enjoyed a right to health care. The beleaguered health care worker has not experienced the safe workplace to which she is entitled.\n\nThe truth about health care is that it evokes intense feelings due to its life-and-death nature, and the powerful transferences triggered in the doctor-patient scenario. Far from relating as parties to a contract, patients and health care workers can hate each other enough to kill \u2014 and fear each other enough to carry weapons. On July 24, a client shot his case worker to death at the Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital campus near Philadelphia. The client\u2019s psychiatrist pulled out his own weapon and shot the murderer, his patient.\n\nPatients\u2019 rights, with their emphasis on health care as a business transaction, contribute to the mindset that patients and doctors must be vigilant, even paranoid, in protecting their interests. That mentality reached its bizarre apotheosis in the shooting at Mercy Fitzgerald, where the psychiatrist was the last man standing.\n\nIn contrast, human rights are identified by their \u201cinalienable\u201d quality; they derive from the acknowledgment of our human dignity, freedom, and need for personal security. A human rights perspective offers a solution that respects the dignity of all participants in a health care setting. The Open Society Foundations has advocated applying principles of human rights to medical settings. The group\u2019s focus has been on oppressed peoples, such as Roma women subject to forced sterilization, but US hospitals can also benefit from a human rights-based approach.\n\nHow might a human rights perspective have changed the emergency room encounter between the patient and her nurse? To begin with, identifying unacceptable conditions as human rights violations has the power to galvanize administrators and lawmakers into addressing issues such as crowding and starvation of needy patients in the emergency room. Open Society Foundations refers to this as \u201cshaming power.\u201d Shame in health care should shift from patients, where it currently resides, to policy makers and profiteers, who bear responsibility for our current inadequate health care system.\n\nAs to health care workers, The Journal of Emergency Medicine study noted that fully 65 percent of subjects who had been assaulted never reported the incident to superiors. Workplace violence should never be considered an unfortunate part of the job; it\u2019s an abuse of the worker\u2019s liberty and security. The human rights perspective acknowledges that health care workers have the same inherent rights to safety as do patients. The health care worker is encouraged to report, document, and demand response from the institution and the government to prevent violent and threatening behavior.\n\nWhen dignity, liberty, and security are appreciated as the basis of the right to health care, conflicts between patients and health care workers will occur less frequently. Until then, it\u2019s us versus them.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.1048715977", "eomportal-id": 60496, "description": "Four years after rollout of Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights, health care workers still have no right to safety.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Four years after rollout of Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights, health care workers still have no right to safety.", "title": "Amend Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights to protect health care workers, too - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/09/23/amend-patients-bill-rights-protect-health-care-workers-too/IFa1lN63fhintSP1qSfHxO/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/07/10/BostonGlobe.com/Boston/Images/fa157c9ce74f492c9919ec4e986eedb9-fa157c9ce74f492c9919ec4e986eedb9-0.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Wed May 25 17:36:27 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Anne Skomorowsky,PAtients' bill of rights,health care workers,Open Society Foundations,Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital,do no harm,emergency room,Journal of Emergency Medicine,thepodium,Affordable Care Act,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "78f31968-4285-11e4-882e-5f8c4cd4fe3c", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Anne Skomorowsky,PAtients' bill of rights,health care workers,Open Society Foundations,Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital,do no harm,emergency room,Journal of Emergency Medicine,thepodium,Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd7d\"", "article_summary": "When dignity, liberty, and security are appreciated as the basis of the right to health care, conflicts between patients and health care workers will occur less frequently.\nThe human rights perspective acknowledges that health care workers have the same inherent rights to safety as do patients.\nMeanwhile, health care workers have none.\nConflicts between health care workers and staff are a daily occurrence.\nA human rights perspective offers a solution that respects the dignity of all participants in a health care setting."}
