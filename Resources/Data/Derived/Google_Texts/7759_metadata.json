'Fitch believes the stable operating environment will continue in 2014.'.\n\nAlong with the housing market improvement, demand for services remained strong, which led to a further strengthening in occupancy gains seen in 2013. Expenses remained manageable, led by labor and insurance, two areas that have historically been concerns.\n\nDespite a rise in interest rates in the latter half of 2013, Fitch expects capital spending to accelerate in 2014 as CCRCs look to remain competitive, meet demand, and address older sections of their campuses.\n\nFitch views an increase in the rate of unit turnover above actuarial predictions as an emerging challenge. This can weaken operating performance as communities incur elevated renovation and marketing costs, and realize lower monthly service fee revenues.\n\nWhile CCRCs have little direct exposure to the changes under the Affordable Care Act, the emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions and delivering high quality post-acute and rehab care is expected to further benefit many CCRCs.\n\nFitch will host a conference call to discuss its 2014 Healthcare Outlook on Dec. 12 at 2:00 PM eastern.\n\nDial-in Numbers:\n\n--U.S. Participants: +1-877-467-8597;\n\n--International Participants: +1-706-643-6296;\n\n--Conference and Replay ID: 17261588;\n\n--U.S. Replay: +1-855-859-2056;\n\n--International Replay: +1-404-537-3406.\n\nThe replay will be available for 30 days.\n\nFitch's special report titled '2014 Outlook: Nonprofit Continuing Care Retirement Communities' is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the above link.\n\nAdditional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.\n\nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
