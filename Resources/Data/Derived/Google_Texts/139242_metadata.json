However, Li said the procedure is invasive and expensive.\n\n\"If we could offer a simpler test, you'd get more people receptive to this type of screening,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers said they plan to start testing a panel of molecules next summer. They said the system could eventually be used to test for other types of cancer, if it proves effective.\n\n\"We're really going to do our best to make this happen.\" The two-year grant is worth $199,650.
