The 49ers have been criticized for keeping McDonald on the field while he awaits trial. This case comes amid widespread criticism of the NFL for mishandling situations where players have been accused of abuse.\n\nFeinstein said female senators are \"surprised, amazed and very resolute to do something\" to force the NFL to act more assertively on domestic violence allegations. \"These teams need to set an example for the rest of society,\" Feinstein said. \"There has to be a strength in the league to project the values of what's right and what's wrong.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" host Chuck Todd asked Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) whether Congress should vote to take away the NFL's tax exempt status in response to the mishandling of abuse allegations and other concerns, as some other senators have suggested. Johnson said senators \"have far higher priorities\" than addressing that issue.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: GOP Women In Congress GOP Women In Congress\n\n1 of 23 Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.)
