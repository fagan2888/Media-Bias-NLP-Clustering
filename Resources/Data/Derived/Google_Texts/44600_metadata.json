The changes raise a special set of questions for musicians whose income varies month to month.\n\nThough the website isn't yet enrolling people, Cover Oregon will allow people to reduce monthly commercial health insurance premiums using tax credits based on projected 2014 income.\n\nMoreover, the Oregon Health Plan will no longer use an asset test to disqualify people for having substantial savings. Instead, eligibility will be based solely on income, and the cap on income is going up significantly -- to about $15,860 for individuals or $21,408 for a family of two.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Doug Fir and the Jeremy Wilson Foundation, and will include a performance by Pete Krebs, the Portland guitar player who is battling a rare form of cancer.\n\n\n\n-- Nick Budnick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act,cover oregon,health reform", "title": "Portland musician health care town hall tonight, Oct. 14: Changes ease coverage", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Portland musician health care town hall tonight, Oct. 14: Changes ease coverage\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2013/10/portland_musician_health_care.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/13472050-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11430024\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-14T19:29:02Z\", \"author\": \"Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@music\",\"@portland\",\"affordable care act\",\"cover oregon\",\"health reform\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/opinion_impact/photo/13472050-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@NickBudnick", "site": "@oregonlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Portland town hall tonight will educate musicians about new options for low-cost health care that kick in next year.
