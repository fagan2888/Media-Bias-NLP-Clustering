Recent acquisitions include Gypsum Technologies, Murray Supply and USA Wood Door

Window and door manufacturer PGT Inc. (Nasdaq: PGTI) is buying privately-held WinDoor Inc. for $102 million.

WinDoor, located in Orlando, Florida, makes impact-resistant windows and doors for hotels, resorts, high-rise condominiums and residential homes.

For PGT, the deal is part of the company’s growth strategy to expand through deal making. “The acquisition of WinDoor aligns with our corporate growth strategy to acquire brands and products that generate revenue and leverage our core capabilities,” says PGT COO Jeff Jackson. In September 2014, PGT completed its $111 million deal for CGI Windows & Doors Holdings Inc. The company has received financing from Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB) and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to help fund the purchase of WinDoor.

Masonite International Corp. (NYSE: DOOR) completed its purchase of USA Wood Door; Morsco, backed by Advent International, has acquired Murray Supply Co.; Wynnchurch Capital is investing in privately-held Gypsum Technologies Inc.
