No hearing date has been set.\n\nRepublican legislative leaders welcomed the court\u2019s decision as \u201cgood news for every Arizonan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case presents the question of whether that (redistricting) authority can be removed from the Legislature and given to an unelected commission,\u201d said Senate President Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, and House Speaker Andy Tobin, R-Paulden, in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased the court has decided to address this matter.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission said commissioners would have preferred that the court affirm the lower courts\u2019 rulings, but they hope that it will ultimately uphold Arizona voters\u2019 right to establish independent redistricting.\n\n\u201cWe have precedent on our side, we have the constitutional history on our side,\u201d said Mary O\u2019Grady, lead counsel for the commission. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see what the court decides, but we are hopeful that we\u2019ll prevail on the merits if the court reaches the merits.\u201d\n\nThe case is expected to have a significant impact on redistricting in states around the country that have set up commissions similar to Arizona\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis is a really important case that has profound implications across the country,\u201d said Stephen Spaulding, policy counsel in the national office of Common Cause.\n\nThat organization supported Proposition 106, the Arizona ballot initiative that created the independent redistricting commission 14 years ago.\n\nSupporters of independent redistricting panels say that allowing lawmakers to draw the lines of their own districts amounts to what Spaulding called \u201cthe foxes guarding the hen house.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation where this process \u2013 gerrymandering \u2013 allows politicians to pick their voters rather than voters choosing their politicians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Constitution requires that states redraw congressional boundaries after every decennial census so that the number of voters in each district is roughly equal to others.\n\nThat had been done by lawmakers until voters passed Proposition 106 as an amendment to the Arizona Constitution in 2000. The amendment established the commission that drew new districts for the 2002 elections and again for the 2012 elections, to reflect population changes in the 2000 and 2010 censuses.\n\nBoth times, the commission solicited public input and held hearings before coming up with final district plans.\n\nO\u2019Grady said the belief that independent commissions do a better job at redistricting than politicians can be seen in the state\u2019s congressional district map.\n\n\u201cWe have some of the most competitive congressional districts in the country as a result of our independent redistricting process,\u201d she said.\n\nCommissioners are volunteers, four of whom are appointed by Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, with the fifth and final member selected by the preceding four.\n\nSpaulding said the case will affect six states, including Arizona, that have vested the power to draw legislative and congressional lines with citizen commissions, rather than with their legislatures. Besides Arizona, the states are Alaska, California Idaho, Montana and Washington.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are enormous for the integrity of our democracy and we will be watching it closely,\u201d Spaulding said.\n\n- 30 -", "article_metadata": {"DC.rights": "All rights reserved", "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court said Thursday it will hear the Arizona Legislature\u2019s challenge
