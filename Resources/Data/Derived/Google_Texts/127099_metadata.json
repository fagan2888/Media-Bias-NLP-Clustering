(AP) \u2014 The next time the American military transport plane known as Whiskey 7 drops its paratroopers over Normandy, France, it will be for a commemoration instead of an invasion.\n\nSeventy years after taking part in D-Day, the plane now housed at the National Warplane Museum in western New York is being prepared to recreate its role in the mission, when it dropped troops behind enemy lines under German fire.\n\nAt the invitation of the French government, the restored Douglas C-47 will fly in for 70th-anniversary festivities and again release paratroopers over the original jump zone at Sainte-Mere-Eglise.\n\n\u201cThere are very few of these planes still flying, and this plane was very significant on D-Day,\u201d said Erin Vitale, chairwoman of the Return to Normandy Project. \u201cIt dropped people that were some of the first into Sainte-Mere-Eglise and liberated that town.\u201d\n\nMuseum officials say the twin-prop Whiskey 7, so named because of its W-7 squadron marking, is one of several C-47s scheduled to be part of the D-Day anniversary, with jumpers made up of active and retired military personnel. But it is believed to be the only one flying from the United States.\n\nThe plane will fly to France by way of Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland and Germany, each leg 5 \u00bd to 7 hours. Vitale compared it to trying to drive a 70-year-old car across the country without a breakdown. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge challenge.\u201d\n\nAmong the 21 men it carried in 1944 was 20-year-old Leslie Palmer Cruise Jr., who also will make the return trip to France, his fifth, and be reunited with the craft \u2014 once it\u2019s on the ground. He is flying commercially from his Horsham, Pa., home outside Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWith me, it\u2019s almost, sometimes, like yesterday,\u201d Cruise, now 89, said by phone, recalling his first combat mission. \u201cIt really never leaves you.\u201d\n\nAlthough the C-47 looks much the same today as it did on June 6, 1944, it looked very different when it arrived at the museum as a donation eight years ago. It had been converted to a corporate passenger plane.\n\n\u201cWe had to take an executive interior out,\u201d said the museum\u2019s president, W. Austin Wadsworth. \u201cIt had a dry bar, lounge seats, a table with a nice map of the Bahamas in there. It was beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe museum\u2019s restoration of the historic plane to its original condition has been a roughly $180,000 project so far. Most of the money went toward two rebuilt engines and the rest to parts, equipment and service. The museum is trying to raise a total of $250,000 for the restoration and return to Normandy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WWII troop transport plane will return to Normandy", "title": "WWII troop transport plane will return to Normandy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "WWII troop transport plane will return to Normandy", "title": "WWII troop transport plane will return to Normandy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/wwii_troop_transport_plane_will_return_to_normandy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/warplane-normandy.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WWII troop transport plane will return to Normandy", "title": "WWII troop transport plane will return to Normandy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/warplane-normandy.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Carolyn Thompson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The museum is trying to raise a total of $250,000 for the restoration and return to Normandy.\n\u201cThere are very few of these planes still flying, and this plane was very significant on D-Day,\u201d said Erin Vitale, chairwoman of the Return to Normandy Project.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsGENESEO, N.Y.
