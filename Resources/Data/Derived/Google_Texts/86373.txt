ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) The New York Health Exchange says more than 2.8 million people have signed up for Medicaid and low-cost insurance through its 2016 open enrollment that ended Jan. 31.

According to state health officials, federal data show the number of uninsured New Yorkers has declined by nearly 850,000 since the exchange opened in 2013, dropping from 10 percent to 5 percent by last September.

The enrollment totals include 1,966,920 people in government-funded Medicaid

Another 379,559 have enrolled in the exchange's “essential plan,” a new 2016 option designed to provide benefits and lower premiums of $20 or less a month.

The exchange reports 271,964 people enrolled in plans offered through the exchange by commercial and nonprofit insurers, and 215,380 in the state's Child Health Plus program for children under age 19.
