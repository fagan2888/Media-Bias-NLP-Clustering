Dear Johnnie: The Longmont Post Office website says passports — new and renewal — are available at their office. When I called I was told that only new were done and the tone was go do it online and don't bother us.

Perhaps you can find out just what their policy is. — WP

Dear WP: The Longmont Post Office processes new and renewed passport applications.

However, according to Postal Service spokesman David Rupert, "we do tell everyone that renewals can be done through the mail and they don't need to come in."

"The customers can obtain applications at the post office or through the State Department website. We tell everyone who asks for a renewal to check out the website."

The reason for this is that you will need an appointment — per State Department policy — to obtain or renew a passport at the post office. Of course, you knew that already because the Longmont P.O. website says so. Also, a renewal will cost you an extra $25 if a postal clerk verifies and processes your forms.

All that said, you still should expect to be able to get your passport renewal done at the post office. It's part of their job.

"We have many customers say they would like us to help them anyway and we schedule them in and process their application," Rupert said via email. "Pictures can be done here as well with no appointment necessary."

I checked: They don't do photos over the lunch hour.

One more thing, WP. Rupert said the management will remind employees who answer the phones to be more courteous.
