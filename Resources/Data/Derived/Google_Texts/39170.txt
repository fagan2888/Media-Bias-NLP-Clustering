As Nick Mariniello stepped onto the court this afternoon to begin his team’s pregame preparation, the Hudson Catholic boys basketball coach couldn’t help but take a quick glance into the visiting team’s stands.

The look only lasted a second or two, but in that short time, a wave of nine memorable years washed over Mariniello, who was going head-to-head with Bloomfield Tech for the first time since he resigned from his post there in 2008.

In one section sat the parents of De’Sean Butler, a former Trojan who went on to play for West Virginia and was later drafted by the Miami Heat. In another sat Courtney Nelson, The Star-Ledger’s Player of the Year in 2004 when he led Bloomfield Tech to a 25-8 record and a berth in the NSIAA Tournament of Champions final.

And although Mariniello said he was able to keep his emotions in check, the fifth-year Hudson Catholic coach admitted that there were some flashbacks running through his mind just minutes before the Hawks began their 73-44 defeat of the Trojans.

“I’m far enough removed from the school to the point where it wasn’t as emotional for me,” said Mariniello, who compiled a 186-50 record with Trojans while leading them to two Essex County titles and four Group I state championships. “But I still have a lot of pride for Bloomfield Tech because I got my start there and we accomplished a lot.

“It’s a place that will always be important to me.”

With his old employer in Jersey City, Mariniello said he easily could have rattled off memory after memory from his days in the blue, black and maize -- a tenure that ended amid health issues with Mariniello's father, who died last February. However, once the opening tipoff rolled around, the game became business as usual for the Hawks, ranked No. 9 in the Star-Ledger Top 20.

Slow out of the gate, Hudson Catholic (7-2) used a late first quarter push to separate themselves from Bloomfield Tech (6-1).

The run began with a steal by freshman Kahmoine Foster that led to a lay-in courtesy of junior forward Sammy Friday and progressed as guard Nassir Barrino made a basket to end the first quarter and then hit another to start the second.

From there, the Hawks never looked back, riding the play of Barrino and fellow guard J.R. Lynch – 10 points and a career-high eight assists. Hudson Catholic also received a boost from their big men as Friday scored 14 points alongside senior Safee Sabur, who scored 10 points and pulled down eight rebounds.

Although the Hawks were favored to win coming into the game, Barrino still believes the way they set the tone against the previously unbeaten Trojans speaks volumes to the team’s progression.

“We struggled in the beginning of the season, but we’re trying to get it together now and this win means a lot toward that goal,” said Barrino, who scored a game-high 18 points.

Mariniello concurred with his guard’s assessment while also pointing out that it’s been a day-to-day process for a young Hawks' squad.

“We’re getting better every day and with a young, inexperienced team that’s all I can ask for,” the Hawks’ coach said.

Although the defeat sets back what was a strong start to the season for Bloomfield Tech, Mariniello was quick to point out the respect that he carries for the Trojans. He also tipped his hat to Bloomfield Tech coach Brad Howard – a man who has brought consistency to a program that struggled to find the right fit after Mariniello’s departure.

“I think Brad has done a good job of stabilizing the program,” said Mariniello, who was named The Star-Ledger’s Coach of the Year in 2003 while at Bloomfield Tech. “He’s a great guy, he’s well respected in the community and you can see that his teams are very well coached. It’s good to see someone who wants to continue the success at Bloomfield Tech.

“I think the program is in very good hands.”
