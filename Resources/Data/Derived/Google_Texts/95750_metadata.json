A Fox News affiliate first revealed the conversation in a report Monday.\n\nDuvall and Stott-Bumsted worked together at a D.C. law firm before joining the government. They\u2019re also friends, according to Duvall.\n\n\u201cI was seeking to have a conversation with a colleague,\u201d Duvall said. \u201cI think that talking to appropriate colleagues about issues that you\u2019re working on can sharpen your thinking.\u201d\n\nDuvall added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that Commissioner Koskinen would be surprised that I was talking to Ms. Stott-Bumsted. But Commissioner Koskinen would not know about particular conversations or the content of particular conversations.\u201d\n\nDuvall\u2019s testimony provides a starting point for congressional investigators who want to determine which e-mails could provide evidence of wrongdoing, specifically collaboration between the White House, the Treasury Department and the IRS.\n\nKoskinen has testified that he did not direct anyone to talk to Treasury or the White House about the missing e-mails.

Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who heads the House oversight panel, to prove otherwise.\n\nWhen asked whether Koskinen \u201ccaused\u201d anyone at the White House, Treasury Department or the IRS inspector general\u2019s office to find out about the missing e-mails, the IRS chief said: \u201cI did not, and if you have any evidence of that, I\u2019d be happy to see it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/09/white_house_knew_of_destroyed_emails_two_months_before_congress.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: White House knew of destroyed emails two months before Congress"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcf1\"", "article_summary": "Koskinen has testified that he did not direct anyone to talk to Treasury or the White House about the missing e-mails.\nRepublican lawmakers have suggested that the agency collaborated with the Treasury Department and the executive\u2019s office to control the damage of the IRS targeting scandal.The White House learned about the e-mail issues in April, two months before the IRS informed Congress about the matter.\nIn closed-door testimony with House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staff, IRS attorney Catherine Duval said she told Treasury counsel Hannah Stott-Bumsted about the missing e-mails, which were requested by congressional committees.\nHe practically challenged Rep.
