Who knew that the soothing chirping of birds and the gentle cascade of natural water tucked away in the Irish countryside could help people focus better, sleep better, and feel better?\n\nOne YouTube video \u2014 containing eight hours of waterfall footage \u2014 makes all the difference. Posted by visual artist Johnnie Lawson, who is from County Leitrim in Ireland, the Irish waterfall helps fight insomnia all over the world; it\u2019s also now part of a clinical trial at several London hospitals to determine whether it can help intensive care unit (ICU) patients in preventing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to the BBC.\n\n\u201cThis is one of a series of videos designed for various needs \u2014 as a calming sound to play in the background while studying or as a soothing sound to play while you sleep,\u201d Lawson writes in the YouTube description. \u201cThese videos can be used for many relaxation requirements.\u201d\n\nLawson was surprised when people from all over the world began sending him messages about how much it helped them relax, meditate, sleep, or study. \u201cPeople who were finding it difficult to sleep began writing to me from all over the world \u2014 North Korea, the Central African Republic, Beijing and across the U.K.,\u201d he told BBC. \u201cThey started leaving me messages, saying the recordings were helping to relieve their insomnia. I\u2019ve even had people watching my videos from inside the Vatican.\u201d\n\nThe researchers running the trial, at University College Hospital, University College London, and the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre in London, hope that nature sounds can help bring people calm, stress relief, and sounder sleep.\n\nIndeed, being outdoors \u2014 and immersed in nature \u2014 has been shown to reduce stress, depression, and fatigue levels. Nature also has a positive effect on people\u2019s ability to focus, think creatively, and enjoy life. So next time you need a dose of nature, plug in to the Irish waterfall.\n\nThe inspiration behind the video? \u201cI consider myself lucky to live in the unexplored and peaceful hills of County Leitrim,\u201d Lawson told the BBC.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "irish waterfall, insomnia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If you suffer from insomnia, stress, or overall city life dissatisfaction, you may be helped by the soothing sounds in this video.", "title": "Irish Waterfall Video Soothes Insomnia Sufferers To Sleep Soundly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/irish-waterfall-video-will-help-you-sleep-soundly-tonight-video-331944", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/04/waterfall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you suffer from insomnia, stress, or overall city life dissatisfaction, you may be helped by the soothing sounds in this video.", "title": "Irish Waterfall Video Soothes Insomnia Sufferers To Sleep Soundly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/irish-waterfall-video-will-help-you-sleep-soundly-tonight-video-331944", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/04/waterfall.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/04/waterfall.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-04T18:04:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T18:03:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "If you suffer from insomnia, stress, or overall city life dissatisfaction, you may be helped by the soothing sounds in this video."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9925\"", "article_summary": "An eight-hour YouTube video of an Irish waterfall helps people across the world sleep better \u2014 and reduce their stress.\nWhile the term \u201cIrish waterfall\u201d may have different connotations on Urban Dictionary, it turns out to be an actual waterfall in Ireland that may help insomnia sufferers overcome their sleeping problems.\nOne YouTube video \u2014 containing eight hours of waterfall footage \u2014 makes all the difference.\nSo next time you need a dose of nature, plug in to the Irish waterfall.\nWho knew that the soothing chirping of birds and the gentle cascade of natural water tucked away in the Irish countryside could help people focus better, sleep better, and feel better?"}
