Sen. Mary L. Landrieu was spotted pouring beer into the mouth of a Louisiana State University fan who was doing a keg stand during a tailgating event on Saturday.

Several photos from the event show the vulnerable Louisiana Democrat holding the keg’s spigot while a man dressed in Tigers colors does a handstand on the keg and others hold his legs.

A source close to the campaign said the man was in his late 20s and was enjoying a tailgate with his friends and family, The Hill reported.

Mrs. Landrieu said fans had initially asked her to do a keg stand, which she declined. She then agreed to hold the spigot for someone else.

“They tried to get me to do it,” the senator told Roll Call. “His father was there, so I felt OK about it.”

Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is challenging Mrs. Landrieu, dropped by campus an hour later to shake hands and pass out flyers, Roll Call reported.
