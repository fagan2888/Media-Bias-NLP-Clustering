Fiorina has been brutal in stressing Clinton\u2019s huge credibility gap with voters stemming from her mishandling of government emails during her four years at the State Department and her role in the lead up to and aftermath of the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attacks that left four Americans dead.\n\nBut as her campaign suddenly begins to gain steam, Fiorina is attracting unwelcome scrutiny into her checkered stint as chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, her overwhelming loss to Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in the 2010 California Senate race, her personal wealth and even the accuracy of her public statements.\n\nOn that last point, Fiorina has drawn sharp fire from political fact-checkers for her comment at the Wednesday night debate in California daring Clinton and President Obama to watch videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group purporting to prove that Planned Parenthood officials have illegally profited from aborted fetal tissue provided to scientific researchers.\n\n\u201cWatch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, \u2018We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times PolitiFact.com, among other political watchdogs that have viewed hours of the video surreptitiously taken by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress, said there is no actual footage of what Fiorina described, only an interview with a woman talking about a scene similar to what Fiorina described.\n\nRelated: Fiorina Scores Well on Social Media in Face-off With Trump\n\nFiorina is standing by her statement, but her critics say she went too far afield in her attack on Planned Parenthood in a ham-handed appeal to her party\u2019s conservative base. \u201cTo be sure, Fiorina wasn't the only person lying about Planned Parenthood on stage,\u201d Amanda Marcotte wrote in Slate. \u201cThe claim that Planned Parenthood sells fetal body parts was stated as fact by multiple candidates. It's simply not true, and repeating it will not make it more true. But describing such a vivid and grisly scene that never happened\u2014that is taking it to another level.\u201d\n\nIt's a measure of Fiorina's sudden rise in prominence that she's taking incoming fire, according to University of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato. This is a normal part of the campaign process.\n\n\u201cShe'll have a rough patch that tests her,\u201d Sabato said in an email on Friday. \u201cThe system is supposed to work that way. Fiorina has a lot of enemies from her time at HP. But now she also has a lot of admirers in the GOP. We\u2019ll just have to watch and see how it plays out. Welcome to the big leagues.\u201d\n\nFiorina said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program on Thursday morning that she entered the debate well aware that half or more of the nearly 24 million people who watched it had never heard her name before or didn\u2019t realize she was running for president. \u201cAnd so it was a really important opportunity for me to continue to introduce myself to the American people,\u201d she explained.\n\nRelated: Trump Slights Rival Fiorina's Looks: 'Look at That Face'\n\nAfter essentially forcing her way onto the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., by virtue of a strong performance in an \u201cundercard\u201d candidates\u2019 debate in Cleveland on Aug. 6, Fiorina at times stole the show. She was well prepared to converse on a broad range of topics, from immigration and the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal to same sex marriage, drug treatment and federal funding of Planned Parenthood. The New York Times wrote that she emerged as an \u201cespecially tenacious combatant who provided some of the few moments when Mr. Trump looked uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nOne of those moments came when she was asked to respond to Trump\u2019s demeaning comment that Fiorina doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe face\u201d to be elected president. \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\u201d she said.\n\nBut there were rocky moments as well, as Trump and other questioned her business acumen and her stormy career at HP that ended with her firing. She claimed, as she has before, that she helped \u201cdouble the size\u201d of the company, quadrupled its top-line growth rate, quadrupled cash flow and tripled its rate of innovation.\n\nRelated: Carly Fiorina\u2019s Real Record at HP: Is She Presidential Material?\n\nCNN debate moderator Jake Tapper noted that Trump had said Fiorina \"ran HP into the ground\" during her time as CEO \u2014 including orchestrating a highly controversial merger with Compaq that prompted the layoff of 30,000 workers. Fiorina retorted: \"I led Hewlett-Packard through a very difficult time, the worst technology recession in 25 years,\" adding: \"We had to make tough choices, and in doing so, we saved 80,000 jobs, went on to grow to 160,000 jobs.\"\n\nFiorina\u2019s once promising challenge to Boxer in the 2010 Senate race all but collapsed after the Democrat began running an ad highlighting Fiorina\u2019s disastrous stewardship of HP, the 30,000 layoffs, her $1 million yacht and five corporate jets. She received a $20 million severance package when she was forced out in 2005.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported this week that one of Fiorina\u2019s Republican rivals shared Boxer\u2019s opposition research book from the 2010 campaign with reporters \u2014 suggesting that there could be plenty of negative stories about Fiorina in the coming days. The 219-page document covers Fiorina\u2019s career at Hewlett-Packard, details about her divorce and her net worth and property holdings.\n\n\u201cFiorina knows what's coming,\u201d Sabato said, \u201csince she saw it unfold in her Senate race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It didn\u2019t take long for the political long knives to come out against Carly Fiorina af", "title": "For Fiorina, the Real Test Starts Now", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Fiorina-Real-Test-Starts-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05042015_Carly_Fiorina.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/18/Fiorina-Real-Test-Starts-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05042015_Carly_Fiorina.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It didn\u2019t take long for the political long knives to come out against Carly Fiorina af", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d95\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTo be sure, Fiorina wasn't the only person lying about Planned Parenthood on stage,\u201d Amanda Marcotte wrote in Slate.\n\u201cThe claim that Planned Parenthood sells fetal body parts was stated as fact by multiple candidates.\nShe was well prepared to converse on a broad range of topics, from immigration and the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal to same sex marriage, drug treatment and federal funding of Planned Parenthood.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the political long knives to come out against Carly Fiorina after her boffo performance in Wednesday night\u2019s three-hour GOP presidential debate.\n\u201cFiorina knows what's coming,\u201d Sabato said, \u201csince she saw it unfold in her Senate race.\u201d"}
