With a temperature reading of 49 degrees at kickoff, the first open-air cold-weather climate didn't actually turn out to the the coldest ever played.

In fact, it wasnâ€™t even number two.

Super Bowl VI, played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, still holds the title with a kickoff temperature of 39 degrees. Super Bowl IX, also at Tulane Stadium, had a kickoff temperature of 46 degrees, holds the number two spot.

So after all the scrutiny and concern over holding an outdoor Super Bowl in a cold weather setting, Super Bowl XLVIII will only go down as the third coldest ever played, barely beating out Super Bowl VIII in Houston, Tex., which had a kickoff temperature of 50 degrees.

The temperature is expected to drop steadily throughout the game, but not to uncomfortable levels. It appears the game will miss a snowstorm by just 12 hours, but no precipitation is expected. And winds remain calm and should not have an impact on passing or kicking throughout the game.
