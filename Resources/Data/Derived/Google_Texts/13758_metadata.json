Chris Columbus [director] has come out and said that the first film is very near and dear to his heart and as long as he is alive it will never be remade.\"\n\nGalligan expanded on his statements.\n\n\"So the only thing they will be, and apparently are going to be doing, is something along the lines of like 'Jurassic World,' where it will be 30 years later,\" he continued.\n\nAs of now, \"Jurassic World,\" which starred Chris Pratt, has made north of $1.6 billion worldwide, reports Box Office Mojo, and the movie picked up where the original \"Jurassic Park\" franchise left off.\n\nThere will be new stars but Galligan added that \"some of the characters from the first one\" would be in it, but that \"I swear on my life, I don't know if I'm in it or not, but I think there is probably a decent chance since I'm one of the few people left standing from the first movie.\"\n\nReports of a new \"Gremlins\" movie started back in early 2014. In April, Deadline reported that \"Goosebumps\" writer Carl Ellsworth would be involved in the script.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Original 'Gremlins' star Zach Galligan says that the success of a 'Jurassic World,' a movie that is set decades after the original, has had an influence on the making of 'Gremlins 3.'", "language": "english", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/entertainment/headlines/Zach-Galligan-shares-details-of-Gremlins-3-356422051.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/gremlins.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Original 'Gremlins' star Zach Galligan says that the success of a 'Jurassic World,' a movie that is set decades after the original, has had an influence on the making of 'Gremlins 3.'", "title": "Zach Galligan shares details of 'Gremlins 3'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Original", "title": "Zach Galligan shares details of 'Gremlins 3'", "url": "http://www.kake.com/entertainment/headlines/Zach-Galligan-shares-details-of-Gremlins-3-356422051.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/gremlins.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Zach Galligan shares details of 'Gremlins 3'", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Zach Galligan shares details of"}, "article_summary": "Warner Bros./Amblin E/Sunset Boulevard/CorbisOriginal \"Gremlins\" star Zach Galligan says that the success of a \"Jurassic World,\" a movie that is set decades after the original, has had an influence on the making of \"Gremlins 3.\"\nReports of a new \"Gremlins\" movie started back in early 2014.\n\"So the only thing they will be, and apparently are going to be doing, is something along the lines of like 'Jurassic World,' where it will be 30 years later,\" he continued.\n\"It's not going to be a reboot,\" he told the audience in London, who had come out for a special screening of \"Gremlins,\" followed by questions for Galligan, according to the BBC.\nAs of now, \"Jurassic World,\" which starred Chris Pratt, has made north of $1.6 billion worldwide, reports Box Office Mojo, and the movie picked up where the original \"Jurassic Park\" franchise left off."}
