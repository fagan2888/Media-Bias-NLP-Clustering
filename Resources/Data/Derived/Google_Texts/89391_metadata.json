Bernie Sanders of Vermont know what he\u2019s talking about when he calls for the breakup of big Wall Street banks, a regular feature of his populist presidential campaign stump speech?\n\nOr, has he really done his homework on the Dodd-Frank law and federal banking regulations--a topic that goes to the heart of his challenge to former of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination?\n\nRelated: Sanders: I\u2019ll Win New York, Too \u2013 and Then the White House\n\nThe Daily News editorial page published a transcript Monday of its full interview with Sanders April 1 that highlighted vague answers to questions about the Middle East and foreign policy and his game plan for taking on the big banks. At one point in the interview, the editors grilled Sanders on precisely how he would go about breaking up the big banks, and the powers and role of the Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve in achieving that goal.\n\nSanders said that if the Treasury Department concluded a breakup of a mega bank was necessary, then it would be up to the bank\u2019s executives to determine how to unwind the institution within the financial parameters set by the administration to eliminate any risk to the economy.\n\n\u201cHow you go about doing it is having legislation passed, or giving the authority to the Secretary of Treasury to determine, under Dodd-Frank, that these banks are a danger to the economy over the problem of too-big-to-fail,\u201d Sanders said, according to the transcript.\n\nRelated: 4 Hillary Clinton Flip-Flops That Will Make Voters Think Twice\n\nThat sounded fine, until the editors pressed him more on whether he thought the Federal Reserve currently has the power to force a breakup. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if the Fed has it,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cBut I think the administration can have it.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board forged ahead, demanding to know how JPMorgan, Citibank or Bank of America would be restructured to eliminate the risk of a long-term failure. \u201cI\u2019m not running JP Morgan Chase or Citibank,\u201d Sanders snapped. \u201cNo, but you\u2019d be breaking it up,\u201d one of the editors replied.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd that is their decision as to what they want to do and how they want to reconfigure themselves.\u201d And so it went.\n\nMembers of the news media pounced on the transcript, describing it as \u201cpretty close to a disaster\u201d and a telltale sign that he hadn\u2019t adequately prepared for the interview. And Clinton\u2019s campaign staff gleefully emailed supporters links to the Daily News transcript to back up their argument that the long-time Vermont senator is not prepared to lead the country.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Plan Would Raise Taxes a Staggering $13.6 Trillion over a Decade\n\nWriting in the Atlantic, David Graham said that while no one doubts Sanders\u2019 core liberal convictions, \u201cturning convictions into policy is the challenge, and the Vermont senator\u2019s interview with the editorial board of the New York Daily News raises some questions about his policy chops.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s striking that there hasn\u2019t been more coverage of Sanders\u2019 policy ideas so far during the campaign, even at this late date, with most of the primary season concluded,\u201d Graham added.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019s key advisers and supporters cried foul, insisting that Sanders had adequately and accurately answered all of the questions about breaking up big banks. Tad Devine, a senior campaign adviser, told CNN on Wednesday that the critics are wrong and that \u201cBernie\u2019s answer on that was absolutely correct\u2026. Everything he said in that interview was absolutely, 100 percent correct.\u201d\n\nOthers echoed Devine\u2019s line, including the Huffington Post, which claimed, \u201cIn fact, in several instances, it\u2019s the Daily News editors who are bungling the facts in an interview designed to show that Sanders doesn\u2019t understand the fine points of policy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Study Challenges Clinton\u2019s Tax Plan for $1 Trillion in New Spending\n\nMike Konczal, a highly regarded financial expert with the Roosevelt Institute, wrote \u201cThe real problem with Sanders\u2019 language\u201d is his promise to begin downsizing banks within a year of taking office. \u201cYou\u2019d need to replace a lot of regulators to try this approach, and that takes time, and even then it\u2019s a hard slog,\u201d he wrote.\n\nKonczal insisted, nonetheless, that Sanders did perfectly fine in answering the newspaper editors\u2019 questions and \u201cgave some fairly normal answers on financial reform.\u201d\n\nYet if Sanders and his advisers were totally comfortable with his performance last week, it wasn\u2019t very apparent. They rushed Tuesday evening to put out the fire with a detailed statement on the senator\u2019s views on banking restructuring.\n\n\u201cElecting Senator Sanders as president would send a clear message to financial regulators that they need to do everything within their power to break up financial institutions so that they can no longer threaten the financial well-being of the American people,\u201d Michael Briggs, Sanders\u2019 spokesperson, said in a statement, according to The Washington Post.\n\nSanders has pledged to order the Treasury Secretary to create a \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose demise would pose \u201ca catastrophic risk\u201d to the economy.\n\nWithin a year, his administration would work with the Federal Reserve and financial regulators to break up the large banks, utilizing authority of Section 121 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform legislation, according to the campaign statement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Does Sen.", "title": "Not So Fast, Hillary: Bernie\u2019s Right About Breaking Up the Banks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Not-So-Fast-Hillary-Bernie-s-Right-About-Breaking-Banks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02282016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Not-So-Fast-Hillary-Bernie-s-Right-About-Breaking-Banks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02282016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Does Sen.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But Sanders\u2019s key advisers and supporters cried foul, insisting that Sanders had adequately and accurately answered all of the questions about breaking up big banks.\nSanders has pledged to order the Treasury Secretary to create a \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose demise would pose \u201ca catastrophic risk\u201d to the economy.\nTad Devine, a senior campaign adviser, told CNN on Wednesday that the critics are wrong and that \u201cBernie\u2019s answer on that was absolutely correct\u2026.\nAt one point in the interview, the editors grilled Sanders on precisely how he would go about breaking up the big banks, and the powers and role of the Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve in achieving that goal.\nThey rushed Tuesday evening to put out the fire with a detailed statement on the senator\u2019s views on banking restructuring."}
