Because Muslims believe the Quran contains God\u2019s will, it is the most authoritative source of the law \u2013 the final word.\n\nThe Sunna is the example of Mohammed, embodied in stories about his sayings and conduct.\n\nTwo centuries after the death of Mohammed, Muslim scholars collected and sifted through hundreds of thousands of narratives (called hadith) attributed to him, accepting a few thousand as likely to be authentic.\n\nTogether, the Sunna forms the second most important source of legal guidance \u2013 but their application to modern life isn\u2019t always clear, and at times, one lesson from Mohammed seems to contradict another.\n\nWhat does the Quran say about apostasy?\n\nThe Quran warns apostates, except those who later repent, that a severe and painful punishment awaits them in the afterlife.\n\nThey shall forever be the companions of hellfire, the holy book says.\n\nBut nowhere in the Quran does God command earthly authorities to execute anyone who has converted from Islam.\n\nThat omission is key, because the Quran says, \u201cThe Lord neglects nothing, nor does he forget.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if God wanted apostates killed, he would have said so.\n\nInstead, the Quran\u2019s message is: The apostate is accountable to Allah in the hereafter, not to judges on Earth.\n\nAs one passage says, \u201cIt is God who judges.\u201d\n\nWhat did Mohammed say about apostasy?\n\nUnlike the Quran, there are conflicting stories and opinions about the prophet\u2019s stance on apostasy.\n\nAccording to several sayings attributed to him in the Sunna, Mohammed did call for apostates to be killed. \u201cHe who changes his religion, kill him,\u201d the prophet said, according to one hadith, or story about his life.\n\nBut other stories contradict that teaching.\n\nIn the seventh century, for example, Mohammed, as leader of the growing Muslim community, brokered a truce with the Qurayshites, a competing religious tribe.\n\nIn the Truce of Hudaybiyyah, Mohammed agreed that if any Qurayshite came to join the Muslim community, he would not accept them.\n\nOn the other hand, Muslims were permitted to join the Qurayshites, no questions asked, no executions threatened.\n\nMoreover, lots of Muslim coverts abandoned Islam during the prophet\u2019s life, and he never sentenced one to death.\n\nThe Sahih al-Bukhari, one of the most famous collections of Sunna, contains an illustrative example.\n\nA Bedouin man pledged allegiance to God and the prophet, only to later inform Mohammed that he wanted to cancel his pledge.\n\nAfter the prophet refused three times to accept his cancellation, the Bedouin simply moved to another town.\n\nThe prophet did not order his execution despite such clear and undisputed apostasy. And there are many other examples like this in the Muslim historical literature.\n\nThe conflicting stories and lessons from Mohammed's life is one reason why the Sunna is not considered as authoritative a source of Islamic law as the Quran.\n\nSo, why is apostasy a capital crime in countries like Sudan?\n\nMohammed preached a message of unity and social justice, and his religious community welcomed believers regardless of tribe, color, race, ethnicity, social status or gender.\n\nAt the same time, the prophet\u2019s growing tribe frequently battled outsiders, from competing Arabian religious tribes to Jewish groups.\n\nThat means a Muslim who decided to abandon his religion was not simply making a personal choice to follow another God. He was turning his back on his tribe at a time of almost perpetual war.\n\nSo, you can see why early Muslim jurists and leaders wanted to discourage conversions. To them, it was an act of treason against the community. It was a political crime and not a restriction upon one\u2019s freedom of conscience.\n\nA majority of early Muslim jurists thus concluded that male apostates should receive the death penalty. For women, the main schools of Islamic law don\u2019t agree. Some say female apostates should be killed. Others argue that she should be imprisoned until she returns to Islam.\n\nStill, many prominent contemporary Muslim scholars have argued that apostasy should never carry the death penalty except in cases where converts take up arms against Muslims.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that nations like Sudan have gotten the message, though. And while Meriam Ibrahim is undoubtedly the victim of harsh human judges, there are also larger cultural forces at play.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the fact remains that the Quran without a doubt supports religious freedom. Allah the most merciful and wise said it best: \u201cThere is no compulsion in religion.\u201d\n\nAnd that should be last word.\n\nAbed Awad is an attorney, a national Islamic law expert and an adjunct law professor at Rutgers Law School and Pace Law School.
