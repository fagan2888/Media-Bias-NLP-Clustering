LAS VEGAS (AP) — Bruno Mars closed the Rock In Rio USA festival with an electrifying and upbeat performance that ended with his latest hit, “Uptown Funk!”

Mars was energetic as usual Saturday night in Las Vegas, kicking off his set on the drums. He went on to perform the likable “Locked Out of Heaven” as fireworks burst from the stage.
