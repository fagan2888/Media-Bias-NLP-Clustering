Mike Lee\n\n(Sentinel, 244 pages, $27.95)\n\nSadly, the American public has become disconnected from its founding document, the Constitution. Knowledge of civics is so deplorable that few people can identify the three branches of government, let alone the constitutional bases for them. Most Americans have never read the Constitution. Even law students studying Constitutional Law learn mainly about Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Constitution\u2014and arcane \u201ctheories\u201d of interpretation\u2014 not the actual text. This ignorance has permitted the Supreme Court (and elected officials) to manipulate the Constitution, in the process allowing the Leviathan state to expand beyond the narrow limits intended by the Framers.\n\nSenator Mike Lee (R-Utah) intends to correct that with his fine new book, Our Lost Constitution. The book is primarily directed at a lay audience, in the nature of the essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in 1787-88, popularly known as The Federalist Papers. Those essays, published in newspapers in the states critical to ratification of the freshly-drafted Constitution, engaged the public in an intelligent conversation about the structure and operation of the federal government. Lee seeks to begin a similar dialogue, regarding how far we have strayed from the original understanding.\n\nAlas, since the Constitution was ratified in 1789, key provisions have been ignored and distorted. Lee, son of former Solicitor General and founding BYU law school dean Rex Lee, and a legal scholar in his own right, aims to restore the \u201cLost Constitution\u201d by identifying some of these errors and their consequences. He focuses on five clauses that have been neglected or misconstrued: the \u201corigination clause\u201d in Article I, Section 7, which requires that all tax bills originate in the House of Representatives; the \u201clegislative powers\u201d clause of Article I, Section 1, which confers all authority to enact legislation on the Congress; the \u201cestablishment clause\u201d of the First Amendment, which bars Congress from establishing a religion; the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of privacy against governmental intrusion; and the Tenth Amendment\u2019s reservation to the states of all powers not delegated to the federal government. Lee devotes a chapter to each of these \u201cLost Clauses.\u201d\n\nA generation raised to believe that the only important provisions in the Constitution pertain to free speech and \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d may be surprised to learn that Founding Fathers had an elaborate, and carefully balanced, structure in mind. The Constitution granted limited powers to the federal government, and then warily allocated them among the three branches, to restrain abuses and provide accountability to the people. Over the years, the Supreme Court has circumvented those limits and altered that structure by neglect and, at times, outright fabrication. With interesting profiles and colorful anecdotes, Lee provides an engaging history lesson for each of his \u201cLost Clauses,\u201d and explains the public policy significance of the Court\u2019s departure from the text. Predictably, these errors have invariably expanded the size and power of the federal government, encroaching upon individual liberty.\n\nFor example, the requirement that the House (members of which are elected based on the states\u2019 population) originate all federal tax bills was an important compromise\u2014brokered in Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin\u2014between large and small states. Yet in enacting the disastrous Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid overcame the lack of political support by commandeering an unrelated bill (H.R. 3950) in the Senate, gutting it, and then \u201camending\u201d it to incorporate the monstrosity we have come to call Obamacare, complete with at least 17 tax provisions. Fittingly, Obamacare was literally born in violation of the Constitution\u2019s checks and balances.\n\nCongress is entrusted with passing all legislation because it is politically accountable to the people at regular intervals. The Framers deemed this an essential bulwark against tyranny. Yet we now drown in an ocean of administrative regulations\u2014equivalent to legislation in every way, civil and criminal\u2014promulgated by unaccountable and entrenched bureaucrats at hundreds of federal agencies, to whom Congress has \u201cdelegated\u201d rulemaking authority. Lee states that \u201cmost laws are now written and promulgated by executive agencies, not by Congress,\u201d with annual compliance costs estimated as high as $2 trillion! Even the courts have abdicated review of administrative agency regulations, under the deferential Chevron standard. The Founding Fathers would be appalled.\n\nNo provision in the Constitution has been interpreted more erroneously than the First Amendment\u2019s \u201cestablishment clause,\u201d the meaning of which has been inverted. The mythical \u201cwall of separation\u201d between church and state\u2014unknown at the founding\u2014was concocted in 1947 at the behest of the rabidly anti-Catholic former Klansman (and U.S. Senator from Alabama), Justice Hugo Black in Everson v. Board of Education. \u201cThe result,\u201d Lee explains, \u201cwas one of the most transparently misleading and historically inaccurate opinions in Supreme Court history.\u201d Black\u2019s goal was to cripple state support for parochial schools, and he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. The Everson holding has been extended to ban voluntary prayer from schools, the Ten Commandments from courthouses, and nativity cr\u00e8ches from public squares. As Lee notes, a constitutional provision applicable only to Congress, designed to empower the states, has instead been interpreted to restrict their autonomy.\n\nFew provisions were as important to the early colonists as the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections against unlawful searches and seizures. King George III greatly abused his subjects, and especially disregarded the sanctity and security of their homes. When James Madison went about drafting the Bill of Rights in 1789, the requirement of a general warrant to justify a government search was a central concern. However, in recent years, the exigencies of \u201cnational security\u201d have led to a proliferation of laws that permit warrantless access to citizens\u2019 personal information (including telephone records) by agencies such as the NSA. The Framers knew that unchecked government power will be abused, as the IRS has repeatedly demonstrated.\n\nLee\u2019s final example, the neutering of the Tenth Amendment, has reduced the 50 sovereign states to the status of mere appendages to the federal government. The visionary delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia would not recognize the bloated monolith\u2014begat by the New Deal and engorged ever since\u2014the national government has become. Congress has asserted essentially unlimited power to regulate pursuant to the \u201ccommerce clause\u201d of Article I, Section 8. The Supreme Court\u2019s ignominious acquiescence to this overreach began in 1937 and continues to this day, with Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 2012 decision in NFIB v. Sebelius upholding Obamacare being the latest example. Congress has become untethered from its constitutional limits.\n\nThe second (and shorter) part of Lee\u2019s book is devoted to solutions, and he spends a chapter apiece on the roles of courts, legislators, and voters in reclaiming the Constitution. Lee\u2019s prescriptions here are hopeful, but vague and possibly unrealistic. The essential first step is to restore the political will for reform, which requires public education and thoughtful dialogue. The Federalist Papers guided public debate 230 years ago, and Lee\u2019s book could prompt a renewed (and overdue) dialogue today. If the people are ever going to \u201ctake back\u201d their country and insist upon a federal government whose powers are limited in the manner intended by the Framers\u2014as set forth in the \u201cLost Constitution\u201d\u2014they need to begin by electing a President committed to that vision. Congress, which lacks the resolve to even pass a balanced budget, is not going to reform itself. (Ultimately, we need a five-person majority on the Supreme Court dedicated to reclaiming the Constitution.)\n\nAlthough Senator Mike Lee is not a candidate for President in 2016, his friend and colleague Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is. Whoever is elected President, the road to reclaiming the \u201cLost Constitution\u201d could begin by appointing Lee (or a serious constitutionalist like him) to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court\u2019s job is to enforce the Constitution, as written and ratified. Much of our current predicament owes to the Court\u2019s failure discharge that responsibility in a principled manner. Lee\u2019s book is a guide to much-needed reform\u2014a radically smaller federal government limited by the Constitution. Our Lost Constitution deserves to be widely read, and discussed, and heeded.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1f8\"", "article_summary": "The Federalist Papers guided public debate 230 years ago, and Lee\u2019s book could prompt a renewed (and overdue) dialogue today.\nThe book is primarily directed at a lay audience, in the nature of the essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in 1787-88, popularly known as The Federalist Papers.\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has circumvented those limits and altered that structure by neglect and, at times, outright fabrication.\nEven law students studying Constitutional Law learn mainly about Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Constitution\u2014and arcane \u201ctheories\u201d of interpretation\u2014 not the actual text.\nOur Lost Constitution deserves to be widely read, and discussed, and heeded."}
