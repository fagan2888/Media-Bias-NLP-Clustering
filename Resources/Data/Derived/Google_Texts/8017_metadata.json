If surgery is recommended, which a top Arizona physician advised on Sunday, then Gonzalez will have the procedure done either later this month or immediately following the season. He\u2019s leaning heavily toward surgery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my decision. I am probably going to have it regardless of what he says. It\u2019s just not getting any better,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI want to be ready for spring training.\u201d\n\nDr. Don Sheridan, a hand specialist used by the Diamondbacks, examined Gonzalez when he suffered the initial injury July 7 in Phoenix during the follow-through on his swing. After a checkup Sunday, Sheridan recommended surgery, according to Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez will seek a second opinion in Cleveland, but sounded Sunday as though his mind is made up after weighing multiple scenarios.\n\nIt\u2019s a risk, he said, counting on rest to fix the injury given how little progress he\u2019s had over the past two months. And if time off doesn\u2019t work, that only delays surgery which could jeopardize the start of next season.\n\nThe surgery, however, is not a simple procedure. Gonzalez would have the ligament replaced and a pin inserted to stabilize the finger for six to eight weeks. When the pin is removed, aggressive therapy would follow for roughly two months to help him regain most of his flexibility, Rockies trainer Keith Dugger said. It would leave him ready to swing a bat in early January, barring any setbacks.\n\n\u201cI know I have to make some adjustments, but I don\u2019t want to completely change who I am as a hitter. I swing a certain way. I don\u2019t choke up and hit singles. That\u2019s not me,\u201d said Gonzalez, who last homered July 20. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have surgery, but my finger isn\u2019t allowing me to swing. I have had a lot of exams, MRIs, and it\u2019s not stronger. I really think I will have the surgery. It\u2019s my best option to get it better.\u201d\n\nGonzalez is hitting .302 with 26 home runs, 49 extra-base hits and 70 RBIs in 109 games. He remains on the active roster, and could be used as a defensive replacement until a date for surgery is set.\n\nTroy E.
