Dear Readers,

We hope you’ve enjoyed reading this blog as much as we’ve enjoyed reporting and writing it, but it’s time for the next stage in Belief’s evolution.

Like the rest of our colleagues at CNN, we’re “going there” … to a spiffy new home: http://www.cnn.com/specials/belief.

The new site will have the same insightful analysis and in-depth reporting that you’re used to, but it will also enable us — and, more importantly, you — to navigate through a wider array of videos, articles and columns from our team of reporters and editors around the globe.

What’s more, the design will allow you to comfortably read Belief’s content whether you’re strap-hanging on a subway, sitting at a desktop, or settling in for a long read on your tablet.

We hope ardent atheists, devout believers and every array of religion in between will join us on a pilgrimage to the new sanctuary … er, site. And please let us know what you think on Twitter: @CNNBelief.

Yours in gratitude,

Daniel Burke and Eric Marrapodi
