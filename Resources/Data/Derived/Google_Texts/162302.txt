One man’s terrible fan-fiction has made the world a better place, thanks to Jimmy Kimmel, who wrote a script starring himself as Ross and then organized a mini-“Friends” reunion on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” With it, he brought Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow and Courteney Cox back together as Rachel, Phoebe and Monica and made the rest of us smile.

Since it’s Kimmels’s scripted fantasy, of course the premise of the sketch was his love-making abilities. He led guest Jennifer Aniston over to an incredible replica of the “Friends” set and forced her to read the intentionally bad script as Rachel. Aniston was not amused, however, and got angrier and angrier as the sketch went on because she is anti-fun and anti-nostalgia, I guess. Everyone else was in pretty high spirits, though.
