(CHRISTIAN TODAY) A Texas mom has filed a lawsuit against a hospital over its decision to discontinue providing life-sustaining treatment to her son, calling it “in the best interest of the patient.”

Evelyn Kelly sued Houston Methodist Hospital over the case of his son Christopher Dunn, 46, who has been confined in the hospital for two months after a mass of tissue was found in his pancreas. The non-cancerous mass has affected his small intestine, liver and kidneys, according to Christian News Network.

Dunn worked as a sheriff’s deputy but had no insurance when he was hospitalised. He’s on a ventilator but can communicate with hand gestures or moving his head.

Last Nov. 13, J. Richard Cheney, head of the hospital’s bioethics committee, wrote a letter to Kelly and Dunn to say that “the committee has decided that life-sustaining treatment is medically inappropriate for Chris and that all treatments other than those needed to keep him comfortable should be discontinued and withheld.”
