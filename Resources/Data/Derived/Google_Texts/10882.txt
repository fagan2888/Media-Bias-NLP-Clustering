One of the two lucky winners in George R.R. Martin’s “martyr” contest has been announced: Thirty year-old Facebook employee Dave Goldblatt will be written into the author’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series only to meet a gruesome, untimely death.

Martin announced the contest June 5, inviting fans to help him raise money for the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe near his home in New Mexico in exchange for face time with the author — and, the highest prize at $20,000 is the creation os a character of any existing race that will be killed off.

“I’m just lucky enough to be in a position to do this,” Goldblatt told ABC News upon the announcement. “Obviously, the money is going to charity, so it’s an added bonus. I didn’t immediately seek to help wolf sanctuaries, but the more I read about the charities, I learned it was a worthwhile cause.”
