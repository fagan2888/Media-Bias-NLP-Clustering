Several tennis players competed for the win today, but they aren't your average competitors

It's important to stay active no matter what, and it's events like this, the Q.C.A. Adaptive Sports' third annual wheelchair tennis tournament, that inspire even those confined to wheelchairs to get out and stay active.

"Oh it's a lot of fun, it's a lot of fun to see other people and get out there and try to do your best," said David Moore, a first time tournament player.

Players in wheelchairs come to serve up their best game, and organizer Robert Juarez wants to inspire others to do the same.

"We're just trying to get the word out and get people active that are in chairs," Juarez said.

They get the opportunity to play singles and doubles, and players also get the chance to connect with others who have similar disabilities: Disabilities they're overcoming one volley at a time.

"Oh to get outside and do anything active, it's better than sitting around the house, you know, doing something," said Darin Mink, a first time tournament player.

And the tennis tournament is just the tip of the iceberg for Q.C.A. Adaptive Sports.

"We've started adaptive rowing, tennis, softball, and we're doing road, uh, local road races, um, with individuals in their own chairs or with a sport chair," Juarez said.

Players say staying active aids in the healing process, and they also plan on doing other events put on by Q.C.A. Adaptive Sports.
