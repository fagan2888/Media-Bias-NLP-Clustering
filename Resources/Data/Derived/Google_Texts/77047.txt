A man wearing a suicide belt walked into an Iraqi soccer stadium Friday and blew himself up -- killing at least 41 people and wounding more than 100 others, security officials said.

A crowd had gathered for a ceremony to mark a championship for a popular local soccer team when the bomb exploded, the head of the Babil province security committee, Baydhan al Hamdani, told CNN.

A video posted on YouTube showed soccer players approaching a table holding trophies before an explosion occurred. CNN could not independently authenticate the video.

The attacker struck at al-Shuhadaa stadium in the Babil province city of Iskandariya, roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Baghdad.

ISIS claimed responsibility, according to a statement posted online by supporters.

The special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General for Iraq, Jan Kubis, condemned the bombing by "Daesh," another term for ISIS.

"The evildoers are aiming their wrath at the innocent and vulnerable civilians," he said. "Today, Daesh committed yet another atrocity, targeting families who were enjoying their weekend attending a football game in their hometown. This abhorrent act deserves the strongest condemnation."

Kubis urged Iraqis to unite to thwart the terrorists' goals of inciting sectarian tensions in the country.

The U.S. State Department also spoke out.

"The United States condemns today's suicide bombing claimed by Daesh ... which killed and wounded dozens of Iraqis who had gathered to support a local football game," said a statement from Elizabeth Trudeau, director of the department's office of press relations.

Though the attacks in Europe have gained the attention of the West, the bulk of ISIS' brutal actions -- not to mention the vast majority of its active members -- are in the Middle East.
