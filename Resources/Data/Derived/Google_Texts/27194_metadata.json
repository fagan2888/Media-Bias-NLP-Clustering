They will not be admitting any new patients after that date. The patients already admitted will be discharged upon the completion of their treatment and care.\n\n\"It's just going to send health care somewhere else, which not only if it's here they spend other money at Walmart, gassing up,eating and things like that so it will have an effect,\" says Mayor Carr.\n\nPioneer Family and Pediatric Clinic and Pioneer Physical Therapy will remain open, but Newton County residents will have to seek emergency medical attention at surrounding hospitals.\n\n\"They've basically got three choices here. They've got Forest which is about 20 miles. Union, the same amount and Meridian a little over 20 miles,\" says Mayor Carr.\n\nWhile Newton County is losing a major healthcare department, roughly 130 people are losing their job as well. Mayor Carr says he is optimistic that someone will come in and occupy the building.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Pioneer Community Hospital has been fully operational since September 2010, but it announced this week it's closing Dec. 1.", "language": "english", "author": "Lindsey Jennings", "og": {"description": "Pioneer Community Hospital has been fully operational since September 2010, but it announced this week it's closing Dec. 1.", "title": "Pioneer Community Hospital Announces Closure", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Pioneer-Community-Hospital-Closing--347949581.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/8DE/5DD/8DE5DD4D7AA2462689D52BD9AD21FF4A", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/CD7/02E/CD702E5CE1464715A8148D3C75ED33BF.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Pioneer Community Hospital has been fully operational since September 2010, but it announced this week it's closing Dec. 1.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Pioneer-Community-Hospital-Closing--347949581.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Newton+Hospital.jpg", "title": "Pioneer Community Hospital Announces Closure", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Pioneer Community Hospital Announces Closure", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Pioneer Community Hospital Announces Closure"}, "article_summary": "Pioneer Community Hospital has been fully operational since September 2010, but it announced this week it's closing Dec. 1.\nThe hospital's emergency department will be closing on December 1, 2015.\nPioneer Family and Pediatric Clinic and Pioneer Physical Therapy will remain open, but Newton County residents will have to seek emergency medical attention at surrounding hospitals.\nNewton Mayor David Carr says the reason for the closure is due to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' reversal of the original interpretation that allowed the facility to remain operational.\nWhile Newton County is losing a major healthcare department, roughly 130 people are losing their job as well."}
