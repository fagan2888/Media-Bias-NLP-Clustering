A total of 68 percent of healthcare leaders reject the Republican Party’s approach to dismantling the healthcare law, while about one-third said they’d take a wait-and-see approach. Republicans in Congress have vowed to release a healthcare plan before the Republican National Convention in July.

Healthcare leaders say they stand behind ObamaCare in far greater numbers than voters: A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 35 percent of people supported repealing the law, with another 14 percent who support scaling back its provisions.

The CEO group also reject an approach from Democrats — made popular recently by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders wins over W.Va. superdelegate Boxer: Sanders appeals to young voters with grandpa effect The Trail 2016: Interleague play MORE — to create a single-payer system.

Sixty-two percent of CEOs said they supported scrapping the private insurance market to make way for a Medicare-for-all system — nearly the same figure who are opposed to repealing ObamaCare.

The quarterly survey from Modern Healthcare includes about 90 healthcare leaders at hospitals, insurance companies, physician groups, trade associations and other not-for-profit advocacy groups.
