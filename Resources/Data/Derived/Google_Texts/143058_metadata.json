There is no tax associated with the ballot question.\n\nWhat supporters say: The Boulder Valley School District, as a result of the 2006 voter approved bond, built about 100 miles of conduit and fiber. While some parts of the fiber network are fully committed, other parts have up to 30 percent of capacity available for leasing. Excess fiber could be leased to generate new revenue to benefit students. The district also could partner with the cities it serves to help provide regional broadband solutions or provide access in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nWhat opponents say: No formal opposition. Generally, opponents say the private sector is providing adequate Internet service and providing broadband service isn't a good use of school district resources.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948141/boulder-valley-school-district-question-3a-leasing-broadband", "sailthru.author": "Camera staff", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28948141:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-10T18:22:50-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "What it asks: \"Without increasing taxes, shall Boulder Valley School District No. RE-2 be authorized to lease current excess capacity on its existing fiber optic networks or to otherwise provide high-speed Internet services (advanced services), telecommunications services, and/or cable television services, including any new and improved high bandwidth services based on future technologies, to schools, libraries, residents, businesses, nonprofit entities, and other users or subscribers of such", "title": "Boulder Valley School District Question 3A: Leasing broadband", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948141/boulder-valley-school-district-question-3a-leasing-broadband", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-10-10T18:23:03-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-09T18:22:34-0600", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "byline": "Camera staff", "pubDate": "2015-10-10T18:25:03-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-10T18:22:50-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Valley School District Question 3A: Leasing broadband", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Election", "description": "What it asks: \"Without increasing taxes, shall Boulder Valley School District No. RE-2 be authorized to lease current excess capacity on its existing fiber optic networks or to otherwise provide high-speed Internet services (advanced services), telecommunications services, and/or cable television services, including any new and improved high bandwidth services based on future technologies, to schools, libraries, residents, businesses, nonprofit entities, and other users or subscribers of such", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948141/boulder-valley-school-district-question-3a-leasing-broadband", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "What it asks: \"Without increasing taxes, shall Boulder Valley School District No. RE-2 be authorized to lease current excess capacity on its existing fiber optic networks or to otherwise provide high-speed Internet services (advanced services), telecommunications services, and/or cable television services, including any new and improved high bandwidth services based on future technologies, to schools, libraries, residents, businesses, nonprofit entities, and other users or subscribers of such", "title": "Boulder Valley School District Question 3A: Leasing broadband"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "What it asks: \"Without increasing taxes, shall Boulder Valley School District No.\nWhat supporters say: The Boulder Valley School District, as a result of the 2006 voter approved bond, built about 100 miles of conduit and fiber.\nWhat it means: Boulder Valley is asking voters to exempt the district from a 2005 state law that limits local governments and school districts from offering Internet services.\nGenerally, opponents say the private sector is providing adequate Internet service and providing broadband service isn't a good use of school district resources.\nThe district also could partner with the cities it serves to help provide regional broadband solutions or provide access in low-income neighborhoods."}
