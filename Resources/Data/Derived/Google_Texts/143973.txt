Congratulations go out to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was named Monday as one of Time magazine’s 2013 “Person of the Year” finalists.

The freshman Republican, who gained notoriety after his 21-hour marathon speech on the Senate floor over the Affordable Care Act, is joined on the list along side Syrian President Bashar Assad, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Pope Francis and National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. The full list is available here.

President Barack Obama, who was chosen in both 2008 and 2012, is also on the 2013 list. Only former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been chosen three times.

The nominees were announced on NBC‘s “TODAY” show Monday morning by Time Managing Editor Nancy Gibbs, and the winner will be announced Wednesday morning.

Time magazine has been selecting a “Man of the Year” since 1927 in recognition of the person whom the magazine’s editors believe most influenced the news in the previous year. Egyptian General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, who led the charge to topple the the first democratically-elected government in the Arab world’s most populous nation, was the winner of the Time.com online poll conducted last week.

The “TODAY” show is also holding their own contest to see who should be crowned “Person of the Year.”
