FOREST CITY, Iowa – The nation’s largest health care provider announced this week they would no longer provide plans on Iowa’s Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

UnitedHealthcare is one of three private companies that are currently covering those on Medicaid in Iowa, but come 2017, they will no longer offer insurance on the state exchange. That will force nearly 9,000 people to find a new provider, which has some concerned.

“Obviously it’s a shakeup and there are a lot of people impacted. Iowa certainly is part of it. Iowa is fortunate to have a good health care in the state, whether that’s competitive or not that’s a challenge people are facing. I think premiums are out of control,” said Lee Lambert, director of insurance Services at MBT Bank.

UnitedHealthcare says they’re dropping out because of major financial losses. Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield will be taking their place.
