Ted Cruz (R-Texas) , who has been sharply criticized by fellow Republicans for leading Republicans to partially shut down the government to block the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \u201cNot only isn't it working, it is not working badly.\u201dDespite his displeasure with the law, Cruz did not pile on with criticism over the technical glitches with the federal insurance exchange website. \u201cThey'll get the technical things worked out,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cEventually, they'll hire a programmer who can find his rear end with both hands.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGenerally, I think the TMA is not red or blue\u2014we're more purple,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Brotherton, president of the TMA.\n\n\n\nBrotherton introduced Cruz as someone who has gained notoriety for \u201cdefending his principles.\u201d He told Modern Healthcare that \u201cit's up to individuals if they agree with those principles.\u201d He said he personally would have liked Cruz to have spent more time talking about healthcare reforms he supported rather than focusing on what he was against.\n\n\n\nThe TMA has published a long list of changes it wants to see in the law, including eliminating the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board, repealing provisions that limit physician ownership of hospitals, and adding limits on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice suits. http://www.texmed.org/template.aspx?id=20404\n\n\n\nCruz said he didn't agree with those who argue for letting Obamacare fail on its own.

The American Medical Association generally supports the basic elements of the ACA but has faced strong resistance from its more conservative members and state medical societies, who have tried to reverse the AMA's position backing the individual mandate. A recent Medical Group Management Association Survey found that physicians are wary about participating in health plans offered on the state insurance exchanges.\u201cGenerally, I think the TMA is not red or blue\u2014we're more purple,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Brotherton, president of the TMA.Brotherton introduced Cruz as someone who has gained notoriety for \u201cdefending his principles.\u201d He told Modern Healthcare that \u201cit's up to individuals if they agree with those principles.\u201d He said he personally would have liked Cruz to have spent more time talking about healthcare reforms he supported rather than focusing on what he was against.The TMA has published a long list of changes it wants to see in the law, including eliminating the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board, repealing provisions that limit physician ownership of hospitals, and adding limits on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice suits. http://www.texmed.org/template.aspx?id=20404Cruz said he didn't agree with those who argue for letting Obamacare fail on its own.

He did not mention that Hoffa has called on Cruz and others to stop taking concerns outlined in the letter out of context to bolster their own arguments.If the ACA is repealed, Cruz said it should be replaced with legislation that allows the interstate sale of health insurance, expansion of health savings accounts and de-linking health insurance from employment, which are longstanding elements of Republican health policy proposals.
