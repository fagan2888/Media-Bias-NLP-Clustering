Mike Harmon upset Kentucky Auditor Adam Edelen in the Nov. 3 election, the Democrats lost more than just someone in a \u201cwatchdog\u201d office who could keep an eye on the administration of incoming Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nThey lost the best hope for a U.S. Senate candidate to challenge Rand Paul and lead the ticket in a year that they desperately need some top-of-the-ticket pizzazz to inspire voters to come out for down-ticket candidates who can help them hold onto the state House of Representatives.\n\nEdelen, who until Election Day appeared to be gearing up to challenge Paul, said he hopes to one day resume his political career but he\u2019s headed back into the private sector for now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for bluer skies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe environment is just not conducive to electing Democrats statewide. \u2026 It\u2019s a very difficult environment for Democrats.\u201d\n\nPatrick Hughes, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said he\u2019s hopeful that the party will be able to come up with a top-tier candidate to challenge Paul, who Democrats believe is weakened by a presidential run that has faltered.\n\nBut Hughes admits that he\u2019s not sure who that might be.\n\n\u201cWe have some strong candidates who might be able to take advantage of some excitement on the national level,\u201d he said.\n\nTalk in the party has largely settled around actress Ashley Judd and state Veterans Affairs Commissioner Heather French Henry, and there are some in the party who are holding out hope that some wealthy business person who\u2019s not been involved in politics before will step forward.\n\nLouisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who lost the Democratic primary to challenge Sen. Mitch McConnell in 2008, is also often mentioned as a possible challenger.\n\nHenry said she\u2019s not even thinking about the race right now and that she wants to get to Dec. 8 when Bevin will be sworn in and her appointment ends. (It\u2019s unlikely that Bevin would reappoint her to the post after he was critical in May of Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s appointment of her.)\n\n\u201cThe idea that we would have a veterans\u2019 administration not run by a veteran, for starters, is a little bit odd to me,\u201d he said six months ago. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between the civilian sector and the military ranks. \u2026 We need somebody in charge of the veterans\u2019 affairs and the things that affect us as veterans that has literally walked or rucked in our boots.\u201d\n\nHenry said her plan is to head back to her foundation that helps veterans when her job as commissioner ends. Though she didn\u2019t rule out a run completely, she said a federal office may not be the best fit for her now.\n\n\u201cMy daughters are 12 and 14 and the idea of being gone, you know, three to four days a week \u2026 those are very impressionable times and years for my daughters, so my family would be the biggest reason for my decision to not seek a federal office,\u201d she said.\n\nJudd\u2019s publicist didn\u2019t return an email seeking comment.\n\nFischer doesn\u2019t seem eager to jump into the race. \u201cThe mayor enjoys being mayor,\u201d said Chris Poynter, his spokesman.\n\nRepublicans have all the momentum in the state, having won races for governor and lieutenant governor, treasurer, auditor and agriculture commissioner in the November election and having convinced state Rep. Denny Butler, of Louisville, to join the GOP in recent weeks.\n\nThey have reduced the Democratic majority in the House to 53-47 and hope to flip control of the chamber for the first time in nearly 100 years during the November elections.\n\nHughes said the party\u2019s biggest concern is to win two upcoming special elections that will be needed to replace state Reps. Ryan Quarles and Harmon, both Republicans who won races for agriculture commissioner and auditor.\n\nIf they can do that, they hope they can slow GOP momentum that has shifted the state from a Democratic to Republican stronghold over the last 25 years.\n\nHe argues that the state House and U.S. Senate races are not intertwined because they will be run on different issues. \u201cAs it relates to the U.S. Senate campaign, I think that\u2019s independently important for the Democrats to field a candidate, and it has to be a competitive candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while Hughes said it\u2019s important to have a strong Democrat running for the Senate, it\u2019s not nearly as important for down-ticket races as it was in 2014 when Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes tied up Sen. Mitch McConnell and forced him to spend his time focusing on his re-election rather than raising money for state House candidates.\n\n\u201cShe was able to draw the attention of Sen. McConnell and his machine away from the House,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be possible this go-round because Sen. McConnell isn\u2019t going to be occupied with that and we\u2019d be naive to think he isn\u2019t interested with what happens with the House races.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Louisville, said he believes it\u2019s important for Democrats to find a strong candidate but he\u2019s not certain that will be the determining factor when it comes to control of the state House.\n\nFor one thing, he said that Hillary Clinton is likely to be the Democratic Presidential nominee and that former President Bill Clinton has assured him that Hillary Clinton would campaign in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cI talked to the president and they are going to be active here,\u201d Yarmuth said.\n\nEven if Clinton doesn\u2019t spend heavily to win in Kentucky, large swaths of Kentucky will see her ads because she will compete in Indiana and Ohio and will be forced to buy air time on Louisville and Cincinnati television, Yarmuth said.\n\nWithout a strong candidate for U.S. Senate spending heavily in the state, \u201cit makes it more difficult\u201d for the Democrats to hold onto the state House. Bevin\u2019s performance is really what\u2019s most important, Yarmuth said.\n\n\u201cIf this administration works well, it will make it harder for us. If it\u2019s a train wreck it makes it easier,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at 502-582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
