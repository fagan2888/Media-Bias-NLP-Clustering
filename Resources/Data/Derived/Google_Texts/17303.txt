WASHINGTON — An Illinois ad targeting same-sex couples advising them to get enrolled in health care under the Affordable Care Act aired in the state during the Golden Globe Awards Sunday night, the Washington Post reports.

Get Covered Illinois paid for the ad, which showed residents Jake and Allen — a real couple who are friends with the commercial’s director, the Post reports — recount how they were able to get coverage prior to Jake getting appendicitis.

“Having affordable care was sincerely a life-saving moment,” Jake said in the ad.

The ad ran during prime time in Chicago last week and is also slated to run in other markets throughout the state, the Post article said. It’s part of the “National LGBT Outreach and Enrollment Week” effort from the Obama administration and its allies that was scheduled to launch this week. Several agencies such as Out2Enroll and the Center for American Progress are collaborating on the effort, the Post said.

Nationally, LGBT advocates will be touting a new Health and Human Services policy that took effect Jan. 1, which states that legally married same-sex couples have access to the same plans a straight couple would in every state, even if the state doesn’t recognize the couple’s marriage, the Post reports. Out2Enroll has also launched a new Web tool during the law’s second enrollment period where individuals can put in their zip code and identify trained LGBT-friendly assisters in their region.

Recent research from CAP shows the uninsured rate among low- and middle-income LGBT people who are potentially eligible for federal subsidies declined by almost a quarter between 2013 and 2014, from 34 percent to 26 percent uninsured, the Post article notes.
