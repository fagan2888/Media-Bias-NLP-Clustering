San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif. The event is considered the largest collegiate forensics competition in the West.\n\nThat marked the fourth time this semester the students have earned first-place honors at major collegiate competitions designed to help young people hone their public-speaking skills.\n\nGCU\u2019s squad finished first in the individual events sweepstakes and second place overall. Teams from UCLA, USC, Azusa Pacific University and Biola University \u2014 plus those from top-ranked speech and debate schools such as the University of Utah, Eastern Michigan University and California State University, Long Beach \u2014 were among the more than 40 finishing behind GCU.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of this tournament, and the level of competition we faced, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of how we performed,\u201d said Regan, who is in his second year as a GCU instructor and director of the 15-member speech and debate club.\n\n\u201cAt this tournament last year we took fifth place, so it demonstrates just how much our team has progressed,\u201d Regan said.\n\nGCU student standouts included Zachary Kuykendall (gold medal in varsity International Public Debate Association debate) and sisters Victoria and Chloe Saunders (first place in varsity duo interpretation). Students JilliAnna Davis, Emmett Foster, Thomas Rotering, Ashlyn Tupper and Bradlee Waldraff earned Top 5 places in several other events, including extemporaneous speaking, persuasive speaking and parliamentary debate.\n\nIn November, the team finished in first place, ahead of teams from Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University, in individual events among four-year universities at the Grossmont College-Griffin Invitational in California.\n\nAlso last month, it hosted a public debate with ASU student speech and debate club members at GCU\u2019s Student Union. Two GCU students argued the likelihood of the Republican Party retaking the U.S. Senate majority in last month\u2019s elections, while ASU\u2019s duo argued why Democrats would retain control. The public debate was well attended and helped generate attention for the club, which has evolved rapidly since its origins in GCU\u2019s former College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe club now is part of the new College of Humanities and Social Sciences, though students have a range of majors, rather than just the communications program or other humanities programs.\n\nRotering, 19, a sophomore biology pre-physican assistant major, said he got involved with GCU speech and debate to sharpen his public speaking and analytical skills.\n\nLast year, students such as Jasmine Richardson, who has since graduated, earned more honors in speech events. Richardson won awards for her passionate prose interpretation of the harrowing autobiography, \u201cLeft to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,\u201d by Immacul\u00e9e Ilibagiza, who survived the 1994 genocide in her native country by hiding for 91 days in the bathroom of a local pastor\u2019s home.\n\nThe results of last weekend\u2019s competition in California showed GCU\u2019s team is expanding its range.\n\n\u201cIt was a really big win for us,\u201d said Rotering, who also earned a judge\u2019s honor for eloquence in debate. As a duo in parliamentary debate, he and Kuykendall responded to challenging subjects related to foreign affairs, such as military interventions in the Middle East and other global conflicts.\n\n\u201cIt was encouraging that the work we\u2019ve done all semester is paying off, especially in debate,\u201d Rotering said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had success in debate, but that was probably our biggest win against top schools that put a lot of resources into debate.\u201d\n\nRotering said addressing issues such as the Affordable Care Act during competitions has helped expand his knowledge of complex issues that likely will impact his career. In debate events, students often are challenged to defend a position that might not match their personal beliefs and to debunk others, through prepared or impromptu styles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really increased my education about different people and the perspectives they have,\u201d Rotering said.\n\nReach Michael Ferraresi at 602-639-7030 or michael.ferraresi@gcu.edu.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "GCU Today", "description": "This weekend marked the fourth time this semester that GCU\u2019s student speech and debate team earned first-place honors at a major collegiate forensics competition.
