This week, GoLocal sat down Dr. Michael Fine, Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH), about the major challenges -- and opportunities -- currently facing Rhode Island.\n\nYou gave your first State of the State this week. In recent years, what have been the major changes you\u2019ve seen in health issues \u2013and concerns--facing Rhode Islanders?\n\nThe economy! And not enough pride in our strong communities, which is what is unique about Rhode Island. In order for there to be optimal health, and equal life chances for all Rhode Islanders, we need to have healthy functional families and communities made up of people who take care of one another, and who participate in the democratic process. We have an immediate serious concern about drug and alcohol addiction and drug overdose death that we need to come together to address right away.\n\n\n\nWhere do you see the opportunities for the State to achieve gains in public health?\n\nOur most significant opportunities are to eliminate smoking, and develop a system of primary care practices that provide all Rhode Islanders, and all Rhode Island communities, with world class primary care. Getting world class primary care to all Rhode Islanders will allow us to improve the public\u2019s health while reducing medical care cost, which in turn will allow us to invest in education, safe and healthy housing, the environment and safe streets, which turn out to be the things that matter most for health. Our other \u201copportunities\u201d (though emergency is a better word) is addressing drug overdose death. We also can and should be the first state in the nation to end new cases of HIV, which is what our Getting to Zero campaign is working hard at.\n\n\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges facing Rhode Island in making these possible?\n\nFirst, the imagination. We\u2019ve never seen a health care system (what we have is best described as a wealth extraction system) so it\u2019s hard to imagine one; and without being able to imagine a health care system, it\u2019s hard to advocate for one. The second major challenge is the enmeshed interests who profit from things as they are and are trying very hard to prevent change \u2013tobacco companies, pharmaceutical companies, industrial food producers, even health care facilities and health professionals. Change is hard. But the status quo has completely failed. Our medical wealth extraction system is draining the state and nation dry, and making optimal health for all impossible.\n\n\n\nWhat would you like Rhode Islanders to know, in terms of resources at HEALTH, that they should take advantage of?\n\nWe have the most mission-driven organization in Rhode Island \u2013 450 people and hundreds of volunteers, totally focused on protecting the health and safety of Rhode Islanders. Rhode Islanders should call us or come to our website first, whenever they have a health related question, a concern about a health professional\u2019s practice, a worry about the safety of a health care facility, or the safety of their food or water. We speak English and Spanish as well as many other languages.\n\nWhat is their plan to reduce the cost of health insurance in Rhode Island by 30 percent or more, and use affordable health insurance as a driver for our economy?\n\n\n\nTell us something nobody knows about you.\n\nI cut wood and write fiction on weekends. I\u2019ve had a beard since I was 19. I like to ride old Hondas on back country roads, and yes, I wear a helmet.\n\n\n\nRole model?\n\nMartin Luther King; Jack Geiger, MD; Bernard Lown, MD; Governor Lucius Garvin, MD; Jack Cunningham, MD; and Moses, not necessarily in that order.\n\n\n\nFavorite book?\n\nWar and Peace. Really, I reread it every few years.\n\n\n\nBest place to eat in Rhode Island?\n\nCindy\u2019s Diner in Scituate. Bob and Timmy\u2019s on Federal Hill.\n\n\n\nIf you weren\u2019t Director of HEALTH, what would you be?\n\nWriting fiction in Venice or in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, and/or practicing medicine part time in a Neighborhood Health Station, the VA or the ACI.\n\n\n\nHow do you go about staying healthy?\n\nI cut, haul and bring in 15 cords of wood a year. I\u2019m outside \u00bd an hour to an hour every day and 10 \u2013 12 hours on weekends. I drink water from a glass, and try to avoid simple carbohydrates in favor of fresh fruits and vegetables, but I\u2019m a stress eater and not as good as I\u2019d like to be. When I\u2019m not working 11 hour days I like to fast a day or two a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Slideshow: 13 Biggest Healthcare Stories in RI in 2013\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEnjoy this post?
