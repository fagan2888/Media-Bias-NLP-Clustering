Maybe the federal government’s decisions to set up a call center in Boise to help folks navigate the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act wasn’t such a good idea after all.

The good shepherds of Obamacare have been working with a private contractor, Maximus Inc., based in Reston, Va., to manage call centers for those seeking information about their insurance options under the act. One such center was located in Boise. Starting in October, troubles began to boil over at the center, located on a former Hewlett Packard manufacturing site.
