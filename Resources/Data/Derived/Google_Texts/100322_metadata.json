Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2013 not getting a hearing from the base.\u201cAs candidates drop down the polls and out of the presidential race, support for the Common Core national education standards has often become intertwined with their decline,\u201d McGroarty wrote in background information provided exclusively to The Hill.\u201cDue to the Common Core\u2019s deeper roots in an increasingly unpopular top-down ideology, a candidate\u2019s acceptance or rejection of the Core now serves as a leading indicator for determining whether he or she will ultimately have a chance at the nomination,\u201d he said.Nearly the entirety of the Republican presidential field is opposed to Common Core.However, some, like Bush, Kasich, Christie and Walker, had embraced the standards in the past. They\u2019ve since argued that Common Core has been corrupted by a federal government hell-bent on imposing it on local school districts, where many conservatives believe the power should lie.APP argues that it\u2019s not enough for the governors to qualify their past support for Common Core, or to argue that it\u2019s merely a set of higher standards that can act as an alternative to the status quo.\u201cIf a candidate is not willing to protect voters and their families from inordinate federal control in education, they are unlikely to be trusted to maintain a system of checks and balances in any area,\u201d McGroarty wrote.APP has singled out the four GOP governors, all of whom received grades of \u201cD\u201d or \u201cF\u201d on the issue from APP\u2019s advocacy arm American Principles in Action in an August report card, as evidence that Common Core has doomed or is damaging those who support Common Core or have advocated for it in the past.Bush, Kasich and Christie are mired in single-digit polling, while Walker dropped out of the race in September.Walker said on the campaign trail that he supports allowing districts to \u201copt out\u201d of the education standards, but was criticized by some for not advocating for full repeal.\u201cScott Walker is a prime example of how quickly an inconsistent stance on Common Core can kill a campaign,\u201d McGroarty wrote.After spending months atop the polls as the favorite to win the Iowa caucuses, Walker ended his campaign in August amid low polling numbers and spending woes.\u201cWalker\u2019s departure from the race came after heavy criticism for his position on the fence, a spot that he claimed not just with words but with misleading action,\u201d McGroarty said.Many Republicans have long-believed that Bush\u2019s past support for Common Core would present a major hurdle for him with the base.Common Core standards were developed after Bush left the Florida governor's mansion, but he has advocated for the education standards through his foundation.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bush has made his made his record on education reform a central selling point. He has sought to distance himself from Common Core, saying the federal government should play no role in the creation or implementation of education standards, and arguing that he supports higher standards no matter what form they come in.\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s spin used by Common Core supporters, McGroarty says.\n\n\n\nHe writes that Bush \u201chas made only minimal attempts to make his rhetoric sound more anti-Core,\u201d and points to a Bloomberg-Des Moines Register poll from earlier this year that found nearly two-thirds of likely caucus-goers in Iowa cited Common Core as either a deal-breaker or something they\u2019d consider in deciding whether to vote for Bush.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile he went out of his way at this year\u2019s Iowa State Fair to label the term \u2018Common Core\u2019 as \u2018poisonous,\u2019 national polling as well as polling in Iowa indicates that such fake-outs will not be enough to divert the attention of voters,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMcGroarty argued that Kasich and Christie, two candidates staking their campaigns on winning the New Hampshire primary, will continue to find it difficult to gain traction in a state where he says the issue is still \u201chotly contested.\u201d\n\n\n\nKasich is the only Republican who outright defends his support for Common Core, saying it has a record of success in his home state and that he won\u2019t bend on the matter just because it has become politically poisonous in conservative circles.\n\n\n\nMcGroarty notes that in New Hampshire earlier this year, Kasich sought to back away from the standards, saying that: \u201cIt\u2019s time Washington stop micromanaging education\u2026Yes, we need high standards, but the federal government shouldn\u2019t set them or control them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile it sounds like Kasich had a change of heart on Common Core, is he really any different from Walker and the \u2018fa\u00e7ade of authority\u2019\u201d that Wisconsin gives its school districts in determining standards?,\u201d McGroarty writes. \u201cAs the record has shown, candidates who continue to propagate the falsehoods and weasel words surrounding Common Core, even while disowning the name, will not survive for long.\u201d\n\n\n\nChristie, meanwhile, has evolved on the issue. He once supported Common Core, but announced earlier this year he\u2019d seek to pull New Jersey out. However, APP notes that Christie has said his state will continue administering a test that relies on Common Core principles.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not giving the parents their full due,\u201d McGroarty said in a phone interview. \u201cHe\u2019s not acknowledging that there\u2019s a problem with what\u2019s in front of children in the classroom. We\u2019ll end up with no changes if Christie has his way. He won\u2019t come down and fight on behalf of parents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Chris Christie, and Scott Walker all supported Common Core at one point.", "description": "Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Chris Christie, and Scott Walker all supported Common Core at one point.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Chris Christie, and Scott Walker all supported Common Core at one point.", "title": "Conservative group: Common Core dooms 2016 GOP governors", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/261529-conservative-group-common-core-dooms-2016-gop-governors", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/classroom_getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/261529-conservative-group-common-core-dooms-2016-gop-governors", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-30T16:04-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cheryl Segal", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Common Core education,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-30T16:04:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/261529-conservative-group-common-core-dooms-2016-gop-governors", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Chris Christie, and Scott Walker all supported Common Core at one point.", "card": "summary", "title": "Conservative group: Common Core dooms 2016 GOP governors"}, "dcterms.title": "Conservative group: Common Core dooms 2016 GOP governors"}, "article_summary": "Republican governors struggling in the GOP presidential contest are weighed down by their failure to fully rebuke Common Core education standards, according to the conservative think tank American Principles Project (APP).\nHe once supported Common Core, but announced earlier this year he\u2019d seek to pull New Jersey out.\nHowever, APP notes that Christie has said his state will continue administering a test that relies on Common Core principles.\nBut that\u2019s spin used by Common Core supporters, McGroarty says.\n\u201cAs the record has shown, candidates who continue to propagate the falsehoods and weasel words surrounding Common Core, even while disowning the name, will not survive for long.\u201dChristie, meanwhile, has evolved on the issue."}
