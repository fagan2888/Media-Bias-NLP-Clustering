The result was that all controversial subjects were virtually barred from the airwaves because management didn\u2019t want to deal with constant demands for \"equal time.\" The rule wasn\u2019t abolished until 1987, but long before that the new technology enabling cable television bypassed the Washington bureaucrats \u2013 and injected some life into what had been characterized previously as a vast wasteland.\n\nBut old outdated regulators never die \u2013 they simply lay in wait for their next opportunity to strike. This came when the administration of Barack Obama took office and appointed a number of FCC commissioners who want to impose \"diversity\" on America\u2019s newsrooms. In their view, various \"underserved\" communities are being shortchanged by the media, which doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to their concerns. The FCC is now seeking to rectify that Historic Injustice by sponsoring a study supposedly proving their point \u2013 and laying the groundwork for new regulations that clearly pose a direct threat to the First Amendment.\n\nLast year the FCC began its \"Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,\" a \"research\" project that will send government bureaucrats into the nation\u2019s newsrooms to discover if the Critical Information Needs (CINs, in bureaucratese) of \"underserved communities\" are being met. What are these CINs? Well, there\u2019s no less than eight of them, covering everything from information on the environment to \"economic opportunities\u201d \u2013 and also including \u201ccivic\u201d and \u201cpolitical information.\u201d These eight categories are deemed so important that broadcasters \u2013 and that includes print and internet media as well as television and radio \u2013 have a social obligation to cover them. Government agents will descend on media outlets, interview managers, journalists, and presumably the janitors to determine if these obligations are being met.\n\nIs the \"news philosophy\" of a given media outlet broadcasting its fair share of CINs? Big Brother wants to know.\n\nThese interrogations will consist of questions like: \u201cHave you ever suggested coverage of what you consider a story with critical information for your customers that was rejected by management?\u201d After this fishing expedition is concluded, managers will then be asked how and why they made particular decisions.\n\nOf course, all of this is \"voluntary\" \u2013 but radio and television stations must go to the FCC to have their licenses approved and/or renewed. So it\u2019s about as \"voluntary,\" in their case, as paying extortion fees to the Mafia. When the FCC comes knocking on the door of some radio station that features Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, and the whole panoply of Fox News shock-jocks, questions about \"perceived station bias\" \u2013 as the FCC puts it \u2013 are inevitably going to be loaded with all sorts of rather ominous political overtones.\n\n\"It is important to identify and talk with people who are willing to provide demographic information about their respective property\u2019s work force,\" says the FCC. Translation: the racial make-up of the news staff of radio, television, and other media outlets is going to be mapped \u2013 and challenged. Because, you see, \"underserved communities\" are getting short shrift from owners and top level personnel, who are naturally racists and have only gotten where they are today due to the \"privilege\" conferred on them due to an accident of birth. And to even suggest that there is some kind of barely hidden political agenda behind this survey is in itself racist, classist, sexist, not to mention homophobic and trans-phobic. In the Brave New World we are entering, even raising the question will be considered a hate crime, punishable by being locked in a room with Joan Walsh for twenty-four hours straight.\n\nThe FCC is apparently modeling its efforts on the NSA: the former\u2019s goal is to build a gigantic media database geared to give us the metrics in deciding how the government will intervene to provide those oh-so-essentials CINs to long deprived media consumers. As the FCC puts it:\n\n\"The final constructed database will contain data for all media outlets at multiple units of analysis. We anticipate that the most granular unit of analysis will be individual news stories, while higher order variables will tap into higher units of analysis. For example, for broadcast television and radio, we also will include station demographics. Likewise, for newspaper content, we will also include newspaper-specific variables. Such data formatting will allow for potential hierarchical analysis of the data, including multi-level modeling (e.g. analysis of news stories that are clustered within particular stations within markets).\"\n\nPerhaps the FCC can collaborate with the NSA, in which case the latter can divert the internal correspondence of media providers and journalists to complete the picture.\n\nThe rationale for this brazen bullying \u2013 aside from the cover story, which employs the fashionable rhetoric of ethnic and \"class\" victimology \u2013 is the alleged disadvantage suffered by \"underserved communities\" whose members have never had a radio or television station handed to them. These \"barriers to entry\" are the main obstacles to those \"entrepreneurs\" who would dearly love to own Fox News but have so far (and through no fault of their own) failed to raise the funds to buy it.\n\nJust to give you a taste of the profoundly authoritarian nature of the FCC\u2019s project, get a load of what they call the \"Community Ecology Study\":\n\n\"The Community Ecology Study seeks to determine the CINs of a broad and demographically diverse population of a metropolitan area, as they are perceived and demanded by individuals nested in neighborhoods within those areas.\"\n\nThe \"media ecology\" of a given geographical area must reflect the \"demographics\" of \"diversity,\" or else something is really wrong in Media-Land. And what\u2019s more, those \"nested\" individuals in \"underserved communities\" really don\u2019t know what their real \"needs\" are, you see, because some of these are \"latent.\" So who knows what these \"needs\" are and ought to be? Why, who else but the designers of this absurd survey, Social ist Solutions International, of Silver Springs, Maryland?!\n\nSSI is a longtime government contractor specializing in behavioral psychology and behavior modification: one study, for example, contracted for by the State Department and worth $1,400,000, researched \"mandatory Therapeutic communities\" in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to advance our knowledge of how to treat substance abuse. We learned how the SRV \"nudges\" its slaves citizens out of certain \"socially irresponsible\" behaviors \u2013 yes, that\u2019s how SSI makes its money, and lots of it.\n\nA la Cass \" Abolish Modify the First Amendment\" Sunstein, what the FCC is doing is \"nudging\" the media into becoming an instrument of government, at least insofar as it is possible to achieve this within the bounds of what is left of the Constitution. To make the media a force for \"good\" \u2013 as defined by the lords of DC \u2013 and \"nudge\" the population into cooperating with government diktats, it is first necessary to ensure properly compliant people are in the right positions.\n\nIn short, the FCC is getting ready to turn the American media landscape into something resembling Venezuela\u2019s \u2013 a nation that similarly employs the rhetoric of radical egalitarianism to regulate media for the \"public good,\" and provide a \"level playing field\" for the \"underserved communities\" \u2013 where El Presidente Nicolas Maduro derives his main support. In 2004, the Chavistas imposed the \"Law on Social Responsibility of Radio and Television,\" ostensibly passed in order to:\n\n\"[S]trike a democratic balance between duties, rights, and interests, in order to promote social justice and further the development of the citizenry, democracy, peace, human rights, education, culture, public health, and the nation\u2019s social and economic development.\"\n\nIn short, the Venezuelan media is, for the most part, an instrument of government, not an adversarial entity but a complementary one that enhances \"social solutions\" as conceived by Venezuela\u2019s avowedly socialist government. The law was used to knock Radio Caracas Television, which had been critical of the Chavez regime, off the air. Daytime news reporting is censored for scenes of violence as well as sexually suggestive material \u2013 a rule that allows the government to downplay the recent violence in the streets as well as news of the skyrocketing crime rate. The Chavistas have determined the real \"needs\" of the \"community\" \u2013 and these do not include exposure to dissenting opinions. Their methods, however, are a bit more than \"nudges\" \u2013 a violent shove is more like it. The difference, however, is merely a matter of degree.\n\nThe irony is that while the Obama administration is continuing the policies of George W. Bush in doing everything possible to overthrow the Chavistas in Venezuela \u2013 funding the opposition and directing much of the action from behind the scenes \u2013 they are importing the Venezuelan media model here, minus (for the moment) its less draconian aspects.\n\nFCC commissioner Ajit Pai was the first to draw attention to this ominous development, and Thomas Sowell followed up here, in which he makes the argument \u2013 in a somewhat convoluted polemic against Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 that the agenda of the Obama administration has put us on the slippery slope to authoritarian rule. Citing the FCC\u2019s media \"study\" as a harbinger of a larger trend, he writes:\n\n\"In the German elections of 1932, the Nazi party received 37 percent of the vote. They became part of a democratically elected coalition government, in which Hitler became chancellor. Only step by step did the Nazis dismantle democratic freedoms and turn the country into a complete dictatorship.\n\n\"The political majority could have united to stop Hitler from becoming a dictator. But they did not unite. They fought each other over their differences. Some figured that they would take over after the Nazis were discredited and defeated.\n\n\"Many who plotted this clever strategy died in Nazi concentration camps. Unfortunately, so did millions of others.\n\n\"What such clever strategies overlook is that there can be a point of no return. We may be close to that point of no return, not only with ObamaCare, but also with the larger erosion of personal freedom, of which ObamaCare is just the most visible part.\"\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s visible to Sowell and what he\u2019s blind to, but regardless of what you think of the President\u2019s healthcare plan it\u2019s possible to substitute the Snowden revelations for Obamacare and come up with a credible argument that we have indeed nearly reached a point of no return. Sowell\u2019s polemic against Sen. Cruz, berating him for insisting on ideological purity, could just as well describe those \"progressives\" who have spent so many column inches arguing against cooperating with libertarians in a united campaign against the Surveillance State.\n\nSowell used the example of German National Socialism, but he could just as well have cited the Bolsheviks or the Italian fascists \u2013 and indeed the Italian corporatist model seems to fit the closest, albeit not quite like a glove. Mussolini presided over a system of economic crony capitalism that limned and co-opted the collectivist program of the Italian Socialist Party, where Mussolini had formerly been a top leader. Sounds like Obama-land to me, especially the crony capitalist part. (Thomas Wheeler, head of the FCC, is a former lobbyist for the cable industry as well as a major \"bundler\" for Obama\u2019s presidential campaign: as head of Core Capital Partners, he was a major industry player.)\n\nIn any case, and by any measure, the realm of freedom is rapidly shrinking in these United States of America. Journalism is being redefined as a criminal act, which is why Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, the two journalists who have done the most to report on the crimes of the NSA, cannot return to their own country without fear of being arrested. That\u2019s why James Risen faces a criminal trial, and why Fox News and the Associated Press have both had their communications systems broken into by government snoops.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject, that is why Antiwar.com has been subjected to an FBI investigation on the grounds that we might well be \"agents of a foreign power.\"\n\nWhat in the name of all that\u2019s holy is going on?\n\nWe\u2019re almost at the point of no return.\n\nNo return to the days when journalism was a profession, and not a crime scene: no return to the days when the Constitution mattered. No return to the America of our forefathers, who fought and died for the Fourth Amendment \u2013 and took up arms against the Cass Susteins of their era, who thought they could \"nudge\" free Americans into allowing British soldiers into their homes. One imagines the FCC interrogating Benjamin Franklin \u2013 and his inevitable response \u2013 with nostalgia for the America that was, and hope for the America that will yet be.\n\nNOTES IN THE MARGIN\n\nWell, if the Social ist Solutions folks come to Antiwar.com, I\u2019ll be sure to tell them we\u2019re serving up hot CINs at such a rate that by the end of the day I\u2019m literally exhausted. Because we\u2019re involved in a little \"nudging\" of our own, albeit in the complete opposition direction from Cass Sunstein and his fellow statist nudgers. We\u2019re nudging Americans away from the idea that government officials have access to Ultimate Truth and teaching them to distrust whatever comes out of a government spokesman\u2019s mouth, especially when it comes to issues of war, peace, and civil liberties.\n\nUnlike the legion of government contractors who flock to profit from our leaders\u2019 authoritarian impulses, however, we don\u2019t have access to the US Treasury. We depend on our readers and supporters to voluntarily contribute the resources we need to continue. And I don\u2019t mean \"voluntary\" in the sense that accepting the visit of the FCC\u2019s interrogators is \"voluntary\" on the part of radio and television outlets: I mean really voluntary. And our success in fundraising depends on the value of our services \u2013 exposing the War Party and it\u2019s allies in government and media \u2013 to our readers.\n\nWe\u2019ve been on the War Party\u2019s case since 1998, which means I guess that we\u2019ve been serving the needs of our readers as they perceive them \u2013 not as some fool of a government contractor sees them. And now we are turning to you again, as you may have noticed, in asking for your support \u2013 because we\u2019re coming to the crucial part of our fundraising campaign.\n\nA group of \"angels\" \u2013 relatively well-off supporters of Antiwar.com \u2013 have gotten together and come up with a contribution of some $28,000, which they are prepared to donate on the condition that we match it in smaller contributions dollar-for-dollar. We get only what we can match, and not one penny more. (Oh those libertarians, you know how they are!)\n\nNow is the time for all good peace activists, left, right and center, and for all defenders of the Constitution against the James Clappers and Barack Obamas, to come to the aid of Antiwar.com. It\u2019s as simple as that. This is make or break for us \u2013 so please help us make it. Make your tax-deductible donation today \u2013 and not just today, but right now.\n\nPlease make your contribution today.\n\nNOTES IN THE MARGIN\n\nYou can check out my Twitter feed by going here. But please note that my tweets are sometimes deliberately provocative, often made in jest, and largely consist of me thinking out loud.\n\nI\u2019ve written a couple of books, which you might want to peruse. Here is the link for buying the second edition of my 1993 book, Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement, with an Introduction by Prof. George W.
