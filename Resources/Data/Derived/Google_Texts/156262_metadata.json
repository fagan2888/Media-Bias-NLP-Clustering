It seemed fitting for a country that marked Valentine's Day 10 years ago by setting a world record for the number of couples simultaneously kissing for 10 seconds (the final tally: 5,122). And it's also appropriate for a country where a whopping 93 percent of people report feeling loved.\n\nThat last stat comes from what the economist Justin Wolfers has described as \"the most comprehensive global index of love ever constructed.\" In 2006 and 2007, Gallup asked people in 136 countries whether they had experienced love the previous day. The researchers found that on a typical day, roughly 70 percent of the world's population reports feeling love. The world leader in love turned out to be the Philippines, where more than 90 percent said they had experienced love, and the world's laggard Armenia, where only 29 percent of respondents did. In the United States, 81 percent replied in the affirmative. (Click on the map to expand it.)\n\nGallup data; created with Datawrapper (Click to expand)\n\nThe map offers some broad lessons. Love appears to be flourishing in the Americas, achieving mixed results in Africa, and languishing in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. But Wolfers cautions against reading too much into the data. \"[D]ifferences between countries may be due to how cultures define 'love' and not in actual day-to-day experiences,\" he writes. \"For example, in some countries, the idea of 'love' is restricted to a romantic partner, while in others it extends to one's family members and friends.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Where is the love?
