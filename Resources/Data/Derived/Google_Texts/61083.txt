The crowd around the small arena at Thunder Mountain Harley-Davidson cheered Sunday morning as Tony Jones and Eric Rocks squealed past them during their Busted Knuckles Stunt show.

The pair performed all weekend at the event, showing off their wheelies, burnouts, acrobatics, small pyrotechnic stunts and jumps.

"It's an all Harley-Davidson V-Twin thrill show," Jones said. "We're doing stuff on a motorcycle not intended to be done."

Jones and Rocks stood on their bicycles, performed wheelies that put them perfectly upright, and let sparks fly off the metal as they gracefully spun in circles while standing on their bikes.

Occasionally their tattooed emcee would shout, "Let's make some noise," as the stunt performers dazzled the crowd with feats that seemed to defy gravity.
