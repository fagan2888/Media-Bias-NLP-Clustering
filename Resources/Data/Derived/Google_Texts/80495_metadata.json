And so our revered senators and congressmen made some quality dad jokes on Twitter Monday morning. They just \"get\" it \u2014 memes, that is!\n\nRepublican Rep. Thomas Massie sent out budget deal analysis in #doge style.\n\nMuch bipartisanship. Very spending. Wow. #doge http://t.co/ioD2Jwnyp8 \u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) December 23, 2013\n\nFor those who are not fluent in \"doge,\" he is a Shibe dog that \"speaks\" with comic fonts and horrible grammar and loves the word wow.\n\nWow So confuse How pronounce Very question pic.twitter.com/RirWCXbWO2 \u2014 Doge (@DogeTheDog) December 23, 2013\n\nRep. Steve Stockman's senate campaign also sent out a doge joke about Sen. John Cornyn, but it's not as good. Stockman is running for Cornyn's seat in 2014.\n\nwow. such obamacare funding. oppose ted cruz. pic.twitter.com/bIgXNNpimi \u2014 Rep. Steve Stockman (@StockmanSenate) December 23, 2013\n\nAside from \"wow,\" the words in the photo are just phrases, not doge-isms. Please get it together, Representative. This cool, millennial meme is dead forever now.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul has been making the best dad jokes of all \u2014 Seinfeld jokes. He performed the traditional Festivus \"airing of grievances\" on Twitter this morning, using the opportunity to complain about the budget deal and the Fed. LOL!\n\nHe also mentioned cafeteria food and his beloved turtlenecks, just to let you know he's real.\n\nThe Senate cafeteria never has burgoo. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) December 23, 2013\n\nFinally, he called out Sen. Cory Booker. Don't worry, Booker \"gets\" it, too.\n\nU, me & \"feats of strength:\" Senate floor, name the time MT @SenRandPaul A Festivus grievance re bipartisanship. Booker doesn't RT me enough \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) December 23, 2013\n\nThis kind of Twitter banter isn't new for Paul and Booker \u2014 both are active on the site and play to young fan bases of libertarians and liberals, respectively. Stockman and Massie are stretching themselves by comparison. And Paul's ribbing may just lead to bipartisan legislation on marijuana:\n\nI know. U told me last week. Here is to a 2014 where we take on the failed war on drugs RT @SenRandPaul: I'm the Senate author of Hemp bill! \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) December 23, 2013\n\nLooks like Booker and Paul found common ground \u2014 through lulz!
