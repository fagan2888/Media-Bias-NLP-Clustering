His speech became a viral moment for the Wisconsin congressman among many conservatives.\n\nBut with Republicans in the majority, Ryan worked hard to find common ground with Democrats and prove that Republicans were ready to work together. That kind of work was celebrated by establishment Republicans and earned Ryan begrudging respect from the White House.\n\nThe White House frequently refers favorably to the budget agreement Ryan reached with Senator Patty Murray in 2013, when Democrats still controlled the Senate.\n\nRyan\u2019s ability to ward off a government shutdown for two years, led the Obama team to respect Ryan \u2013 even though they disagreed with him on politics.\n\nLast month, White House press secretary Josh Earnest used the Ryan deal as an example of what they wanted in 2015 \u2013 including the removal of sequester cuts.\n\n\u201cCongress needs to arrive at the kind of bipartisan budget agreement that was reached by Senator Murray and Chairman Paul Ryan from the House that essentially raised the sequester caps to ensure that those priorities were adequately funded,\u201d Earnest told reporters on September 30.\n\nObama\u2019s Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew also teamed up with Ryan in July to discuss infrastructure spending.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Allen: White House Would Like Paul Ryan As Speaker", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mike Allen: White House Would Like Paul Ryan As Speaker", "title": "Mike Allen: White House Would Like Paul Ryan As Speaker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-111669257-ryan3.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/12/mike-allen-white-house-like-paul-ryan-speaker/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mike Allen: White House Would Like Paul Ryan As Speaker", "creator": "@charliespiering", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-111669257-ryan3.jpg", "title": "Mike Allen: White House Would Like Paul Ryan As Speaker", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Paul Ryan,Big Government, Obama,Ryan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Paul Ryan", "published_time": "2015-10-12T13:36:11-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPolitico\u2019s Mike Allen thinks President Barack Obama likes the idea of Paul Ryan for Speaker.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cThe White House would like that idea,\u201d Allen said during an interview with Laura Ingraham on her radio show today.\nThat kind of work was celebrated by establishment Republicans and earned Ryan begrudging respect from the White House.\nThe White House frequently refers favorably to the budget agreement Ryan reached with Senator Patty Murray in 2013, when Democrats still controlled the Senate.\n\u201cTo his credit, Paul Ryan expressed real interest in discussions and negotiations,\u201d Obama said during his remarks to the Business Roundtable Headquarters in September."}
