This is happening because hospitals of all sizes and types recognize the need to be part of a comprehensive, integrated provider network in their region.\n\nThis is a trend that has ramifications for clinical laboratories and pathology groups that operate in the regions where these alliances and collaborations happen. That is because such collaborations can often change the competitive market for medical laboratory testing in the communities served by the partners in the alliance.\n\n\n\nStrategic Alliance between Academic Center and Health System\n\nOne recent example of involving a multi-hospital health system and a stand-alone academic medical center is the strategic alliance recently announced in the Pacific Northwest by PeaceHealth (PH) and the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWM).\n\nThis collaboration became effective on September 12, 2013. It makes UWM the preferred complex tertiary and quaternary care provider for patients in PeaceHealth\u2019s Northwest Network.\n\n\u201cThis strategic collaboration will support UW Medicine\u2019s mission to improve the health of the public by providing more seamless access to UW Medicine clinical services for many patients in the Northwest,\u201d stated Paul Ramsey, M.D., CEO of UWM in a story published in the San Juan Islander.\n\nPace of Alliances Will Accelerate as Healthcare Reform Takes Hold\n\nAnalysts at Moody\u2019s Investors Service (NYSE: MCO) believe this deal is an example of how hospitals and healthcare systems are increasingly moving toward alliances. This consolidation trend will accelerate, according to a recent story published in Modern Healthcare. This applies to both not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems as they look to team up to create integrated clinical care networks.\n\nCollaborations between hospitals, health systems, and academic medical centers are essential to meet the Affordable Care Act goals related to improving individual and population health, while reducing costs. For UWM, the deal with PH accomplishes at least two strategic objectives.\n\nCollaborations Are a Response to Healthcare Market Trends\n\nFirst, health insurers are narrowing networks and trying to exclude high-cost hospitals. Academic centers such as UWM are typically higher-cost providers. (See Dark Daily, \u201cAs Health Insurers Narrow Their Networks, Some Hospitals and Physicians Find Themselves Excluded, as Happened to Many Clinical Pathology Laboratories,\u201d June 24, 2013.)\n\nThe deal allows UWM to retain access to provider networks. Secondly, collaborating with a multi-hospital health system gives UWM access to valuable inpatient referrals.\n\nFor its part, the collaboration allows PeaceHealth to broaden the scope of its care. \u201c[The alliance] offers significant benefits to people in our geographic region,\u201d said Peter Adler, Chief Strategy Officer for PeaceHealth, in a company press release. \u201c[This is] due to the opportunity to provide the full continuum of care\u2014primary through quaternary levels\u2014more seamlessly and with a unique patient experience.\u201d PeaceHealth is based in Vancouver, Washington, and provides services in Washington, Oregon, and Alaska.\n\nThe press release specified other advantages of the deal, including opportunities to:\n\nidentify ongoing performance improvement initiatives to reduce costs,\n\ndevelop clinical programming to increase access to specialized services,\n\nshare and more broadly use best practices, and\n\nbetter coordinate care through securely linked electronic medical records (EMR).\n\nWave of Mergers Involving Hospitals and Health Systems\n\nPowerful forces, including the Affordable Care Act, are driving the healthcare consolidation trend, according to a story published by The New York Times. One consulting firm predicted that, within the next five to seven years, 20% of the nation\u2019s nearly 5,000 hospitals could seek mergers, noted a briefing issued by Advisory.com.\n\nThere are other examples of the merger trend. Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. (NYSE: THC) acquired Nashville\u2019s Vanguard Health Systems. \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in expanding in markets we serve and expanding into new markets with scale,\u201d declared Trevor Fetter, CEO of Tenet, in a recent story published by The Dallas Morning News.\n\nBaylor Health Care and Scott & White Merger\n\nA day before the Tenet-Vanguard deal, Dallas-based Baylor Health Care System and Temple, Texas-based Scott & White Healthcare completed their merger. The result is the largest not-for-profit health system in Texas.\n\nBrentwood, Tennessee-based Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH) is in negotiations to acquire Naples, Florida-based Health Management Associates (NYSE: HMA). If the deal goes through, it would make CHS the largest for-profit system, when judged by the number of hospitals, reported in a recent Modern Healthcare story.\n\nAccording to Advisory.com, other major mergers that occurred as of August of this year include: Mount Sinai Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners, Trinity Health and Catholic Health East, and Highmark and West Penn Allegheny Health System.\n\nNot all reform-driven merger attempts are succeeding. Talks between Royal Oak, Michigan-based Beaumont Health System and Detroit-based Henry Ford Medical Center fell through. This was due to a series of disagreements over major policy and operational issues, according to a story published in Crain\u2019s Detroit Business.\n\nRegulators Fear Consolidation Could Lead to Higher Hospital Prices\n\nAn increase in mergers means ever-larger health systems. This worries federal regulators. They fear consolidations could reduce competition and lead to higher insurance premiums, copayments, and out-of-pocket expenses. Further, some deals have involved religious-based health systems acquiring secular hospitals. This raises new questions about patient access to services, such as contraception and end-of-life care, Advisory.com reported.\n\nIn many ways, pathologists and clinical laboratory managers can only watch and wait. Mergers, consolidations and alliances among leading hospitals in different regional markets may trigger further consolidation of clinical laboratory testing services within newly expanded health systems. Were that to happen on a large scale, it would mirror the similar wave of hospital laboratory consolidations that took place between 1996 and 2000, following that wave of hospital consolidation transactions.\n\n\u2014Pamela Scherer McLeod\n\nRelated Information:\n\nUW Medicine, Catholic health system to have \u2018strategic affiliation\u2019\n\nClark County plays role in PeaceHealth-UW deal: Local medical residency program to expand under partnership\n\nReform Update: ACA will accelerate hospital mergers, Moody\u2019s says\n\nTenet completes $4.3 billion acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems\n\nThe unmaking of the Beaumont-Henry Ford Health merger: Policy, culture issues did in deal\n\nNew Laws and Rising Costs Create a Surge of Supersizing Hospitals\n\nHospital mergers may drive up costs\n\nEditorial: Noble motives behind UW Medicine-PeaceHealth partnership\n\nConsolidation of Big Hospital Systems May Drive Healthcare Costs Even Higher, Say Some Experts", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, peacehealth, university of washington school of medicine, san juan islander, affordable care act, moody\u2019s investors service, nyse: mco, modern healthcare, dark daily, peter adler, electronic medical records, the new york times, advisory.com, tenet healthcare corp., nyse: thc, vanguard health systems, the dallas morning news, baylor health care system, scott & white healthcare, trevor fetter, community health systems, nyse: cyh, health management associates, nyse: hma, the mount sinai medical center, continuum health partners, trinity health, catholic health east, highmark, west penn allegheny health system, beaumont health system, henry ford medical center, crain\u2019s detroit business,advisory.com,affordable care act,baylor health care system,beaumont health system,catholic health east,clinical laboratory,community health systems,continuum health partners,crain\u2019s detroit business,dark daily,electronic medical records,health management associates,henry ford medical center,highmark,medical laboratory,modern healthcare,moody's investors service,nyse: cyh,nyse: hma,nyse: mco,nyse: thc,peacehealth,peter adler,san juan islander,scott & white healthcare,tenet healthcare corp.,the dallas morning news,the mount sinai medical center,the new york times,trevor fetter,trinity health,university of washington school of medicine,vanguard health systems,west penn allegheny health system,laboratory hiring & human resources,laboratory management and operations,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology,laboratory sales and marketing,management & operations", "description": "PeaceHealth (PH) and the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWM) have joined forces in a strategic alliance.
