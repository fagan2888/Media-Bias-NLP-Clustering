EngagePoint also said Noridian \u201clacked the expertise, resources and commitment actually required\u201d to develop and operate the Web site through which Marylanders were supposed to sign up for insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nNoridian fired EngagePoint in October, and the two companies \u2014 which are suing each other in federal court in Baltimore \u2014 are fighting over employees, money and work that remains to be completed.\n\nNoridian\u2019s president and chief executive, Tom McGraw, said in a written statement Friday afternoon that the firm had reviewed EngagePoint\u2019s new filings and believes \u201cthe statements are false, unsupportable and will be contradicted by evidence that we present in court and arbitration.\u201d He also wrote that the pending case precluded Noridian from discussing details about the relationship between the two companies.\n\nTimothy J. Long, an attorney for EngagePoint, declined to comment because of the ongoing litigation.\n\nThe new filings are evidence of the deepening rancor between the two contractors. But Dori Henry, a spokeswoman for the insurance exchange, maintained Friday that the system continues to improve and that the litigation \u201cis not having an impact\u201d on its progress.\n\nMaryland was one of 14 states that chose to launch their own online health insurance exchanges, authorized by the Affordable Care Act, instead of relying on the federal marketplace.\n\nMaryland hired Noridian, a North Dakota-based health-care services company, to build the exchange. Unbeknown to Maryland officials, Noridian hired EngagePoint, a Maryland-based company, to \u201cprovide all of the technical services\u201d and agreed to share the project\u2019s profits, according to the court documents. EngagePoint then hired \u201ca substantial number of subcontractors\u201d because, the company says, it didn\u2019t have enough staff of its own to get the work done.\n\nWithin months of joining forces, the two firms were fighting over costs. Soon, they were blowing important deadlines, and an outside auditor had flagged potential problems, according to internal documents obtained by The Washington Post. After the site\u2019s failed launch on Oct. 1, Noridian fired EngagePoint.\n\nMaryland Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown (D), who was tasked with implementing health-care reform in Maryland, said top state officials became aware of potential problems in September but did not realize their gravity. Maryland\u2019s exchange crashed Oct. 1, its first day, and has been plagued with problems that have made it difficult for Marylanders to sign up for health insurance.\n\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D) has said the exchange has been greatly improved in the meantime and is now functioning for most applicants. But enrollment numbers continue to lag behind expectations. As of Friday, officials say, 29,059 Marylanders had enrolled in private plans, a pace far short of what is needed to meet the goal of at least 150,000 by March 31. Brown once touted an even higher goal \u2014 180,000. So far the state has paid Noridian nearly $65 million and has unpaid invoices totaling an additional $13 million.\n\nThe exchange is largely functioning through work-arounds, state health officials have said. Rather than signing up for insurance through the Web site, many Marylanders have contacted call centers and spent hours on the phone. Some applications are being processed on paper.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s chief information officer said last week that \u201cmultiple defects remain\u201d and that there are \u201ca number of architectural and infrastructure issues\u201d that need to be corrected.\n\nOn Monday, a newly formed oversight group of lawmakers will gather in Annapolis to examine the current state of the exchange and begin to determine what should be done when the first enrollment period ends March 31. There has been talk of abandoning all or part of the site.\n\nIn the court records, EngagePoint accused Noridian of not disclosing its lack of expertise, mismanaging the project and not hiring qualified staff \u2014 and then threatening EngagePoint when problems appeared. At one point, Noridian threatened that it \u201cwould bankrupt\u201d EngagePoint if it did not give in to demands for more work, according to the court documents. EngagePoint is also seeking $7.4 million from Noridian for what it says are overdue bills.\n\nNoridian chose to use a \u201cwaterfall method\u201d of development, finishing one part of the project before starting another, and EngagePoint says the complex project should have had a number of parts being worked on simultaneously.\n\nAfter EngagePoint was fired, Noridian tried to hire some of its employees. Noridian acknowledged its reliance on EngagePoint in earlier court filings as it tried to hire the employees and gain access to information it said EngagePoint controlled.\n\nIf Noridian could not offer jobs to EngagePoint employees there was \u201ca significant risk\u201d it would not be able to deliver Maryland\u2019s health exchange with all of the functions promised by Jan. 1, Noridian said in an earlier filing. Unless crucial EngagePoint employees helped it, Noridian said in earlier filings, the company would be left to \u201creverse engineer\u201d the site to determine how the work had been done.\n\nNoridian has been able to hire some of EngagePoint\u2019s staff, Friday\u2019s filings indicate. EngagePoint also continues to work on the site, the court files show, without making clear what that work entails and who is paying for it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Noridian Healthcare Solutions accused of hiding \u201cits lack of relevant expertise\u201d when bidding on contract.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Noridian Healthcare Solutions accused of hiding \u201cits lack of relevant expertise\u201d when bidding on contract.", "title": "Court papers escalate fight between key contractors on Md. health insurance exhange", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/court-papers-escalate-fight-between-key-contractors-on-md-health-insurance-exhange/2014/02/07/2f8d9fb2-9044-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/23/Editorial-Opinion/Images/116685912-1700.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marypatflaherty"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "md politics, maryland politics, noridian, engagepoint, maryland health exchange, obamacare, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson"}, "news_keywords": "md politics, maryland politics, noridian, engagepoint, maryland health exchange, obamacare, affordable care act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "2f8d9fb2-9044-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef45\"", "article_summary": "One of the two companies that built Maryland\u2019s troubled online health insurance exchange charged in court papers Friday that the lead contractor \u201cconcealed its lack of relevant expertise\u201d when it bid on the contract.\nMaryland was one of 14 states that chose to launch their own online health insurance exchanges, authorized by the Affordable Care Act, instead of relying on the federal marketplace.\nBut Dori Henry, a spokeswoman for the insurance exchange, maintained Friday that the system continues to improve and that the litigation \u201cis not having an impact\u201d on its progress.\nMaryland\u2019s exchange crashed Oct. 1, its first day, and has been plagued with problems that have made it difficult for Marylanders to sign up for health insurance.\nThe exchange is largely functioning through work-arounds, state health officials have said."}
