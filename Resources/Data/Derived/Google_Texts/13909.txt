The Kansas Highway Patrol says a 40-year-old Wichita woman who suffered critical injuries in a rollover accident Saturday morning was driving erratically and at high speeds before the crash.

The crash was reported around 9:15 a.m. at 61st Street North and Ridge Road, which is just northeast of Maize.

An off-duty Mt. Hope officer told troopers he saw a maroon passenger car driving erratically at speeds up to 100 mph on K-96. He followed as the car exited on Ridge Road and headed north. It then crossed the road, went into a ditch and overturned.

Wichita's Chris Ketzner was driving two cars behind the woman on Ridge Road. Having just returned late Friday night from the Bahamas, Ketzner was on the way to Sedgwick to pick up her daughter's dog from the pet sitter.

"There was a truck in front of me and a red car in front of him and the red car just started swerving into the opposite lane, went into the ditch, and went spinning. It went on its roof and then flipped onto its tires," Ketzner said.

Ketzner says the car started on fire. She called 911 as another witness grabbed a fire extinguisher and tried to put out the flames.

About a minute later, the fire officers put out the fire and they were getting of the jaws of life and the ambulance arrived," Ketzner said.

Troopers said Tina McDaneld had to be extracted from the vehicle and was taken to the hospital with critical injuries. Reports state she was wearing a seatbelt.

Investigators are trying to determine whether prescription drugs played a role in the crash.
