But this safety net is eroding.\n\nHealth News Florida investigated what these changes mean to pregnant and poor women across Florida, and found that only 28 of Florida\u2019s 67 counties offer prenatal care by health department employees. The state\u2019s also been decreasing its roll in patient care overall.\n\nHealth News Florida will be highlighting details of the investigation all week. See the series here.\n\nPrenatal care has a huge impact on a child throughout life, said Linda Sutherland, Director of Orange County\u2019s Healthy Start Coalition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a direct correlation between being born low birth weight or not as healthy as your potential and low performing schools. Because really what happens in those zip codes is you start out behind,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for the changes including:\n\nBudget. Last year, the Florida Department of Health\u2019s budget was cut by $155.8 million. And since 2011, the state\u2019s health department ranks have decreased by 2,700 employees.\n\nMedicaid managed care. The state finalized its transition to managed care for Medicaid participants a year ago, and some of the private plans administering plans are paying county health department clinicians less for the services.\n\nDOH priorities. State leaders feel that public health departments supported by taxpayer dollars should only be providing care if there is absolutely no one else doing it. The focus instead is on population health, on things such as flu vaccines and preventing sexually transmitted disease.\n\nSwannie Jett of the Seminole County Health Department said health departments really should only have doctors who see patients when there are no options.\n\n\u201cOnce the community begins to stand up and provide some of those services, the health department can begin retracting their services,\u201d he said.\n\nThe states says the majority of women who were getting care in county health departments already are being seen by private doctors since the state privatized Medicaid.\n\nBut the access is limited. In Orange County, for example, only about a third of doctors in private practice are willing to see Medicaid patients. Those who do, limit care to just a few obstetric patients a week.\n\nHealth News Florida found that the counties dropping prenatal care in the past two years saw dips in several key health statistics.\n\nFor example, the number of women getting in to see a doctor in the first trimester of pregnancy worsened 11 of the 12 counties that stopped offering prenatal care in the last two years. In rural Dixie County, when its county health department stopped offering prenatal care, the rate of women giving birth without ever seeing a doctor more than doubled, to the worst rate in Florida.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter for WMFE in Orlando.
