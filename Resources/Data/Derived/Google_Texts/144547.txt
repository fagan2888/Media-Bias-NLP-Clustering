Four people were hurt in a crash east of Leon Saturday night.

It happened just before 10 p.m. on US Highway 400 near SE Pawnee Road. The Kansas Highway Patrol says 41-year-old Robert Lara Jr. of El Dorado was westbound on the highway when he crossed the center line and sideswiped an eastbound car, carrying a Joplin couple.

Both vehicles left the road. A third vehicle behind Lara struck debris in the roadway.

Lara was taken to Susan B. Allen Memorial Hospital in El Dorado for treatment. The couple in the second vehicle, 69-year-old JK Wright and 66-year-old Mary Jo Wright were taken to Via Christi-St. Francis in Wichita in serious condition. They both have since been treated and released.

A passenger in the third car, 86-year-old Lois Roper of Wichita, suffered minor injuries. She was transported to Wesley Medical Center for treatment.
