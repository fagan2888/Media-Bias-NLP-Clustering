In a video that surfaced on Friday, economist and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber said “lack of transparency” and “stupidity of the American voter” were “critical” to passing the president’s unpopular health care law.

“Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” Gruber said. “Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.”

Gruber added that he wished “we could make it all transparent,” but said the bill would not have passed if not for the administration’s art of deception on key features of the law.

“This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes,” Gruber said. “If you had a law that made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.”

Gruber made clear that deliberately lying to the American people was a necessary measure in the passage of Obamacare.

“There’s things that I wish could change,” Gruber said. “But I’d rather have this law than not.”
