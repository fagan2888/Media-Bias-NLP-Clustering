So we had David Wohl who recently defended Trump by saying, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s a man\u2019s man and that\u2019s what his followers love about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there any doubt about that?\u201d Wohl now asked, after host Sandra Smith read the original quote. Then he also defended Trump's tweet as satire, also, presumably, of the manly man kind.\n\nWOHL: Donald Trump responded with satire. That was a satirical tweet of his wife next to Heidi Cruz. What if he had made the tweet his beautiful wife and the possible future First Man of the United States, Bill Clinton, with a smirk on his face? Would people have been outraged? No, they would have laughed and moved on and that\u2019s what people need to do with this one.\n\nThe other guest, Cruz supporter Katie Pavlich wasn\u2019t buying it.\n\nPAVLICH: Come on. \u2026It\u2019s not funny and I find it, again, amazing how Donald Trump supporters like David continue to condone behavior that\u2019s easily condemnable and when it\u2019s the right thing to do, supporters like David here can\u2019t actually get on the right side of things.\n\nIf you ask me, the anti-Trump ad that started it all, which showed a GQ photo of a nude Melania Trump and questioned whether she was fit to be First Lady, was entirely fair game. This was not private behavior but part of her career. The ad was made for conservative Utah voters and raised an issue about Melania Trump's public morality that they might well care about. Trump\u2019s response, however, did nothing to actually defend his wife. He took a mean-spirited, gratuitous swipe at Heidi Cruz with a photo chosen to make her look unattractive. In other words, it was childish retaliation aimed at Cruz' looks.\n\nBut Pavlich seemed more interested in emphasizing that Cruz \u201chad nothing to do with the ad\u201d and that when he found out about it, praised Melania Trump.\n\nHowever, Pavlich did delve somewhat into Trump\u2019s history of attacking women \u2013 which Wohl dismissed as all part of Trump\u2019s sense of good fun.\n\nPAVLICH: Donald Trump then responded by again proving that he only cares about what women look like. He again repeated his track record of going after the wives of candidates. Let\u2019s not forget that Heidi Cruz is not one of Donald Trump\u2019s first targets here. Jeb Bush\u2019s wife, of course, was another target of Donald Trump\u2019s inappropriate, immature and frivolous attacks. This proves once again that Donald Trump is un-presidential, unfit for the presidency and he should be making better decisions and people like you should be condemning \u2013 it\u2019s not funny. WOHL: If you don\u2019t have a sense of humor, then you shouldn\u2019t be in this game. It was a satirical tweet. We know Heidi Cruz is a beautiful, smart woman and he had a tweet with her smirking next to his wife to sort of zing back at Ted Cruz for what he perceived to be a horrible naked picture of his wife in an ad in Utah caucuses, just before the caucuses took place and knowing full well that the Mormon people are very offended by that kind of thing. I think you guys are blowing it up to be far more than it is.\n\nYet neither host Sandra Smith nor Fox News contributor Pavlich mentioned Trump\u2019s continued, sexist attacks on their colleague, Megyn Kelly, the regular host of the show.\n\nI\u2019d say his behavior toward her is quite relevant to Wohl\u2019s claim that Trump was merely responding to an ad and being satirical, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nWatch everybody ignore the elephant in the room below, from the March 24 The Kelly File.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "6CZRTAU+30dzTiV5pS4IO3MFDKNrWvk9OMEKU/1/0bs=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/trump_supporter_defends_attack_heidi_cruz_looks_satire_man_s_man_032516", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Trump Supporter Defends Attack On Heidi Cruz\u2019 Looks As \u2018Satire\u2019 From A 'Man's Man'"}, "Title": "Trump Supporter Defends Attack On Heidi Cruz\u2019 Looks As \u2018Satire\u2019 From A 'Man's Man'"}, "article_summary": "A Donald Trump supporter defended Trump's offensive tweet smearing Heidi Cruz\u2019 looks as \u201csatire\u201d and as part of Trump's \"man's man\" awesome masculinity.\nWOHL: Donald Trump responded with satire.\nPAVLICH: Donald Trump then responded by again proving that he only cares about what women look like.\nHe took a mean-spirited, gratuitous swipe at Heidi Cruz with a photo chosen to make her look unattractive.\nLet\u2019s not forget that Heidi Cruz is not one of Donald Trump\u2019s first targets here."}
