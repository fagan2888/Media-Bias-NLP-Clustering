A Los Angeles Times columnist went after Republican Carly Fiorina for “exploiting” her breast cancer survivor status during her current presidential run and her 2010 California Senate run.

Liberal columnist Michael Hiltzik was less than happy that Fiorina brought up her previous fight with breast cancer to make a joke about her 2010 Democratic opponent Barbara Boxer:

Fiorina, who was making much out of her own battle with breast cancer (‘After chemotherapy, Barbara Boxer just isn’t really that scary anymore,’ she quipped), displayed the usual contempt that privileged insurance owners have for the uninsureds. Fiorina received her health coverage through her husband’s AT&T retirement plan, but for everyone else she advocated allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines, which would be a boon to the insurers and a disaster for buyers.

When called out on the paragraph by a reader on Twitter, Hiltzik defended what he wrote:

You should take that up with #Carly: she deliberately exploited her own illness for her political campaign https://t.co/8qvNhmRlCj — Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015

You're saying she should be able to use her own cancer case as a weapon against working women, without pushback https://t.co/Up2zOb3VUD — Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015

She raised the point, without prompting, at her campaign launch event on Day One. https://t.co/Up2zOb3VUD — Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015

In her world, you wouldn't be entitled to affordable treatment https://t.co/nXpySTKlxG — Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015

The Federalist’s Sean Davis also points out that Hiltzik has a long history of unscrupulous behavior, including attacking his opponents with sockpuppet accounts and hacking into his L.A. Times colleagues’ emails.
