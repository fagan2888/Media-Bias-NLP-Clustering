And if Hillary Clinton has her way, that dynamic will extend well beyond Obamacare.\n\nRight off the bat, she and Bernie Sanders tangled over that topic, which Sanders proposes to replace with a single-payer system, or as he calls it, Medicare for all. Sanders claims it would cost the average American an extra $500 on their tax bill, but would return $5,000 worth of benefit; Clinton insists his numbers \u201cdon\u2019t add up,\u201d and suggests re-opening the Obamacare debate could roll back its gains.\n\nBut an even more telling exchange came when Clinton responded to the familiar questions about the Wall Street campaign donations she\u2019s pocketed by noting that Obama took more money from Wall Street than any Democratic candidate in history without compromising his ability or willingness to impose strict new regulations, a degree of independence Clinton claimed she, too, would retain.\n\nSanders called that \u201can insult\u201d to the voters\u2019 intelligence.\n\nHis argument buried hers in New Hampshire, no doubt. But you wonder how it plays in South Carolina, where close to 30% of the Democratic electorate is African-American and strongly pro-Obama.\n\nBetween these two, and the Obama-phobia of the GOP field, something tells me this Obama-less election could nonetheless be another one of those referendums on the incumbent.\n\nListen to Jon\u2019s commentary:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Something tells me this Obama-less election could nonetheless be another one of those referendums on the incumbent.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/02/12/obamacare-2016-election-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-jon-keller-at-large-wbz/", "image": {"width": 628, "secure_url": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/sanders-clinton1.jpg?w=628", "identifier": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/sanders-clinton1.jpg?w=628", "height": 353}, "type": "article", "description": "Something tells me this Obama-less election could nonetheless be another one of those referendums on the incumbent.", "title": "Keller @ Large: Obamacare A Major Issue In 2016 Election"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/sanders-clinton1.jpg?w=628", "description": "Something tells me this Obama-less election could nonetheless be another one of those referendums on the incumbent.", "site": "CBSboston", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Keller @ Large: Obamacare A Major Issue In 2016 Election"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Boston News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Boston's Best", "msvalidate.01": "FDD12CE797EAB78953FDE9ACF7F312A5", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Boston", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston"}, "keywords": "jon keller, keller at large, wbz, 2016 presidential election, obamacare, hillary clinton, bernie sanders", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://boston.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/72ff1baf55fe94c284ce5747d8d4a96e?s=16", "news_keywords": "campaign 2016, jon keller, keller at large"}, "article_summary": "President Obama won\u2019t be on the ballot this fall, but it was clear in Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate that the centerpiece of his administration \u2013 the Affordable Care Act \u2013 is a major issue in the race to succeed him.\nBOSTON (CBS) \u2013 Like any rule, it is made to be broken.\nAnd if Hillary Clinton has her way, that dynamic will extend well beyond Obamacare.\nBetween these two, and the Obama-phobia of the GOP field, something tells me this Obama-less election could nonetheless be another one of those referendums on the incumbent.\nBut you wonder how it plays in South Carolina, where close to 30% of the Democratic electorate is African-American and strongly pro-Obama."}
