Bush, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, Middle East, Politics News\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s last name comes with advantages that are difficult to overstate. In a presidential race, he gets, among other things, instant name recognition and a built-in fundraising apparatus from his father and brother. Those assets alone explain why a man who hasn\u2019t won an election in more than a decade is nonetheless considered a serious contender for his party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nAnd yet, a few months into the presidential race, Bush has not been able to turn \u201ccontender\u201d into \u201cfront-runner,\u201d in part because he cannot seem to escape the legacy of the same last name that provides him so many privileges.\n\nBush\u2019s struggle with the Bush legacy started in February, when the former Florida governor gave a speech declaring: \u201cI love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make. But I am my own man.\u201d There was no problem with the rhetoric, except for the fact that it was accompanied by Bush announcing his foreign policy advisers \u2014 19 of 21 of which had formerly worked for his father or brother. A few months later, Jeb Bush said his brother was one of his top advisers on the Middle East.\n\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s policy in that region soon became a focus of inquiry on the campaign trail. In May, Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly asked Jeb Bush: \u201cKnowing what we know now, would you have authorized the (Iraq) invasion?\u201d\n\nBush declared, \u201cI would have\u201d and insisted \u201cso would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got\u201d \u2014 somehow ignoring 133 House members and 23 senators who saw some of that intelligence and voted against the war. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing Bush said: He went on to proudly assert that when it came to the decision to invade Iraq, \u201cnews flash to the world, if they\u2019re trying to find places where there\u2019s big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Florida governor insists that he's his \"own man.\" The American public appears to think otherwise", "title": "The elephant in the room: Why Jeb can\u2019t escape his last name", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Florida governor insists that he's his \"own man.\" The American public appears to think otherwise", "title": "The elephant in the room: Why Jeb can\u2019t escape his last name", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/the_elephants_in_the_room_why_jeb_cant_escape_his_last_name_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/jeb_bush3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Florida governor insists that he's his \"own man.\" The American public appears to think otherwise", "title": "The elephant in the room: Why Jeb can\u2019t escape his last name", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/jeb_bush3.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Florida, George H.W.
