But now that may be changing \u2014 and dads\u2019 answers reveal a lot about American culture at home and at the office.\n\nFor a study recently published in the Journal of Business and Psychology, Beth Humberd, Jamie J. Ladge and Brad Harrington interviewed 31 men about their experiences as workers and fathers. They chose college-educated professionals with working spouses, because they wanted to focus on dads effected most by the old ideal of the totally committed worker and the newer one of the highly involved dad. They found that, rather than choosing to see themselves either as traditional breadwinner dads or as hands-on types who were home for dinner, most fathers in their sample saw themselves as both.\n\nOne man\u2019s definition of an ideal father is telling. He told the researchers a good dad was someone who could \u201cbe there for their kids every day when they need to be, and as much as they can be. And does their best to make sure that their spouse and kids understand the times that they can\u2019t be there, why that is, to make sure that they understand that it is not a matter of one priority is more important than the other.\u201d\n\nThe dads in the sample weren\u2019t necessarily bothered by fulfilling multiple roles. But the fact that they have to do so may reveal bigger problems. Ms. Humberd told Op-Talk her research showed dads weren\u2019t really discarding more traditional expectations (like the idea that they should work as much as possible), even as they added on new ones: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of status quo. There\u2019s this more involved narrative, that we need and want and desire to be more involved fathers. But in order to live up to the demands of an outdated workplace, they haven\u2019t really shifted there yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen women become mothers,\u201d she noted, \u201ca lot changes for them on the work front, and perhaps too much\u201d \u2014 they can be passed over for promotions or big assignments. \u201cYet when men become fathers, little seems to change in terms of others\u2019 expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still rewarded and expected to be ideal workers,\u201d she said, \u201cand it has trickle-down effects on their spouses. It leaves men largely unable to adapt their work demands in order to meet family needs.\u201d\n\nEssentially, though men may spend more time with their kids than dads of decades past did, they may also have to uphold an older model of manhood \u2014 which can leave their partners stuck in the past, too, forced to do more at home even if they\u2019re also working.\n\nThe research resonated with dads. Dana H. Glazer, director of the documentary \u201cThe Evolution of Dad\u201d and a participant in a recent White House event on working fathers, told Op-Talk: \u201cMost people are very confused about the role of fatherhood in our culture, because we\u2019re given mixed messages about it. We\u2019re told on the one hand that fatherhood is very important, and we\u2019re told on the other hand that your value as a father is how much time you spend at work.\u201d\n\nHe explained why men might feel they had to be ideal employees even after having kids: \u201cIt\u2019s because the corporate mentality doesn\u2019t leave any room for being involved with the family.\u201d Corporate culture, he said, is \u201cabout maximizing profits to the detriment of dads.\u201d\n\nKipp Jarecke-Cheng, a father and blogger who also spoke at the White House event, told Op-Talk, \u201cI think a lot of companies kind of have an expectation that men don\u2019t need to be engaged the same way that mothers are traditionally expected to be engaged with their children.\u201d\n\nMr. Jarecke-Cheng\u2019s partner is male, and he said being a two-dad family has \u201cchallenges and benefits within the context of work-life balance.\u201d He explained that \u201cthere aren\u2019t expectations about gender roles, there isn\u2019t a female or mom in the equation that an employer would immediately assume is going to take care of all of the logistics.\u201d So he and his partner have been able to define their roles based on what works for them.\n\nBut getting employers to support his role as an involved dad hasn\u2019t always been easy \u2014 one boss told him that if he wanted a flexible schedule to care for his child, he\u2019d have to take a pay cut. He wasn\u2019t paid during his paternity leave and had to pay for his health insurance out of pocket then, too.\n\nWhen it comes to helping dads resolve their double roles, Ms. Humberd says, \u201cformalized work programs and benefits are hugely important, but so are the cultures that underlie them.\u201d In their research, she said, \u201cwe really saw the power of the informal context: the interactions these men have, the expectations on them, how they negotiate with their boss.\u201d For companies, she said, \u201cit\u2019s about creating a culture in which men can be fathers and workers.\u201d\n\nMr. Jarecke-Cheng offered a similar prescription: Often, he said, \u201cthere are policies in place but the culture doesn\u2019t support that.\u201d Your company may offer paternity leave, he said, \u201cbut you may work in an environment where your colleagues or your boss are going to look sideways at you.\u201d He argued that bosses had to lead the way in encouraging workers to actually take the benefits they deserved: \u201cPolicy is the talking the talk, but walking the walk from a cultural standpoint is important.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140615103429, "twitter": {"description": "Many dads are far more involved at home than their fathers were.
