It is officially 2016 and with the start of the New Year comes New Year’s resolutions and on the top of many peoples list is staying fit and healthy by working out and burning off those holiday calories.

“Usually if someone comes to me they are trying to change a lifestyle,” explained Adam Hodges, Director of Anderson’s Fitness Center, “Get healthier and more fit and possibly lose weight, I will get them moving first, I will get them set up at our fitness center with a workout program and then we will start working on that diet.”

When gearing up to start working out during the New Year, there are few tips that you can keep in mind to make sure you stay successful when you hit the gym.

“If we can make fun and we can make it effective and start seeing those results and have either your trainer or your friends hold you accountable, you are much more likely to succeed and stay with the workout program,” said Hodges.

By working out with friends or a trainer and by having fun while exercising, it can help make the resolution a habit, and by knowing that progress takes time and results won’t happen overnight is key.

“The more variability that you have in your workout program the more effective it is going to be,” stated Hodges, so if you can and have no limitations and you can do some strength training, you can do cardio by running or elliptical machine or rowing, the best results will come from doing all of those in some combination.”

By finding what fitness routine works for you and keeping a good schedule, it can help you keep the resolution you made for 2016.

“A lot of people think that you need to go in and work out for two hours in order to get results and you have to do that every day but you really don’t,” explained Hodges, “There are very effective ways to work out where you can go in for thirty minutes, get your work out, a very good workout in and go on with your daily activities.”
