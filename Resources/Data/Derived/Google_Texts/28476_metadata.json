Chris Christie of any knowledge or involvement in Bridgegate, Sen. Dianne Feinstein has accused the CIA of spying on Senate staffers and Obamacare is just days away from an important deadline.\n\nBut it\u2019s another story, out of Mississippi, that has really been shortchanged by the news coverage \u2014 and that should have folks in every corner of the country alarmed.\n\nMississippi Republicans are following in the footsteps of many Republican lawmakers before them in trying to tie drug testing to federal assistance. A bill passed the state House earlier this year and the state Senate last week \u2014 and Republican Gov. Phil Bryant promptly signed it into law.\n\nThis is a huge mistake. I say that as someone who\u2019s suspicious of welfare programs and sympathetic to conservatives\u2019 big-government concerns.\n\nSimilar legislation has passed elsewhere and is being considered in half the states; it\u2019s also been struck down in federal courts. Whether Mississippi or other states will be able to overcome the legal arguments is anyone's guess.\n\nI\u2019m no fan of government dependency, and I think most welfare programs either accidentally or deliberately lock people into relying on taxpayer assistance instead of lifting them out of it. I think there are better ways to help people out of poverty and into productivity.\n\nBut the Republican solution \u2014 to tie federal assistance to drug testing \u2014 is more than just silly. It runs contrary to everything conservatives are supposed to stand for.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s undeniably and almost unfathomably a terrific example of the kind of big government conservatives rail against, crossing all kinds of privacy lines.\n\nAnd it\u2019s inefficient government, as lawsuit after lawsuit attempting to figure out just who should be tested and how much authority the state has over federal money has proven.\n\nIt\u2019s also discriminatory and, at least according to some judges, unconstitutional. If receiving federal money is the trigger, what about drug testing everyone else who receives grants, federal loans and public money to start businesses, go to college or buy a home?\n\nDrug testing doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of fiscal sense either. In cases where states have implemented similar requirements \u2014 filling out a questionnaire that\u2019s meant to red flag potential substance abusers and then trigger the drug test - savings were modest. Mississippi state Sen. Terry Burton estimates their bill could actually cost as much as $291,000 if everyone who applied turned out to be a substance abuser.\n\nWorst of all, it\u2019s a non-solution to a very real problem, which is the kind of empty, symbolic politicking conservatives regularly accuse Democrats of engaging in. Just as (honest) Democrats know raising the minimum wage won\u2019t solve income inequality, Republicans should know that denying people federal assistance because they fail a drug test won\u2019t solve poverty or a rising drug epidemic.\n\nAnd proponents of this silly idea use the same emotional arguments Democrats use to sell their silly ideas.\n\n\u201cI see this as a step forward in trying to get people more responsive and back in the productivity,\u201d Capt. Ken Chapman, regional coordinator for the Salvation Army in Jackson, Miss, told the Daily Caller. \u201cIt\u2019s not about condemning people; it\u2019s actually about tough love and giving people a hand up than a handout.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m all for a hand up, but where is it in this legislation? Someone tests positive for drugs, is denied federal assistance and is sent back out onto the streets moneyless and drug addicted. How is he any closer to being solvent or off drugs? How is the community safer when a broke and desperate drug addict is left without anywhere else to go?\n\nThe conservative impulse might be to say, \u201cGet a job,\u201d which we all know in Obama\u2019s economy is harder said than done, and I\u2019d imagine even harder when broke and drug addicted. But equating poverty with criminality is hardly the kind of compassionate conservatism Republicans used to embody.\n\nInstead, thoughtful conservatives should champion more access to job and skills training, online education, faith-based initiatives and private organizations that are creatively solving community problems.\n\nMeantime, Republicans should fight to reform welfare in ways that make government assistance leaner and more efficient, instead of fighting to keep it alive and bureaucratically muck it up even further with symbolic, unworkable amendments that solve no problems.\n\nContact Cupp at www.thesecupp.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "S.E.
