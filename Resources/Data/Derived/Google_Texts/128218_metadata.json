Netanyahu called it a victory \u201cagainst all odds.\u201d The liberals\u2019 optimism has been replaced with devastation \u2014 an infuriating belief that the masses may never understand that logic shows the current path is suicidal.\n\n\u201cDrink cyanide, bloody Neanderthals. You won,\u201d award-winning Israeli author and actress Alona Kimhi wrote on her Facebook page, before erasing it as her comments became the talk of the town. \u201cOnly death with save you from yourselves.\u201d\n\nSuch rage rippled through liberal Israel this week. Social media was full of embittered Israelis accusing Netanyahu\u2019s supporters of racism, and some vowed to stop donating charity to the underprivileged whom they perceived as being automatic supporters of the right.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s main rival denounced such attacks. \u201cAttempts to divide, vilify and spread hate in Israeli society disgust me, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it comes from the right or the left,\u201d wrote Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog on Facebook.\n\nThe anger was about far more than the election, reflecting a larger and more dramatic battle for the face of the country.\n\nIsrael\u2019s founding fathers were Jews of Ashkenazi, or eastern European, descent and the ideological predecessors of the Labor party, the main faction in the rebranded Zionist Union. The left led the country for its first three decades until Likud \u2014 heavily backed by working class Jews of Mizrahi, or Middle Eastern, descent \u2014 gained power in 1977.\n\nThe Labor Party returned to the helm in the 1990s, leading the first efforts at peace with the Palestinians. But the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s saw the return of hawkish rule, which in one form or another has lasted till today.\n\nThe divisions between right and left largely revolve around the question of what do with territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 and the millions of Palestinians who live there.\n\nParties on the left would trade the land for peace and allow the creation of a Palestinian state. They also argue that the lands are a liability, since incorporating the Palestinians as citizens would destroy Israel as a Jewish-majority state.\n\nThe right emphasizes the lands\u2019 strategic value and biblical symbolism and pushes constantly for settling them with Jews. Its success in this endeavor has, paradoxically, put the country on a path toward being a place where Jews may no longer be a strong majority.\n\nWith more than 550,000 Israeli settlers now living in territories claimed by the Palestinians, Israeli liberals \u2014 along with the Palestinians \u2014 believe time is running out for the \u201ctwo-state solution.\u201d So compelling is this \u201cdemographic argument\u201d that Netanyahu himself has adopted its language, claiming at various times since 2009 that he, too, wants to end the occupation; but his party opposes this and Netanyahu continues to support the settlements, leading opponents to believe he is bamboozling them and adding to the sense of urgency.\n\nActivists at the headquarters of V-15, an initiative that called to unseat Netanyahu, silently bundled dozens of banners on Thursday, and one activist asked a journalist to leave. A whole floor of the Zionist Union\u2019s campaign headquarters was empty, and party leaders gazed up from crumpled posters next to a vacuum cleaner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big disappointment. There was a lot of energy for change here,\u201d said Zev Laderman, an investor in start-up companies, sitting in a boulevard cafe. \u201cI woke up this morning to realize that I\u2019m a minority in this country.\u201d\n\nThe center-left\u2019s Zionist Union won 24 seats \u2014 somewhat higher than the combined previous total of the two parties that form it \u2014 but Likud won 30. Another 37 seats were captured by parties believed to be willing to support Likud for a solid majority in the 120-member parliament. And the left-wing Meretz party will now be the smallest party in the upcoming government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For liberal Israelis, Netanyahu\u2019s win is a reality check", "title": "For liberal Israelis, Netanyahu\u2019s win is a reality check", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For liberal Israelis, Netanyahu\u2019s win is a reality check", "title": "For liberal Israelis, Netanyahu\u2019s win is a reality check", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/for_liberal_israelis_netanyahus_win_is_a_reality_check/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mideast-israel-dejected-left.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For liberal Israelis, Netanyahu\u2019s win is a reality check", "title": "For liberal Israelis, Netanyahu\u2019s win is a reality check", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mideast-israel-dejected-left.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel Estrin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOnly death with save you from yourselves.\u201dSuch rage rippled through liberal Israel this week.\nYou won,\u201d award-winning Israeli author and actress Alona Kimhi wrote on her Facebook page, before erasing it as her comments became the talk of the town.\nThe Labor Party returned to the helm in the 1990s, leading the first efforts at peace with the Palestinians.\nAnother 37 seats were captured by parties believed to be willing to support Likud for a solid majority in the 120-member parliament.\nThey also argue that the lands are a liability, since incorporating the Palestinians as citizens would destroy Israel as a Jewish-majority state."}
