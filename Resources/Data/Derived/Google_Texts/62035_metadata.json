It\u2019s called The Red Pill.\n\nIf you\u2019ve paid attention to Breitbart, you\u2019ve probably seen the headlines and the content: a feminist set out to make a documentary about Men\u2019s Rights Activists (MRAs), and while she was there, she started to question her beliefs. When it came time to fund the film, she found a few hurdles: executive producers wanted creative control and had a particular vision for the film (not uncommon, really); also that it didn\u2019t fit the standard feminist criteria for the grants she would have applied for, and her applications were rejected under the human rights criteria, for reasons that haven\u2019t been elaborated upon.\n\nThe public was told by certain writers that feminists were \u201cin a meltdown\u201d about this film.\n\nDavid Futrelle, of We Hunted the Mammoth, composed an open letter to the director of the film, Cassie Jaye, questioning her motives and declining a previous request for an interview. Besides that, a search of popular feminist websites Jezebel, Bustle, and Feministing for either Jaye\u2019s name or mention of the film result in literally no search results.\n\nSo where are all these outraged, angry feminists who are \u201cmelting down\u201d over this film? Where\u2019s the feminist critique?\n\nHere\u2019s a mild post from a feminist blogger known for critiquing the \u201cmanosphere\u201d who stated she \u201cwon\u2019t be donating. I\u2019ve heard enough of woman hating to last me a lifetime.\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s a far cry from \u201cmelting down\u201d and attempting to keep a film from being seen. Another post expresses disappointment that Jaye didn\u2019t request an interview with her as she\u2019s been researching the claims made by the Men\u2019s Rights Movement (MRM) for years, and tells Jaye \u201cYou\u2019re free to do what you will Cassie\u201d while warning that the MRM is not going to be as friendly as she thinks.\n\nI\u2019d like to point out something that should be obvious to my fellow free-market types, but seems to require stating: deciding not to fund a film does not equate to seeking to censor it. If I refuse to buy something it doesn\u2019t mean I support it being banned. I\u2019m getting really tired of the rhetoric that by not wishing to support something, someone is actively \u201cagainst\u201d it.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt Jaye has likely received emails from all sorts of people about her views and what little the public knows about her documentary \u2013 and certainly some may have been hostile feminists, or hostile MRAs, or just general internet trolls. She stated in her Reddit AMA and interviews that a number of people didn\u2019t want to work on her film because it was taking on the topic of the Men\u2019s Rights Movement without being a feminist perspective on it. She also said an intern was watching interview footage and was having panic attacks and didn\u2019t want to work on it anymore.\n\nI also don\u2019t doubt that there are plenty of feminist trolls and sock-puppets out there. This is a common thing within the MRM as well. The previously mentioned blogger actually documented a ton of obnoxious comments during a Livestream interview with a well-known Gamergater. I think it\u2019s worth noting that in regards to comments and tweets on the internet: if you\u2019re going to freak out about hostility from feminists, you might want to check out the comments from some MRA folks. I believe there\u2019s a glass house and some stones to check.\n\nSince the media that has bothered covering the story of this film has mentioned hostility from feminists, it is important to note the other interesting problems Jaye has dealt with since she began filming. From Vocativ \u2014\n\n\u201cIt turns out Jaye understands fear of MRAs. \u201cI luckily moved recently,\u201d she said toward the end of our nearly three-hour-long conversation, explaining that some of the men she interviewed had her home address. \u201cI was really glad to move.\u201d Such is the conflicted and at times contradictory nature of her relationship to MRAs. On nearly a dozen occasions, she received calls in the middle of the night from one of her MRA subjects. (There were multiple emails, too.) Jaye implied that her repeat caller had on the mind what one might charitably call romance\u2014but that isn\u2019t her only worry. \u201cI think any bad seeds would probably want to see the film first before taking me down,\u201d she said with a laugh. What if they do see the film and view it as unfavorable, though? \u201cI guess I could go into hiding,\u201d Jaye said. \u201cDo I want to have any kind of allegiance to them to make sure I\u2019m not harmed in the end?\u201d She paused, the question lingering, and then explained that her video diaries show her reacting negatively to the MRAs, but that those clips were part of her early \u201cevolution\u201d on the subject. \u201cI think that protects me from people wanting to attack what I said then,\u201d she said. The implication seemingly being that the position she ultimately came to would not make MRAs angry with her. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be OK,\u201d she said.\u201d\n\nFrankly, I\u2019ve seen some casual commentary from both feminist and MRA sides to worry about Jaye. Not that I think she\u2019s in physical danger, or has been brainwashed, or is seeking brownie points from \u201cTHE MEN\u201d, but that by refusing to pick a side, she\u2019s unfortunately lacking in many \u201ceasy\u201d ideological allies (\u201cfeminist good/MRA bad\u201d, or vice versa). It\u2019s something I\u2019m used to myself, as a libertarian feminist blogger who often discusses men\u2019s rights issues such as false rape accusations, paternity rights and circumcision, but I\u2019ve never done something as big as her project, nor attracted so much ire for it. I know that many on both the feminist and MRA sides don\u2019t trust her and I find that unfortunate, for both them and her.\n\nThere are those of us out there who do attend conferences and sit in on talks from the other side. Many of us refuse to get caught up in a gender war, and believe it is possible to fight for men\u2019s rights while being a feminist, because rejection of traditional gender roles will benefit men on issues like conscription and more.\n\nI contributed money to Jaye\u2019s Kickstarter campaign myself, because I want to see what she made. Because I think humanizing people is good. Maybe I\u2019ll watch it and fact check it the entire time. Maybe I\u2019ll hate how she depicted one or both movements. Maybe her movie will inspire a bunch of articles from me. I don\u2019t know yet, but I won\u2019t get to decide how to react to the content of the film until I\u2019ve gotten to see it, and that\u2019s worth my money.\n\nOne thing is for sure \u2013 Cassie Jaye has made a film which may change the conversation. By validating people, by encouraging closer looks, and by being willing to explore doubt. Maybe there are feminists out there that are worried she\u2019s offering legitimacy to those they don\u2019t want to have any, but this feminist is curious what productive purpose MRAs could do with a little good press.\n\nIf Jaye\u2019s felt \u201cabandoned\u201d by feminism lately, I\u2019m here to remind her and the rest of the sensationalist blogosphere that some of us feminists are perfectly fine with hearing other views and supporting free speech and I see her as a brave individual searching for truth \u2013 and when I see her film I can find out if she\u2019s found it yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're told \"feminists don't want you to see The Red Pill\", but what does that mean?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "We're told \"feminists don't want you to see The Red Pill\", but what does that mean?", "title": "This Feminist Donated To \"The Red Pill\" Kickstarter...
