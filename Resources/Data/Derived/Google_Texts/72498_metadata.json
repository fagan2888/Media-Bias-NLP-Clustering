And I\u2019ve been there so long. So surprised would be an understatement. I thought I had put myself in a really good place to be in the Rockies\u2019 bullpen next season.\u201d\n\nBrothers, 27, was selected by the Rockies as a supplemental pick in the first round in the 2009 draft. He was designated for assignment Friday along with veteran closer John Axford, catcher/first baseman Wilin Rosario and right-hander reliever Tommy Kahnle. The moves were made as general manager Jeff Bridich overhauled Colorado\u2019s 40-man roster.\n\nThe Rockies have a 10-day window in which they can trade Axford, Brothers, Rosario and Kahnle. If the club can\u2019t work out a trade in that time frame and the player clears waivers, Axford, Brothers and Rosario can elect free agency because they all have at least three years of service time. Kahnle, however, does not have three years of service, so he can be outrighted to the minors and remain in the organization if he clears waivers.\n\nExplaining the decision to part ways with Brothers, Bridich said: \u201cIt was just time for a fresh start for everybody involved.\u201d\n\nBrothers agreed, once the shock wore off.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way you can look at it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was told about it (Friday), I sure didn\u2019t think it was a breath of fresh air, but now I definitely do. I think I\u2019m in a really good place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m always working on my craft. I\u2019m ready for what\u2019s next. I\u2019m not just paying lip service when I say that I think my best days in the game are ahead of me.\u201d\n\nBrothers was one of the best lefty relievers in baseball in 2013 when he posted an overall 1.74 ERA and notched 19 saves in 21 opportunities when he took over as closer in the second half of the season. He was penciled in as the Rockies\u2019 future closer, but he struggled mightily in 2014 when his ERA soared to 5.58 and his mechanics got out of kilter.\n\nHe spent much of the 2015 season at Triple-A Albuquerque, but his velocity returned and his fastball touched 97 mph at times. In 45 appearances at Triple-A, he had a 4.46 ERA. In 17 appearances with the Rockies, he posted a 1.74 ERA.\n\nBrothers puts the blame for his struggles on himself.\n\n\u201cI got to a spot where I was laboring a little bit physically, had a couple of bad outings and started searching for the success I had,\u201d Brothers said. \u201cI think I got away from the athleticism that helped my success. I got away from that aggressiveness.\n\n\u201cBut that was not because of a pitching coach or anybody else. Looking back on it, I think I backed myself into a corner and I had to start back from square one. I think, now, I\u2019ve got that competitive fire back. I think I was showing that again this past season.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Nick Groke contributed to this report.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rex Brothers shocked by Rockies\u2019 move, but confident in bright future", "title": "Rex Brothers shocked by Rockies\u2019 move, but confident in bright future", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/21/rex-brothers-shocked-by-rockies-move-but-confident-in-bright-future/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__SP04BBNROCKIES_2JL8860p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__SP04BBNROCKIES_2JL8860p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T17:02:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:07:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Rockies have a 10-day window in which they can trade Axford, Brothers, Rosario and Kahnle.\nBrothers also said, quite pointedly, that he doesn\u2019t blame the Rockies for his poor performance over the last two seasons.\nI think I\u2019m in a really good place.\nHe was designated for assignment Friday along with veteran closer John Axford, catcher/first baseman Wilin Rosario and right-hander reliever Tommy Kahnle.\nHe was penciled in as the Rockies\u2019 future closer, but he struggled mightily in 2014 when his ERA soared to 5.58 and his mechanics got out of kilter."}
