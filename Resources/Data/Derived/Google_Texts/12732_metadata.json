Further, a key strategy is to expand and diversify its care continuum beyond inpatient acute care services as well as develop greater health plan capabilities.\n\nLIGHT DEBT BURDEN: Ascension's light debt burden is viewed as a key credit strength which will allow for solid debt coverage should profitability be compressed going forward. Maximum annual debt service (MADS) equates to a light 1.8% of annualized 2014 total revenues which is lower than the 'AA' category median of 2.6%. MADS coverage by net and operating EBITDA through the nine months ended March 31, 2014 was a strong 5.7x and 5.2x, respectively.\n\nROBUST LIQUIDITY: At March 31 2014, Ascension's unrestricted cash and investments increased to $12.7 billion from $9.7 billion at the end of third quarter 2013 (3Q'13). Liquidity metrics remain strong relative to Fitch's 'AA' category median, with days cash on hand of 252.6, a cushion ratio of 35.8x and cash to debt of 200.4%.\n\nSTRONG MANAGEMENT PRACTICES: While Ascension's sheer size could present a challenge in its ability to react quickly to the rapidly changing health care delivery environment, Fitch views Ascension's management practices and information systems as a credit strength which should allow the organization to successfully navigate the changing landscape. Management continues to drive greater efficiencies through a consolidation of redundant services, has demonstrated a willingness to create joint venture partnerships where appropriate, and divest money-losing/poorly positioned operations.\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES:\n\nPROFITABILITY DETERIORATION: While Ascension's light debt burden and strong liquidity provide significant credit strength, a sustained deterioration in profitability due to weaker core operations (i.e. declining clinical volumes, weaker reimbursement, etc.) would likely result in negative rating action.\n\nSECURITY:\n\nSenior bonds are secured by a security interest in the pledged revenues of the Senior Credit Group.\n\nCREDIT SUMMARY:\n\nAscension, headquartered in St. Louis, MO, is the largest Catholic-sponsored health care provider in the United States. The System operates 102 general acute care hospitals, 69 outpatient surgery centers, 372 primary care clinics and over 4,900 employed physicians located across 23 states and the District of Columbia. On a fully consolidated basis, Ascension Health Alliance reported total revenues of $17.1 billion in fiscal 2013.\n\nBROAD OPERATING FOOTPRINT\n\nAscension's wide geographic diversity and large scale of operations make it unique among Fitch's not-for-profit healthcare systems. Fitch views Ascension's broad operating footprint as a credit strength as it helps to insulate the system from adverse economic, demographic and operational challenges in any one of its markets. The diversity of its markets allows Ascension's management team to identify industry changes and test strategies that can then be exported throughout the system. Through its various subsidiaries, Ascension has been able to test new technologies and incubate various strategies without putting the enterprise at risk. Ascension has been expanding its presence in non-acute service lines such as long-term care, home health, senior housing and outpatient rehabilitation in an effort to prepare for value-based reimbursement models. Ascension has entered into a variety of risk-based reimbursement contracts in various markets to develop knowledge and expertise for the expected growth in value-based reimbursement models.\n\nSimilarly, Ascension has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire a multi-state health insurance company to accelerate and expand its health plan capabilities to support risk-based contracting and health management services including third party administration. The completion of the proposed transaction is subject to the parties executing final definitive agreements and obtaining all necessary approvals. According to management, the purchase price would not be material to Ascension's financial or operational profile with closing possible by the end of calendar year 3Q'14.\n\nLIGHT DEBT BURDEN\n\nAscension's light debt burden is considered a key credit strength. Fitch used MADS of $355.6 million (which includes certain debt of Alexian Brothers, St. John Health System and Ministry Health system, formerly part of Marian Health System, that remains outside the Ascension Credit Group) which equates to a light 1.8% of annualized fiscal 2014 revenues. Debt-to-capitalization at March 31, 2014 was 26.1% which compares favorably to the 'AA' median of 31.1%. Ascension's light debt burden, combined with adequate profitability for the rating category generates strong coverage of debt service. Historical coverage of MADS by EBITDA was a very solid 5.7x in fiscal 2013 and remained steady at 5.7x through the nine-month interim period. Fitch notes that MADS coverage for 2013 is understated in light of only three months of revenues from the Marian Health System transaction being reflected in consolidated audited results.\n\nAlthough light relative to Fitch's 'AA' category medians, Ascension's operating profitability has been fairly stable over the last four fiscal years. Operating margins from recurring operations have ranged between 2.8% and 4% while operating EBITDA margins from recurring operations have ranged between 8.1% and 9.5% over that period. Through the nine months ended March 31, 2014, Ascension generated $1.38 billion of operating EBITDA on total revenues of $15 billion, resulting in a 9.2% operating EBITDA margin from recurring operations. Operating results reflect the system's continued investment in physician alignment and sub-acute business lines, its on-going investment in its Symphony software platform and softer clinical volumes and payor mix. Ascension's strong liquidity and light debt burden currently offset any concerns regarding the somewhat compressed operating profitability relative to the 'AA' category median.\n\nROBUST LIQUIDITY\n\nAscension's strong liquidity position provides a substantial financial cushion as the system positions itself for the changes anticipated under the Affordable Care Act and further executes its strategic plan. At March 31, 2014, unrestricted cash and investments improved to $12.7 billion from $9.7 billion at 3Q 2013 reflecting the addition of the systems formerly affiliated with Marian Health System, and strong investment returns. Ascension's liquidity ratios compare favorably to Fitch's 'AA' category medians with days cash on hand of 252.6, cushion ratio of 35.8x and cash-to-debt of 200.4%.\n\nSTRONG MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\n\nWhile Ascension's sheer size could present a challenge to its ability to react quickly to the rapidly changing health care delivery environment, Fitch views Ascension's management practices as a credit strength which should allow the organization to successfully navigate the changing landscape. Ascension's substantial investment in its Symphony information and enterprise risk management platform is nearing its completion with 21 of 25 Ministry Organizations expected to be fully operational by the end of 2014. Fitch believes this will improve information flow allowing for timely decisionmaking and identifying additional areas ready for further operational efficiencies. Ascension has demonstrated a willingness to create joint venture partnerships where appropriate, test strategies that can be exported through the system and divest money-losing/poorly positioned operations. Additionally, Fitch believes Ascension is very well positioned as a preferred merger partner, particularly among religion-sponsored providers, as the not-for-profit health sector further consolidates in response to healthcare reform.\n\nSELF-LIQUIDITY\n\nThe 'F1+' rating is based on the sufficiency of Ascension's liquid resources and written procedures to fund any un-remarketed variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) and multi-annual put bonds. As of Aug. 31, 2014, the corporation had a total of $587 million of tax exempt weekly VRDBs, $393 million of variable-rate bonds in seven-month Windows mode and approximately $40.8 million of multi-annual put bonds which come due within 90 days that are supported by Ascension's internal liquidity. Ascension has a taxable CP program which has been authorized up to $1 billion of which there were no amounts outstanding at Aug. 31, 2014. Ascension has staggered the put dates on its multi-annual puts such that Ascension's maximum put exposure in any given week including its weekly VRDBs and multi-annual puts supported by self-liquidity is approximately $668 million in the next 13 months. Liquidity is supplemented by a $1 billion line of credit which has an expiration date of Nov. 9, 2014. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. acts as the administrative agent on the line of credit. Based on Fitch's Rating Criteria related to Self-Liquidity, Ascension had 'eligible' cash and investments (including bank credit facilities) in excess of the 125% threshold of its maximum put exposure for assignment of the 'F1+' rating.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nAscension has covenanted to provide audited financial information and annual operating data within 180 days of each fiscal year end and quarterly unaudited financial information for the first three quarters within 60 days of each fiscal quarter end. The annual and quarterly financial releases and all notices of material events will be filed by the bond trustee with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's EMMA system. Additionally, Ascension has made annual and quarterly financial information available on its website at www.ascensionhealth.org. Fitch views Ascension's disclosure content and practices positively.\n\nAdditional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.\n\nApplicable Criteria and Related Research:\n\n--'U.S. Nonprofit Hospitals and Health Systems Rating Criteria' (May 30, 2014);\n\n--'Revenue Supported Rating Criteria' (June 16, 2014);\n\n--Rating U.S. Public Finance Short-Term Debt (Dec. 9, 2013).\n\nApplicable Criteria and Related Research:\n\nRating U.S. Public Finance Short-Term Debt\n\nhttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=724680\n\nRevenue-Supported Rating Criteria\n\nhttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=750012\n\nU.S. Nonprofit Hospitals and Health Systems Rating Criteria\n\nhttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=746860\n\nAdditional Disclosure\n\nSolicitation Status\n\nhttp://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=872794\n\nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
