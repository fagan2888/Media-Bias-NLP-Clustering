Sept. 15, 2015 (Photo: By Michael Clevenger/The Courier)\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Jack Conway and Republican Matt Bevin traded more barbs in a bitter debate Tuesday over same-sex marriage, state pensions and the racial makeup of trustees at the University of Louisville.\n\nBut the rivalry was put at ease at times by independent candidate Drew Curtis, a digital entrepreneur who touted his technology background as a unique qualification to move the state forward.\n\nThe debate \u2014 sponsored by The Courier-Journal and its Bluegrass Poll partners, the Lexington Herald-Leader, WHAS-TV and WKYT-TV in Lexington \u2014 was held at Bellarmine University and was the first televised debate of the campaign.\n\nThroughout the hourlong event, Bevin sought to draw blood as he accused Conway of failing to defend the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage or challenge racial inequalities on the U of L Board.\n\nConway, who was visibly sweating, responded with attacks over Bevin\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns and called his approach to Medicaid expansion \u201ccallous,\u201d saying Bevin plans to kick half a million people off the program.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never worked in the real world,\u201d Bevin told Conway in one tense moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve hidden behind false promises and hidden behind your political jobs over the years. You saying you will do your job once you're governor, but you won\u2019t do it as attorney general, is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe charge came as Bevin took aim at Conway over his decision not to appeal a U.S. District Court opinion striking down Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nBut Conway sought to make his case, saying that good-paying jobs will only come to Kentucky if the state embraces an inclusive atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t want to do was waste hundreds of thousands of dollars defending a case that ultimately we weren\u2019t going to win,\u201d he said.\n\nConway argued that Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis went to jail because she defied a court order to issue marriage licenses following the Supreme Court's subsequent ruling for gay marriage. \u201cI have sympathy for her, but we are a nation of laws,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue of how to address Kentucky\u2019s multibillion dollar pension liabilities, Bevin said he supports moving teachers onto a defined contribution plan, but Conway disagreed, saying it would be unfair to teachers, who are not eligible for Social Security benefits.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Jack Conway speaks to media after Bluegrass Poll debate at Bellarmine University.\n\nConway noted that it will take many years to dig out of more than $30 billion in unfunded liabilities in all the pension systems combined. He said he looked forward to recommendations of a task force appointed by Gov. Steve Beshear to address the liabilities of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System.\n\nCurtis proposed using bonds that would serve as a line of credit for KTRS if there is a bad year with investments.\n\nAsked about how he would fund his education platform that calls for more investment in early childhood education, Conway gave only a general answer and threw a jab at Bevin. \u201cIf we\u2019re fiscally responsible we can certainly make it happen,\u201d Conway said. \u201c\u2026But we have an opponent in this race who said that early childhood education serves no purpose, that kids forget it all by the age of nine.\u201d\n\nThat was a reference to Bevin\u2019s comments on the issue in a debate during the Republican primary. But Bevin said in Tuesday night\u2019s debate, \u201cTo assume that I am not a proponent of early childhood education is nonsense. I have nine children for crying out loud. \u2026 This is critical, we have got to spend the money there, but let\u2019s be good stewards of those dollars.\u201d\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Drew Curtis, creator of Fark.com speaks to the media after Bluegrass Poll debate at Bellarmine University.\n\nCurtis said he\u2019s a strong proponent of early childhood education and other worthy programs. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019ve got to actually have the money that comes from somewhere,\u201d Curtis said. \u201c\u2026 But we just don\u2019t have the money.\u201d\n\nBevin jabbed at Conway, saying he didn't act as attorney general to challenge Beshear\u2019s failure to comply with a law requiring appointment of at least one African American to the current University of Louisville Board of Trustees.\n\nConway\u2019s reply was that he will appoint African Americans to the U of L Board \u2014 an answer Bevin called \u201ca cop-out\u201d because it did not answer his question.\n\nThe two also tangled over the sexual harassment complaints filed in 2013 by legislative staffers against former state Rep. John Arnold, D-Sturgis, which this summer ended in the legislative branch paying a $400,000 civil settlement to the staffers.\n\n\u201cThat really didn\u2019t have to do with the office of the attorney general,\" Conway said. \u201c... I can tell you this, when I became attorney general I think half of my directors were women.\u201d\n\nBevin said the settlement, paid by taxpayers, \u201cfor the absolute shenanigans that went on, the sexual harassment that went on in Frankfort\" was unacceptable. He added that Conway\u2019s running mate Rep. Sannie Overly, Paris, resisted a deposition in the civil suit and did not speak up for the female staffers.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Matt Bevin speaks to media after Bluegrass Poll debate at Bellarmine University Tuesday night. Matt Stone, The Courier-Journal\n\nConway, meanwhile, targeted Bevin\u2019s position on Medicaid expansion.\n\nBevin was asked about his contrasting statements on Medicaid, which have varied from reversing expansion of the program to tweaking it.\n\nBevin said Kentucky cannot continue to have up to 30 percent of the state enrolled in Medicaid and that he wants to apply for federal waivers, using the money to customize a solution specifically for Kentucky.\n\n\u201cWe want to have as many Kentuckians as we possibly can covered with as much health care as possible at the most affordable price,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Conway seized on Bevin\u2019s contradictory comments, charging that Bevin would kick half a million people off health insurance.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t afford something in 2021, we can always scale back but I think the action that Mr. Bevin proposes is callous,\u201d Conway said, explaining that he would instead build on the work of Beshear.\n\nCurtis argued that since Kentucky has already transitioned so many people onto the program, he would leave it alone.\n\nBeshear chose to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\n\nThe plan calls on the federal government to pay the full cost of Medicaid expansion in the first years of the ACA, but beginning in 2016-17, the expansion is estimated to require $74 million in state allocations. That tab will increase each year until 2021 as states pay a larger percentage of the cost of Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe Beshear administration says other impacts of the policy will reduce state costs elsewhere and increase state revenues and that expansion overall will have a net positive impact to the state budget until 2021.\n\nThough Conway and Bevin have appeared together on several occasions, including Fancy Farm in Western Kentucky earlier this year, Tuesday\u2019s showdown at Bellarmine University provided many voters with the first chance to compare the candidates side by side.\n\nIn one of the most notable responses of the night, Conway noted that he \"even has a female dog\" while listing strong women in his family and who have worked with him. The response came after he was asked about making Kentucky safer for women.\n\nAfter Bevin replied to a question about releasing his tax returns by calling the issue a \"smokescreen,\" Curtis, who was next, said, \"I'll actually answer this question.\" After laughter from the audience, Curtis went on to say that he would release his returns and even have people over to his house for tours.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Fe79V9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Early in their first televised debate Tuesday Democrat Attorney General Jack Conway sought to draw blood from his Republican opponent Matt Bevin, calling his position on the Medicaid expansion \u201ccallous\u201d and saying it end care for thousands of Kentuck", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Early in their first televised debate Tuesday Democrat Attorney General Jack Conway sought to draw blood from his Republican opponent Matt Bevin, calling his position on the Medicaid expansion \u201ccallous\u201d and saying it end care for thousands of Kentuck", "title": "Conway, Bevin spew venom in debate", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2015/09/15/conway-goes-after-bevin-early-debate/72255392/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Early in their first televised debate Tuesday Democrat Attorney General Jack Conway sought to draw blood from his Republican opponent Matt Bevin, calling his position on the Medicaid expansion \u201ccallous\u201d and saying it end care for thousands of Kentuck", "title": "Conway, Bevin spew venom in debate", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ec7907fae1aa545e0ca5bfadd4bc864040f6c98/c=520-0-3106-2586&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/15/Louisville/Louisville/635779418350554564-EarlyBluegrassDebate-2.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Bellarmine University", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Bellarmine University", "title": "Conway, Bevin spew venom in debate", "author": "Tom Loftus, Mike Wynn, and Phillip M.
