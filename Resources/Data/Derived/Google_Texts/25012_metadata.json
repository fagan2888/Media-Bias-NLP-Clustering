If so, you might be debating on whether or not to take a sick day from work. But how do you tell when you're too sick to function?\n\nAt least a quarter of workers will choose to head to work while sick. The number one fear -- having too much work to catch up on the when they return.\n\nHere's a mental check list of sorts you can go through to decide, stay home or go to work.\n\nFirst, if you're starting to feel sick, doctors say you are highly contagious right when you start feeling symptoms. And by staying home when everything starts, you may be able to sleep it off.\n\nBut, if you've had symptoms for a few days and went into work, doctors advise you to take a day to allow your body to recover.\n\nIf you have a fever, doctors say take it easy on the couch for the day. That's especially if your thermometer reads over 100-degrees. Then away from work until your fever is gone for 24 hours.\n\nIf you feel you won't get a lot of work done due to your symptoms, just call out then as well.\n\nHere's a big one. You might want to take a day off if you're taking antibiotics or other medications that have side effects. One example, if it may cause drowsiness. That could make it dangerous driving to work or using heavy equipment.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Did you wake up with a runny nose and a nasty cough?\u00a0If so, you might be debating on whether or not to take a sick day from work.\u00a0But how do you tell when you're too sick to function?", "author": "Justin Dougherty", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30704793/when-should-you-call-in-sick", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9422537_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Did you wake up with a runny nose and a nasty cough?\u00a0If so, you might be debating on whether or not to take a sick day from work.\u00a0But how do you tell when you're too sick to function?", "title": "When Should You Call In Sick?"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9422537_G.jpg", "description": "Did you wake up with a runny nose and a nasty cough?\u00a0If so, you might be debating on whether or not to take a sick day from work.\u00a0But how do you tell when you're too sick to function?", "card": "summary", "title": "When Should You Call In Sick?"}, "wnreadableurl": "when-should-you-call-in-sick", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/09", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, call in sick, checklist, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS10", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, call in sick, checklist, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "article_summary": "If so, you might be debating on whether or not to take a sick day from work.\nFirst, if you're starting to feel sick, doctors say you are highly contagious right when you start feeling symptoms.\nIf you have a fever, doctors say take it easy on the couch for the day.\nAt least a quarter of workers will choose to head to work while sick.\nBut how do you tell when you're too sick to function?"}
