A semi driven by a 31-year-old Peoria, Ill., man smashed into the disabled Taurus before rear-ending the Jetta and Caravan.\n\nA 27-year-old Lake Geneva woman sitting in the front passenger seat of the Jetta was killed, while two Lake Geneva boys, 6 and 9, sitting in the back seat suffered life-threatening injuries. The Jetta driver, a 29-year-old Lake Geneva man, suffered injuries that weren't considered life-threatening. Also injured were three Deerfield residents in the Dodge Caravan: two women, 23 and 49, and a 51-year-old man. The Taurus driver, who was arrested by Beloit police on suspicion of homicide by drunken driving, suffered injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe State Patrol did not release the names of those involved.\n\nIn the second accident, at 8:20 a.m. Sunday, a northbound semi driven by David V. Juneau, 65, of South Dakota crossed from the right lane over into the median and then into the right lane of southbound traffic, colliding with a pickup truck near Janesville, the State Patrol said. The pickup driver Terry G. Sportsman, 34, of Sycamore, Ill., was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJuneau suffered injuries that weren't life-threatening.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Woman dies, 7 hurt after cars stop to help at highway spinout", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/woman-dies-7-hurt-after-cars-stop-to-help-at-highway-spinout-b99519398z1-307308641.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "One person was killed and seven injured when a drunken driver crashed her car on I-39/90 in Rock County and two vehicles that stopped to help were struck by a semitrailer truck Saturday night, authorities said.", "title": "Woman dies, 7 hurt after cars stop to help highway spinout"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "One person was killed and seven injured when a drunken driver crashed her car on I-39/90 in Rock County and two vehicles that stopped to help were struck by a semitrailer truck Saturday night, authorities said.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "title": "Woman dies, 7 hurt after cars stop to help at highway spinout"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28ca\"", "article_summary": "The Jetta driver, a 29-year-old Lake Geneva man, suffered injuries that weren't considered life-threatening.\nThe Taurus driver, who was arrested by Beloit police on suspicion of homicide by drunken driving, suffered injuries that were not life-threatening.\nJuneau suffered injuries that weren't life-threatening.\nA 27-year-old Lake Geneva woman sitting in the front passenger seat of the Jetta was killed, while two Lake Geneva boys, 6 and 9, sitting in the back seat suffered life-threatening injuries.\nA semi driven by a 31-year-old Peoria, Ill., man smashed into the disabled Taurus before rear-ending the Jetta and Caravan."}
