I didn\u2019t sleep well actually. The memories from two years ago were a little bit difficult.\u201d\n\nNo. 10 Carla Suarez Navarro advanced in straight sets, while No. 17 Sara Errani was the first of the seeded women eliminated with a 1-6, 7-5, 6-1 loss to Margarita Gasparyan. No. 24 Sloane Stephens, who beat Serena Williams in the 2013 Australian Open quarterfinals, went out in a 6-3, 6-3 loss to Chinese qualifier Wang Qiang.\n\nNo. 7 Kei Nishikori was the first of the seeded men\u2019s players to advance, beating Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.\n\nNo. 15 David Goffin had a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Sergiy Stakhovsky, and No. 22 Ivo Karlovic was the first of the seeded players to exit the tournament when he retired due to a left knee injury in the third set while trailing Federico Delbonis 7-6 (4), 6-4, 2-1.\n\nThe hours before the tournament began were overshadowed by reports alleging a number of players were suspected of being involved in match-fixing but had been allowed to continue playing.\n\nThe ATP, which runs the men\u2019s tour, and Nigel Willerton, head of the Tennis Integrity Unit, represented the four governing bodies of tennis \u2014 the ATP, the WTA, the Grand Slam Board and the International Tennis Federation \u2014 in a joint news conference to reject the allegations published by the BBC and BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe reports said secret files exposed evidence of widespread suspected match-fixing at the top level of world tennis. The report said that in the last decade 16 players \u2014 all at some stage ranked in the top 50 \u2014 have been repeatedly flagged to the integrity unit.\n\nThe reports say the players \u2014 it doesn\u2019t identify them \u2014 were allowed to continue competing.\n\nATP chairman Chris Kermode said tennis authorities \u201cabsolutely reject any suggestion that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed for any reason, or isn\u2019t being investigated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have stringent procedures and sanctions in place to deal with any suspected corruption and have shown we will act decisively when our integrity rules are broken,\u201d Kermode said. \u201cNo player or official is immune \u2026 Investigations follow where evidence leads.\u201d\n\nTennis Integrity Unit investigations have resulted in 18 successful disciplinary cases, including five players and one official who have been banned from the sport for life.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bright start: Serena Williams advances at Australian Open", "title": "Bright start: Serena Williams advances at Australian Open", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/bright-start-serena-williams-advances-at-australian-open/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__ten-williamsp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__ten-williamsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T21:32:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:13:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "24 Sloane Stephens, who beat Serena Williams in the 2013 Australian Open quarterfinals, went out in a 6-3, 6-3 loss to Chinese qualifier Wang Qiang.\n15 David Goffin had a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Sergiy Stakhovsky, and No.\n7 Kei Nishikori was the first of the seeded men\u2019s players to advance, beating Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.\nMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Serena Williams made a bright start to her Australian Open title defense, holding up one finger and twirling in her neon yellow two-piece outfit to mark victory No.\n17 Sara Errani was the first of the seeded women eliminated with a 1-6, 7-5, 6-1 loss to Margarita Gasparyan."}
