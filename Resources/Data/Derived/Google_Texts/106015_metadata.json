The spot tells the story of Pryor\u2019s own battle with cancer, and features the Senator sitting alongside his father, David Pryor:\n\nDAVID: When Mark was diagnosed with cancer, we thought we might lose him. MARK: My family and my faith helped me through the rough times. DAVID: But you know what? Mark\u2019s insurance company didn\u2019t want to pay for the treatment that ultimately saved his life. MARK: No one should be fighting an insurance company while you\u2019re fighting for your life. That\u2019s why I helped pass a law that prevents insurance companies from canceling your policy if you get sick, or deny coverage for preexisting conditions.\n\nThe spot represents an effort to shift the debate over the law away from the land of GOP talking points where it has resided so long \u2014 in this and so many other Senate races \u2014 and back to one of the fundamental moral imperatives driving health reform, i.e., protecting the sick and vulnerable from insurance industry abuse. Republicans have long sought to dominate in the anecdote war \u2014 stressing hyper-exaggerated horror stories about canceled plans and lost coverage \u2014 while refusing to acknowledge the existence of the law\u2019s many beneficiaries. And Dems have been perhaps not engaged on this front forcefully enough, because in places where control of the Senate will be decided, pointing to the folks gaining coverage might not be compelling to the persuadable voters Obamacare has alienated.\n\nIn this ad, Pryor engages the battle over anecdotes by citing his own. Republicans have cast Pryor\u2019s vote for the health law \u2014 and that of most other Dem incumbents \u2014 as proof they are little more than Obama stooges. This ad pushes back by personalizing Pryor\u2019s vote \u2014 its implicit message is that it wasn\u2019t for Obama but rather was born of Pryor\u2019s own personal experience and a moral obligation he felt towards those who might one day endure the same.\n\nIt is also in keeping with the larger strategy of Pryor and other Democrats, who are emphasizing their personal ties to the state, and their families\u2019 political legacies and brands (hence the appearance of Pryor\u2019s father), to survive amid a difficult national environment.\n\nRepublicans will undoubtedly cast this as an acknowledgment that their attacks on Pryor over the law are working and could no longer be ignored. They\u2019ll argue Pryor is, in desperation, using his faith and personal experience as a shield against those attacks. But this misses what\u2019s really going on here. This ad is actually coming at a point where there are signs the anti-Obamacare fires are cooling somewhat. GOP advertising against the law has fallen off sharply, and is surprisingly low in Arkansas. The ad appears geared towards persuadable voters \u2014 particularly women \u2014 who, now that the Affordable Care Act is not quite the albatross it was a few months ago, might now be open to hearing the Democratic case for the law, straight from the candidate.\n\nOne other key nuance: Democrats believe that in many ways the law itself is baked in as a political factor. Polls have shown the public wants to move on from the Obamacare debate. And so, when Republicans attack Pryor (or other Dems) over the law, they are not introducing new information about it \u2014 voters already know Dems voted for it \u2014 but rather are citing this to make voters more receptive to their broader case, i.e., that Democratic incumbents are nothing more than rubber stamps for the larger Obama agenda. By casting his vote as a personal moral choice, Pryor seems to be trying to undercut that argument, too.\n\nPryor\u2019s own brush with mortal illness, of course, makes it easier for him to personalize the issue. But still, if this ad plays well, perhaps we may see other Dems attempt something similar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Mark Pryor makes a personal case for his vote for health reform.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Senator Mark Pryor makes a personal case for his vote for health reform.", "title": "From a vulnerable red state Democrat, a strong pro-Obamacare ad", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/20/from-a-vulnerable-red-state-democrat-a-strong-pro-obamacare-ad/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/07/Capitol__Fiscal_Cliff_03074-1705_new.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/08/20/from-a-vulnerable-red-state-democrat-a-strong-pro-obamacare-ad/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mark pryor, arkansas senate race, tom cotton, obamacare, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mark pryor, arkansas senate race, tom cotton, obamacare, affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b1b\"", "article_summary": "In this ad, Pryor engages the battle over anecdotes by citing his own.\nRepublicans have cast Pryor\u2019s vote for the health law \u2014 and that of most other Dem incumbents \u2014 as proof they are little more than Obama stooges.\nBy casting his vote as a personal moral choice, Pryor seems to be trying to undercut that argument, too.\nBut still, if this ad plays well, perhaps we may see other Dems attempt something similar.\nThis ad is actually coming at a point where there are signs the anti-Obamacare fires are cooling somewhat."}
