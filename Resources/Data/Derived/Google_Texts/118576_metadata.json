Cruz starts by reading the poem \u201cThe Night Before Christmas\u201d only the word \u201cChristmas\u201d is replaced with \u201cshutdown.\u201d If that tickles your funny bone give the ad a look, there\u2019s plenty more where that came from\u2014\u201cHow Obamacare Stole Christmas\u201d and \u201cThe Grinch Who Lost Her Emails.\u201d\n\nCruz was understandably not happy with the cartoon.\n\nClassy. @washingtonpost makes fun of my girls.

All politicians to some extent use Christmas card-like caricatures of their families as political props, but whether that makes them open to scrutiny as public figures has always been open to different interpretations.
