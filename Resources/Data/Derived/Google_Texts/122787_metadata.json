When Wilson saw a sign that indicated I-25 was closed north of Harmony Road in Fort Collins, Wilson exited onto U.S. 34 in Loveland and then went north into Fort Collins on U.S. 287.\n\n\u201cWith everybody getting off on Harmony, I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with that,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nFortunately, I-25 at least was open to Harmony Road. Until Friday evening, parts of the Interstate had been closed from Erie northward.\n\nBob Wing, 70, and a retiree from Lakewood, drove up with his son-in-law and said traffic flowed smoothly along I-25. \u201cExcept for the \u2018rubber-neckers\u2019 who slowed at the Big Thompson (River) to, I guess, see how high it was,\u201d Wing said.\n\n\u201cWe only left (the Denver area) a half-hour early, and we were fine,\u201d he added. \u201cWe would have kicked ourselves in the rear end if we had decided not to come to the game.\u201d\n\nLoveland and Fort Collins had some road closures to navigate , but their residents, for the most part, knew to go take other routes.\n\n\u201cI just happened to pick the right one,\u201d said Marcia Bettger, a 40-year-old teacher in Loveland. \u201cI have to admit, it was more luck than anything \u2014 and knowing my way around town.\u201d\n\nFloyd and Shirley Taladay, who live in a flood-prone area of Fort Collins along Shields Avenue, had been notified by Reverse 911 to be ready to evacuate at some point this weekend if heavy rains returned. But they decided to come to the game, anyway, driving to Moby Arena and riding a university shuttle from there.\n\n\u201cThey should be able to get through the game,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying rain this afternoon or early morning hours. They\u2019re saying we could get one to four. They told us, \u2018If we call again, be ready to move out.'\u201d\n\nBob and Joyce Folbrecht of Fort Collins found themselves in the unusual position of getting to the stadium an hour before kickoff and killing time. \u201cWe knew which roads were closed,\u201d Bob said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here a long time and have found out there\u2019s more than one way to get here. This is earlier than we usually get here because we thought it might take longer, but it really didn\u2019t. We got to park a lot closer than we usually do.\u201d\n\nMichael Johnston drove his classic 24-foot mobile home from Loveland, near the Budweiser Events Center, and was hosting his usual tailgate party in one of the south parking lots. \u201cI had no trouble getting here, but being a local native, I knew what roads to take today.\u201d He laughed and added, \u201cWe had an unfair advantage,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nOne of his long-time tailgate regulars, John Farley, said he left Broomfield about 10:20 a.m. and it took no longer than usual.\n\n\u201cWe went downtown and had some lunch and went to the (CSU) Bookstore and got some new gear,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnston, the tailgate host, voiced what seemed to be a common viewpoint about the decision to play the game as scheduled. \u201cI would have supported it either way they went,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the low turnout, Colorado State athletic director Jack Graham said Saturday he did not regret the decision to have the game played as scheduled. Graham said he was convinced that the game should be played when campus police determined that additional officers were not needed.\n\n\u201cWe did the right thing,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t want to take law enforcement away from helping those impacted by the floods.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU fans navigate routes around flooded areas to the game", "title": "CSU fans navigate routes around flooded areas to the game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/14/csu-fans-navigate-routes-around-flooded-areas-to-the-game/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914_052942_csu-fans.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914_052942_csu-fans.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T14:09:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:41:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e7a\"", "article_summary": "When Wilson saw a sign that indicated I-25 was closed north of Harmony Road in Fort Collins, Wilson exited onto U.S. 34 in Loveland and then went north into Fort Collins on U.S. 287.\n'\u201dBob and Joyce Folbrecht of Fort Collins found themselves in the unusual position of getting to the stadium an hour before kickoff and killing time.\n\u201cWe went downtown and had some lunch and went to the (CSU) Bookstore and got some new gear,\u201d he said.\nGraham said he was convinced that the game should be played when campus police determined that additional officers were not needed.\nBut they decided to come to the game, anyway, driving to Moby Arena and riding a university shuttle from there."}
