President Obama joked Wednesday that the tech-savvy nation of Estonia could have prevented last year’s botched rollout of HealthCare.Gov.

The website, the central hub of the president’s signature domestic achievement, was nothing short of a disaster when it launched last year, frequently crashing and suffering from a host of other technological problems.

The president contrasted those problems with the government of Estonia, which operates a digital identification system for its 1.3 million citizens.

Using a highly protected digital ID card, Estonians are able to use smart phones and other devices to access a wealth of information.

“You’ve become a model for how citizens can interact with their government in the 21st century,” Mr. Obama said at a press conference alongside Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. “With their digital IDs, Estonians can use their smart phones to get just about anything online, from their children’s grades to their health records. I should’ve called the Estonians when we were setting up our health-care website.”
