But two days later, Tenet was dropped from the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index because its market value had fallen so sharply.\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough stretch for the Dallas company, which became a health care giant after a string of mergers and acquisitions. Tenet has roughly doubled its revenue and workforce in the last three years and is now the No. 3 hospital operator in the country.\n\nTenet, whose headquarters is in downtown Dallas, has 130,000 employees \u2014 on par with American Airlines.\n\nEarlier this month, when the S&P said Tenet no longer ranked among the top 500, its market cap had dropped by $3 billion since July. In general, investors have been souring on hospitals because they\u2019re no longer getting much lift from the Affordable Care Act. The law is also pushing to reduce expensive inpatient treatment.\n\nBut Tenet has its own issues, too, starting with the highest debt burden in the business. In the last three years, Tenet\u2019s long-term debt has almost tripled, to $14.4 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s also the overhang of a kickback scandal and whistleblower lawsuit. Tenet disclosed the case several years ago and reserved $20 million to cover it. In February, Tenet provided an update: It has offered $238 million to settle with the government \u2014 and that may not be enough, it said in its annual regulatory filing. Tenet had to increase its litigation reserves for the case, and that led to a net loss of $140 million last year.\n\nTenet had another piece of unusual news. In January, the board was expanded by two seats so it could add directors from a New York hedge fund. Glenview Capital Management, Tenet\u2019s largest investor, with 18 percent of outstanding shares, also has the option of appointing two independent directors next year.\n\nThe refreshed board isn\u2019t waiting to act. \u201cIn light of the decline in the stock price,\u201d long-term stock awards to CEO Trevor Fetter have been cut by 19 percent, the board wrote in its proxy last month.\n\nThat\u2019s a notable hit, even for an executive whose pay package was valued at $15 million last year. It\u2019s also a public message that the pressure is on.\n\n\u201cThe market views our company very differently than it did just seven months ago,\u201d Fetter told analysts in a conference call in February.\n\nGrowth in hospital revenue has slowed for Tenet. And in the fourth quarter, same-hospital admissions and patient days declined from a year earlier.\n\nThe upside from the health law has also been dampened because Texas and Florida, Tenet\u2019s two largest markets, haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid. That would reduce the number of uninsured and reduce uncompensated care in the two states. Tenet doesn\u2019t expect the states to change this year.\n\nTenet\u2019s trials are another example of how the health care industry is adjusting to Obamacare, sometimes painfully. The state\u2019s largest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, has lost about $720 million on exchange customers in the past two years and has been trying to right the business.\n\nThis week, United Health said it would exit the exchanges in most states where it now offers that insurance. Many consumers are also unhappy that narrow provider networks and higher out-of-pocket costs are becoming common.\n\nTenet beefed up in preparation for the post-Obamacare world and was generally cheered on by investors. In addition to buying hospitals, it expanded aggressively into outpatient treatment and management services.\n\nTenet has a relatively small footprint in hospitals in Dallas. With Baylor Scott & White Health, it\u2019s a partner in five hospitals in the area. But it\u2019s a major player in San Antonio, El Paso and Houston, and Texas accounts for a quarter of Tenet\u2019s hospital beds nationwide.\n\nTenet has adopted a new strategy. It no longer plans to grow rapidly through large mergers and acquisitions, Fetter said. And after it finishes four hospital projects early next year, it plans to tap the brakes. Cuts in capital spending are coming soon.\n\nThe new focus has turned to improving operations, expanding margins and increasing cash flow. Tenet recently sold five hospitals in the Atlanta area for $575 million, part of its push to concentrate in locations where it\u2019s one of the top players.\n\nThe new efforts should enable Tenet to pay down debt and buy back stock. Fetter called it \u201ca natural evolution in our strategy.\u201d\n\nLast year, Tenet merged with United Surgical Partners, giving it a major outpatient surgery network. That segment is fast-growing, with higher profit margins.\n\nTenet also operates Conifer, a health business services unit in Frisco. It has over 800 clients, including many in the not-for-profit sector, and 14,500 employees nationwide. That\u2019s another way to diversify and inject a growth element.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going in the right direction,\u201d said Jason McGorman, a senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cOutpatient service generates more cash flow. And if they\u2019re not growing admissions, it\u2019s prudent to pay off debt and maybe buy back stock.\u201d\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t lift Tenet shares, more moves will follow. Hedge funds can get restless fast, especially when they\u2019re on the board.\n\nTwitter: @mitchschnurman", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tenet Healthcare has two new hedge fund directors, a giant whistleblower lawsuit and a falling stock price \u2014 plus the usual industry issues.", "og": {"description": "Tenet Healthcare has two new hedge fund directors, a giant whistleblower lawsuit and a falling stock price \u2014 plus the usual industry issues.", "title": "Mitchell Schnurman: From Obamacare cost to debt load, can Dallas health care giant Tenet find a remedy?", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160422-mitchell-schnurman-from-obamacare-cost-to-debt-load-can-dallas-health-care-giant-tenet-find-a-remedy.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160422-nb_27scorecardd_44108313.ece/BINARY/original/NB_27SCORECARDD_44108313", "height": 1136}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-04-23T04:38:25Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-04-22T17:25:43Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mitchell Schnurman: From Obamacare cost to debt load, can Dallas health care giant Tenet find a remedy?\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160422-mitchell-schnurman-from-obamacare-cost-to-debt-load-can-dallas-health-care-giant-tenet-find-a-remedy.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160422-nb_27scorecardd_44108313.ece/BINARY/original/NB_27SCORECARDD_44108313\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2737178\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-04-22T17:25:43Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20160422-nb_27scorecardd_44108313.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NB_27SCORECARDD_44108313", "publishtime": "2016-04-22T17:25:43Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s a major player in San Antonio, El Paso and Houston, and Texas accounts for a quarter of Tenet\u2019s hospital beds nationwide.\nIt\u2019s been a tough stretch for the Dallas company, which became a health care giant after a string of mergers and acquisitions.\nBut Tenet has its own issues, too, starting with the highest debt burden in the business.\nIn general, investors have been souring on hospitals because they\u2019re no longer getting much lift from the Affordable Care Act.\nTenet\u2019s trials are another example of how the health care industry is adjusting to Obamacare, sometimes painfully."}
