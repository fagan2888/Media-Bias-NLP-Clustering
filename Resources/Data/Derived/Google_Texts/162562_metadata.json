Most of which are caused by conditions that could easily be \u201cprevented or treated with access to simple, affordable interventions,\u201d according to the World Health Organization. This is a toll that any empathetic and compassionate human being would be saddened to hear of, yet to those who believe in the word of God, it is something we must simply accept as \u201cHis will.\u201d As someone who considers himself to be a generally decent human being, I look at this number and feel disgusted by the thought that a supposedly all-loving God would allow this many people to suffer and die so young. It seems to me, then, that even the most basic of human morality is superior to that of religion.\n\n1. Faith is irrational and causes more pain and suffering than it relieves\n\nI once wrote\u2014in a previous column of mine (\u201cBeauty without divinity\u201d)\u2014\u201cI understand the desire to believe in a higher power. I understand the need to know that there is an ever compassionate, wise and powerful being out there looking over me. The desire to know that once I have moved on from this existence I will be greeted in another more perfect one, surrounded by people I know and love.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories\n\nI still stand by what I said\u2014albeit while many of my fellow atheists look at me with incredulity\u2014though, I feel I must expand upon this, because I did not do myself justice at the time.\n\nWhile I do understand the desire to believe in a higher power, I do not understand the act of believing itself. Because, the desire, I would say, is something most people have, regardless of their actual beliefs or non-beliefs. Having faith in some sort of higher-being, it seems, is either an evolutionary trait in humans or a by-product of our evolution\u2014perhaps a coping mechanism, a way to explain things not yet understood or some sort of naturally occurring device for social cooperation.\n\nDominic Johnson, a professor at University of Edinburgh, said, on this very topic, \u201cEverywhere you look around the world, you find examples of people altering their behavior because of concerns for supernatural consequences of their actions. They don\u2019t do things that they consider bad because they think they\u2019ll be punished for it.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the act of belief itself is wholeheartedly irrational. Of course, thousands of years ago, when we couldn\u2019t explain the movement of the stars, the cold-heartedness of nature or, even more importantly, the actions of other people, we often filled the gap of ignorance with the easy answer\u2014that some sort of supernatural being or cause must be at play. But now, with our advancements in science and our vastly expanded knowledge, it is hard for me to comprehend humanity\u2019s lingering\u2014and seemingly stubborn and desperate\u2014need to have some sort of prime-mover dangling on high, especially when you take into consideration just how morally deficient it all is.\n\n\u201cPicture an Asian tsunami of the sort we saw in 2004, that killed a quarter of a million people,\u201d Harris continues. \u201cOne of those, every ten days, killing children only under five. That\u2019s 24,000 children a day, a thousand an hour, 17 or so a minute. That means before I can get to the end of this sentence, some few children, very likely, will have died in terror and agony.\n\n\u201cThink of the parents of these children. Think of the fact that most of these men and women believe in God and are praying at this moment for their children to be spared. And their prayers will not be answered. Any God who would allow children by the millions to suffer and die in this way, and their parents to grieve in this way, either can do nothing to help them, or doesn\u2019t care to. He is therefore either impotent or evil.\u201d\n\nIn many of my conversations with believers, this subject of evil is often brought up\u2014usually, by me\u2014and it is, more times than not, refuted with the simplistic explanation that I just \u201ccannot know the mind of God,\u201d or that \u201cGod works in mysterious ways.\u201d\n\nI find this perplexing. When something good happens in the world, it is very clearly the work of God and they thank and praise him for it, but when something bad happens\u2014such as the fact that \u201cevery 3.6 seconds one person [usually under the age of 5] dies of starvation,\u201d according to UNICEF\u2014it\u2019s suddenly furtive, because \u201cGod works in mysterious ways.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Gay Byrne for RT\u00c9 One\u2019s \u201cThe Meaning of Life,\u201d Stephen Fry was asked what he would say to God upon meeting him in the afterlife. \u201cI think [I\u2019d] say, \u2018bone cancer in children, what\u2019s that about? How dare you!\u201d He continued, \u201cHow dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?\u201d\n\nLater on he added, \u201cThe god who created this universe, if it was created by a god, is quite clearly a maniac [and] we have to spend our life on our knees, thanking him? What kind of god would do that? Yes, the world is very splendid, but it also has in it insects whose whole life cycle is to burrow into the eyes of children and make them blind. They eat outwards from the eyes. Why? Why did you do that to us? You could easily have made a creation in which that didn\u2019t exist. It is simply not acceptable.\u201d\n\nFor many, this injustice is easily dismissible, especially when it isn\u2019t close to home. It\u2019s easy to sit behind your computer screen and say, \u201cThere is a meaning to it all.\u201d But, what meaning is there to be found in the senseless death of millions of people? What is the meaning in mass shootings, in genocide? I can\u2019t possibly think of a reasonable explanation for this, let alone a lesson to be learned. But, after all, \u201cGod works in mysterious ways.\u201d\n\n2. Vicarious redemption is repulsive\n\nIn many religions, there is this idea that your sins can be forgiven, usually in the form of a scapegoat. Jesus Christ is an example of this.\n\nAccording to many sects of Christianity, we are born with sin, as if an infant is inherently evil. We are born with original sin, the sin of Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge and tempting Adam with it. This sin was forgiven when Christ was crucified, because he \u201cdied for our sins.\u201d\n\nThis concept is disgusting, because it is, first, telling us that we are inherently bad people, but that we can be forgiven for that if we accept Jesus Christ and acknowledge his sacrifice and, second, it is essentially telling us that we do not have to be responsible for our actions.\n\nIn other words, a mass murderer can be forgiven, so long as he repents and accepts Christ as his savior. What kind of morality is that?\n\n3. The Bible (and other religious texts) preach hate\n\nConsider for a moment that the Holy Bible not only defends, but often encourages acts like ritual human sacrifice, rape, stoning, murder and slavery. Certainly, many of these passages come from the Old Testament, which many Christians say no longer applies, but it\u2019s still interesting to note that a supposedly benevolent god would condone and even approve of such heinous crimes.\n\nIn Deuteronomy 22:23-24 it says, \u201cIf within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though he was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear from this that God doesn\u2019t care at all about the rape victim. Instead, the rapist is to be punished for violating someone else\u2019s property, which is illustrated by the fact that he prescribes the same fate to the victim\u2014death by stoning.\n\nMany Americans scoff at this, but look at the world outside of the United States. In many regions of Africa, Muslims are slaughtering Christians, even ethnically cleansing them, such as was the case in the Central African Republic, according to Al-Jazeera.\n\nIn Iraq and Syria, anyone who isn\u2019t a Sunni Muslim is executed by the Islamic State. Innocent civilians are executed every day by these religious fanatics, because they do not agree on who should\u2019ve taken over after the Prophet Muhammed. (Yes, Sunnis and Shia have been fighting for thousands of years, because of a petty dispute.)\n\nNow, I\u2019d like you to think about all of these horrible things I\u2019ve just presented. I will assume that things like rape, murder, slavery and so on are things that you do not agree with\u2014things that you think are bad or immoral. Doesn\u2019t that say something about God? That you, right off the bat, called it right and God somehow was left in the corner of the room seeing red?\n\nBasic human morality is far superior to religious morality, especially because I do not need the threat of hell to be a good person\u2014I\u2019m a good person because I choose to be.\n\nThe late Christopher Hitchens, author and journalist, once said, \u201cBy trying to adjust to the findings that it once tried so viciously to ban and repress, religion has only succeeded in restating the same questions that undermined it in earlier epochs. What kind of designer or creator is so wasteful and capricious and approximate? What kind of designer or creator is so cruel and indifferent? And\u2014most of all\u2014what kind of designer or creator only chooses to \u201creveal\u201d himself to semi-stupefied peasants in desert regions?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://d2c076l7bqbhhm.cloudfront.net/20151020QygYaDhuog/dist/img/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "EasternEcho", "description": "\u201cNine million children die every year before the age of five,\u201d says American author, neuroscientist and philosopher, Sam Harris.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Eastern Echo", "description": "\u201cNine million children die every year before the age of five,\u201d says American author, neuroscientist and philosopher, Sam Harris.", "title": "Religion is nonsense", "url": "http://www.easternecho.com/article/2015/10/religion-is-nonsense", "image": "http://d2c076l7bqbhhm.cloudfront.net/20151020QygYaDhuog/dist/img/fb-hidden-icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "easternecho.com", "site": "@TheEasternEcho", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#007b47", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://d2c076l7bqbhhm.cloudfront.net/20151020QygYaDhuog/dist/img/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "EasternEcho", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fbc\"", "article_summary": "It seems to me, then, that even the most basic of human morality is superior to that of religion.\nReligion is nonsense\u201cNine million children die every year before the age of five,\u201d says American author, neuroscientist and philosopher, Sam Harris.\nWhile I do understand the desire to believe in a higher power, I do not understand the act of believing itself.\nBecause, the desire, I would say, is something most people have, regardless of their actual beliefs or non-beliefs.\nI understand the need to know that there is an ever compassionate, wise and powerful being out there looking over me."}
