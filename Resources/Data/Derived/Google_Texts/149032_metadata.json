If we focus on these foods, we can encourage healthy behavior in our kids from the start. By moving the bacon off our plates \u2014 and out of the competitions \u2014 we\u2019ll all earn blue ribbons.\n\n\u2014 Cameron Wells, R.D., M.P.H., Washington, D.C.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1oPKO7l", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "As a registered dietitian, I find it especially concerning that the Iowa State Fair encouraged young, impressionable children to compete in a bacon-eating contest.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "As a registered dietitian, I find it especially concerning that the Iowa State Fair encouraged young, impressionable children to compete in a bacon-eating contest.", "title": "Bacon-eating contest not behavior to encourage", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/08/20/state-fair-bacon-eating-contest/14322735/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As a registered dietitian, I find it especially concerning that the Iowa State Fair encouraged young, impressionable children to compete in a bacon-eating contest.", "title": "Bacon-eating contest not behavior to encourage", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c723218a0d9ce2e97c9cbd7375998690f4f8a0b4/c=86-0-1283-1197&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/19/baconstatefair.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Iowa State Fair", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/Iowa State Fair", "title": "Bacon-eating contest not behavior to encourage", "author": "Cameron Wells, Washington, D.C., Letter to the Editor", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a51c1a49d64567fba92195a51ad0cee958e5e786/c=236-0-1134-1197/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/19/baconstatefair.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1472c2895e6524e1a4c338e3933913319ae50421/c=86-0-1283-1197/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/19/baconstatefair.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71d03e7d6991d8f20a56f863726b58c585ff66dd/c=0-84-1370-1112/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/19/baconstatefair.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68785f74dfaa648b971a975def47be5f47ce05d4/c=0-213-1370-984&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/19/baconstatefair.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-19T23:14:14.397000-05:00", "shorthed": "Bacon-eating contest not behavior to encourage", "articleid": 14322735, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0923af2a08ea99c642911a9b91ee3dcebeff004d/c=0-213-1370-984/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/19/baconstatefair.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf5ad80193af70a30d23f395db87b938c0d9de5c/c=348-0-1021-1197/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/08/19/baconstatefair.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Bill Neibergall/The Register)Buy PhotoAs a registered dietitian, I find it especially concerning that the Iowa State Fair encouraged young, impressionable children to compete in a bacon-eating contest.\nIf we focus on these foods, we can encourage healthy behavior in our kids from the start.\nBobby Jindal, left, looked on as an aide tried a bacon funnel cake with maple syrup at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on Saturday August 9, 2014.\nJindal declined an offer of a taste of the funnel cake.\nJust one serving of bacon a day raises colorectal cancer risk by 21 percent, making this a contest no one will win."}
