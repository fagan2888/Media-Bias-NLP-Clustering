After deducting fees and payments, the 141 school districts involved in the suit will split $4.9 million. In southeastern Wisconsin, 36 school district will split roughly $2 million of the settlement.\n\nFour school districts in Milwaukee County \u2014 Brown Deer, Franklin, Greendale and Shorewood \u2014 received payments totaling $66,646.\n\nThe school districts filed a class action lawsuit against WEA Trust in 2012 that claimed the insurer had intentionally withheld millions in federal funding from school districts that had switched from WEA Trust to competing insurance providers.\n\nThe case bounced through federal, state and county courts for years before a settlement was reached.\n\nAt question was federal funding dispersed as part of the $5 billion Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, a federal reimbursement program which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act to financially assist employment-based health plan sponsors that made coverage available to early retirees.\n\nThe plan allowed employers to apply for reimbursements based on claims they had filed in the past on behalf of early retirees enrolled in their insurance plans.\n\nWhen the program was enacted, WEA Trust, which had extensive data on school districts\u2019 prior insurance claims, offered to apply for the federal funds on their behalf and the school districts obliged. WEA then kept millions of that money instead of paying it out to certain school districts.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the school districts claimed WEA Trust was not entitled to keep the money, and had withheld the funds specifically from school districts who had switched insurance providers as a form of punishment. WEA Trust contested that claim and argued it was entitled to keep the federal reimbursement dollars.\n\n\u201cIt was a complicated case,\u201d said Brett Ludwig, a partner at Foley & Lardner. \u201cThis whole program was a one-time federal subsidy. There was no precedent for it. As far as I know, there are no other cases related to (ERRP). We\u2019re just very happy as lawyers that we were able to achieve such a substantial recovery. This case happened to be public school districts who really need as much funding as they can get. That\u2019s why we did it.\u201d\n\nA WEA Trust representative was not immediately available for comment.\n\nBy the time the suit was settled, Ludwig said the 141 school districts claimed $11.9 million had been withheld by WEA Trust. The settlement gave the school districts roughly 63 percent of what they claimed was withheld.\n\nMore school districts were initially involved in the lawsuit, but an unspecified number had settled independently with WEA Trust over the past four years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Southeastern Wisconsin districts to split $2 million", "og": {"site_name": "BizTimes Media", "description": "Southeastern Wisconsin districts to split $2 million", "title": "School districts, WEA Trust settle lawsuit for $7.5 million", "url": "http://www.biztimes.com/2016/04/13/school-districts-wea-trust-settle-lawsuit-for-7-5-million/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Law-384066283-shutterstock-e1456941184941.jpg", "height": 560}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Law-384066283-shutterstock-e1456941184941.jpg?w=640", "site": "@BizTimesMedia", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BizTimesMedia"}, "google-site-verification": "q525hWL29Np_TIsJ0g7DBGQn-HsUQezBxm172DFDNQw", "keywords": "wea trust,foley & lardner llp,school districts,foley & lardner llp", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-13T17:27:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T19:18:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The school districts filed a class action lawsuit against WEA Trust in 2012 that claimed the insurer had intentionally withheld millions in federal funding from school districts that had switched from WEA Trust to competing insurance providers.\nBy the time the suit was settled, Ludwig said the 141 school districts claimed $11.9 million had been withheld by WEA Trust.\nMore school districts were initially involved in the lawsuit, but an unspecified number had settled independently with WEA Trust over the past four years.\nA complex four-year legal battle between 141 school districts and the Wisconsin Education Association Council-affiliated insurer WEA Trust has ended in a $7.5 million settlement.\nIn the lawsuit, the school districts claimed WEA Trust was not entitled to keep the money, and had withheld the funds specifically from school districts who had switched insurance providers as a form of punishment."}
