(Photo By Sylvain Thomas/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA possible cure for hep-C comes at a great cost to the sick.\n\nWith Sovaldi\u2019s potential to break the U.S. healthcare bank, advocates, government and insurance companies alike are demanding more affordable prices.\n\nDrugs that cure patients can kill profits. So Gilead Sciences Inc. faced a fiscal challenge with its new drug, Sovaldi, which reportedly cures up to 90 percent of people with hepatitis C, a viral infection that can lurk undiagnosed and transmissible for decades until it causes liver diseases such as cirrhosis and cancer.\n\nUnlike take-forever meds like those for high cholesterol, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) \u201crepresents a finite cure, an important point to consider when comparing the price of a pill or bottle to the lifetime costs of treating a chronic disease,\u201d Gilead spokesperson Cara Miller said.\n\nConsidering that point, Gilead set the price at an astounding $1,000 for each daily pill\u2014a total of $84,000 for the minimum 12-week course. That sum would buy a Maserati SQ4 (with $10K in change) or a double-wide mobile home, or feed a thrifty family of four for 11 years. Supplementary drugs can boost the 12-week price to near $100,000. And, depending on the hep-C genotype, some patients\u2014possibly 12 percent in the U.S. and the majority in some heavily infected, poorer countries\u2014need 24 or 48 weeks of daily treatment.\n\nWith 180 million people worldwide infected with hep-C, including 3 million to 5 million Americans (many times the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV), we are talking a huge epidemic and a large, desperate market. Up to half a million people around the world die of hep-C each year. Sovaldi could save most of them\u2014if they could afford it.\n\nIn addition to weighing limits to future profits, pharmaceutical companies also cite past research and development costs to justify high prices. But Gilead spends only 19 percent of its revenue on research, and in any case, sofosbuvir was developed by Pharmasset Inc. at Emory University as \u201cthe result of federally funded university-based research,\u201d according to Science Coalition, a non-profit university research group. The drug was nearly market-ready in November 2011 when Gilead paid $11 billion cash to acquire Pharmassett, which had forecast a $36,000 price tag for the 12-week course. In December 2013, Sovaldi hit the market at well over twice that price.\n\nThe launch\u2014the biggest ever of a new drug\u2014put Gilead on track to reap morethan $10 billion in 2014 sales, virtually guaranteeing it will quickly recoup its investment. Meanwhile, Gilead avoided hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. taxes by transferring its patent for Sovaldi to its Irish subsidiary.\n\nTaxpayers not only got gamed by Gilead\u2019s tax avoidance strategy and subsidized its R&D costs, but will end up paying for much of the treatment itself. Because most U.S. hep-C sufferers are poor, in prison or aging boomers, federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will foot much of their bills.\n\nMost Americans caught the bloodborne virus from injection drug use or, before 1992, through unscreened transfusions or poor needle hygienein clinical settings. Hep-C can also be transmitted through high-risk sex or simply by sharing a razor blade, toothbrush, nail clipper or rolled-up $20 bill passed around to snort cocaine. About half of infected people have never been tested and, until they develop symptoms, will not know they carry\u2014and can pass on\u2014the virus. Without treatment, they risk slow death and high medical bills\u2014a fact that Gilead cites when defending Sovaldi as a bargaincompared to a half-million-dollar liver transplant.\n\nBut it is one expensive bargain. U.S. annual spending on pharmaceuticals could double to $600 billion if Sovaldi is used to treat all 3 million-plus infected Americans\u2014including the 12 percent to 35 percent of inmates who are chronically infected. Treating prisoners with standard care is a constitutionally guaranteed right and an opportunity to curtail the epidemic\u2014but also a multibillion dollar drain on public resources.\n\nAffordability is even more problematic for the world\u2019s 40 low-income countries, where average daily incomes range from $1.09 to $2.82 and annual healthcare spending averages $30 per capita, compared to more than $8,000 in America. In the world\u2019s 100 or so middle-income countries, including China and Brazil, average income spans $2.82 to $34.18 a day, and average annual per capita healthcare spending is about $250. Even if curing hep-C patients and stopping the epidemic were a priority, the price is absurdly prohibitive.\n\nDrug companies recognize that it is not only bad PR to let the poor die while the rich buy a cure\u2014it is also bad business. Better to sell at a steep discount than not at all, especially when rich countries subsidize the market. Enter tiered pricing, a system spawned in the 1990s by protests, outrage and lawsuits over unaffordable HIV drugs. Despite initial industry resistance, tiered pricing has worked to Big Pharma\u2019s advantage by both blunting criticism of price gouging and boosting the bottom line.\n\nWith manufacturing costs for a 12-week course estimated at less than $136, Gilead can steeply discount Solvadi in low-income countries and still turn a large profit. In India, where 12 million people have hep-C, Gilead charges about 1 percent of the U.S. price\u2014or $900 for the 12-week course.\n\nGilead is also striking discount deals with some middle-income countries\u2014a giant market that has two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, 75 percent of its poor, and the majority of its disease burden. In Egypt, where 10 to 13 percent of the population is infected (the world\u2019s highest prevalence), even with a 99 percent discount, providing a 12-week course to all infected Egyptians would cost 2.5 times the country\u2019s yearly total health spending, based on calculations by the humanitarian NGO M\u00e9decins du Monde.\n\nIn any case, tiered pricing only works (for consumers, as opposed to industry) if rich and poor countries alike implement policies that mediate price differentials among rich and poor people within their borders. Fairness also founders on the ability of countries to negotiate on behalf of the public. Caving to lobbying pressure, the Obama administration signed away the right to negotiate lower drug prices (except in the veterans\u2019 system) in exchange for the pharmaceutical industry not killing the Affordable Care Act. That lack of bargaining power may explain why Sovaldi costs $84,000 for Americans, compared to about $70,000 for the French and $55,000 for Canadians. France has proposed taxing Sovaldi when its cost to the state exceeds $567 million.\n\nWith Sovaldi\u2019s potential to break the U.S. healthcare bank, advocates, government and insurance companies alike are demanding more affordable prices for essential drugs. While humans can actually survive without Viagra, lifesaving drugs fall into another category entirely.\u201cThough produced by private companies, they constitute a public good, both because they can prevent epidemics and because healthy people function better as members of society than sick ones do,\u201d declared no less a bastion of capitalism than The Economist.\n\nSovaldi\u2019s key developer concurs. \u201cIt\u2019s a pandemic, and there is an urgent need for cheap, effective, user-friendly anti-[hep-C] oral drugs [for] the sickest and poorest people in the world,\u201d Raymond Schinazi told Poz magazine. \u201cWe have a moral obligation to do something about it as quickly as possible.\u201d Schinazi\u2014whose research was supported by public funding through his affiliation with Emory and the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center\u2014was made $440 million richer from the sale of Pharmasset.\n\nThese concerns have prompted Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to question not only how Gilead set the price, but whether Sovaldi is as safe and effective as touted. The senators cite an Oregon Health and Sciences report detailing research \u201cfactors that would lead to a bias in underrepresenting the true nature of adverse events.\u201d The study noted \u201cuncertainty\u201d about whether the high cure rate could be a result of cherry picking trial subjects and data, a too-small sample size, and lack of long-term follow up. The report rated studies on Sovaldi as \u201cpoor,\u201d the lowest category. It also found \u201ca high risk of bias\u201d owing to conflicts of interest and issues with study funding: 19 of the 27 members of the expert panel that developed the Sovaldi guidelines had a financial relationships with Gilead.\n\nFor my October column, I drove to Canada to save a friend a couple hundred bucks on an Epipen. If In These Times would pony up $84,000 for a first-person account (and if I had hep-C, which I somehow escaped despite a wastrel youth), I could fly to India, buy Sovaldi, cure myself, live nicely for 12 weeks, and still have enough left for that Maserati. Or, in a practice Big Pharma deplores as \u201cleakage,\u201d I could buy enough Sovaldi to treat 100 infected Americans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/17249/hep_c_profit_tier_pricing", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/Allen_487287753_10-web_500_349_s.jpg", "description": "A possible cure for hep-C comes at a great cost to the sick.", "title": "The Pandemic We Are Ignoring"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Protesters with Act Up lay on the floor in front of a Gilead Sciences booth to denounce the high price of Sovaldi.\nIn India, where 12 million people have hep-C, Gilead charges about 1 percent of the U.S. price\u2014or $900 for the 12-week course.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pandemic, and there is an urgent need for cheap, effective, user-friendly anti-[hep-C] oral drugs [for] the sickest and poorest people in the world,\u201d Raymond Schinazi told Poz magazine.\nConsidering that point, Gilead set the price at an astounding $1,000 for each daily pill\u2014a total of $84,000 for the minimum 12-week course.\nOr, in a practice Big Pharma deplores as \u201cleakage,\u201d I could buy enough Sovaldi to treat 100 infected Americans."}
