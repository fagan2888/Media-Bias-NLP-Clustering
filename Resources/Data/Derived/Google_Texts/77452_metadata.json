The Netherlands now trails Turkey by two points, with two games left to play.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have our fate in our own hands,\u201d coach Danny Blind told Dutch broadcaster NOS.\n\nIceland earned a 0-0 draw at home to Kazakhstan to make a slice of history with its first appearance in a major competition, and will be joined in France next year by the Czech Republic after its 2-1 win over Latvia.\n\nBoth sides have 19 points - seven more than Turkey. The two teams in each group qualify automatically, along with the best third-place team, while the eight other sides to finish third go to a playoff round.\n\n\u201cWe advanced because we collected points on a regular basis,\u201d Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech said. \u201cThe team proved it is hungry for success.\u201d\n\nDutch-born midfielder Oguzhan Ozyakup put Turkey 1-0 up in the eighth minute, running onto a defense-splitting pass from Arda Turan and deftly chipping the ball over Jasper Cillessen.\n\nThe Netherlands almost handed Turkey its second. Daley Blind failed to control a 26th-minute throw in, and was then muscled off the ball by Turan, whose shot Cillessen should have saved.\n\n\u201cIf you give away goals so easily, you sell yourself short,\u201d Blind\u2019s father and coach said.\n\nBurak Yilmaz completed the Dutch humiliation by scoring a late third for the hosts, firing through the legs of defender Jairo Riedewald.\n\nThe Netherlands was without injured captain Arjen Robben and Blind gave Ajax defender Riedewald his international debut to replace Bruno Martins Indi, who was suspended after being sent off last Thursday in his team\u2019s 1-0 defeat to Iceland.\n\nOn the rare occasions that the 1988 European champions did threaten Turkey\u2019s defense, the team\u2019s finishing let it down.\n\nRight winger Luciano Narsingh shot straight at goalkeeper Volkan Babacan in the 14th with Memphis Depay and Wesley Sneijder both free in front of goal. Davy Klaassen twice failed to get headers on target after good crosses by Depay and substitute Georginio Wijnaldum headed another Depay cross wide when all alone in front of goal five minutes into the second half.\n\n\u201cThis whole qualification campaign has been incredibly difficult,\u201d Van Persie said. \u201cWe still have a chance, but it is no longer in our hands and that is terrible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Netherlands' chances of qualifying for the 2016 European Championship slipped further away Sunday as the team that finished third at last year's World Cup crashed to a 3-0 defeat in Turkey, while Iceland qualified for its first ever major tournament.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Netherlands\u2019 chances of qualifying for the 2016 European Championship slipped further away Sunday as the team that finished third at last year\u2019s World Cup crashed to a 3-0 defeat in Turkey, while Iceland qualified for its first ever major tournament.", "title": "Turkey beats Dutch to go 3rd in Group A, Iceland qualifies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/6/turkey-beats-netherlands-3-0-to-go-3rd-in-qualifyi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/99e4dde0163e4128810f6a706700dab3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/99e4dde0163e4128810f6a706700dab3.jpg", "description": "The Netherlands' chances of qualifying for the 2016 European Championship slipped further away Sunday as the team that finished third at last year's World Cup crashed to a 3-0 defeat in Turkey, while", "card": "summary", "title": "Turkey beats Dutch to go 3rd in Group A, Iceland qualifies"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The resounding victory in Konya meant that Turkey overtook the Dutch in the race for third place in Group A.\n\u201cWe no longer have our fate in our own hands,\u201d coach Danny Blind told Dutch broadcaster NOS.\nThe Netherlands now trails Turkey by two points, with two games left to play.\nBurak Yilmaz completed the Dutch humiliation by scoring a late third for the hosts, firing through the legs of defender Jairo Riedewald.\nBoth sides have 19 points - seven more than Turkey."}
