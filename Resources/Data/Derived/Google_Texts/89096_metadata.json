The social services to be linked include those related to housing, food, personal safety, inability to pay utility bills and transportation. The project will fund up to 44 separate experiments over five years. Applications are being accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and announcement of the winning proposals is expected later this year.\n\nThe goal of combining medical and social services is not just to help patients, wrote the team in charge of the project in this week\u2019s New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cThe test will assess whether systematically identifying and addressing health-related social needs can reduce health care costs and utilization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany community service organizations\u2026might be able to help\u201d patients with health-related social needs, said Dr. Patrick Conway, chief medical officer at CMS in a conference call with reporters, \u201cbut many clinics and hospitals aren\u2019t linked well to these organizations.\u201d\n\nThere are already small-scale examples of one-stop shopping for medical and social needs around the country that are showing positive results. For example, Hennepin Health in Minnesota, which serves low-income residents who are eligible for Medicaid, has reduced both hospital and emergency room admissions among its caseload.\n\nThe bigger challenge is \u201cscaling up\u201d \u2014 or figuring out how to provide such services to more people who need them.\n\nPart of the problem is a cultural gap \u2014 not between the patients and providers, but between health care professionals and social service agencies.\n\nMedical and social service providers \u201care not used to working with one another or collaborating,\u201d said Tricia McGinnis, a vice president at the Center for Health Care Strategies, which works on projects to improve state Medicaid programs.\n\nAnd more often than not, the bureaucracy involved, particularly in programs that serve the poor, can make collaboration difficult if not impossible.\n\nFor example, said CHCS Vice President Allison Hamblin, \u201cfitting together a complicated Medicaid financing stream with a complicated housing financing scheme \u2014 it\u2019s horrendous.\u201d\n\nMcGinnis said that projects to connect health and social services are getting more popular as the health care moves towards a payment system that rewards medical providers for keeping patients healthy rather than simply doing things to them. Such systems provide a financial incentive to make sure social needs are met, if only to keep down their medical bills. But it\u2019s not clear how fast those savings might materialize.\n\nFor the sickest and most expensive patients, things like helping them get to and from medical appointments and helping pay utility bills so they don\u2019t have to choose between that and buying medication can produce savings \u201cprobably pretty fast,\u201d she said. But for patients whose social service needs are purely preventive, \u201cit\u2019s hard to reap those (medical) savings quickly enough\u201d to reimburse the social service providers.\n\nPerhaps most critical to the program, said Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, is that the 44 separate programs about to be funded be rigorously evaluated \u201cso we actually learn what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe program is being run by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which was created by the Affordable Care Act to find ways to improve and pay for health care. But its record so far on providing results of its projects has been spotty, at best.\n\n\u201cThe innovation center hasn\u2019t been the strongest\u201d at evaluation, Jha said.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Fuente COM SALUD", "article_metadata": {"description": "The project will fund up to 44 separate experiments over five years.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The project will fund up to 44 separate experiments over five years.", "title": "Here\u2019s a closer look at Accountable Health Communities (and the $157 million behind it)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/medical_flickr_FuenteCOMSALUD.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-07T08:38:04-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/01/accountable-health-communities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/medical_flickr_FuenteCOMSALUD.jpg", "description": "The project will fund up to 44 separate experiments over five years.", "card": "summary", "title": "A closer look at Accountable Health Communities"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,accountable health communities, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "published_time": "2016-01-07T08:30:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-07T08:38:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The social services to be linked include those related to housing, food, personal safety, inability to pay utility bills and transportation.\nApplications are being accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and announcement of the winning proposals is expected later this year.\nPart of the problem is a cultural gap \u2014 not between the patients and providers, but between health care professionals and social service agencies.\nBut for patients whose social service needs are purely preventive, \u201cit\u2019s hard to reap those (medical) savings quickly enough\u201d to reimburse the social service providers.\nThe goal of the \u201cAccountable Health Communities\u201d project is to find better ways to identify patients\u2019 non-medical needs and connect them to available services in their communities."}
