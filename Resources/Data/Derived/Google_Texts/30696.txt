× Michelle Obama to campaign for Illinois governor

CHICAGO (AP) _ First lady Michelle Obama is set to attend a Chicago fundraiser and rally for Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn’s re-election bid.

She’s expected Tuesday at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Organizers say she’ll encourage early voting. She appears in a Quinn television ad released Monday where she notes Quinn’s efforts to boost Illinois’ minimum wage.

The first lady was set to stop in Wisconsin earlier Tuesday rallying backers of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke.

Last week President Barack Obama campaigned and fundraised for Quinn. Quinn’s campaign didn’t release details of the first lady’s fundraiser, which was set to precede the afternoon rally.

Quinn faces a challenge from Republican Bruce Rauner (ROW’-nur).

Early voting starts in Illinois this month, with some voters able to vote during a grace period this week.
