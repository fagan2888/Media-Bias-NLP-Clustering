New York City, Nov. 11, 7:30 p.m. Tickets here.\n\nDidn't get a ticket to our San Francisco show? We're doing a second one on Dec. 10. Get tickets here.\n\nOn this week\u2019s Slate Political Gabfest, Emily Bazelon, John Dickerson, and David Plotz discuss how and why the debt ceiling crisis was finally resolved, the implications of that deal for the future of American politics, and whether teens should be allowed to post publicly on Facebook.\n\nHere are some of the links and references mentioned during this week's show:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe shutdown solution Rep. Paul Ryan proposed in a Wall Street Journal op-ed never gained traction.\n\nPresident Obama's no-negotiation position on raising the debt limit was unpopular, but tying the funding of the government to Obamacare was even less popular, John writes.\n\nDave Weigel says Republicans are already rewriting the history of their own defeat.\n\nIn his remarks after the deal was done, Obama called for an end to the demonization of government.\n\nFacebook loosened its privacy rules for teenagers so it could make more money, Emily writes.\n\nEmily chatters about an endearing Red Sox video on Intentional Talk.\n\nJohn chatters about a Kottke article on brain training games.\n\nDavid chatters about a graphic adaptation of the Gettysburg Address.\n\nTopic ideas for next week?
