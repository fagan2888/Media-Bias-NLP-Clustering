NWLC contends the companies\u2019 plans to charge women more for the policies violates Obamacare protections barring sex discrimination in insurance plans.\n\nThe long-term care industry has long maintained that Obamacare\u2019s rules barring insurers from charging women more for their health care don\u2019t apply to them. Early last year, the nation\u2019s largest long-term care insurer announced that it be charging women between 20 and 40 percent more in monthly premiums.\n\nIndustry experts predicted the practice would become a trend \u2014 a prediction that has proven true. NWLC\u2019s complaints are targeting Genworth Financial, John Hancock, Transamerica, and Mutual of Omaha.\n\n\u201cBy gender rating their long-term care insurance policies, these companies are charging women 20 to 40 percent more than men for the same product,\u201d said NWLC Co-President Marcia D. Greenberger in a statement. \u201cRequiring women to pay higher prices just because they are women is wrong, unfair and, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, is now illegal sex discrimination.\u201d\n\nJust under six in ten of the eight million Americans with long-term care policies are women. Since women tend to live longer than men, they often become their husbands\u2019 long-term caregivers. That reduces the need for men to have a long-term care insurance; unfortunately, women are far less likely to have such a caregiver since their male spouses die earlier, leaving them dependent on insurance coverage for their long-term care needs. That\u2019s why they tend to use a greater bulk of services and why insurers feel they are justified in discriminating against them.\n\nBut as NWLC points out, this form of discrimination only exacerbates the financial strains of the lifetime of wage discrimination that most women experience. \u201cWomen already have a hard enough time making ends meet, earning only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men,\u201d said NWLC Vice-President and General Counsel Emily Martin. \u201cWith lower wages to begin with, women simply can\u2019t afford to pay 20 to 40 percent more than men for the same long-term care insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Genworth Financial, John Hancock, Transamerica, and Mutual of Omaha are being sued for their decision to charge women more for long-term care insurance than they charge men.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Genworth Financial, John Hancock, Transamerica, and Mutual of Omaha are being sued for their decision to charge women more for long-term care insurance than they charge men.", "title": "Four Major Insurers Accused Of Discriminating Against Women In Long-Term Care Plans", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/16/3176091/major-insurers-discriminate-gender-long-term-care/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_old-elderly-woman-e1389906651644.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Genworth Financial, John Hancock, Transamerica, and Mutual of Omaha are being sued for their decision to charge women more for long-term care insurance than they charge men.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_old-elderly-woman-321x214.jpg", "title": "Four Major Insurers Accused Of Discriminating Against Women In Long-Term Care Plans", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_old-elderly-woman-e1389906651644.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_old-elderly-woman-e1389906651644.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-16T17:04:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcc8\"", "article_summary": "Health Four Major Insurers Accused Of Discriminating Against Women In Long-Term Care Plans CREDIT: ShutterstockThe National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC), an advocacy group for women, is filing federal sex discrimination complaints against four of the largest American insurance companies for discriminating against women in their long-term care insurance plans.\nThe long-term care industry has long maintained that Obamacare\u2019s rules barring insurers from charging women more for their health care don\u2019t apply to them.\nNWLC contends the companies\u2019 plans to charge women more for the policies violates Obamacare protections barring sex discrimination in insurance plans.\n\u201cWith lower wages to begin with, women simply can\u2019t afford to pay 20 to 40 percent more than men for the same long-term care insurance.\u201d\nEarly last year, the nation\u2019s largest long-term care insurer announced that it be charging women between 20 and 40 percent more in monthly premiums."}
