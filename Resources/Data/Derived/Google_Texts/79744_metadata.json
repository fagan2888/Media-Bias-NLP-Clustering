I understand where you\u2019re coming from because I also love animals. In fact, I love them so much we even took our 110-pound dog to Italy \u2014 and we have photos of him in so many other places around the U.S. that we took to calling him Zelig.\n\nSo I agree with you about those horses. Why should horses, who are by most accounts beautifully cared for, be allowed to stay with their owners who love them, when they can instead be farmed out \u2014 if they\u2019re lucky? And when you come right down to it, too much glue is never enough glue \u2014 especially when you need it.\n\nThose radical activist carriage-horse owners have some nerve arguing about something as unimportant as their livelihood with anti-carriage horse activists like former parking garage king Steve Nislick. This is a man who knows that these animals are secretly abused, and that it\u2019s all covered up. I guess you\u2019d know this first-hand yourself, Mr. Mayor, but you haven\u2019t had a chance to visit the stables yet. But I\u2019m sure you will get around to it, at least before the propsed bill gets any further.\n\nDe Blasio proposed carriage horses be replaced with replicas of vintage cars. (David Handschuh/New York Daily News)\n\nI believe that animal lover Nislick\u2019s background and experience running parking garages is close enough to running horse stables to make him an expert. To defy such a good-hearted person would be ludicrous.\n\nJust because he founded an \u201canimal rights\u201d group, NY-CLASS, that supported you and was behind the anti-Christine Quinn TV ads and is now involved in developing the fake antique cars that are going to be sold as substitute horses to the beleaguered, unemployed horse-and-carriage drivers for $125,000 to $170,000, should not be seen as a bad thing.\n\nThose horses are in danger. After all, according to horse-and-carriage owner Colm McKeever, there have been six motor vehicle-horse accidents since 2007 involving a rotating group of 220 horses who made 300,000 round trips between the stables and Central Park.\n\nOK, yes, I admit that in 2012 in New York City alone there were over 68,000 car crashes involving 128,000 vehicles and 170,000 humans with 271 fatalities, including 11,000 vehicle-pedestrian accidents, 3,639 bikes-car accidents, and 1,619 motorcyle crashes, but still.\n\nClearly, those out-of-work carriage drivers will be thrilled to pay up to $170,000 to replace their beloved animals with fake Model T electric cars.\n\nThat\u2019s no reason that carriage horses should be exposed to a one in 50,000 chance of being involved in a horse-auto accident \u2014 is there?\n\nWith odds like that, who wouldn\u2019t rather take their chances in a car than in a horse-and-carriage? Yes, I know you can ride around in a car anytime, but it\u2019s obvious that these electric Model Ts will be fabulous replacements for the horses \u2014 despite the fact than none yet exist.\n\nClearly, those out-of-work carriage drivers will be thrilled to pay up to $170,000 to replace their beloved animals with fake Model T electric cars.\n\nBut where would these tourist Model T cars be allowed to go since cars, not horses, are banned from so many Central Park drives so much of the time that it\u2019s become a paradise for runners and cloppers?\n\nNot to worry. I\u2019m sure the parking garage guy will figure it out.\n\nBest, Linda\n\nTeen porn actress and Duke University student Miriam Weeks says she\u2019s been watching porn since she was 12.

The missing plane has been to CNN what Obamacare is to Fox \u2014 the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nThe mystery gave CNN such a ratings boost that anchors for weeks have spent 24/7 obsessing about every bit of flotsam and jetsam, and interviewing any \u201cexpert\u201d willing to discuss every nut-bag scenario on the Internet.\n\nThe missing plane has been to CNN what Obamacare is to Fox \u2014 the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nBut on Wednesday night CNN turned so nut-bag itself that it actually caused TV news to die.\n\nAs the screen crawl underneath misread, \u201cLack hole?\u201d (the only accurate statement of the night), anchor Don Lemon asked Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Transportation, \u201cIs it preposterous to consider a black hole as a possibility?\u201d Ah, yes?\n\nInstead of running away to find her lost reputation, Schiano answered, \u201cA small black hole would suck in our entire universe, so we know it\u2019s not that.\u201d\n\nReally? Wait \u2019til she sees the black hole CNN gets sucked into when this story is finally over.\n\nActor Russell Crowe was shocked when he couldn't attract an audience of one at the Vatican. (AP)\n\nNOTHING TO CROWE ABOUT\n\nRussell Crowe, who\u2019s used to attracting huge audiences wherever he goes, was shocked that he couldn\u2019t attract an audience of one at the Vatican.
