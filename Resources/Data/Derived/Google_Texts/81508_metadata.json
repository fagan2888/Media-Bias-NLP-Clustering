So I'm here in a limbo world trying to decide what it is I'm going to do.\"\n\ni toggle caption Stephanie O'Neill Stephanie O'Neill\n\nOne new option he'll soon have is to buy insurance through Covered California's SHOP exchange. SHOP stands for Small Business Health Options Program. It's California's version of a small-business insurance program that is part of the federal Affordable Care Act. The state has 500,000 small businesses.\n\nAll states are offering similar small-business exchanges. These are marketplaces for employers with 50 or fewer full-time workers and are designed to offer more affordable insurance to mom-and-pop businesses that have long paid more than large companies for the same level of coverage.\n\n\"Small businesses are horribly disadvantaged in terms of being able to purchase insurance,\" says Peter Harbage, president of the Sacramento-based health policy firm Harbage Consulting. \"If they're even able to purchase it, they have to pay more and they get less.\"\n\nHarbage says that not only will SHOP plans offer competitive prices, but they will also offer tax benefits that for some smaller companies might cut premium prices in half.\n\nBut John Kabateck is not so optimistic. He is the California executive director for the National Federation of Independent Business, and represents more than 22,000 small businesses in California.\n\n\"There are a lot of uncertainties as it relates to the law,\" he says. \"We are hopeful that they will find affordable coverage within the exchange. We are hopeful they will have the ability to pick and choose in the marketplace.\"\n\nBusiness owners will need to closely inspect the policies offered, Kabateck says, as some participating insurance companies have announced they're keeping premiums lower by offering a smaller network of doctors and hospitals. And that means fewer choices for employees.\n\nAnd whether or not a small business opts to provide workers health coverage, there's really no way for them to avoid the extra time and cost it will take to navigate the new law's reporting requirements. And that's a concern shared by Westwind's Ramani.\n\n\"Small business doesn't have scale,\" Ramani says. \"We don't have a legal department. We don't have an HR department. We navigate through mountains of regulations, not just about health care but about everything we do here. We're just getting bombarded on all levels.\"\n\nFor now, Ramani says he'll sit tight and watch before deciding whether the SHOP marketplace will provide him a better way to buy affordable, quality health insurance for his employees.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, small businesses are not required to provide insurance to their workers. Only those with more than 50 employees must do so, beginning in 2015.\n\nThis story is part of a collaboration with NPR, KPCC and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Small businesses can now buy health insurance tailored for their needs on marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act.
