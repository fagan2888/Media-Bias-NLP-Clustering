Mike Huckabee said Friday that as president, he would dispatch the head of the Department of Homeland Security to Laredo, Texas until the country\u2019s southern border is secure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be done in less than a year,\u201d said Mr. Huckabee, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate.\n\nMr. Huckabee said \u201cwe will secure the border\u201d is a common refrain from Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe always say that, but we never seem to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cSecuring the border is not the end of what we do. It\u2019s just a matter not of trying to keep people out but making sure that the people who come in want to come and help us build a great America.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause throughout our entire life as a country, it has been the immigrants who come to this country and help us build a great America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to close people out and say \u2018we don\u2019t want anybody else.\u2019 But it\u2019s to make sure that when people do come, they want to come to be a part of making this country even better with their skills, their talents, their abilities, their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t control the border itself,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Huckabee also said the country should not have an immigration policy that \u201cdisplaces Americans.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee, speaking at a Republican Party of Florida summit in Orlando, pointed out that Disney workers were replaced by foreign workers under the H-1B visa program because the foreign workers were willing to do the job for less money.\n\n\u201cAnd to add insult to injury, the Disney workers were required to train their foreign replacements before they ultimately were shoved out the door,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica can treat its people better than that, and immigration should not be about seeing if we can displace American workers. It\u2019s about making it so that everybody who does come here comes to contribute to something greater than himself or herself.\u201d\n\nThe comments on immigration from Mr. Huckabee come amid an intense public dispute over the issue among the 2016 GOP presidential field, notably a back-and-forth between Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida over their respective roles in the 2013 effort in the U.S. Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Arkansas Gov.
