She\u2019s too busy working.\n\nThe star took to Twitter to announce that she will be the new face of pop icon Madonna\u2019s Material Girl fashion line:\n\n\u201cSo honored to be chosen by Madonna and her amazing daughter Lola as the new face of Material Girl!\u2026\u201d\n\nThe 17-year-old will be featured in the line\u2019s \u201cBoardwalk Babe\u201d campaign, showcasing her playful side on Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island. She recently told Access Hollywood the brand was a good match for her own personal style:\n\n\u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s affordable, but it\u2019s still edgy and cool.\u201d \u201cI just think it was a perfect fit for me and my personal style.\u201d\n\nMadonna shared in a press release the reason behind her decision:\n\n\u201cZendaya exudes a confident, free spirit. We love having her as the new face of Material Girl.\u201d\n\nHer daughter Lourdes Leon added:\n\n\u201cI love how Zendaya makes her own style rules to fit her personality \u2014 that\u2019s who Material Girl is all about, being yourself to the fullest.\u201d\n\nLourdes will also model for Material Girl.\n\nTaylor Momsen and Georgia May Jagger have modeled for Material Girl in the past.\n\nSay what you want about Zendaya\u2019s acting and singing, but the girl can dress her behind off. Judging by her Instagram posts, I\u2019m surprised that some fashion line hasn\u2019t scooped her up until now. The girl is definitely winning and I would guess we\u2019ll probably be seeing her face all over the place soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actress/singer Zendaya has been chosen as the new face for Madonna's Material Girl fashion line.,", "og": {"site_name": "MadameNoire", "description": "Actress/singer Zendaya has been chosen as the new face for Madonna's Material Girl fashion line.,", "title": "Zendaya Chosen As New Face Of Material Girl", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 420, "identifier": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/zendaya-2.jpg", "height": 420}, "url": "http://madamenoire.com/441092/stuntin-zendaya-madonnas-new-material-girl/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/zendaya-2.jpg"}, "title": "Stuntin\u2019: Zendaya Is Madonna\u2019s New \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d", "description": "Shake the haters off.", "card": "summary", "site": "@MadameNoire"}, "robots": "noodp", "ob": {"title": "Stuntin\u2019: Zendaya Is Madonna\u2019s New \u201cMat"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"admins": 100006356380901}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Madonna", "published_time": "2014-06-22T13:37:35-04:00"}, "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd63e\"", "article_summary": "We love having her as the new face of Material Girl.\u201dHer daughter Lourdes Leon added:\u201cI love how Zendaya makes her own style rules to fit her personality \u2014 that\u2019s who Material Girl is all about, being yourself to the fullest.\u201dLourdes will also model for Material Girl.\nTaylor Momsen and Georgia May Jagger have modeled for Material Girl in the past.\nThe girl is definitely winning and I would guess we\u2019ll probably be seeing her face all over the place soon.\nThe star took to Twitter to announce that she will be the new face of pop icon Madonna\u2019s Material Girl fashion line:\u201cSo honored to be chosen by Madonna and her amazing daughter Lola as the new face of Material Girl!\u2026\u201dThe 17-year-old will be featured in the line\u2019s \u201cBoardwalk Babe\u201d campaign, showcasing her playful side on Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island.\nSay what you want about Zendaya\u2019s acting and singing, but the girl can dress her behind off."}
