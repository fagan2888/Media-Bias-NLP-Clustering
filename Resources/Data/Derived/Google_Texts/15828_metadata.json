As he enters his 18th season, and as many come to grips with the fact that his presence in the pocket is expiring, Manning finds himself playing alongside and against many players who idolized him when they were growing up.\n\n\u201cI try not to think about this too much, but I had his college jersey when I was in junior high, so it goes back to me being a fan even back then when I was quarterback back then,\u201d tight end Owen Daniels said.\n\n\u201cObviously he was one of the best to do it in college and at this level, and now to be in the same huddle with him is pretty special. I look at it as art to play with a guy like that and you just want to give your best effort on every down.\u201d\n\n\n\nTy Sambrailo, the Broncos\u2019 rookie left tackle out of Colorado State, said in May that the opportunity to play alongside Manning is \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a future hall-of-famer and that\u2019s exciting to be in the same building as him,\u201d Sambrailo said in May, after the two crossed paths in the team cafeteria.\n\nTwo preseason games into his pro career, the appreciation of Manning is still there for Sambrailo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true, really,\u201d he said after Saturday\u2019s win in Houston. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been watching him play since I was a little kid, so it\u2019s kind of crazy to be out in the huddle and get play calls from him. It\u2019s football still, and we\u2019re all here for a reason, we\u2019re all professionals, so it\u2019s your job to protect whoever\u2019s back there, and it just happens to be one of the greatest.\u201d\n\nThe Manning fans can also be found across the line of scrimmage.\n\nHouston\u2019s rookie cornerback Kevin Johnson had two tackles in Saturday\u2019s preseason game, and recorded a pass defensed against Manning that forced a three-and-out on the Broncos\u2019 opening drive. Johnson\u2019s reaction?\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah. It was pretty cool,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pretty cool just going out there, lining up, and looking in at the quarterback and it was Peyton Manning. That\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,Owen Daniels,Peyton Manning,Ty Sambrailo", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Many of Peyton Manning's current teammates and opponents grew up watching him and say they're honored to take the field with him.", "title": "Peyton Manning playing alongside and against many of his fans", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/08/24/peyton-manning-playing-alongside-and-against-many-of-his-fans/35116/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/08/458911571-495x344.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Many of Peyton Manning's current teammates and opponents grew up watching him and say they're honored to take the field with him.", "title": "Peyton Manning playing alongside and against many of his fans", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/08/24/peyton-manning-playing-alongside-and-against-many-of-his-fans/35116/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/08/458911571-495x344.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Many of Peyton Manning's current teammates and opponents grew up watching him and say they're honored to take the field with him."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca290\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was pretty cool just going out there, lining up, and looking in at the quarterback and it was Peyton Manning.\nThat\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\nPeyton Manning, a sure-fire hall-of-famer, is widely regarded as one of the best to play the game, at any position.\nSeventeen NFL seasons, 14 Pro Bowl selections, seven first-team All-Pro honors, five MVP awards, a Super Bowl ring, a Super Bowl MVP award, the NFL record for career touchdown passes and countless other accolades and all-time records will do this.\nIt was pretty cool,\u201d he said."}
