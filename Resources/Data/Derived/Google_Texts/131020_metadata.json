Jeff Sessions is urging GOP legislators to pass a short-term budget that will create time for legislators and voters to look inside Washington\u2019s latest budget maneuver \u2014 the secretly negotiated, two-year $8 trillion budget plan.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHe also wants House legislators to pick their new House Speaker before debating the two-year budget, which largely frees Obama from congressional pushback for the rest of his eight-year tenure.\n\nThe Oct. 31 budget \u201cdeadline is artificial and can easily be pushed back with a short-term [budget] measure\u2026 Republicans should insist that any vote on spending caps or the debt ceiling be delayed until the House has chosen a new Speaker \u2014 and until there has been a full conversation among our conference and, most importantly, our voters, \u201d said an Oct. 27 statement from Sessions, a leading anti-establishment populist in D.C.\n\nUnder current plans, Rep. Paul Ryan will stand for election Thursday, Oct. 29, just after GOP leaders rush the little-understood $8 trillion plan through the House.\n\n\u201cGOP voters are entitled to have their representatives represent them \u2013 not act as opposing counsel, urging them to capitulate to the President\u2019s demands,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cWhether it\u2019s spending, debt, crime, immigration or trade, it is time for us to start fighting for what our voters want \u2013 instead of demeaning their just concerns about the future of our country,\u201d he said.\n\nSessions is a budget expert. In late 2014, he was in line to chair the Senate\u2019s budget committee, but he was bumped out by a close ally of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He now chairs the Senate\u2019s subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest.\n\nSessions slammed the entire deal:\n\n\u201cAt its core, this deal with President Obama does two things: First, it lifts federal spending caps for the next two years \u2013 including a $40 billion increase in spending on the federal bureaucracy. Second, it waives the federal debt limit through March of 2017, allowing for approximately $1.5 trillion to be added to the debt \u2013 ensuring no further conversation about our debt course or any corresponding action to alter it\u2026 It appears this deal is built on the same principles as the Ryan-Murray budget deal from 2013. It exchanges instant increases in federal spending for distant savings, as much two decades down the road, that are likely to never materialize. It funds increased spending through increased revenues \u2013 violating a core budget principle by collecting more money to expand an already too-large federal bureaucracy. And it trades the termination of today\u2019s spending limits for the promise of new spending limits ten years from now. The spending caps in law today were pledged as part of the 2011 Budget Control Act agreement to lift the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion. They represented a bipartisan commitment to cap spending at a fixed amount. This deal shatters that commitment by spending $80 billion more than we promised over the next 2 years.\n\nNotably, Sessions highlighted the language in the plan that would move $150 billion in Social Security revenues over to the \u201cfraud-ridden Social Security Disability\u201d program. Enrollment in that program has rocketed up during the last few years, partly because many older Americans remain unemployed in Obama\u2019s slow-growth, high-immigration economy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
