The administration staff will be moved behind the Urgent Care Center on the LRMC campus that is currently under construction.\n\n\u201cThe Urgent Care Center is a new service that we have never offered to the community at the Leesburg campus,\u201d Henderson said. The facility will feature an in-house lab, X-ray, and other services.\n\n\u201cWe plan to do a lot of our preoperative work there, and also function as a preoperative testing facility, and that will be very convenient,\u201d he said.\n\nOver in The Villages, he noted the TVRH is preparing to add on to its facility with more patient rooms.\n\n\u201cOur best information is that The Villages, which has crossed the 100,000 (population) mark and it may get up to about 120,000 in the next three to five years, so that\u2019s a 20 percent increase in population,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cEarly next year in 2015, we are going to open our first phase of our expansion at The Villages Hospital, which we\u2019ll add 60 beds to the facility.\u201d\n\nHe said TVRH could eventually go as high as 310 in the second phase of construction.\n\n\u201cWe think that once we get up to the 280 to 300 beds that we will be adequately sized to serve the growth of the community,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, both hospitals have 560 beds, including the rehabilitation hospital, and about 3, 0000 employees, including more than 350 medical staff members. There also is a community board of 16 members who govern operations, including eight from Leesburg and eight from The Villages.\n\n\u201cMore than 30 percent of our current board is practicing physicians in the com munity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe physicians have a lot of say so and input into our leadership structure.\u201d\n\nHenderson said emphasis is place on allowing the sister hospitals to provide a range of services that complement each other,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur cardiac surgery program continues to grow, and that\u2019s our leading service at the Leesburg hospital. We were very excited in that last year we performed over 760 open-heart procedures, which my by account, ranks us as the No. 3 largest heart program in the state, and that volume continues to grow.\u201d\n\nThe orthopedics program continues to be very strong, too, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that you can look for us to do in the near future, is to offer partial-knee replacement in both communities,\u201d Henderson said, noting this could be within three months as an putpatient procedure. \u201cPartial-knee replacement is very exciting. It\u2019s a much less invasive procedure than the traditional knee replacements. You can actually get in and get out and have your procedure done within a day; and it\u2019s a big breakthrough and we are very excited about it.\u201d\n\nThe women and children\u2019s area of LRMC also is growing.\n\n\u201cWe have two main obstetrical programs, but we do more deliveries at the hospital (LRMC) than anywhere in Lake County, and we are excited because we have been working with the two local medical groups in having more obstetricians come to the area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe demand is there to grow the obstetrical program.\u201d\n\nHenderson said LRMC delivered 1,700 babies last year, which was 200 more than the previous year.\n\n\u201cWe think that it could go even higher. We do twice as many deliveries as the closest hospital to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen\u2019s health care is a very big thing.\u201d\n\nHenderson said LRMC also is focused on its pediatrics program.\n\n\u201cWe have the only pediatricians that stay in-house 24/7. This is the only hospital in the region where the doctors are actually staffing the hospital on a 24-hour basis, so that gives us a level of care for both the babies that are being born as well as the children who get the winter respiratory diseases.\u201d\n\nThe CEO also expressed his views on the Affordable Care Act and how it will affect families, small businesses and how own employees.\n\n\u201cI think the big impact for Obamacare is yet to be felt because so many of the provisions were deferred until 2015, but I am a bit worried because I think that insurance premiums for many of the small businesses will go up and that has got me significantly concerned,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cAnd as a large employer, we don\u2019t know what will happen with our premiums because the law brings in new requirements...\n\n\u201cThe stories that we are hearing from the Lake County community especially, is that people are seeing much higher premiums. We\u2019re seeing higher premiums and we are seeing higher out-of-pocket deductibles across the board, and that causes concern because the deductible are so high from $5,000 to $10,000 per family that it\u2019s creating issues for us and we\u2019re are concerned. The question is \u2018Are people going to be able to afford these new higher requirements?\u2019\u201d\n\nHenderson recently met with a community group about the Affordable Care Act, and he heard from small business employers.\n\n\u201cThere were folks jumping up from the audience saying \u2018If I have higher premiums, I\u2019m goi ng to have to pass higher deductibles on to my employees,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo yeah, we worried about it,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to make sure that all of the local residents get the health care that they need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Commercial", "description": "Don Henderson, president and CEO of Central Florida Health Alliance, is overseeing construction projects and new challenges as Leesburg Regional Medical Center and The Villages Regional Hospital experience a growth spurt \u2014 something that is unique compared with many other states.", "title": "Growth a challenge to hospitals' CEO", "url": "http://www.dailycommercial.com/news/article_f7eb0799-502e-55c7-93f5-504bd3ff3de7.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailycommercial.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/17/81706a0c-8d83-5335-a81e-c77bed6fe75a/52df334c3e2e3.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C211", "height": 211}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailycommercial", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 108599415991304}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "h_JIwo5TKFCMaJN3XKwQEjqiSRq1nDT50zFNlwpyIqo", "news_keywords": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "description": "Don Henderson, president and CEO of Central Florida Health Alliance, is overseeing construction projects and new challenges as Leesburg Regional Medical Center and The Villages Regional Hospital experience a growth spurt \u2014 something that is unique compared with many other states."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8cc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere were folks jumping up from the audience saying \u2018If I have higher premiums, I\u2019m goi ng to have to pass higher deductibles on to my employees,\u2019\u201d he said.\nAbout 60 percent of both hospitals\u2019 patients are Medicare recipients, and it plays a role in the services that are provided.\n\u201cThe winter continues to be very challenging for both hospitals, especially with the big snowbird population that comes in,\u201d Henderson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to make sure that all of the local residents get the health care that they need.\u201d\nCurrently, both hospitals have 560 beds, including the rehabilitation hospital, and about 3, 0000 employees, including more than 350 medical staff members."}
