She was on high alert in May, when Ezra was just two weeks old.\n\n\u201cHe was red all day, he pretty much cried his eyes out all day and then when we took his temperature at night time it was bad,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cThat was when we decided to go to the hospital.\u201d\n\nEzra had a fever of 101.6, dangerously high for a newborn. The Armstrongs rushed their baby to Mercy Hospital in Council Bluffs. Doctors performed several tests, and a spinal tap revealed Ezra had meningitis, an infection of the coverings of the brain.\n\nEzra was immediately transported to Children\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha. Doctors, including Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Dr. Kari Simonsen, determined Ezra had listeria meningitis.\n\n\u201cListeria is a particular type of bacteria that\u2019s known to cause meningitis, particularly in susceptible patients; infants are one of the most susceptible,\u201d said Dr. Simonsen. \u201cMost babies get it around the time of delivery from their mother, who's acquired it usually from a food.\u201d\n\n-- Video: Pregnant woman eats cold cuts, sickens baby\n\nDr. Simonsen said refrigerated meats and cheeses and deli products usually served cold host the listeria bacteria, which can live at the refrigerated temperature.\n\n\u201cOften times, the mom won\u2019t become clinically ill because of her normal immune system,\u201d said Dr. Simonsen. Babies\u2019 immature immune systems cannot fight off the bacteria. Dr. Simonsen says it is important to note listeria meningitis is not contagious; you cannot spread the infection person to person.\n\nDoctors are now helping Ezra\u2019s tiny body battle the infection.\n\n\u201cThey said he was in pretty bad shape,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cThey said we probably would've lost him if this would've gone untreated.\u201d\n\nEzra is improving every day; doctors will watch him closely but Dr. Simonsen says many patients have normal outcomes.\n\n\u201cI think the main takeaway for moms would be to listen to your obstetrician\u2019s advice,\u201d said Dr. Simonsen. \u201cIn this case, those foods that might be dangerous for moms to consume while pregnant.\u201d\n\nLucinda Armstrong also has a message for parents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell them to go with their gut,\u201d said Lucinda. \u201cIf they feel something\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s much better going to the hospital and figuring out nothing is wrong rather than not going, then to figure out something bad happened.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how long Ezra will have to stay in the hospital. Lucinda and her husband, Greg, plan to stay with their baby until they can take him home.\n\n\u201c[I was] sitting here thinking about it and I just broke down in tears because I think of how bad it could\u2019ve been if it would\u2019ve gone untreated,\u201d said Lucinda. \u201cIf we wouldn\u2019t have thought anything of it at the time, we could\u2019ve lost him.\u201d\n\nThe Armstrongs are from Randolph, Iowa, more than an hour from Omaha\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center. They are staying at the Rainbow House when they can, and have set up a donation account to help them pay bills.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 02 Jun 2014 22:28:55 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Brandi Petersen", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "The family of a baby, hospitalized at Children\u2019s Hospital & Medical Center, wants to warn other expecting mothers and new parents about the illness that made their son extremely sick.", "title": "Mother, doctor shares warning for pregnant women", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/mother-doctor-share-warning-for-pregnant-women/26293992", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/26293958/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/kj0iv2z/-/baby-Ezra-jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/mother-doctor-share-warning-for-pregnant-women/26293992", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/26293992", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/26293992", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/26293992"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "description": "The family of a baby, hospitalized at Children\u2019s Hospital & Medical Center, wants to warn other expecting mothers and new parents about the illness that made their son extremely sick.", "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/26293992", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/26293992", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/KETVBrandiPetersen"}, "keywords": "meningitis, listeria, listeria meningitis, childrens, ezra armstrong", "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "news_keywords": "meningitis, listeria, listeria meningitis, childrens, ezra armstrong"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde043\"", "article_summary": "Ezra Armstrong entered the world at a whopping 9-plus pounds, and the \u2018big guy\u2019 is still adding to that.\n\u201cI think the main takeaway for moms would be to listen to your obstetrician\u2019s advice,\u201d said Dr. Simonsen.\n\u201cOften times, the mom won\u2019t become clinically ill because of her normal immune system,\u201d said Dr. Simonsen.\nDr. Simonsen says it is important to note listeria meningitis is not contagious; you cannot spread the infection person to person.\nDoctors performed several tests, and a spinal tap revealed Ezra had meningitis, an infection of the coverings of the brain."}
