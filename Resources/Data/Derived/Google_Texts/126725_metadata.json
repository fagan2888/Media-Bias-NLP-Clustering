He thinks that carried interest should be treated instead as regular income, just like it would be if they were investment advisers or anything of the sort. In terms of tax policy, I haven\u2019t heard him say anything yet that I disagree with.\u201d\n\nRelated: 6 Tips from Warren Buffett on What to Do During a Market Crash\n\nTrump has derided hedge fund investors as \u201cpaper pushers\u201d who are \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and has said he wants to lower tax rates for the middle class. Buffett has publicly called for higher taxes on anyone making more than $1 million a year, and he agrees that the carried interest loophole should be closed \u2014 as do Hillary Clinton and now Jeb Bush, who proposed eliminating the break as part of a tax reform proposal released Wednesday.\n\nIn other interviews Tuesday, Buffett offered kind words for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the self-proclaimed socialist who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. \"I think Bernie Sanders has been a terrific campaigner. He campaigns exactly as I would campaign if I were a candidate,\" Buffett reportedly said. \"I think he's run a model campaign. He's not going to get elected, but I admire him.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Warren Buffett is backing Hillary Clinton for president, but that didn\u2019t stop him from", "title": "Buffett Is Backing Hillary Clinton, but Praises Trump and Sanders, Too", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/Buffett-Backing-Hillary-Clinton-Praises-Trump-and-Sanders-Too", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062012_Warren_Buffett_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/Buffett-Backing-Hillary-Clinton-Praises-Trump-and-Sanders-Too", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062012_Warren_Buffett_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Warren Buffett is backing Hillary Clinton for president, but that didn\u2019t stop him from", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Warren Buffett is backing Hillary Clinton for president, but that didn\u2019t stop him from tossing around praise for her rivals in a round of interviews Tuesday.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I agree with quite a bit of his economic program, just from what he\u2019s said,\u201d Buffett told Bloomberg Television.\nIn other interviews Tuesday, Buffett offered kind words for Sen.
