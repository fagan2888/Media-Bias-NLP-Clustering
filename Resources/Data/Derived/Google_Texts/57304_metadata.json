Stymied in its efforts to penetrate Israel\u2019s defenses by rocket attacks on its urban centers and through special operations, Hamas on Saturday attempted a blatant public relations exercise that achieved limited success, at least on its home front.\n\nAt 8 p.m., Hamas Television announced that in an hour\u2019s time a massive rocket barrage would be unleashed on Tel Aviv that would overcome Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system. A ticking clock was left visible onscreen to heighten the tension.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m., viewers watching Israeli television saw incoming rockets\u2014white tennis balls in the dark sky\u2014arcing northward through the sky towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Meanwhile, smaller points of light rising from Iron Dome batteries in their path to meet them.\n\nOne by one, the white lights were snuffed out. The scene was repeated several times. Each time, the rockets were either intercepted or, if on a trajectory to an unpopulated area, left to explode harmlessly on the ground.\n\nIsraelis, who had already seen rockets fired at Tel Aviv several times since the fighting began earlier last week, were puzzled at what Hamas had attempted to achieve in dramatizing a form of attack which had been consistently thwarted before.\n\nThe answer appeared to come from a subsequent scene on Hamas Television: children in Gaza dancing in the streets. A commentator on Israel Television said that Hamas knew it would boost spirits at home to show how its rockets could reach Israel\u2019s major city and send its population scurrying to shelters, even if Iron Dome shot down all the rockets.\n\nHamas had previously attempted an attack by its special forces through a tunnel under the border but the effort was foiled by Israel. It then sent naval commandos in a night attack against a southern Israeli coastal village but the attack force was wiped out shortly after emerging from the Mediterranean.\n\nHamas was also intending to send drones loaded with explosives into Israeli cities, according to Israeli military spokesmen who said that all the drones had been destroyed by the Israeli air force before they could be sent aloft.\n\nDespite hundreds of rockets fired at Israel over six days, there have yet been no fatalities and only a handful of wounded.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Jerusalem\u2014Hours after Hamas sent volleys of rockets at Tel Aviv, the Israeli Defense Forces today advised Palestinian residents of a neighborhood in northern Gaza to evacuate because the Israeli Air", "title": "Hamas Uses Terror as Domestic PR", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/hamas-uses-terror-as-domestic-pr/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP334577812241-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP334577812241-150x150.jpg", "title": "Hamas Uses Terror as Domestic PR", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "description": "Jerusalem\u2014Hours after Hamas sent volleys of rockets at Tel Aviv, the Israeli Defense Forces today"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd355\"", "article_summary": "The answer appeared to come from a subsequent scene on Hamas Television: children in Gaza dancing in the streets.\nMeanwhile, smaller points of light rising from Iron Dome batteries in their path to meet them.\nAt 8 p.m., Hamas Television announced that in an hour\u2019s time a massive rocket barrage would be unleashed on Tel Aviv that would overcome Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system.\nThe flight followed a failed Palestinian attempt to defeat Israel\u2019s anti-missile system, Iron Dome.\nShortly after 9 p.m., viewers watching Israeli television saw incoming rockets\u2014white tennis balls in the dark sky\u2014arcing northward through the sky towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area."}
