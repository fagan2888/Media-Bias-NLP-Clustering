The statistics are startling. About 44 percent of women in North Carolina have experienced rape, physical violence or stalking by a husband or boyfriend in their lifetimes, and about 25 percent of North Carolina women have been the victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives.

The WRAL Documentary, "Enough is eNOugh," examines the problem of domestic violence in the state from the perspectives of both victims and abusers.

It examines a story of domestic violence that reveals many of the common traits of abusive relationships and some of the challenges victims face in seeking help.

It also looks at how one North Carolina county is developing and deploying some innovative domestic violence prevention initiatives that could serve as models for other counties across the state and nation.

Hosted by WRAL News anchor Gerald Owens, “Enough is eNOough” originally aired Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014.
