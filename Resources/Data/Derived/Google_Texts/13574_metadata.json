That doesn\u2019t always happen. But in the last year or so, members of Congress responded to what one member called a \u201cconstituent-driven movement\u201d to rally around the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research it funds. Last month, Congress passed a $2 billion increase for the NIH, the biggest funding bump in over a decade, as part of larger spending bill for 2016. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna fight over Obamacare, we\u2019re gonna fight over family planning, we\u2019re gonna fight over any number of educational programs,\u201d said the Republican Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that determines healthcare, labor, and educational funding. But they\u2019re not going to fight over the value of the NIH.\n\nConstituents surely did have influence here; when legislators talk about why they supported more funding for the NIH, they cite the voices of research institutions in their districts, patient advocates, and often patients themselves. But the nonpartisan nature of disease had its effect, too: Biomedical research transcends political divides because everyone, including members of Congress, knows someone affected by conditions NIH researchers investigate. (Cole himself has intimate experience here: His wife has multiple sclerosis, and his dad had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. That experience, he\u2019s said, doesn\u2019t influence his funding preferences.) Latest from Politics The Edge: Trump\u2019s Magic Number Congressional disagreements around the agency tend to be limited to how much funding it deserves, not whether it deserves much at all. And as supporters prepare themselves for new budget negotiations around the corner, they\u2019re hoping this increase\u2014with money for Alzheimer\u2019s, precision medicine, and other research\u2014is the first of many to come. Historically, the NIH, the world\u2019s biggest backer of biomedical research, has enjoyed robust bipartisan support in Congress. At the turn of the 21st century, Congress doubled the agency\u2019s budget over five years, a period backers now refer to as the \u201cdoubling.\u201d More recently, though, the NIH hasn\u2019t seen the same kind of financial support, as focus shifted to national security concerns and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other concerns. The agency lost purchasing power and its ability to fund many grants over the last decade. But last year marked a change in the conversation around the NIH, something funding advocates attributed to a reshuffling of priorities. \u201cPeople are saying \u2018Enough, we have got to find answers and even if it means we\u2019re gonna spend more money than some would like\u2019 ... it\u2019s worth doing,\u201d Mary Woolley, the president of Research!America, said last month. Now that the NIH has gotten a bump, the agency Director Francis Collins hopes Congress will begin to make funding more reliable. The new budget figure is a \u201cwonderful development,\u201d Collins said last week, sounding a lot more optimistic than he did just two months ago, when the omnibus negotiations were ongoing. But he\u2019s quick to caution that his agency\u2019s battle isn\u2019t over. \u201cIt\u2019ll be even more wonderful if this actually begins a trend to get us back on a stable, predictable, upward trajectory,\u201d Collins said.\n\nHe said that researchers on the ground will begin to feel relief \u201calmost immediately\u201d from the 2016 budget increase, as more grants are funded. \u201cThis is the first time in quite a long time that we are able to look at our budget and feel excited and enthusiastic about what\u2019s there,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThis is a really good moment for a community that has been increasingly feeling quite stressed, and obviously we want them to get unleashed as quickly as possible.\u201d Collins and top health-care appropriators seem to be speaking the same language when it comes to the future of NIH funding. Roy Blunt, Cole\u2019s Senate Appropriations counterpart, who advocated for a $2 billion bump, arrived in Congress just as doubling began in the late 1990s. He said that while he wouldn\u2019t necessarily oppose some supporters\u2019 push for an even grander goal\u2014namely, another period of doubling\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to establish an \u201carbitrary\u201d dollar figure for Congress to be working toward. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is think that there\u2019s a goal [and] once you get there you\u2019re done, and you can turn in some other direction,\u201d Blunt said. Collins, too, wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a dollar goal, though he appreciates the thought. He called a \u201cfeast or famine\u201d approach to NIH funding \u201cthe worst way to support medical research.\u201d Nor do lawmakers expect to be satisfied by this 2016 increase. Representative Chris Van Hollen, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, whose Maryland district includes the NIH\u2019s headquarters, emphasizes the need for a sustainable pace. Lawmakers need to \u201cbuild upon\u201d the budget increase \u201cso that we can get back to where we would\u2019ve been\u201d if funding hadn\u2019t degraded after doubling. Patty Murray, Blunt\u2019s Democratic counterpart on the Senate subcommittee, said in a statement that while she\u2019s gratified by the bipartisan support around NIH, \u201cthere\u2019s no question that we can and should do more.\u201d More than half of the 2016 budget allocation will be spread out across the NIH\u2019s funding jurisdiction. Many of those \u201copportunities,\u201d as Collins calls them, are in basic research, the kind of fundamental investigations \u201cthat may not seem initially attached to a specific clinical advance, but are the future,\u201d Collins said. The budget bump also allocates funding to the kind of high-profile research taxpayers hope\u2014and expect\u2014the NIH will tackle. It includes specific funding for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, antimicrobial research, and the \u201cunprecedented\u201d Precision Medicine Initiative, a giant, multiyear research project in which 1 million Americans will allow scientists to track their health.\n\nThe initiative, launched during President Obama\u2019s 2015 State of the Union address, wouldn\u2019t have gotten off the ground this year without the budget bump. \u201cWe\u2019d been furiously planning for this effort over the course of the last year knowing that we might not actually be able to start unless the Congress came through with a budget increase,\u201d Collins said. The BRAIN Initiative, another White House favorite that studies how the human brain functions, will also see a \u201cramp-up\u201d thanks to the omnibus funding. Despite the warm feelings around the NIH, Collins predicts it won\u2019t be easy to secure another increase in the 2017 budget, which is part of a two-year agreement passed in October. \u201cThere are going to be some tough choices that\u2019ll have to be made in the appropriations process,\u201d he said. The Republicans in Congress who hold the purse strings are sending out early warning signals that prioritizing the NIH will necessitate cuts elsewhere. Blunt said the \u201cbiggest fight\u201d in the negotiations for 2017 will be the degree to which members prioritize the NIH. Cole predicts that the NIH will be \u201cthe preferred destination for extra dollars\u201d in next year\u2019s budget for his subcommittee, but said \u201cyou may have to rob some Peters to pay Paul, so to speak\u201d because of the expected flat allowance. He\u2019s looking to see what Obama proposes for the NIH when he sends out his 2017 budget request in early February. Last year, the president\u2019s proposed $1 billion boost was \u201chelpful\u201d to lawmakers, Cole said, and if the president backs another increase this year, it\u2019ll \u201chelp set the tone.\u201d Appropriators will get a boost, too, from the president\u2019s right hand, Joe Biden, whose personal views on biomedical research funding have translated recently to very public support. Just months after his son Beau died from brain cancer, Biden announced that he\u2019d be pursuing a \u201cmoon shot\u201d to end cancer. As President Obama noted in the State of the Union Tuesday night, Biden and his staffers weighed in with lawmakers and their teams during last year\u2019s omnibus negotiations. In the future, Biden plans to lobby for increased funding for NIH and other federally funded cancer-research institutions, and the president said Tuesday that the veep would be leading \"mission control\" in a new national quest to find a cure. Biden has also arranged for summits of stakeholders in the cancer-research community. According to one researcher who\u2019s met with Biden\u2019s staff, the vice president\u2019s office hopes to use the \u201cpower\u201d of his \u201cpersonality,\u201d \u201cthe power of what he and his family have been through,\u201d and his high-ranking position \u201cto move things forward.\u201d Blunt plans to contact the vice president soon\u2014as well as top congressional leadership\u2014to make sure 2016\u2019s increase is the start of a larger pattern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress rallied around the agency this year, giving it a major funding bump.", "author": "Nora Kelly", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Congress rallied around the agency this year, giving it a major funding bump.", "title": "What's Next for the National Institutes of Health?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/20384488641_d3898389be_o/facebook.jpg?1452695055", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/national-institutes-of-health-congress-budget/423837/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "He said that researchers on the ground will begin to feel relief \u201calmost immediately\u201d from the 2016 budget increase, as more grants are funded.\nNow that the NIH has gotten a bump, the agency Director Francis Collins hopes Congress will begin to make funding more reliable.\nLawmakers need to \u201cbuild upon\u201d the budget increase \u201cso that we can get back to where we would\u2019ve been\u201d if funding hadn\u2019t degraded after doubling.\nBut last year marked a change in the conversation around the NIH, something funding advocates attributed to a reshuffling of priorities.\nHistorically, the NIH, the world\u2019s biggest backer of biomedical research, has enjoyed robust bipartisan support in Congress."}
