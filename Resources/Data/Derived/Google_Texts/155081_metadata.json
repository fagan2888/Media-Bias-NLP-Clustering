She and her husband were on their way to the Child Protective Services Emergency Crisis Center. Why?\n\nThe police picked up the kids while they were outside again sometime Saturday afternoon, and this time the cops took them without telling their parents.\n\nThe kids, ages 10 and 6, were supposed to come home at 6:00 p.m. from playing. At 6:30 p.m, Danielle says, she and her husband Sasha were pretty worried. By 8:00 p.m., they were frantic. Only then did someone from the CPS Crisis Center call the parents and tell them that the police had picked the children up.\n\n\"It was dark!\" said Danielle, her voice shaking. \"You know, I'd really had a nightmare about this, but I didn't realize they would do it. I didn't think they would. The kids must be terrified.\"\n\n\"What did CPS tell you had happened?\" I asked.\n\n\"They wouldn't tell me anything about my children.\"\n\nHusband Sasha Meitiv, raised in the Soviet Union under complete state control, told his wife he was less surprised. \"He said, 'You don't understand how cruel bureaucracy can be,'\" said Danielle.\n\nI think we all are beginning to understand just how insane, paranoid, and vindictive the state can be when it comes to respecting human rights\u2014in this case, the right of parents who love their kids to raise them the way they see fit. And the right of kids, all kids, to be outside, part of the world, without having to worry about police snatching them off the street and holding them for hours without even letting them make a phone call.\n\nAccording to MyFoxDC, the children were released back into the Meitiv's custody but were required to sign a \"temporary safety plan,\" which prohibits them from letting the kids go outside by themselves:\n\nThe Meitivs say CPS didn't call them to let them know they had the kids until about 8 p.m. The Meitivs drove to CPS to pick up their kids, but say they were told to \"take a seat\" and initially weren't given any information about their children, except that they were there. Just after 10:30 p.m., the Meitivs were reunited with their kids. They had to sign a temporary safety plan to take them home. which means they are not allowed to leave the children unattended at all. The Meitivs' 10-year-old son told reporters they sat in the police car for about two hours before they were told they would be dropped off at home, but instead, they went to CPS in Rockville.\n\nStay tuned for updates.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\"You don't understand how cruel bureaucracy can be.\"", "title": "Maryland Parents Panic When Their Kids Are Once Again Confiscated By CPS", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/13/maryland-parents-panic-when-their-kids-a", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14288961136006.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14288961136006.jpg", "title": "Maryland Parents Panic When Their Kids Are Once Again Confiscated By CPS", "description": "\"You don't understand how cruel bureaucracy can be.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-04-13T04:12:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/lenore-skenazy"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "\"What did CPS tell you had happened?\"\nDanielle Meitiv, the Maryland Mom who lets her children play outside by themselves\u2014despite the government's ridiculous demands\u2014just called me.\nOnly then did someone from the CPS Crisis Center call the parents and tell them that the police had picked the children up.\nThe police picked up the kids while they were outside again sometime Saturday afternoon, and this time the cops took them without telling their parents.\nThe kids, ages 10 and 6, were supposed to come home at 6:00 p.m. from playing."}
