Patients making 200 percent less than federal poverty guidelines, without insurance, are able to visit the clinic like a primary care facility. The clinic works with 13 specialists all over the county, connecting patients with services in dental health, behavioral health and more.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey would go without these services if they weren\u2019t provided,\u201d Rahman Parker, LFC executive director, told the Times-Mirror. \u201cThere are some people that just aren\u2019t set up in a way to receive care like most of the community is.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe clinic was initially a project of the Catoctin Foundation, which no longer exists. It started seeing patients in 2002. Now, even in 2016, after the entirety of the Affordable Care Act has been implemented, the clinic is seeing a growing number of patients. Some days there are more patients than the facility can take in, said Parker.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have to decide if they\u2019re going to eat versus meeting their deductible,\u201d said Parker. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that nationwide, not just here. We\u2019ve got to customize something so that people can get the care they need and access it when they need to.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe clinic has 12 staff members and over 100 volunteers dedicated to helping serve the uninsured.\n\n\n\n\u201cVolunteers make the clinic run,\u201d said Parker. \u201cWithout them, we wouldn\u2019t be in existence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe clinic\u2019s full-time physicians show passion in their work each day, said the executive director.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not only a passion but an art form,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to watch our providers in their craft. It\u2019s amazing how skilled they are. You could akin it to a conductor or an artist. They figure out the patients' needs and how they can treat the whole patient, not just a cough.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaving connections to specialist all over the county allows the clinic to refer patients to the services they need to be truly healthy.\n\n\n\nProviding specialty care like mental health services can help combat larger community issues like addiction, said Parker.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople want the help. People are hurting and addiction is very powerful,\u201d said Parker. \u201cThe heroin issue is not just about drugs. It really speaks to a bigger issue of what\u2019s going on in our community. It\u2019s a symptom.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs long as there are people falling through the cracks in the health care system, Parker says the clinic will continue to help them with the aid of volunteers, donors, private foundations and county and state funding.\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit loudounfreeclinic.org.\n\n\n\nComments\n\nPost a comment\n\nCommenting is not available in this channel entry.\n\nComments express only the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of this website or any associated person or entity.
