What qualifies in this category of loans that the CFPB is trying to regulate?\n\nCHICO HARLAN, The Washington Post: Well, they\u2019re actually going after a pretty broad swathe of both short-term and medium-term loans, generally characterized by very high interest rates and by the target audience or the target consumer, which is \u2014 which tends to be \u2014 tends to be the working poor.\n\nYou have two categories, payday loans, which are \u2014 you know, you have two weeks, basically, to pay it back, and then installment loans, which go over a longer period. You still have astronomical interest rates. And they\u2019re paid back over weeks or sometimes months.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: What is the hazard when somebody takes a loan, can\u2019t take it or can\u2019t pay it back? They pick up another loan?\n\nCHICO HARLAN: Yes, that tends to be the biggest hazard.\n\nIt\u2019s that, you know, these loans are marketed as a two-week fix. Let\u2019s say you have some unforeseen emergency, a car accident, bills that are larger than anticipated. Well, you go to a payday lending store, and you take out a loan, with the idea that it will be paid back in two weeks.\n\nHowever, these are people who don\u2019t always have so much money on hand. And when that two-week period hits, boom, you have all this \u2014 these financing fees that are added in.\n\nAnd many people find themselves in a position where the only way they can pay back that loan and still pay for food and other daily needs is to take out yet another payday loan.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so what is the bureau going to do or want to do to try to prevent this from happening?\n\nCHICO HARLAN: Well, they\u2019re going after this in a couple of different ways.\n\nAnd it does get complicated, but I think maybe the key, the key thing, the pillar in this whole strategy is a cap that will come after the third loan.\n\nSo, let\u2019s say you take out a loan, renew it twice. Now a payday company can no longer get you on a fourth \u2014 or on a third renewal.\n\nThey basically have to give you an off-ramp, where all the money you owe after three payday loans in a row gets paid back over any period of time that you want.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So when do these proposed rules go into effect?\n\nCHICO HARLAN: Well, there\u2019s still going to be quite a long period of deliberation. I would suspect that some \u2014 by some time next year, these rules or some version of them will go into effect.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And what has the initial response been from the lending industry about this?\n\nCHICO HARLAN: Almost everybody I have talked to in the payday industry has made it clear that this was far more strict than expected.\n\nAnd the outcome, or the outcry, I should say, from people in the payday industry has been pretty \u2014 pretty fierce, saying that, this will really jeopardize our business, but more importantly \u2014 this is their words \u2014 this will jeopardize the ability of low-income people to get credit when they\u2019re oftentimes not serviced properly by banks.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Chico Harlan from The Washington Post, thanks so much.\n\nCHICO HARLAN: Thank you, Hari.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took new steps to protect the working poor from people critics describe as predatory lenders, those who make what are known as pay day loans.
