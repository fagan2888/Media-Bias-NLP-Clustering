The German Economics Ministry responded to the report calling it \"incomprehensible\" and told the United States to \u201canalyze its own economic situation.\u201d\n\nThe trade deficit was \u201ca sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany,\u201d the ministry said in the statement.\n\nRelated: \u201cMama\u201d Merkel May Win Germany, But Not the Eurozone\n\nTurns out, Treasury was on to something.\n\nAccording to numbers released Friday, Germany\u2019s trade surplus hit a new high in 2013. It now has a trade surplus of $271 billion, meaning that it exported $271 billion more than it imported.\n\nGerman sensitivity over Treasury\u2019s October report comes from an uncomfortable truth at the heart of the euro crisis: Germany has been able to get rich by exporting to eurozone partners. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t buy products from those partners, creating a trade surplus internally while depressing other eurozone economies.\n\nThe two charts below illustrate the problem. They illustrate the primary reason behind the entire euro crisis.\n\nGermany has recognized this problem in the past. In fact, as the second chart shows, Germany has been exporting less. But because the German economy grew just .04 percent last year, spendthrift Germans have been reluctant to buy products from elsewhere (quietly, many Germans make the argument that they don\u2019t buy foreign products because German ones are superior, but that\u2019s not a popular topic in Brussels these days).\n\nRelated: Germany's Tea Party: A Threat to European Unity\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only problem for the EU that emerged Friday. Despite making progress by scaling back its deficit by $8.31 billion, France is still running a deficit of $83.4 billion.\n\nFrance\u2019s economy has been weighed down by structural deficits for years now, hampering economic progress. There was widespread hope that 2013 would be a turnaround year for France. Even French Trade Minister Nicole Bricq expressed disappointment at the figure, saying that France would make a comeback this year.\n\n\u201cAfter a difficult year in 2013, the economic lights are turning to green, particularly in the eurozone where we do 47 percent of our trade,\u201d she said, calling 2014 a year of \"recovery and rebound.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Germany\u2019s trade surplus hit a record high last year, while France\u2019s economy continued to struggle under the weight of structural deficit.
