Bush for exceeding his constitutional authority. Since he\u2019s been in office, however, he has shown his predecessors what constitutional disrespect really looks like.\n\n\u201cThis is all part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he\u2019s going along. I disagree with that,\u201d then-Sen. Obama said while campaigning in May 2008. \u201cI taught the Constitution for 10 years. I believe in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nWatch the following clip compiled by Breitbart News:\n\nBut, as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told conservative talk radio host Mark Levin, Obama has been anything but respectful to the Constitution.\n\nLevin asked Cruz Thursday night about President Obama\u2019s use of executive power to change congressionally enacted laws, according to CNS News.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the most profoundly troubling aspects of the Obama administration, is the degree to which this is a lawless administration. Looking at the president\u2019s speech today, where he simply says, \u2018OK, these parts of the law we\u2019re not going to enforce,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cArticle II of the Constitution puts a responsibility on the president to \u2018take care that the law be faithfully executed.\u2019 Not only does this president not take care to faithfully execute the laws, but throughout his administration, we\u2019ve never seen a president that picks and chooses the way this president does.\u201d\n\nCruz then listed specific examples.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018Immigration laws, I\u2019m not going to enforce those. Drug laws, I\u2019m not going to enforce those. Obamacare, well, I\u2019m not going to enforce it against Big Business, I\u2019m not going to enforce it against members of Congress, and now, I\u2019m going to pick some of your plans, if I like them, I won\u2019t enforce it against them \u2014 except on alternate Tuesdays, when I\u2019m wearing a yellow hat,'\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cIt is the antithesis of rule of law. It is rule by arbitrary whim and discretion,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, as you know well, that is profoundly dangerous. For millennia, we had societies where monarchs ruled by whim. And the natural result of that is tyranny and loss of freedom of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nListen to the exchange, then if you haven\u2019t already, be sure to check out Mitt Romney earns Nostradamus reputation.\n\n[poll id=\u201d138\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama often criticized then-President George W.
