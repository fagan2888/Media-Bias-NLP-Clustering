He is so bad at syntax, your head will spin. But if there\u2019s one term that serves as central base for Trump\u2019s assault, a defining Trumpism that is his go-to means of superfluous emphasis, it is bigly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOr is that big league?\n\nFor the longest time, to this Trump observer at least, it sounded like bigly. Is this even a word? Maybe? That would hardly matter for Trump. For a grandiose figure who demonstrates, at least in public, a limited, essentials-only vocabulary, it would make sense that this wordlike entity appeals to him. Big is your simplest adjective for something that is, well, big\u2014in scope or size. And what to do if you need to express this in adverb form, as our loquacious entertainer frequently does? Append a -ly to the end of that sucker, per the elementary school heuristic. Bigly.\n\nThat\u2019s how many chroniclers of our would-be national leader have transcribed it. Iran is taking over Iraq, \u201cand they\u2019re taking it over bigly.\u201d As in, Iran isn\u2019t screwing around with this Iraq-takeover business. \u201cObamacare kicks in in 2016, really bigly.\u201d Whatever Obamacare was prior to 2016 will be no match for the Godzilla Obamacare that hits streets in the new year. \u201cI'm talking about illegal immigrants ... at least Fox is being honest because they're now talking about it bigly.\u201d Illegal immigration had been on Fox News\u2019 radar, but until Trump mentioned it, they hadn\u2019t grappled with the issue in a serious manner.\n\nBut what if this is not at all what Donald Trump has been saying? Could it be that at the end of term, he taps out a hard g sound? In a write-up of its Trump interview earlier this month, CNN transcribed Trump saying the following: \u201cI'm a believer, big league, in God and the Bible.\u201d Here\u2019s a man who doesn\u2019t just dabble in Christianity\u2014he\u2019s the real McCoy. \u201cMexico is ripping off the United States big league, and we have to do something about it.\u201d They\u2019re not skimming a buck off the top here or there, they\u2019re emptying the vault into burlap sacks. \u201cPersonally I'd put on the sanctions [on Iran] big league. I'd double and triple up the sanctions and make a deal from strength.\u201d The absolute big-league-est sanctions you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nSo which is it\u2014bigly or big league? Or does he flip a coin each morning to determine which one he\u2019ll go with that day?\n\n\"It\u2019s big league,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks tells Slate. Oh?
