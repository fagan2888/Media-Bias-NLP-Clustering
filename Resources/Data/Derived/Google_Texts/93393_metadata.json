None of his myriad moves made a bigger, more baffling splash than his trade of popular slugger Matt Kemp and $32 million to a division rival for what might be no more than half of a catching platoon.\n\nWhen Friedman is reminded he\u2019ll be loathed in his new town if Kemp\u2019s curious departure doesn\u2019t lead to World Series success in L.A., the new president of baseball operations replies with a laugh.\n\n\u201cNot any more than we\u2019ll hate ourselves,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nFriedman formed a master plan for deconstructing the Dodgers when he left parsimonious Tampa Bay to take over the highest-spending team in baseball, and his front office has been quick to implement it this winter. He has already made ample use of the Dodgers\u2019 seemingly bottomless financial resources, committing tens of millions just to get unwanted players out of town.\n\nHe might not know how his moves worked until next fall, but Friedman is confident about what will be left when the dust settles in Chavez Ravine on what he called \u201ca frenetic offseason.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur overarching goal coming into the offseason was to take a very strong collective of players and do our best to mold them into a highly functioning baseball team,\u201d Friedman said, referring to the disparate Dodgers roster that didn\u2019t always jell last season. \u201cWe feel like these moves speak to that, and we\u2019re excited about the way our position group fits together, how they complement one another.\u201d\n\nSince Friedman took over from Ned Colletti, Los Angeles has parted ways with Kemp, speedster Dee Gordon, hard-hitting Hanley Ramirez, fourth starter Dan Haren and expensive reliever Brian Wilson. The Dodgers have a new double-play combination in Howie Kendrick and Jimmy Rollins, new catcher Yasmani Grandal, right-hander Brandon McCarthy and a grab-bag of new relievers in their place, stabilizing the Dodgers\u2019 defense and addressing several possible problems from the plate to the clubhouse.\n\nWhen looking at the team that lost to St. Louis in the division series last October, many Dodgers fans saw the NL West champions as a sports car in need of a polish and a tuneup. Friedman put the Dodgers on blocks and ripped out several key components, determined to get more speed and performance out of an awfully expensive machine.\n\nThe moves might confuse fans, but they\u2019re intriguing to the players they\u2019re designed to help.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always moving forward, trying to get better,\u201d Kendrick said Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s always ways you can get better. That\u2019s been very cool to come into an organization that wants to improve their game.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LA Dodgers chart new course with rebuilt roster", "author": "Greg Beacham", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "LA Dodgers chart new course with rebuilt roster", "title": "LA Dodgers chart new course with rebuilt roster", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/20/la_dodgers_chart_new_course_with_rebuilt_roster/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/dodgers-revamp-los-angeles-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LA Dodgers chart new course with rebuilt roster", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/dodgers-revamp-los-angeles-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "LA Dodgers chart new course with rebuilt roster", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "LA Dodgers chart new course with rebuilt roster", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ccb\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Andrew Friedman has thoroughly overhauled a 94-win team in his first two months running the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe moves might confuse fans, but they\u2019re intriguing to the players they\u2019re designed to help.\nFriedman put the Dodgers on blocks and ripped out several key components, determined to get more speed and performance out of an awfully expensive machine.\nHe has already made ample use of the Dodgers\u2019 seemingly bottomless financial resources, committing tens of millions just to get unwanted players out of town.\nWhen Friedman is reminded he\u2019ll be loathed in his new town if Kemp\u2019s curious departure doesn\u2019t lead to World Series success in L.A., the new president of baseball operations replies with a laugh."}
