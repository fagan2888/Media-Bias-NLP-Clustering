The family-run operation, with 14 barns, normally has 2 million hens on site.\n\nDuerst said the fire became so large that 150 to 200 firefighters from at least five nearby counties representing as many as 55 departments helped fight the blaze. The building, which Duerst estimated was 300 feet long, 80 to 90 feet wide and three stories tall, was a total loss.\n\nDuerst, who has been chief for 11 years and on the La Grange volunteer force for 35 years, said he could not recall fighting a bigger blaze. Firefighters had to haul in water from seven miles away to fight the fire, he said.\n\n\"We're very thankful for the other departments,\" Duerst said Sunday. \"It's like the brotherhood of firefighters. If you call for help, they come.\"\n\nThe fire was brought under control by late Saturday morning, but firefighters showed up again Sunday morning to douse any remaining embers. A cause has not been determined, Duerst said.\n\nThe Schimpf family runs the egg farm, Duerst said, and employs 155 people. A family member could not be reached for comment, but a statement on the company's website said no one was injured in the blaze and all other barns were still in production.\n\nThe company plans to rebuild.\n\n\"S&R Egg Farm would like to thank and acknowledge the efforts of all the fire departments deployed and appreciates those sending compassionate regards,\" the company said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Egg farm fire that killed 300,000 hens still smoldering days later", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/egg-farm-fire-that-killed-300000-hens-still-smoldering-days-later-b99196825z1-243229131.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "The fire Friday night was so large that 150 to 200 firefighters from at least five nearby counties and as many as 55 departments helped fight it.", "title": "Fire that killed 300,000 hens still smoldering days later"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "The fire Friday night was so large that 150 to 200 firefighters from at least five nearby counties and as many as 55 departments helped fight it.", "card": "summary", "title": "Egg farm fire that killed 300,000 hens still smoldering days later"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda994\"", "article_summary": "The Schimpf family runs the egg farm, Duerst said, and employs 155 people.\n\"S&R Egg Farm would like to thank and acknowledge the efforts of all the fire departments deployed and appreciates those sending compassionate regards,\" the company said.\n\"We're very thankful for the other departments,\" Duerst said Sunday.\nBy of theFirefighters in the Town of La Grange in Walworth County were back on the scene Sunday morning pouring more water on the remains of a huge fire Friday night at the S&R Egg Farm that killed more than 300,000 hens.\nThe fire was brought under control by late Saturday morning, but firefighters showed up again Sunday morning to douse any remaining embers."}
