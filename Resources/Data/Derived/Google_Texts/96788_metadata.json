This is up almost 50% since 2012 and represents a $46 billion annual loss for the health program. Despite this, the Obama Administration has suspended an audit program that had already recovered more than $8 billion in improper payments.\n\nThe Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program, initiated in 2010, is charged with ferreting out waste and fraud in the giant Medicare program. The federal government contracts with private companies to investigate Medicare billing records and capture any improper payments. The companies are allowed to keep 9-12.5% of any money recovered, providing a market incentive to identify fraud. In 2012, before the Obama Administration put a hold on the program, RAC companies found $2.3 billion in improper payments.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn October 2013, the Obama administration undertook a series of steps to curtail the fraud recovery program. Over subsequent months, the administration suspended auditing activity and put a hold on awarding new contracts to police Medicare billing. Existing contracts have been extended only for \u201cadministrative and transition activities.\u201d In other words, the audits are supposed to wind down.\n\nThe suspension of the audit program is a victory for the American Hospital Association, which has led a lobbying campaign against the program. In a series of letters, the AHA has not only lobbied against the RAC program, but even auditing efforts by the federal government\u2019s own Office of the Inspector General.\n\n\u201cThe OIG\u2019s approach grossly exaggerates estimated Medicare overpayments, leads to excessive recoveries by Medicare contractors, and otherwise prejudices and burdens hospitals,\u201d one of the letters argues. Apparently, any audit process is too much for the nation\u2019s hospitals.\n\nOne piece of legislation, introduced by House Republicans, would block audits of Medicare providers unless their estimated error rate exceeded 40% of total billing. In other words, more than one-third of bills submitted to Medicare could be fraudulent before any audit threshold was triggered. Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation to suspend all audits for another 6 months.\n\nIn the 2012 fiscal year, federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, spent more than $60 billion in improper payments. A big chunk of the federal budget deficit could be eliminated, simply by ensuring that federal health care dollars are spent properly. Even such an obvious action runs into a lobbying buzz saw in Washington, however.\n\nIf the nation isn\u2019t serious about curtailing spending that, by law, shouldn\u2019t exist, what hope is there to curtail the spending choices we\u2019ve actually made?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama, Congress Block Efforts to Combat Medicare Fraud", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama, Congress Block Efforts to Combat Medicare Fraud", "title": "Obama, Congress Block Efforts to Combat Medicare Fraud - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Health/doctor-hand-on-heart-reuters.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/15/obama-congress-block-efforts-to-combat-medicare-fraud/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama, Congress Block Efforts to Combat Medicare Fraud", "title": "Obama, Congress Block Efforts to Combat Medicare Fraud - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Health/doctor-hand-on-heart-reuters.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Reuters,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Reuters", "published_time": "2014-12-15T06:41:32-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbca\"", "article_summary": "The Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program, initiated in 2010, is charged with ferreting out waste and fraud in the giant Medicare program.\nIn the 2012 fiscal year, federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, spent more than $60 billion in improper payments.\nDespite this, the Obama Administration has suspended an audit program that had already recovered more than $8 billion in improper payments.\nA big chunk of the federal budget deficit could be eliminated, simply by ensuring that federal health care dollars are spent properly.\nIn 2012, before the Obama Administration put a hold on the program, RAC companies found $2.3 billion in improper payments."}
