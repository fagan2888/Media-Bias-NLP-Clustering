It\u2019s more than a garden variety response. It\u2019s a release, and the laughter proves instructive of something larger at work.\n\nJimmy Fallon hit just such a nerve Wednesday night on The Tonight Show.\n\nThe host dressed up like Vladimir Putin for a sketch featuring the Russian leader and President Barack Obama. Mid-sketch, they had this exchange about Russia\u2019s aggressive political maneuvers in recent weeks.\n\nObama: You\u2019re forcing people to accept something that the majority of them don\u2019t even want. Putin: In Russia we have word for this \u2026 ObamaCare.\n\nFirst, a big laugh. Then, the crowd starts to applaud. An audience member or two begins to howl in approval. Then some the combination of applause and laughs subsides.\n\nJay Leno routinely tapped the growing anger over ObamaCare to his comic advantage. Fallon is starting to do the same, but it remains to be seen if he\u2019ll keep speaking comedy truth to power.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jimmy Fallon hit a nerve Wednesday night during a political sketch courtesy of a brutal ObamaCare joke.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jimmy Fallon hit a nerve Wednesday night during a political sketch courtesy of a brutal ObamaCare joke.", "title": "Jimmy Fallon's ObamaCare Slam Scores Big, Sustained Laugh - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/03/19/fallon-obama/fallon_obama.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/03/20/fallon-obamacare-joke-kills/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jimmy Fallon hit a nerve Wednesday night during a political sketch courtesy of a brutal ObamaCare joke.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/03/19/fallon-obama/fallon_obama.jpg", "title": "Jimmy Fallon's ObamaCare Slam Scores Big, Sustained Laugh - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jimmy Fallon, Russia, Vladimir Putin,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Vladimir Putin", "published_time": "2014-03-20T12:59:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0fe\"", "article_summary": "And then there are the laughter bursts, moments when the host hits a nerve judged by the audience\u2019s reaction.\nJimmy Fallon hit just such a nerve Wednesday night on The Tonight Show.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNo two laughs are the same when it comes to late night crowds.\nFallon is starting to do the same, but it remains to be seen if he\u2019ll keep speaking comedy truth to power.\nLive audiences can give hosts a courtesy laugh, a mild guffaw or even a smattering of applause if they recognize the gag is clever but not laugh-out-loud funny."}
