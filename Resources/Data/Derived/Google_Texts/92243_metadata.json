Going to the stars is often regarded as humanity\u2019s destiny, even a measure of its success as a species. But in the century since this vision was proposed, things we have learned about the universe and ourselves combine to suggest that moving out into the galaxy may not be humanity\u2019s destiny after all.\n\nThe problem that tends to underlie all the other problems with the idea is the sheer size of the universe, which was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars. Tau Ceti, one of the closest stars to us at around 12 light-years away, is 100 billion times farther from Earth than our moon. A quantitative difference that large turns into a qualitative difference; we can\u2019t simply send people over such immense distances in a spaceship, because a spaceship is too impoverished an environment to support humans for the time it would take, which is on the order of centuries. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to create some kind of space-traveling ark, big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.\n\nOn the other hand it would have to be small enough to accelerate to a fairly high speed, to shorten the voyagers\u2019 time of exposure to cosmic radiation, and to breakdowns in the ark. Regarded from some angles bigger is better, but the bigger the ark is, the proportionally more fuel it would have to carry along to slow itself down on reaching its destination; this is a vicious circle that can\u2019t be squared. For that reason and others, smaller is better, but smallness creates problems for resource metabolic flow and ecologic balance. Island biogeography suggests the kinds of problems that would result from this miniaturization, but a space ark\u2019s isolation would be far more complete than that of any island on Earth. The design imperatives for bigness and smallness may cross each other, leaving any viable craft in a non-existent middle.\n\nThe biological problems that could result from the radical miniaturization, simplification and isolation of an ark, no matter what size it is, now must include possible impacts on our microbiomes. We are not autonomous units; about eighty percent of the DNA in our bodies is not human DNA, but the DNA of a vast array of smaller creatures. That array of living beings has to function in a dynamic balance for us to be healthy, and the entire complex system co-evolved on this planet\u2019s surface in a particular set of physical influences, including Earth\u2019s gravity, magnetic field, chemical make-up, atmosphere, insolation, and bacterial load. Traveling to the stars means leaving all these influences, and trying to replace them artificially. What the viable parameters are on the replacements would be impossible to be sure of in advance, as the situation is too complex to model. Any starfaring ark would therefore be an experiment, its inhabitants lab animals. The first generation of the humans aboard might have volunteered to be experimental subjects, but their descendants would not have. These generations of descendants would be born into a set of rooms a trillion times smaller than Earth, with no chance of escape.\n\nIn this radically diminished enviroment, rules would have to be enforced to keep all aspects of the experiment functioning. Reproduction would not be a matter of free choice, as the population in the ark would have to maintain minimum and maximum numbers. Many jobs would be mandatory to keep the ark functioning, so work too would not be a matter of choices freely made. In the end, sharp constraints would force the social structure in the ark to enforce various norms and behaviors. The situation itself would require the establishment of something like a totalitarian state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forget what you saw in \"Interstellar.\" The odds of our successfully relocating to another planet are virtually nil", "title": "There is no planet B: We\u2019re not colonizing the Milky Way any time soon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Forget what you saw in \"Interstellar.\" The odds of our successfully relocating to another planet are virtually nil", "title": "There is no planet B: We\u2019re not colonizing the Milky Way any time soon", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/17/what_exactly_would_it_take_for_humans_to_ever_colonize_the_milky_way_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/MV5BMzAzMDczMTM4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0Mjk3MjE@._V1__SX1394_SY612_.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Forget what you saw in \"Interstellar.\" The odds of our successfully relocating to another planet are virtually nil", "title": "There is no planet B: We\u2019re not colonizing the Milky Way any time soon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/MV5BMzAzMDczMTM4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0Mjk3MjE@._V1__SX1394_SY612_.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kim Stanley Robinson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Astronomy, Milky Way, rocket science, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Going to the stars is often regarded as humanity\u2019s destiny, even a measure of its success as a species.\nThese generations of descendants would be born into a set of rooms a trillion times smaller than Earth, with no chance of escape.\nFor that reason and others, smaller is better, but smallness creates problems for resource metabolic flow and ecologic balance.\nIn the end, sharp constraints would force the social structure in the ark to enforce various norms and behaviors.\nMany jobs would be mandatory to keep the ark functioning, so work too would not be a matter of choices freely made."}
