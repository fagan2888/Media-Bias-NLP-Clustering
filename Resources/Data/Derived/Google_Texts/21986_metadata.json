But some declined to speak, showing hostility at being asked about an act that some regard as treason.\n\nAt a Gold Cup soccer game on Saturday against the United States in Baltimore, Cuba listed five players as absent and gave no reason.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve chosen their path,\u201d Cuba coach Raul Gonzalez said, without giving details.\n\nMijain Lopez, the two-time defending Olympic gold medalist in greco-roman wrestling, was reported almost five years ago to have defected to the United States. It\u2019s a rumor he denied at the time, and again this week.\n\n\u201cI never thought of leaving Cuba,\u201d he said at the Pan Am Games. \u201cI love my people, my country. Those guys [who defected] have betrayed our revolution. I hope they\u2019re happy. They have left something beautiful behind, which is socialism and our country\u2019s dignity. Let them do what they can in other countries. We will continue doing what we can for the revolution.\u201d\n\nA fellow Cuban gold-medal wrestler at the Pan Am Games used a similar tone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t stick my nose in politics,\u201d said Reineris Salas, after defeating Jake Herbert, an American, for gold in freestyle in the 86-kilogram class. \u201cAll I know is I won gold and dedicate it to my family, to Fidel Castro and all of Cuba.\u201d\n\nCuba-born Rafael Borrell attended a baseball game between Cuba and the United States at the Pan Am Games. He wore a white Cuba baseball jersey with No. 10 on the back, and a red cap with \u201cCuba\u201d written in script above the bill.\n\nBorrell immigrated to Canada 20 years ago and works as a carpenter.\n\n\u201cMaybe in two or three years it won\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can go back and forth like in any other place so then they won\u2019t have to be killed by sharks going to Florida.\u201d\n\nBorrell said many Cubans were unaware of defections, since the government doesn\u2019t publicize them, and some people are too busy to care.\n\n\u201cIn a couple of years, maybe these baseball players can sign a contract to play with the Yankees and come back [to Cuba] and just be normal \u2014 like in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico. They can go back and forth like human beings.\u201d\n\nCuba-born Enrique Montana showed off a foul ball he caught at the Cuba-U.S. game. He immigrated to Canada five years ago and now has a Canadian passport.\n\n\u201cI think people should be able to choose the path they want,\u201d Montana said. \u201cIf people want to stay, they stay. If they want to leave, they leave.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that simple. Dozens of baseball players have defected, including stars like Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox, Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aroldis Chapman of the Cincinnati Reds. They leave family behind, and reunification is never easy. The Cuban government also loses millions in training athletes who eventually flee.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t upset me,\u201d said Montana, who works in construction in Canada. \u201cMaybe it upsets somebody else. It\u2019s not my problem. Everybody has a right to choose whatever they want. If I had a chance to play on the grass in the United States and make those millions, I\u2019d go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two baseball players and four rowers defected from Cuba during its national team's visit to Toronto for this month's Pan American Games, and those decisions have affected the country's athletic programs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two baseball players and four rowers defected from Cuba during its national team\u2019s visit to Toronto for this month\u2019s Pan American Games, and those decisions have affected the country\u2019s athletic programs.", "title": "United in support for country, Cubans still remain divided on athletic defections", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/19/cuba-defection-divided-country-pan-am-embassy/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/af786a59342dac207c0f6a7067008f8a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/af786a59342dac207c0f6a7067008f8a.jpg", "description": "Two baseball players and four rowers defected from Cuba during its national team's visit to Toronto for this month's Pan American Games, and those decisions have affected the country's athletic progra", "card": "summary", "title": "United in support for country, Cubans still remain divided on athletic"}, "Author": "Stephen Wade", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Cuba, Canada"}, "article_summary": "If I had a chance to play on the grass in the United States and make those millions, I\u2019d go.\u201d\nTORONTO \u2014 The manager of Cuba\u2019s baseball team at the Pan American Games wanted nothing to do with questions about defections to the United States.\nMijain Lopez, the two-time defending Olympic gold medalist in greco-roman wrestling, was reported almost five years ago to have defected to the United States.\nAt a Gold Cup soccer game on Saturday against the United States in Baltimore, Cuba listed five players as absent and gave no reason.\nCuban athletes have a history of defecting, and that hasn\u2019t changed even as the United States and Cuba open embassies on Monday in the other\u2019s country, ending more than 50 years of separation."}
