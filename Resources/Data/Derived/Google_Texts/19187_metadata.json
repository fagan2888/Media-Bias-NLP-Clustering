(It was in a paper about that and other myths that I first encountered the zombie terminology.) Cockroaches are claims that disappear for a while when proved ludicrously wrong, but just keep on coming back.\n\nI think of the notion that Obamacare hasn\u2019t really reduced the number of uninsured as a cockroach; it seemed to me that it subsided for a while after the big enrollment numbers of 2014 and the sharp drop in uninsurance rates. And really, how could you continue to make that claim given the results shown above, which are corroborated by independent sources like Gallup?\n\nBut the claim is back, as Charles Gaba notes. He says that Avik Roy\u2019s latest is embarrassing, which I guess it is \u2014 but how much more embarrassed can the guy who did the totally spurious work on \u201crate shock\u201d get? I\u2019d say, rather, that the latest is impressive in the way it uses multiple layers of misrepresentation to obscure what you might have thought was too obvious to deny.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s another example of the proposition that in modern political discourse, in particular on the right, no bad argument is ever abandoned. It\u2019s like inequality, where the current position of the usual suspects is that it hasn\u2019t gone up, it has gone up but it\u2019s a good thing, we can\u2019t do anything about it, and anyway it\u2019s all the fault of liberals. You might think one would have to choose one of these lines, but they don\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151208103306, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 8, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Obamacare and the Cockroaches ( 20151208 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Bad ideas just keep coming back.", "title": "Obamacare and the Cockroaches", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/obamacare-and-the-cockroaches/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Bad ideas just keep coming back.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 8, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1449588786, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T15:33:06-05:00"}, "utime": 20151208153306, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20151208, "pdate": 20151208, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Bad ideas just keep coming back.", "title": "Obamacare and the Cockroaches", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/obamacare-and-the-cockroaches/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/obamacare-and-the-cockroaches/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Obamacare and the Cockroaches", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca776\"", "article_summary": "Cockroaches are claims that disappear for a while when proved ludicrously wrong, but just keep on coming back.\nPhotoIn policy discourse, zombies and cockroaches are somewhat different.\nAnd really, how could you continue to make that claim given the results shown above, which are corroborated by independent sources like Gallup?\n(It was in a paper about that and other myths that I first encountered the zombie terminology.)\nYou might think one would have to choose one of these lines, but they don\u2019t."}
