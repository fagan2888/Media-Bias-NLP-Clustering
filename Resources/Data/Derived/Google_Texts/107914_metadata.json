Having the coaches tell you they want to rest you for the playoffs and then when the playoff time comes that didn\u2019t happen \u2014 I\u2019ve never been the type of guy to let anybody tell me I can\u2019t play. I\u2019m excited for the new opportunity I have.\u201d\n\nWoodyard, who will turn 28 in July, signed with Tennessee after also visiting New England.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new era with this franchise and I wanted to be a part of it,\u201d Woodyard said. \u201cThey want me to call the plays and run the defense so I was down for that.\u201d\n\nDuring his six seasons with the Broncos, Woodyard became one of the team\u2019s most popular players inside the locker room and with the fan base. He was selected co-captain in each of the five seasons since his rookie year. Off the field, Woodyard\u2019s charitable work made him three-time nominee as the Broncos\u2019 Walter Payton Man of Year.\n\n\u201cMy foundation, we\u2019re not going to up and leave Denver,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to have the football camp, we still have the Toy Drive in place. I made some great friends in the community, people like the mayor (Michael Hancock) so I\u2019m still connected in Denver.\n\n\u201cI wish my teammates the best. I\u2019m sure Danny is going to step up and be the leader of that defense. I\u2019d like to personally thank (owner) Pat Bowlen for the opportunity he\u2019s given me for the last six years and the amazing fans of Denver.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss that place, but even though I\u2019m gone I won\u2019t forget and I\u2019ll always be there working in the community.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wesley Woodyard agrees to terms with Tennessee Titans for four years, $16 million", "title": "Wesley Woodyard agrees to terms with Tennessee Titans for four years, $16 million", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/14/wesley-woodyard-agrees-to-terms-with-tennessee-titans-for-four-years-16-million-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140131_094111_wesley-woodyard-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140131_094111_wesley-woodyard-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-14T18:09:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:03:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e5e\"", "article_summary": "Woodyard signed a four-year, $16 million deal Friday with the Titans, who will start him at middle linebacker.\nWoodyard and the Tennessee Titans beg to differ.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss that place, but even though I\u2019m gone I won\u2019t forget and I\u2019ll always be there working in the community.\u201dMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis\nI\u2019m excited for the new opportunity I have.\u201dWoodyard, who will turn 28 in July, signed with Tennessee after also visiting New England.\nThe Broncos\u2019 coaching staff told Wesley Woodyard he was not a middle linebacker."}
