The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent leafed through his calendar this morning and discovered that Republicans have promising to unveil their big Obamacare replacement for 50 months, a gestation period that is about twice as long as that of actual, real-live elephants.\n\nInstead of substantive plans, they give us vague notions of plans spelled out in newspaper Op-Eds. Typically they don\u2019t progress much further beyond gauzy promises of cheap, comprehensive health coverage rooted in \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cpatient-centered reforms.\u201d In the past couple of weeks alone we\u2019ve seen healthcare \u201cplans\u201d put forward by former Sen. Phil Gramm (the \u201cfreedom option\u201d), a trio of Republican senators (\u201cfreedom and flexibility\u201d for the states), and a trio of House Republicans (\u201can off-ramp out of ObamaCare toward patient-centered health care\u201d). It\u2019s all the same non-specific prattle we\u2019ve heard countless times over the past five years, and it\u2019s intended to give the impression that the GOP is finally, finally, finally getting serious about healthcare reform.\n\nNow we have a brand new entrant into this discussion: Ted Cruz. The junior senator from Texas unveiled his very own healthcare plan this week and actually managed to put his determinedly vague colleagues to shame by crafting an actual piece of legislation that you can hold in your hands. Make no mistake: his proposed bill is a pile of hot garbage that will screw over countless people. But hey, at least it\u2019s a plan!\n\nCruz has long been adamant that every single word of the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, but his proposed legislation only takes out part of the ACA. It would immediately repeal Title I of the Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate the individual and employer mandates, the state-based exchanges, subsidies for purchasing insurance, the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, the requirement that kids can stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26, the prohibition on capping lifetime benefits \u2013 basically most of what people love and hate about the ACA. Simply put, Cruz wants to strike down most of the policies the ACA put in place to protect consumers from the worst abuses of the insurance market, and in their place he\u2019d put\u2026 nothing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz's terrible healthcare reform bill helps explain why Republicans can't agree on an Obamacare replacement", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s healthcare sham: Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with nothing", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ted Cruz's terrible healthcare reform bill helps explain why Republicans can't agree on an Obamacare replacement", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s healthcare sham: Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with nothing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/06/ted_cruzs_healthcare_sham_repealing_obamacare_and_replacing_it_with_nothing/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/ted_cruz_freedom_summit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz's terrible healthcare reform bill helps explain why Republicans can't agree on an Obamacare replacement", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s healthcare sham: Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with nothing", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/ted_cruz_freedom_summit.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, congressional republicans, Conservatives, health insurance reform, Healthcare Reform, Obamacare, Republicans, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Cruz has long been adamant that every single word of the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, but his proposed legislation only takes out part of the ACA.\nTopics: Affordable Care Act, congressional republicans, Conservatives, health insurance reform, Healthcare Reform, Obamacare, Republicans, Ted Cruz, Politics NewsOne of the biggest criticisms of the GOP when it comes to healthcare reform is that, for all their blustering and fulminating against the Affordable Care Act, they just can\u2019t seem to put together a coherent plan of their own.\nIt\u2019s all the same non-specific prattle we\u2019ve heard countless times over the past five years, and it\u2019s intended to give the impression that the GOP is finally, finally, finally getting serious about healthcare reform.\nInstead of substantive plans, they give us vague notions of plans spelled out in newspaper Op-Eds.\nMake no mistake: his proposed bill is a pile of hot garbage that will screw over countless people."}
