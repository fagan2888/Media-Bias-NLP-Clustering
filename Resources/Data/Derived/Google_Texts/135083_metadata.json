In the last few years, FDA's responsibilities have significantly expanded through enactment of Tobacco legislation, Food Safety legislation and Generic Drug legislation, just to name a few. As a result, FDA is reexamining how to perform its regulatory responsibilities in the most efficient and effective way. Nowhere in FDA are these challenges more real than how the ORA resources are used.\"\n\nThe position would \"lead all of [the Office for Regulatory Affairs' (ORA)] strategic management responsibilities,\" it added, and take charge of approximately 350 ORA staff members.\n\nDuties will include strategic planning, risk-based resource allocation, designing long-term work plans, working with FDA product centers to integrate needs, and \"designing a change management program for the field to meet the ever increasing needs for specialization in the ORA workforce.\"\n\nThe new division, RASM, appears to be a part of the ORA overhaul announced in February 2014. At the time, FDA said it wanted its regulatory programs to become more \"vertically-integrated\" and be characterized by \"coherent policy and strategy development.\"\n\nFDA Job Posting for DACRA SM", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "FDA, US, News, Regulatory strategy", "Description": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is looking to hire  a high-level regulatory official to lead the agency's brand new division of  Regulatory Affairs Strategic Management (RASM), it announced this  week.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Title": "FDA Quietly Announces Creation of New Regulatory Division, Search Begins for Leader"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07c3\"", "article_summary": "As a result, FDA is reexamining how to perform its regulatory responsibilities in the most efficient and effective way.\nThe position would \"lead all of [the Office for Regulatory Affairs' (ORA)] strategic management responsibilities,\" it added, and take charge of approximately 350 ORA staff members.\nBy Alexander Gaffney, RACThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is looking to hire a high-level regulatory official to lead the agency's brand new division of Regulatory Affairs Strategic Management (RASM), it announced this week.\nAt the time, FDA said it wanted its regulatory programs to become more \"vertically-integrated\" and be characterized by \"coherent policy and strategy development.\"\nThe new division, RASM, appears to be a part of the ORA overhaul announced in February 2014."}
