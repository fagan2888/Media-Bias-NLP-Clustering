Burwell, argued in the Supreme Court on March 4,\u201d he said. \u201cThere, Justice Kennedy, among others, noted the \u2018serious constitutional problem\u2019 that would result if a federal statute were interpreted as threatening the citizens of a State with significant injury unless the State agreed to follow federal policies. This case involves the same pressures on States to knuckle under to the Federal Government, and the same lack of clear notice. EPA\u2019s plan confronts the States with an unforeseeable choice and essentially remakes the agreement between them and the Federal Government that has existed since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970.\u201d\n\nIntentionally or otherwise, Tribe was posing a challenge to his liberal critics: If you believe Obamacare\u2019s challengers have read the ACA in an unconstitutional way, then take your complaints elsewhere, because Obama\u2019s climate regulations are no different. And if he were right, he\u2019d be confronting liberals with the greatest Sophie\u2019s choice in recent political memory, wherein one of Obama's biggest legacies might survive at the expense of the other.\n\nIn one procedural sense, Tribe is correct. If Obamacare withstands the King challenge on federalism grounds, conservatives will turn around and use the Court\u2019s decision as a weapon against the Clean Power Plan. (Though as Tribe\u2019s involvement suggests, they\u2019re going to use constitutional arguments against the plan no matter what happens in King.) And federal judges determined to use a federalism ruling in King to support an opinion voiding EPA's plan can do just that if they want. \u201cIf the King plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the ACA is coercive,\u201d posits King architect Jonathan Adler, \u201cthen so too is the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the [Clean Air Act].\u201d\n\nBut as a purely intellectual matter, there\u2019s very little resemblance between the two. Liberals can support a Supreme Court decision upholding ACA subsidies on federalism grounds and full implementation of the Clean Power Plan, and there need be no contradiction.\n\nKing challengers\u2019 interpretation of Obamacare is exceedingly strange, which in turn makes it difficult to weaponize against other regulatory programs in an honest way. King posits that Congress sought to create universal health care programs on a state-by-state basis by threatening to ruin insurance markets\u2014to frustrate their ultimate universal health care goal\u2014in non-capitulating states.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan is nothing like that. It encourages states to implement plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and says the federal government will step in and implement a different plan toward the same end in states that decline. Tribe describes the federal fallback derisively when he says, \u201cEPA claims the power to impose severe sanctions, including the loss of highway and Clean Air Act funds, as well as the imposition of a centrally planned and administered federal scheme that could harm not simply the State but also its citizens and economy.\u201d\n\nBut even on his own terms, this is nothing like the coercive scheme at issue in King. For the parallel to hold, the EPA would have to be encouraging states to implement their own clean power plans by threatening to exacerbate pollution in states that don\u2019t, or something similarly counterproductive.\n\n\u201cIf the Clean Power Plan example looked like King vs. Burwell,\u201d University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley told me, \u201cwhat you\u2019d have is a federal scheme that didn\u2019t provide power to people, didn\u2019t reduce emissions, and torched the energy market in each state.\u201d\n\nBoston University law professor Abby Moncrieff is of a similar view. In a detailed post on Harvard Law School\u2019s website, she explains why King and the Clean Air Act, from which EPA derives its authority to implement the Clean Power Plan, are nothing alike.\n\nUnder the plaintiffs\u2019 read, this is Obamacare\u2019s threat: \u201cIf you set up an exchange (task 1), we will enforce a rational set of insurance market regulations in your state, some of which will apply both on and off the exchanges (our choice of how to do task 2), but if you rely on us to set up an exchange (back to task 1), we will enforce a destructive set of insurance market regulations in your state (a punitive version of task 2).\u201d That structure would be brand new to cooperative federalism, and it would be a transparent attempt at coercion.\n\nThe irony that Obamacare might survive on states' rights grounds has created an opportunity for conservatives to pit liberals against one another. But there really is something unique about the King challengers\u2019 interpretation of the ACA. You can believe it\u2019s unconstitutionally coercive\u2014that Congress shouldn't threaten states with insurance market death spirals and crippled energy markets\u2014without weakening the foundation of other important federal regulatory schemes. Because no other federal regulatory schemes actually work that way.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that Tribe argued in federal court on Wednesday.
