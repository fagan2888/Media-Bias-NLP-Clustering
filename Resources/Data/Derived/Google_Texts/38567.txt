LOWELL, Mass. (AP) - The owner of the Class-A minor league Lowell Spinners baseball team says he plans to sell after 19 years.

Drew Weber tells the Lowell Sun (http://bit.ly/1Uvy6uw) it’s a “tough decision.” But Weber, now 70, said Saturday it’s harder to run the team as he divides his time between homes in Lowell and New York. He says he wants to spend more time with his three grandchildren.

A sale wouldn’t immediately affect the Spinners’ affiliation with the Boston Red Sox, which runs through the 2016. The team’s lease with the city for LeLacheur Park has three years remaining.

Weber and his late wife Joann, who died in 2006, bought the New York-Penn league team for $2.2 million in 1997. Weber said he has no particular buyer in mind and hasn’t set a price.
