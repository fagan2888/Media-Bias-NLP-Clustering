Its \u201c2015 ADPAnnual Health Benefits Report \u201d is a pretty comprehensive look back at five years of health benefits data from U.S.-based companies with 1,000 or more employees going back to 2011 (just FYI, President Barack Obama signed the legislation in March 2010).\n\nAccording to ADP\u2019s survey, \u201cSince 2011, total premiums (including the employer and employee portions) increased by 9.4 percent, or about 2 percent every year.\u201d\n\nA story we posted in 2009 stated, \u201cHealth care premiums have risen 131 percent in the past 10 years.\u201d That year, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust\u2019s annual report, premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance rose to $13,375 for family coverage, up 5 percent from 2008, reported my former Workforce colleague Jeremy Smerd. That was actually a relatively modest increase compared with the double-digit spikes posted through much of that decade. That year forecasters predicted a 7.4 percent increase\u2014which still would have marked the third consecutive year of declines.\n\nAt the time, Jeremy quoted Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation as saying: \u201cIt is health care as an economic issue that has fueled the health reform debate.\u201d\n\nAs we look back now, Altman was indeed prophetic. And it remains an economic issue to this day, though some continue to bleat that it\u2019s purely political, conveniently forgetting the health and financial ramifications of an uninsured workforce. The ADP report clearly shows that health reform is having a positive effect as premium increases have evened out substantially.\n\nConsider that from 2014 to 2015, total premiums increased 2.6 percent, the report notes \u2014 certainly modest compared to 2009, and a huge gain from the 2000s.\n\n\u201cThis could be partially due to more employers offering high-deductible plans with higher copays and implementing flexible spending accounts and consumer-directed health plans,\u201d the report states.\n\nI think that goes without saying. And there are ramifications both pro and con to insuring your population under CDHPs.\n\nBut that\u2019s a story \u2014 or a report \u2014 for another day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite all that\u2019s been said about the Affordable Care Act, one undeniable fact in its favor, five years after its passage, health care costs are stabilizing for employers.
