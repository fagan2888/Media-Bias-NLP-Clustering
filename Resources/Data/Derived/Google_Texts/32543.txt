A northwest Kansas man died early Saturday morning following a house fire.

Crews were called around 2:30 a.m. to a home in the 300 block of W. North Street in Logan. That's in Phillips County. When they arrived on scene, "a good portion of the residence was fully engulfed in flames," the sheriff's officials said.

Firefighters extinguished the blaze and conducted rescue operations.

A man who was inside the home died as a result of his injuries. He has been identified as 45-year-old Mark L. Runnion.

The cause of the fire is under investigation, and a damage estimate has yet to be determined.
