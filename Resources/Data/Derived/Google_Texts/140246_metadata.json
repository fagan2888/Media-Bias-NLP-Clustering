Unlike most anti-vaxxers, Lanka actually has a degree (we think). Like all anti-vaxxers, in my opinion, Lanka is also wrong. So wrong, in fact, that a German court ordered him to pay German doctor David Barden 100,000 euros ($106,000) after Lanka announced via his website that he would pay anyone who could prove measles is an actual virus. Needless to say, Barden was able to provide adequate evidence.\n\nA recent measles outbreak in Germany has resulted in vaccination debate similar to the current one in the United States. The debate has raged on ever since an 18-month-old boy from Berlin became the first casualty of the outbreak. While speaking with a German newspaper, Lanka referred to measles as \u201ca psychosomatic illness\u201d that causes people to become ill after traumatic separations.\u201d Over 750 cases have been reported across Germany since October.\n\nLanka boldly offered up 100,000 euros to anyone who could prove measles is a virus on his website four years ago. Barden decided to take Lanka up on his offer and began gathering a wealth of research supporting measles as a virus (there is plenty). In true anti-vaxxer fashion, Lanka disregarded each and every peer-reviewed study Barden presented and refused to pay up. That\u2019s when a court in Ravensburg stepped in to remind Lanka that a bet\u2019s a bet.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children even though a safe and inexpensive vaccine is available. Around 145,700 people died around the world in 2013 as the result of measles. Recently, the WHO Regional Office for Europe asked health care professionals, policy-makers, and parents to increase the number of children from all age groups who receive vaccination against measles.\n\n\u201cWhen we consider that over the past two decades we have seen a reduction of 96 percent in the number of measles cases in the European Region, and that we are just a step away from eliminating the disease, we are taken aback by these numbers. We must collectively respond, without further delay, to close immunization gaps,\u201d Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, said in a statement. \u201cIt is unacceptable that, after the last 50 years\u2019 efforts to make safe and effective vaccines available, measles continues to cost lives, money, and time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "german, biologist, anti-vaxxer, measles, vaccination", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A German biologist/anti-vaxxer offered 100,000 euros to the first person who could prove measles is a virus.
