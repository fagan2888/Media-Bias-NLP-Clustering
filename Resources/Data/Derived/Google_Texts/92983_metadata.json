In similar fashion, it will undoubtedly be many years before renewable forms of energy \u2014 wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, and others still in development \u2014 replace fossil fuels as the world\u2019s leading energy providers. Nonetheless, 2015 can be viewed as the year in which the epochal transition from one set of fuels to another took off, with renewables making such significant strides that, for the first time in centuries, the beginning of the end of the Fossil Fuel Era has come into sight.\n\nThis shift will take place no matter how well or poorly the deal just achieved at the U.N. climate summit in Paris is carried out. Although a robust commitment by participating nations to curb future carbon emissions will certainly help speed the transition, the necessary preconditions \u2014 political will, investment capital, and technological momentum \u2014 are already in place to drive the renewable revolution forward. Lending a hand to this transformation will be a sharp and continuing reduction in the cost of renewable energy, making it increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), between now and 2040 global investments in renewable power capacity will total $7 trillion, accounting for 60% of all power plant investment.\n\nFossil fuels will not, of course, disappear during this period. Too much existing infrastructure \u2014 refineries, distribution networks, transportation systems, power plants, and the like \u2014 are dependent on oil, coal, and natural gas, which means, unfortunately, that these fuels will continue to play a prominent role for decades. But the primary thrust of new policies, new investment, and new technology will be in the advancement of renewables.\n\nBreakthrough Initiatives\n\nTwo events on the periphery of the Paris climate summit were especially noteworthy in terms of the renewable revolution: the announcement of an International Solar Alliance by India and France, and the launching of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition by Bill Gates of Microsoft, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and a host of other billionaires.\n\nAs described by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the International Solar Alliance is meant to mobilize private and public funds for the development and installation of affordable solar systems on a global scale, especially in developing countries. \u201cWe intend making joint efforts through innovative policies, projects, programs, capacity-building measures, and financial instruments to mobilize more than 1,000 billion U.S. dollars of investments that are needed by 2030 for the massive deployment of affordable solar energy,\u201d Modi and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollandeindicated in a joint statement on November 30th.\n\nAccording to its sponsors, the aim of this program is to pool financing from both public and private sources in order to bring down the costs of solar systems even further and speed their utilization, especially in poor tropical countries. \u201cThe vast majority of humans are blessed with sunlight throughout the year,\u201d Modi explained. \u201cWe want to bring solar energy into their lives.\u201d\n\nTo get the alliance off the ground, the Indian government will commit some $30 billion for the establishment of the alliance\u2019s headquarters in New Delhi. Modi has also pledged to increase solar power generation in India by 2,500% over the next seven years, expanding output from 4 to 100 gigawatts \u2014 thereby creating a vast new market for solar technology and devices. \u201cThis day is the sunrise of new hope, not just for clean energy, but for villages and homes still in darkness,\u201d he said in Paris, adding that the solar alliance would create \u201cunlimited economic opportunities\u201d for green energy entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Breakthrough Energy Coalition, reportedly the brainchild of Bill Gates, will seek to channel private and public funds into the development of advanced green-energy technologies to speed the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. \u201cTechnology will help solve our energy issues,\u201d the project\u2019s website states. \u201cScientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs can invent and scale the innovative technologies that will limit the impact of climate change while providing affordable and reliable energy to everyone.\u201d\n\nAs Gates imagines it, the new venture will seek to bundle funds from wealthy investors in order to move innovative energy breakthroughs from the laboratory \u2014 where they often languish \u2014 to full-scale development and production. \u201cExperience indicates that even the most promising ideas face daunting commercialization challenges and a nearly impassable Valley of Death between promising concept and viable product,\u201d the project notes. \u201cThis collective failure can be addressed, in part, by a dramatically scaled-up public research pipeline, linked to a different kind of private investor with a long-term commitment to new technologies who is willing to put truly patient flexible risk capital to work.\u201d\n\nJoining Gates and Bezos in this venture are a host of super-rich investors, including Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba, the Chinese internet giant; Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chairman of Facebook; George Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management; and Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of India\u2019s giant Tata Sons conglomerate. While seeking to speed the progress of green technology, these investors also see a huge potential for future profits in this field and, as the venture claims, \u201cwill certainly be motivated partly by the possibility of making big returns over the long-term, but also by the criticality of an energy transition.\u201d\n\nWhile vast in their ambitions, these two schemes are not without their critics. Some environmentalists worry, for example, that Modi\u2019s enthusiasm for the International Solar Alliance might actually be a public relations device aimed at deflecting criticism from his plans for increasing India\u2019s reliance on coal to generate electricity. A report by Climate Action Tracker, an environmental watchdog group, noted, for instance, that \u201cthe absolute growth in [India\u2019s] coal-powered electric generating capacity would be significantly larger than the absolute increase in renewable/non-fossil generation capacity\u201d in that country between 2013 and 2030. \u201cUltimately, this would lead to a greater lock-in of carbon-intensive power infrastructure in India than appears necessary.\u201d\n\nThe Gates initiative has come under criticism for favoring still-experimental \u201cbreakthrough\u201d technologies over further improvements in here-and-now devices such as solar panels and wind turbines. For example, Joe Romm, a climate expert and former acting assistant secretary of energy, recently wrote at the website Climate Progress that \u201cGates has generally downplayed the amazing advances we\u2019ve had in the keystone clean technologies,\u201d such as wind and solar, while \u201cinvesting in new nuclear power, geo-engineering technologies, and off-the-wall stuff.\u201d\n\nDespite such criticisms, the far-reaching implications and symbolic importance of these initiatives shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. By funneling billions \u2014 and in the end undoubtedly trillions \u2014 of dollars into the development and deployment of green technologies, these politicians and plutocrats are ensuring that the shift from fossil fuels to renewables will gain further momentum with each passing year until it becomes unstoppable.\n\nThe Developing World Goes Green\n\nIn another sign of this epochal shift, ever more countries in the developing world \u2014 including some oil-producing ones \u2014 are embracing renewables as their preferred energy sources. According to the IEA, the newly industrialized countries, spearheaded by China and India, will spend $2.7 trillion on renewable-based power plants between 2015 and 2040, far more than the older industrialized nations.\n\nThis embrace of renewables by the developing world is especially significant given the way the major oil and gas companies \u2014 led by ExxonMobil and BP \u2014 have long argued that cheap fossil fuels provide these countries with the smoothest path to rapid economic development. Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson has even claimed that there is a \u201chumanitarian imperative\u201d to providing the developing world with cheap fossil fuels in order to save \u201cmillions and millions of lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Big Oil is in big, big trouble.
