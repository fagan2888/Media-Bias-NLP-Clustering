It\u2019s not a clean break, he said.\n\nAnd even though Lyles, a right-handed pitcher, can continue to throw during his recovery, he\u2019s headed to the disabled list.\n\nLeft-handed reliever Boone Logan also joined Lyles on the disabled list Thursday because of left-elbow inflammation.\n\nLogan underwent an MRI that showed no structural damage. He had been pitching through pain in recent appearances. Logan had surgery in October for a bone chip and a bone spur on his left elbow. It forced him into a late start in spring training.\n\nThe Rockies gave Logan three-year, $16.6 million free-agent deal in the offseason.\n\nLyles doesn\u2019t know how much time he will miss, but didn\u2019t sound optimistic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be out,\u201d Lyles said.\n\n\u201cI guess ask Walt. Whatever he wants to say,\u201d Lyles said of his manager, Walt Weiss. \u201cI don\u2019t know a timetable.\u201d\n\nLyles said he will likely not need surgery.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be out for a few weeks \u2014 we don\u2019t know exactly how long that is right now,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of those things where he\u2019ll have to be re-evaluated every week or so. And go from there.\u201d\n\nWeiss said he does not think Lyles will move to the 60-day DL. Rockies trainer Keith Dugger said that Lyles will need either a cast or a hard-splint, but only after the swelling goes down in his hand.\n\nThe Rockies on Thursday called up reliever Chris Martin from Triple-A Colorado Springs to take Lyles\u2019 roster spot, and Franklin Morales, who was an option to replace Lyles in the starting rotation, is for now staying in the bullpen.\n\nWithout Logan in the mix, the Rockies will face Arizona on Thursday with a 24-man roster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some options to take Jordan\u2019s spot,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made that decision yet. I\u2019m not gonna throw them out there right now. But we\u2019ve got a couple, three options.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jordan Lyles unsure about timeline; Rockies add Boone Logan to DL", "title": "Jordan Lyles unsure about timeline; Rockies add Boone Logan to DL", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/05/jordan-lyles-unsure-about-timeline-rockies-add-boone-logan-to-dl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140605__lylesp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140605__lylesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-05T15:27:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:43:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9f2\"", "article_summary": "Left-handed reliever Boone Logan also joined Lyles on the disabled list Thursday because of left-elbow inflammation.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some options to take Jordan\u2019s spot,\u201d Weiss said.\nWhatever he wants to say,\u201d Lyles said of his manager, Walt Weiss.\nAnd even though Lyles, a right-handed pitcher, can continue to throw during his recovery, he\u2019s headed to the disabled list.\nI\u2019m not gonna throw them out there right now."}
