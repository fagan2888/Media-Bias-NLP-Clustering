Roy said the players did not \u201cbattle\u201d hard enough for the puck, that Nashville won too many physical battles for it and that it must improve, \u201cno doubt about it.\u201d\n\nRoy also had some criticism for the play of young Avs D-man Tyson Barrie:\n\n\u201cTonight, I was not 100 percent happy with Barrie. That\u2019s why I put Parenteau (at the point) sometimes there. Tyson needs to keep his game more simple. When he\u2019s losing the puck at the blue line or he\u2019s making a bad decision at the blue line, this is not what we\u2019re looking for. I think he could be a little bit better in that area.\u201d\n\nRight now, Andre Benoit is the quarterback of the power play on the first unit, and I like the fact that he puts a lot of pucks on net. His slap shot isn\u2019t overpowering, but it gets to the net and he gets rid of the puck quickly. Barrie has tended to hold on to the puck a little too long, but the kid will learn.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Avalanche,Patrick Roy,Tyson Barrie", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Roy also had some criticism for the play of young Avs D-man Tyson Barrie:", "title": "Avalanche coach Patrick Roy wants improvement from Tyson Barrie", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2013/10/05/avalanche-2-0-but-patrick-roy-not-happy-with-power-play-or-play-of-tyson-barrie/15025/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2013/10/Tyson-Barrie.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Roy also had some criticism for the play of young Avs D-man Tyson Barrie:", "title": "Avalanche 2-0, but Patrick Roy not happy with power play (or play of Tyson Barrie)", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2013/10/05/avalanche-2-0-but-patrick-roy-not-happy-with-power-play-or-play-of-tyson-barrie/15025/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2013/10/Tyson-Barrie.jpg", "creator": "@adater", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Roy also had some criticism for the play of young Avs D-man Tyson Barrie:"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14bf\"", "article_summary": "The only thing coach Patrick Roy said was a negative in Friday\u2019s 3-1 win over Nashville was his team\u2019s power play.\nBarrie has tended to hold on to the puck a little too long, but the kid will learn.\nWhen he\u2019s losing the puck at the blue line or he\u2019s making a bad decision at the blue line, this is not what we\u2019re looking for.\nHis slap shot isn\u2019t overpowering, but it gets to the net and he gets rid of the puck quickly.\nTyson needs to keep his game more simple."}
