HONOLULU â€” A man who worked as an Uber driver is charged in the sexual assault of a 16-year-old passenger in Hawaii.

Uber deactivated the driver, who was charged with two counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of attempted sex assault.

The 24-year-old man is being held on $150,000 bond.

Police say the man dropped the girl's friends off on April 16 and then took her elsewhere, where she says he sexually assaulted her.

KHON-TV reported that the man is scheduled to appear in court Thursday.

It's unclear whether he has an attorney.

Hawaii News Now reported that minors are prohibited from using the ride-hailing service and drivers must pass background checks.

Uber spokeswoman Taylor Patterson said in a statement that the company is investigating what happened.
