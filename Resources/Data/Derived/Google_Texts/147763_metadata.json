But the lighter women, who fight to maintain essential speed to clear big jumps, are especially at risk on courses with only one take-off jump. Those single lips are big, designed mostly to hurl speedy men into the sky so they can spin as many as four times while flipping two or three times.\n\nCopper Mountain\u2019s slopestyle course offered both large and smaller take-offs, unlike Breckenridge\u2019s Dew Tour slopestyle course or the X Games slopestyle course at Aspen\u2019s Buttermilk ski area.\n\nAnd on Saturday\u2019s snowy contest at Copper Mountain\u2019s Grand Prix, the skiing men struggled to make the transition of the final hit on the last jump of the course, while the women easily cleared the knuckle from the smaller take-off.\n\n\u201cEvery course should have a big and a little side for anytime weather like this happens. We should always have the option for hitting a jump you can actually clear,\u201d said slopestyle veteran Grete Eliassen, who took third in the women\u2019s slopestyle course behind Canadian winner Dara Howell and fellow U.S. Freeskiing teammate Darian Stevens.\n\nA separate slopestyle course for women is a hot topic. Many female skiers and snowboarders feel a small course reduces their legitimacy. The topic broils every season, especially after contests riddled with injured female athletes. But many agree that separate take-offs \u2013 closer to the landing \u2013 are a happy medium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the jump, it\u2019s how it\u2019s built. Guys are doing doubles and triples but we don\u2019t need that much pop, we need to go farther versus higher. So if you want to build a different course, build a different lip. We don\u2019t need that much air,\u201d said Ashley Battersby last month as she trained for her comeback from a knee injury she sustained during slopestyle competition at the Aspen X Games in January.\n\nThe Sochi Olympic slopestyle course features both big and smaller take-off lips, which are good for both men and women when fresh snow slows skis and snowboards or low visibility hinders airtime or high winds alter trajectories.\n\n\u201cYou saw the boys today, they were struggling off the big jumps and us girls said let\u2019s just hit the right side and we could hit all the tricks we wanted to,\u201d said Eliassen. \u201cIt\u2019s just safe. No girls got hurt today because we had that option.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Olympics,Slopestyle", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Copper Grand Prix slopestyle skiing women celebrated the course's smaller jumps, which enabled women to throw big tricks in bad weather without injury.", "title": "Slopestyle women happy with course design with separate take-off jumps", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/12/22/slopestyle-women-celebrate-smaller-jumps-at-copper-mountain-grand-prix/26045/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/12/458768021-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Copper Grand Prix slopestyle skiing women celebrated the course's smaller jumps, which enabled women to throw big tricks in bad weather without injury.", "title": "Slopestyle women celebrate smaller jumps at Copper Mountain Grand Prix", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/12/22/slopestyle-women-celebrate-smaller-jumps-at-copper-mountain-grand-prix/26045/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/12/458768021-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Copper Grand Prix slopestyle skiing women celebrated the course's smaller jumps, which enabled women to throw big tricks in bad weather without injury."}, "article_summary": "Copper Mountain\u2019s slopestyle course offered both large and smaller take-offs, unlike Breckenridge\u2019s Dew Tour slopestyle course or the X Games slopestyle course at Aspen\u2019s Buttermilk ski area.\nA separate slopestyle course for women is a hot topic.\nBad weather is dangerous for men and women slopestyle skiers and snowboarders.\nBut the lighter women, who fight to maintain essential speed to clear big jumps, are especially at risk on courses with only one take-off jump.\nThe Sochi Olympic slopestyle course features both big and smaller take-off lips, which are good for both men and women when fresh snow slows skis and snowboards or low visibility hinders airtime or high winds alter trajectories."}
