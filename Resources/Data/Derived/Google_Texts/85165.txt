As expected, Gov. Pat McCrory today announced that he will appoint sitting Supreme Court Justice Mark Martin to serve as Chief Justice effective September 1, 2014, replacing the retiring chief, Sarah Parker.

Martin is the court’s Senior Associate Justice, elected to a seat there in 1998 at the age of 35. He previously served on the Court of Appeals and the Superior Court.

Although he will begin service in September, Martin must still run for that slot in November, facing off against Brunswick County Superior Court Judge Ola Lewis.

Here is an excerpt from the governor’s press release:

Justice Martin has served as the Senior Associate Justice since 2006, and our Court is better for it. The humility and integrity of his character has benefited our state, and his knowledge and depth of experience is inimitable. I look forward to his work as Chief Justice as he draws upon his more than 20 years of judicial experience.
