None.\n\nAs mentioned in the video, Gloria Allred is not focused on filing any lawsuits or taking any cases to court. Allred simply wants to make sure that justice is served by making the necessary changes within the NFL to ensure that this type of injustice does not continue.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on the process and we want the process to be fair. We want the investigation that is conducted in the future, investigations, of NFL players to afford due process to victims as well as NFL players. The present process is obviously not fair.\u201d\n\nMany people believe that Gloria Allred may have a point with her argument, especially since the initial punishment given to Ray Rice earlier this year (a two-game suspension) was very similar to the one-game suspension given to Brandon Marshall after the allegations against him went public in 2008.\n\n#GloriaAllred: \u201cGoogle me\u201d citing past case work while challenging #NFL player\u2019s union.

She looks out for women. \u2014 Leslie Gornstein (@famefatalesays) September 17, 2014\n\nOn the other hand, there are quite a few others that feel that Gloria Allred is way out of line and really does not have any solid ground to stand on with her statements against the NFL and Commissioner Goodell.\n\nAre you serious #GloriaAllred 5yr + removed from what happened and you get mad now. #pathetic so I guess 5yrs of change, and community 1/2 \u2014 John Rozier (@rozierprime) September 18, 2014\n\n2/2 mean nothing\u2026 #GloriaAllred if you\u2019re so smart do you know the quote to error is human to forgive is Devine.

He admitted this a long time ago and has sought help since then. That\u2019s what these guys need to do. \u2014 Juan Two Three (@juan23kcco) September 17, 2014\n\nRasheedah Watley, the woman who was allegedly beaten by Brandon Marshall throughout the course of their relationship, was not present during the news conference. However, Rasheedah\u2019s father sat next to Gloria Allred throughout the duration of the news conference and even got the opportunity to speak up for himself to those in attendance about his own feelings on the issue.\n\nWhat do you think? Does Gloria Allred have a point or is she just searching for another opportunity to get her name in the spotlight?\n\n[Image Credit: The Daily Beast and The Sports Post]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gloria Allred wants Roger Goodell to resign as the NFL Commissioner due to the recent criticism circulating on how domestic violence cases are handled.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Gloria Allred wants Roger Goodell to resign as the NFL Commissioner due to the recent criticism circulating on how domestic violence cases are handled.", "title": "Gloria Allred on Roger Goodell: \u2018He Should Resign\u2019 Due To Domestic Violence Cases \u2013 Here\u2019s Why!", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1482305/gloria-allred-roger-goodell/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gloria-Allred-649x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-17T23:40:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T23:00:57+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gloria-Allred-649x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-09-17T23:40:09+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "gloria allred,gloria allred vs. roger goodell,gloria allred news conference,brandon marshall,ray rice,nfl domestic violence,gloria allred roger goodell resignation,domestic violence,gloria allred nfl,gloria allred nfl news conference,nfl domestic violence cases,roger goodell,sports", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gloria-Allred-649x409.jpg", "width": 649, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Gloria Allred wants Roger Goodell to resign as the NFL Commissioner due to the recent criticism circulating on how domestic violence cases are handled."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08db\"", "article_summary": "Gloria Allred, high-profile discrimination attorney, wants NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to resign from his position.\nDue to the mishandling of these domestic violence cases, Gloria Allred has come forward to shine light on this issue \u2013 strongly suggesting that major changes are made within the NFL immediately.\nDoes Gloria Allred have a point or is she just searching for another opportunity to get her name in the spotlight?\nAs mentioned in the video, Gloria Allred is not focused on filing any lawsuits or taking any cases to court.\nThe request was made during a news conference held on Wednesday in Atlanta in reference to the way that the NFL has handled recent domestic violence cases involving its players."}
