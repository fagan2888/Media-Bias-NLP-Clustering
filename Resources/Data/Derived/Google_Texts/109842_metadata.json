Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tapped Strodel to take over the nonpartisan, non-legislative office that supports members, staff and employees \u2014 a workforce of nearly 10,000 people \u2014 managing everything from furniture installation in congressional offices to payroll and parking issues.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner commended Strodel on a long and distinguished career Monday afternoon, as well for his \u201coutstanding leadership during an especially challenging period for the CAO organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dedication and innovation of the CAO and his team have helped Members of Congress and their staffs do more with less in recent years while weathering a series of significant cuts to House budgets,\u201d the Ohio Republican said in a statement. \u201cDan\u2019s retirement will be a real loss for the House, but we are grateful for his many contributions to the institution and wish him all the best in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nStrodel saw the chamber through the sequester and implemented staff reductions to stay within budget constraints. In 2011, he was forced to collapse some functions of the agency and lay off 30 employees, or 5 percent of the support agency\u2019s staff. In March, he announced a round of buyouts.\n\nMore recently, Strodel has been spearheading efforts to help House employees navigate changes to their health care benefits under the Affordable Care Act. His position often requires close coordination with House Administration Chairwoman Candice S. Miller, R-Mich., sometimes called the mayor of Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI want to express my sincere gratitude to Dan for his outstanding work on behalf of this institution and its nearly ten thousand employees,\u201d Miller said in a statement. \u201cTapped by both Democratic and Republican Leaders, since 2010, Dan has successfully managed the support services of the House by implementing critical IT modernization projects, improving House operational transparency and restoring the House\u2019s good financial standing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a former staffer of mine on the Committee on House Administration, Dan Strodel has my appreciation and gratitude for his thirty years of service,\u201d said Rep. Robert A. Brady, D-Pa., currently the ranking member on the committee. \u201cHe felt the call to public service from a young age. He came to the House as an intern and rose through the ranks to become one of its Officers. I wish him the best in all of his future endeavors and thank him for his dedication.\u201d\n\nBrady said both sides of the aisle will miss Strodel\u2019s \u201ceffectiveness, expertise and leadership.\u201d\n\nBefore the House Administration Committee, Strodel worked for the House clerk, both chambers\u2019 sergeants-at-arms and the Capitol Police. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree from Hobart College, and a law degree from the Catholic University of America. His retirement takes effect later this year, at the conclusion of the first session of the 113th Congress.\n\nBoehner will soon announce a successor, and a House vote to elect his nominee should take place when the second session opens, in early January 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Strodel, who has served in his post since July 2010 and guided the chamber through internal financial challenges, is retiring from federal service after 28 years on Capitol Hill.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Strodel, who has served in his post since July 2010 and guided the chamber through internal financial challenges, is retiring from federal service after 28 years on Capitol Hill.", "title": "House CAO Dan Strodel to Retire", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/house_cao_dan_strodel_to_retire-229315-1.html", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2013-11-25T16:02:02Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Strodel, who has served in his post since July 2010 and guided the chamber through internal financial challenges, is retiring from federal service after 28 years on Capitol Hill.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "iProCategory,iProStoryType,iProProductCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSDMID", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-25T16:02:02Z", "modified_time": "2013-11-25T16:02:02Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/house_cao_dan_strodel_to_retire-229315-1.html", "site": "@rollcall", "description": "House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Strodel, who has served in his post since July 2010 and guided the chamber through internal financial challenges, is retiring from federal service after 28 year", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "House CAO Dan Strodel to Retire"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2809\"", "article_summary": "Strodel was working as a senior adviser to the House Administration Committee when CAO David Beard resigned, amid accusations of financial mismanagement.\nHis position often requires close coordination with House Administration Chairwoman Candice S.
