NOW, CONVERSATION WITH THE CANDIDATE CONTINUES. OUR GUEST THIS EVENING'S REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP. THE NEXT 30 MINUTES IS COMMERCIAL FREE. WE WILL GET TO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND STOP WASTING TIME AND GET STARTED. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR COMING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. IMA CONSTITUTIONALIST. MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD BE, WOULD YOU USE EXECUTIVE POWER WHEN YOU CANNOT WORK WITH CONGRESS, EVEN THOUGH IT GETS BORDERLINE ILLEGAL SOMETIMES? DONALD TRUMP: YOU HAVE GOT TO GET ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE. THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. THE ONE THING ABOUT EXECUTIVE POWER OBAMA SIGNED, IF THE REPUBLICAN GETS IN, YOU CAN SIGN THAT OUT WITH EXECUTIVE POWER. THAT IS THE ONE GOOD THING. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF VOTES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU CAN WIPE OUT HIS EXECUTIVE POWER. THE SECOND THING I WOULD DO IS REPAIR OBAMACARE AND STRENGTHEN MILITARY AND HELP THE VETERANS BEYOND BELIEF. YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR OWN CENTER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I GUARANTEE YOU THAT WEIRD BECAUSE THEY SHOULD HAVE IT. THIS IS A BIG VETERAN AREA. ABSOLUTELY, THE FIRST THING, I WOULD SIGN OUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND ALL THEY NEED IS MY SIGNATURE. I THINK THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE THAT FOLLOWS UP ON THE QUESTION ABOUT EXECUTIVE POWERS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, CHARLES. MR. TRUMP, I AGREE WITH YOUR POLICIES ON MESKO IN CHINA AND FOREIGN TRADE IN GENERAL. I WONDER HOW YOU WILL GET CHINA TO AGREE WITH YOUR POLICIES? DONALD TRUMP: THE APPRENTICE IS A TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL SHOW THAT PAYS ME A LOT OF MONEY. REGARDLESS OF HOW RICH YOU ARE, IT IS A LOT. MORBIDLY, I GIVE UP PROJECTS ALL OVER THE WORLD OWED BY DOING. WHEN YOU ARE A POLITICIAN AND YOU RUN FOR OFFICE, THAT IS ALL YOU DO YOU RUN AN DEBATE AND RUN AN DEBATE. WHEN SOME IN THE WIN SOME AND LOSE SOMETHING YOU HAVE GUYS THEY LOSE, A FEW CANDIDATES RUNNING WHO LOST ELECTIONS, AND PEOPLE SAY COME ONTO A WONDERFUL? HOW DO YOU RUN FOR OFFICE WHEN YOU LOSE AN ELECTION AT A SMALLER LEVEL? WITH ME, I GIVE UP A LOT. FORGET THE MONEY. I GIVE UP TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY BUT I LOVE WHAT I DO ALSO. IF I RUN, AND OBVIOUSLY, JUST FORMED AN EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE. I HAVE A GREAT GROUP UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU KNOW SO MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED. IF I RUN, AND IF I WIN, THIS COUNTRY WILL BE GREAT AGAIN. THAT, I CAN TELL YOU. YOU SAY THE THINGS HE WOULD GIVE UP AND YOU WOULD BE UNDER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PERSONAL SCRUTINY. YOU HAVE BEEN IN A BUSINESS, CASINO GAMBLING, ROUGH AND TUMBLE. EVERYBODY KIND OF HAS SOMETHING EXAMINED AND BROUGHT UP. ARE YOU SQUEAKY CLEAN? DONALD TRUMP: WHEN YOU ARE REALLY SUCCESSFUL, AND I AM REALLY SUCCESSFUL, IF YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WAS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING, BEFORE I HOPED MITT WOULD DO A BETTER JOB, TO BE HONEST, I ACTUALLY SAID, I DID -- I DO NOT KNOW OF IS THAT RICH -- BECAUSE I'M A PRIVATE PERSON. YOU REMEMBER I FILED FINANCIAL SPIRIT I'M REALLY PRISON IN THE HISTORY OF GOVERNMENT, I THINK, RUNNING FOR OFFICE, TO FILE FINANCIALS. IT SHOWED A TREMENDOUS NET WORTH, TREMENDOUS ASSETS. I DOES A GREAT COMPANY. THAT IS WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS. IT NEED THAT KIND OF MENTALITY. THAT BEING SAID, AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID IT AND IT HAS BEEN SAID, IT IS VERY HARD FOR A PERSON OF GREAT SUCCESS. I DO IMMEDIATELY WEEK. I CRUSHED PEOPLE AND I BEAT PEOPLE. IT IS MY BUSINESS AND I HAVE TO. YOU DO NOT WANT SOMEBODY WHO LOST A LOT OF MONEY? SHE GOT THROWN OUT OF YOUR PACKET AND THAT IS OK TO KNOW SHE IS RIGHT FOR PRESIDENT. SHE GOT THROWN OUT REALLY ROUGH OUT OF HEWLETT-PACKARD. THROWN OUT. NOW SHE IS RUNNING FOR OFFICE. I THINK THAT IS FINE PRINT EVERYBODY HAS GOT THE RIGHT TO RUN P OR I'VE HAD TREMENDOUS VICTORS AND I HAVE MADE A FORTUNE. I HAVE MADE A FORTUNE OFF THE CHINESE. THE BIGGEST DEVELOPERS IN CHINA. A MADE A FORTUNE OFF OF THEM. I BEAT THEM SO BADLY. I WAS VERY PROUD OF IT. ASSUMING I FILE MY STATEMENTS, YOU WILL SEE UNBELIEVABLE NUMBERS. A LOT OF IT WAS MADE AGAINST CHINA, WHICH I LIKE. THAT IS THE KIND OF CHALLENGE YOU NEED TO BE PRESIDENT. OTHERWISE, THIS COUNTRY IS GOING DOWN. THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL BEAT DETROIT. THAT IS A NASTY THING TO SAY AND IT IS TRUE. OUR COUNTRY WILL BE DETROIT IF YOU DO NOT GET THOUGH RIGHT PRESIDENT. AND IF YOU GET ONE OF THESE POLITICIANS, YOU GET A JEB BUSH BACK, AND YOU PUT SOMEBODY ELSE -- I WILL NOT GOING TO NAMES, BUT VIRTUALLY ANYBODY, THIS COUNTRY IS GOING THE WAY OF DETROIT. JUST REMEMBER IT WITH THAT BEING SAID, JUST TO FINISH, IT IS VERY HARD FOR A PERSON OF GREAT SUCCESS WHO HAS DONE IT MEANT -- MANY DEALS, I HAVE A LOT OF ENEMIES BECAUSE I WON ALMOST ALL THE TIME, IF I DID NOT WIN, I ULTIMATELY ONE. IN OTHER WORDS, I TAKE SOMETHING WHERE THE MARKET CRASHED, AND I STILL MAKE IT A GOOD DEAL. IT IS WHAT I DO. THIS COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL. IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT LEADER, THIS COUNTRY WILL GO TO NEW HEIGHTS LIKE IT HAS NEVER RISEN BEFORE, HIGHER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT IF YOU GO INTO THE POLITICIAN STUFF, THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT HAVE A CHANCE. THANK YOU, SIR. MOVING RIGHT ALONG NOW, A QUESTION FROM OUR AUDIENCE. WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, MR. TRUMP. A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I MOVED TO FULL-DAY KINDERGARTEN . NOW, WE HAVE MONITORED THOSE STUDENTS AND THEIR GOOD CLOCK JUST GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. TO ME, IT WAS A NO-BRAINER. HOW WILL U.S. PRESIDENT MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAN OFFER FULL-DAY KINDERGARTEN AND GOOD PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS? SCHOOLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. ALL SCHOOLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF IT HAS TO START WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO SPEND THE MONEY BEING WASTED ON BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGTON AND BRING IT DOWN TO A LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND OTHER PLACES TO TAKE CARE OF KIDS, WHETHER PRESCHOOL OR KINDERGARTEN OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU WANT TO DO THAT ON A LOCAL BASIS. YOU ARE MUCH BETTER THAN SOME PERSON SITTING IN WASHINGTON TELLING YOU WHAT THEY WANT TO LEARN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. MANY CASES, THEY ARE NOT EVEN SMART PEOPLE. THEY ARE JUST THERE TO COLLECT A PAYCHECK. I WOULD TAKE THE MONEY BEING WASTED IN WASHINGTON, WHICH IS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND I WOULD PUT IT TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS. AND YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY FOR WHAT YOU'RE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND THERE WILL BE MONEY LEFT OVER. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, SIR. THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION. A LOT OF SENATE BUILDING TOWARD CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM AND RETURN LIMITATIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR POSITION WITH REGARD TO THOSE SUBJECTS AND HOW WOULD AFFECT POLITICS. YOU HAVE TOUCHED ON IT A COUPLE OF TIMES WHERE MONEY MIGHT AFFECT JUDGMENT. CLASSES VERY INTERESTING AND VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION FOR YOU CAN SAY TERM LIMITS WOULD BE, YOU DO A BAD JOB AND YOU GET VOTED OUT OF OFFICE. OVER THE YEARS, I SEE TERM LIMITS AND THEY DO THEM AND IN SOME CASES, THEY WERE BAD AND IN SOME CASES, YOU GOT RID OF VERY BAD PEOPLE. I HAVE ALSO SEEN UNBELIEVABLY TALENTED PEOPLE GET TERM LIMITED WHERE THEY COULD NOT RUN ANYMORE AND GET REPLACED WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS A BASIC NOVICE. I AM FINE WITH TERM LIMITS. I THINK THEY HAVE A LOT OF VALUE, FRANKLY, BUT I HAVE ALSO SEEN VERY GOOD PEOPLE GET TERM LIMITED OUT OF OFFICE. AS FAR AS CAMPAIGN FINANCING, THE PRIMARY THING IS PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW WHO IS CONTRIBUTING TO IT SHOULD BE AN OPEN BOOK. IF I WANT TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO PEOPLE, I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW THAT TRUMP IS GIVING TO THAT PERSON. I THINK THE LIMITS MAY BE SHOULD BE TAKEN UP, OR CERTAINLY, THEY SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO ON A FEDERAL BASIS, THEY ARE VERY LOW P OR OFTENTIMES, JOSH, I WILL HAVE A UNITED STATES SENATOR COME TO MY OFFICE FROM WASHINGTON, SIT DOWN IN MY OFFICE, IN ORDER TO GET A $2000 MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION. THAT IS A LOT OF WORK. THE LIMIT WAS SET MANY YEARS AGO, BUT THEY COME AND IN ONE WAY, I LOVE IT BECAUSE I GIVE $2000, I HAVE GIVEN THE MAX. 200,000, SHE APPRECIATES IT JUST AS MUCH. SO I LIKE IT, BUT I WILL SAY THIS. OUR POLITICIANS SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME RAISING MONEY, AND I SEE THEM CONSTANTLY CALLING P OR I JUST SAY, LEAVE ME ALONE AND I WILL SEND YOU THE MONEY. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME RAISING MONEY. THE GUYS WHO RUN FOR CONGRESS, THEY RUN AND THE DAY AFTER THEY GET ELECTED, THEY START RUNNING AGAIN AND THEIR FORM OF RUNNING IS JUST TO RAISE MONEY. THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY TIME TO JUST RAISE THE COUNTRY. I THINK SOMETHING COULD BE DONE, ABSOLUTELY. CLASSES FAIR TO ASK YOU, SIR, IF YOU DECIDE TO RUN AND YOU WIN, TERM LIMITED TO TWO OR EIGHT YEARS, HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU TO TURN AROUND AND ACHIEVE THE GOALS YOU SAID YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE. DONALD TRUMP: I THINK I COULD DO IT IN TWO EARS. YOU WILL NOT LOWER YOUR CURRENCY OR MANIPULATE THE CURRENCY. THEY ARE DOING A BIG AND MANIPULATION RIGHT NOW. ALL THE COUNTRIES WE HAVE WITH ISIS, WHAT IS CHINA DOING? THEY DO NOTHING. AFGHANISTAN HAS TREMENDOUS MINERAL WEALTH. EVERYONE THOUGHT, AFGHANISTAN DOES HAVE OIL. THEY DO NOT DO THEY HAVE MINERALS SPIRIT WE FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, MASSIVE ESCALATORS CHINA IS ONLY HERE AND THEY DO NOT SPEND $.10 ON FIGHTING. I HAVE MANY FANS IN CHINA. I DO BUSINESS WITH CHINA. I MAKE A LOT OF MONEY WITH CHINA THEY CANNOT BELIEVE -- THEY ARE LOWERING THEIR CURRENCY NOW. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS ALL THE JOBS THEY DO NOT HAVE, WHEN MY FRIEND WHO IS A BIG CATERPILLARS FAN AND A BUY FROM JAPAN BECAUSE THEIR CURRENCY IS SO LOW AND THEY HAVE CUT IT SO LOW THAT THEY CANNOT BUY IT, YOU WILL SEE REAL TURMOIL IN THE COUNTRY AND IT WILL AFFECT NEW HAMPSHIRE BADLY. THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS WE HAVE POLITICIANS THAT ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. OR THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY OF BUSINESS INSTINCT OR SOMETHING. THE LOBBYISTS TELL THEM, BE QUIET, THIS COUNTRY WOULD GET AWAY WITH MURDER. WE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE. CHINA IS DOING A MANIPULATION I NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE THE GUSTS TO DO IT. THEY ARE NOW DOING THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LEAST OF OUR PROBLEMS. BUT IT WILL BE ONE OF OUR BIG PROBLEMS. LET'S KEEP GOING. ANOTHER QUESTION FROM OUR AUDIENCE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT PRESCHOOL AND OR ONE OF OUR BELOVED SENATORS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS KNOWN FOR CHAMPIONING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORKING EFFECTIVELY IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. IN AN EARLY CHILDHOOD CONFERENCE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE SAID, INVESTING IN OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN IS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU, IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, WOULD REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND CHAMPION THIS IMPORTANT WORK? DONALD TRUMP: I AGREE WITH THAT. GETTING THAT EDUCATION, THE YOUNG UPBRINGING IS SO IMPORTANT. I WOULD AGREE. AGAIN, IT ALSO GETS BACK TO THE EDUCATION. I WOULD FUNNEL THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING WASTED. YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER. MONEY THAT IS BEING WASTED IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF EDUCATION, BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE P OR WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR YOUNG. I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT 100%. I VERY WELL DELIVERED QUESTION TOO. VERY IMPRESSIVE. ONE OF THE DEBATES IN THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON IS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. THE THINK IT SHOULD BE A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE RACE, AND DO YOU THINK THAT MAN HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND SHOULD DEAL WITH IT? DONALD TRUMP: THIS SHOULD BE A BIG THING OF MINE AND I HAVE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND IT IS AMAZING TO ME HERE YOU TELL THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON AND NEW HAMPSHIRE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. THE WORD CLIMATE CHANGE USED TO BE, AS YOU KNOW, GLOBAL WARMING. THAT WAS NOT WORKING SO WELL. WHEN THE SHIP WENT OVER TO STUDY WHY ALL OF THE ICE WAS MELTING AND MELTING AND ALL THE SUDDEN, THE SHIP ENDS UP GETTING ENCAPSULATED, THESE ARE SCIENTISTS AND IT IS AN AMAZING THING AND THEN THEY SAID THEY WERE TOURISTS AND I DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF SCIENTISTS. I THINK THERE IS CLIMATE CHANGE. I THINK IT GOES FOR MANY MILLIONS OF YEARS. IN THE 1920'S, THEY USED TO TALK ABOUT A THING CALLED GLOBAL COOLING. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS COOLING OR NOW THEY THINK IT IS WARMING. NOW THEY ARE SAYING, MAYBE IT IS NOT WARMING BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A DISASTER. IT IS NOT JUST IN A SMALL AREA. THEY CALL IT CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT IS NOT WORKING THAT WELL EITHER BECAUSE PEOPLE GOT WISE TO IT, SO NOW THEY CALL IT "EXTREME WEATHER." IT IS CALLED WEATHER. AS BIG AS YOUR SNOWSTORM WAS UP IN BOSTON WHERE THEY HAVE THE RECORDS AND THEY KEEP THE RECORDS VERY ACCURATELY AND YOUR RECORDS ARE KEPT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE VERY ACCURATELY, THE BIGGEST SNOWSTORM WAS IN 1890'S. THAT STILL HAS THE RECORD. I JUST THINK WE HAVE MUCH BIGGER PROBLEMS. YOU ARE NOT BUYING THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT. DONALD TRUMP: MY UNCLE IS A PROFESSOR AT M.I.T.. A VERY SMART GUY. I HAVE AN ABILITY FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF, IF YOU BELIEVE IN THAT KIND OF THING. I THINK WE HAVE FAR BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN CLIMATE CHANGE. I AM NOT A BIG BELIEVER IN MAN-MADE OR I DO BELIEVE IN CLEAN AIR AND I DO BELIEVE IN COUNTRIES -- YOU GO TO CHINA, AND IT IS VERY DIRTY. I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN CLEAN AIR IN THINGS LIKE THAT, WE ARE SPENDING ALL OF THIS MONEY, WE ARE BECOMING NONCOMPETITIVE IN OUR FACTORIES BECAUSE WE ARE FOCUSING ON CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOT, AND IT IS MAKING OUR PRODUCT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND IS REALLY HURTING US VERY BADLY. I THINK THE BIGGEST CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE BIGGEST THING, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, THAT WE HAVE TO BE CARRIED -- TO TAKE CARE OF, IS NUCLEAR GLOWER -- GLOBAL WARMING. IT IS NOT ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING. IT IS ABOUT NUCLEAR. IF WE ARE NOT SMART AND NOT TOUGH, YOU WILL HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. ONCE YOU HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE WRONG HANDS, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME, FOLKS. I SAW THE OTHER DAY WHERE OBAMA SAID THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THIS COUNTRY HAS IS CLIMATE CHANGE. SAID, DID HE REALLY SAY THAT? WAS HE SAYING THAT AS A JOKE, OR IS HE SERIOUS WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW? THE BIG PROBLEM WE HAVE, ONE OF THE MANY BIG PROBLEMS, BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THE WRONG PEOPLE. THAT IS GOING TO BE CALLED GLOBAL WARMING AND WE BETTER BE CAREFUL, VERY CAREFUL. ALL RIGHT, SIR. LET'S GO BACK TO OUR AUDIENCE NOW COMING FROM BOB. WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION? MY QUESTION IS ABOUT FEDERAL RESERVE. WHAT IF ANY CHANGES WOULD YOU MAKE TO FEDERAL RESERVE AND DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE AUDITED ON A REGULAR BASIS? DONALD TRUMP: AUDITED, ABSOLUTELY. I REALLY THINK YOU CAN HAVE IT OR NOT HAVE IT. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT AND A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE LIKE IT. THEY THINK THERE IS AN ADJUSTMENT WITH INTEREST RATES AND OTHER THINGS. I'M NOT A FAN. I'M NOT A BIG FAN. AUDIT, 100%. BUT I LIKE FREE ECONOMY P OR I LIKE HAVING A GREAT AND FREE ECONOMY. THEY DO A LOT OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ECONOMY. IN SOME CASES, PERHAPS IT IS GOOD. THE TRUTH IS, NOBODY REALLY KNOWS AND NOBODY REALLY HAS AN IDEA APPEARED WE HAVE VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS WHO LIKE THE FEDERAL RESERVE THERE WE HAVE SOME WHO THINK IT SHOULD TOTALLY BE DISBANDED. I HAVE NO OPINION YET. I'VE NOT REALLY FORMED AN OPINION. CAN YOU ENVISION A SCENARIO THAT THIS COUNTRY EVER GOES BACK TO A GOLD STANDARD? DONALD TRUMP: IN SOME WAYS, I LIKE THE GOLD STANDARD AND THERE ARE SOME THE VERY NICE ABOUT IT GET YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AT THE RIGHT TIME. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING VERY NICE ABOUT HAVING SOMETHING CELL. WE USED TO HAVE A VERY SOLID COUNTRY BECAUSE IT WAS BASED ON A GOLD STANDARD FOR IT WE DO NOT HAVE THAT ANYMORE. THERE IS SOMETHING VERY NICE ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF THAT. IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO DO AT THIS POINT AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS WE DO NOT HAVE THE GOLD. OTHER PLACES HAVE THE GOLD. OTHER PLACES HAVE OTHER THINGS. YOU KNOW, YOU GO TO SAUDI ARABIA AND SOME OF THESE PLACES, DUBAI, I WAS IN BY RECENTLY, THEY HAVE AIRPORTS THE LACE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN. IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN AIRPORTS, FLY INTO LAGUARDIA AND IT IS LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY TO LAX IN LOS ANGELES. THIS IS THIRD WORLD AIRPORTS. POTHOLES, THE RUNWAY, THEY FILL THEIR FLOORS, THEY ARE HOLES IN THEM. THEY USED TO FILL THEM WITH ASPHALT FROM OUTSIDE. THEY PUT BIG BLACK ASPHALT PATCHES ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU GO TO A PLACE LIKE TO BUY, YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT IS THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE THING. THEY DO IT WITH OUR MONEY. THEY DO IT WITH OUR MONEY. NOW, WE PROTECT SOME IN A COUNTRIES, WE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SAUDI ARABIA, IF WE PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA, IF WE ANNOUNCED WE WOULD NOT PROTECT THEM, THEY WOULD BE GONE BY THIS AFTERNOON. THE PEOPLE DO NOT FIGHT IT EVERY TIME THERE IS A FIGHT, THEY LEAVE. REMEMBER, THERE WAS A SKIRMISH, AND THEY HAD THE SAUDI SOLDIERS, AND THE SAUDI SOLDIERS RAN BACK. THEY RAN, DROP THEIR RIFLES IN THE BACK. A GREAT JOB. THEY MAKE $1 BILLION A DAY. SAUDI ARABIA. $1 BILLION A DAY. A LITTLE BIT LESS NOW BECAUSE OF OIL PRICES, BUT THEY MAKE $1 BILLION A DAY. THEY GIVE US NOTHING. THEY GIVE US NOTHING. THEY SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO US, FOLKS. BELIEVE ME. THEY SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO US. THEY WOULD NOT BE THERE FOR 24 HOURS IF WE DID NOT PROTECT THEM. AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE THAT. WE PROTECT SOUTH KOREA. I JUST ORDERED 5000 TELEVISION SETS. THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN BUY THEM IS FROM SOUTH KOREA. WHETHER IT IS SAMSUNG, ALL OF THEM. I WOULD LOVE TO BUY THEM IF THEY WERE MADE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU DO NOT HAVE A PLANT. WE PROTECT THEM, AND THEY KILL US ECONOMICALLY. WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS SITTING BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA AND WE GET NOTHING. NOTHING. WHY AREN'T WE GETTING SOMETHING? SOME PEOPLE SAY, THAT IS VERY NASTY P OR ACTUALLY HAD A PERSON SAY, THAT IS VERY RUDE. YOU'RE ASKING A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY. WELL HEY, WHAT ARE WE DOING IT FOR? WE ARE PROTECTING THEM AND WE GET NOTHING. IF SOMEBODY WITH THE RIGHT MIND, AND NONE OF YOU POLITICIANS WILL THINK THIS WAY, BELIEVE ME. THEY DO NOT HAVE IT. AND I TELL YOU, ALL MY LIFE, I'VE DEALT WITH THEM. THEY DO NOT HAVE IT. WE COULD MAKE THIS COUNTRY SO POWERFUL AND SO RICH AGAIN. THE WORD RICH SOUNDS TERRIBLE. BUT RICH WILL SOLVE SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID, HEALTH CARE, ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH RICH BE IT WE WILL MAKE IT RICH AGAIN. WE ARE NOW $18 TRILLION GOING UP RAPIDLY. IT WILL SOON BE 21 TROY DOLLARS. AN IMPORTANT NUMBER. TOY FOR IS A KILLER. WE WILL BE UP TO 24 TRILLION AND WHEN WE GET TO 24 TROY AND, IT IS ALMOST LIKE THERE IS NO RETURN. BUT WE ARE GOING THERE VERY RAPIDLY. THIS COUNTRY CAN BE SO GREAT, BUT YOU NEED THE RIGHT LEADER. ALL RIGHT, SIR. LET'S GO BACK TO OUR AUDIENCE CARE LESS THAN 10 MINUTES TO GO. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE DISEASE PROCESS IN THIS COUNTRY, WITH COSTS THAT WILL SKYROCKET VERY SOON. IF ELECTED, WHERE DO STAND ON INCREASING RESEARCH MONEY AND FUNDING TO FIND A CURE? DONALD TRUMP: 100%. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT AND OTHERS. BUT IT IS AN UNBELIEVABLY HARSH DISEASE FOR FAMILIES. THE PERSON WITH THE ALZHEIMER'S, I KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD IT IN THE FAMILY, AND I'VE HAD SOMEBODY FRIENDS AND I HAVE SEEN IT RECENTLY. A FRIEND OF MINE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S. IT IS A HORRIBLE THING AND I AM ALL FOR IT. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO TAKE THE MONEY AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO DO NOT DESERVE IT AND BRING IT INTO PLACES LIKE THAT. LOOK AT THE CHILDREN, WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH CHILDREN SO MANY DIFFERENT PROMS WITH CHILDREN THAT COULD BE SOLVED, BUT THIS COUNTRY, WE KEEP CUTTING BACK ON THESE THINGS. ALZHEIMER'S IS SOMETHING CLOSE TO MY HEART AND I WOULD BE 100%. THANK YOU. QUITE FLIP GO TO SOCIAL MEDIA NOW. THIS ONE COMES FROM FACEBOOK TO HER JENNIFER WRITES, WHAT IS YOUR STANCE ON RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 PER HOUR? DONALD TRUMP: I WOULD DO SOMETHING ELSE SPEAR AND I WOULD MAKE THE COUNTRY SO GREAT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE GETTING MINIMUM WAGE. THEY WILL HAVE BETTER JOBS THAN THAT. I WANT TO KEEP US COMPETITIVE. I AM NOT LOOKING TO RAISE THINGS. I WANT TO KEEP COMPETITIVE. THE MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT GONE BY PEOPLE I THINK THIS COUNTRY WILL BE SO SUCCESSFUL, PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING THE MINIMUM WAGE ANYMORE. AT THE SAME TIME, I WANT TO KEEP THE COUNTRY COMPETITIVE P OR WE ARE NONCOMPETITIVE. ALL OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL NONSENSE. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I BUILD HOTELS. I JUST TOLD ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE WORLD. IT WAS A SICK PUPPY WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND NOW IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT PUPPIES OF THE WORLD, WHICH COULD HAPPEN WITH THE UNITED STATES. I THINK UNITED STATES COULD BE EASIER. WE BUY THE SINKS, AND THE SINKS THROW OUT VERY LITTLE WATER. SO PEOPLE AT THE SINK RUN TWICE AS LONG. SHOWERS. I REPLACED THE SHOWERHEADS BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS. TOILETS, YOU FLUSH THEM AND NO WATER COMES OUT. SO YOU FLUSH THEM AGAIN AND YOU FORCE THEM 10 TIMES. THESE ARE DISASTERS. IT IS REALLY TERRIBLE. SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. THESE ARE JUST THINGS. YOU END UP GOING TO A SHOWER IN A BRAND-NEW PLACE AND THERE IS NO WATER COMING OUT? THEY AND UP SAVING SO YOU STAND IN THE SHOWER FOUR TIMES LONGER. THESE ARE RESTRICTIONS I WOULD TAKE OFF ABSOLUTELY AND ABSOLUTELY GET RID OF. SO MANY RESTRICTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE HURTING BUSINESSES. I USE THOSE AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE I AM IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE IN MANY OTHER WAYS. TWICE WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL HIM? -- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL HIM? [LAUGHTER] A CHILD BORN ON YOUR INAUGURATION DAY WILL GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL PRESUMABLY IN 2035, WILL RETIRE FROM THE WORKFORCE PROBABLY IN THE 2080'S. I WONDER IF YOU COULD TELL US WHAT POLICIES OR PROGRAMS YOU WOULD PUT IN PLACE AS PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THAT THAT CHILD CAN COMPETE IN A REALLY COMPLEX AND GLOBAL MARKETPLACE? RIGHT NOW, WE CANNOT COMPETE WE DO NOT HAVE THE JOBS OR THE TECHNOLOGY ARE ALL THE TECHNOLOGICAL JOBS ARE IN ASIA. I WOULD VERY EARLY ON HAVE MEETINGS WITH COMPANIES LIKE APPLE AND GIVE THEM TREMENDOUS INCENTIVES TO BUILD PLANTS IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU COULD BUILD A PLANT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I GUARANTEE YOU COULD DO JUST AS GOOD. I ORDER FURNITURE FROM CHINA CAN I ORDER A LOT OF THINGS FROM CHINA. I'M A BUSINESS PERSON AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY. THE FURNITURE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY IS FAR BETTER, NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, AREAS IN THERE. IT IS MUCH BETTER. THE PROBLEM IS, IT IS SO NONCOMPETITIVE PRICEWISE, I ORDERED ANYWAY MANY CASES, BUT IT IS SO NONCOMPETITIVE, BUT IT IS A BETTER PRODUCT. WE TAKEN PLACE LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU CAN HAVE THOSE BIG FACTORIES THAT ARE IN CHINA. YOU HAVE THE POPULATION. YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO KNOCK THEM DEAD. YOU MAKE THOSE COMPUTERS AND IPHONES, YOU WOULD MAKE THEM BETTER THAN THEY MAKE THEM IN CHINA. APPLE WOULD REALLY BE AN AMERICAN COMPANY. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK JOBS. IF WE DO NOT BRING BACK SHOTS, WHAT IS THE FUTURE FOR THE KIDS? WHERE WILL THEY GO AND WHERE WILL THEY WORK? I WILL GO A STEP FURTHER. WHEN THEY GET TO HER TIME AND AGE, THEY WILL NOT HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY. THEY WILL NOT HAVE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID. THIS COUNTRY'S BUST. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT IS INCOMPETENT. A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING, AND THE COUNTRY IS TOTALLY BUST. WE MAKE ALL BAD DEALS. REMEMBER THIS. WE HAVE NOT MADE A GOOD DEAL IN MANY YEARS AND NOBODY IN THE AUDIENCE CAN SIT THERE AND SAY, WE DID GOOD HERE. BRAZIL KILLS US IN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. MEXICO, JAPAN, CHINA. AND WE HAVE ALL THE POWER. BECAUSE IF WE START PLAYING GAMES WITH THEIR PRODUCT, LIKE WE WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE TAX, FOLKS, THEY WILL BEHAVE VERY NICELY, BELIEVE ME. SOME BUT HE HAS TO SAY IT WHO KNOWS HOW TO SAY IT AND WHO KNOWS WHAT HE OR SHE IS DOING. IN THIS CASE, HE. [LAUGHTER] I THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION FOR WE ARE UNDER THREE MINUTES PER YOU HAVE RAILED ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ONE QUESTION A LOT OF DEMOCRATS AND VOTERS ARE ASKING, YOU GET RID OF IT, WHAT DO YOU REPLACE IT WITH? DONALD TRUMP: YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES. I AM OFF WORK GETTING COVERAGE FOR EVERYBODY. BUT IT WAS A PHONY PLAN BECAUSE IF YOU WERE IN NEW YORK, I CANNOT GO OUTSIDE THE BORDERS. I'VE BECOME 3,000 OF PEOPLE. I CANNOT GO TO NEW JERSEY, CALIFORNIA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, IF THERE WAS A GOOD COMPANY, TO GET MY HEALTH CARE TAKING CARE OF. I WAS CONFINED TO ESSENTIALLY ONE COMPANY TO THE REASON IS POLITICS. THE POLITICIANS GET A LOT OF MONEY FROM LOBBYISTS WHO REPRESENT THESE COMPANIES AND THEY DO NOT WANT COMPETITION. IF YOU JUST TOOK DOWN THE BORDER PROBLEM, YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPETITION. THE OWN THING I WOULD REGULATE IS EVERY COUNTRY THAT COMPETES HAS TO BE VERY STRONG FINANCIALLY. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY AND THEN WHEN YOU NEED IT, THEY ARE BUS. SOMETIMES, GOVERNMENT CAN BE A GOOD THING. THE ONE THING I DO BIG LEAGUE IS I MAKE SURE ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO COMPETE FOR YOUR INSURANCE HAS TO BE VERY STRONG FINANCIALLY, NOT THAT ALL THE SUDDEN, THEY HAVE A RUN AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. YOU WOULD HAVE GREAT COVERAGE AT FAR LESS MONEY THAN YOU USED TO PAY BEFORE OBAMACARE. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. THE DEDUCTIBLES IN OBAMACARE ARE SO HIGH THAT UNLESS YOU GET HIT WITH AN ARMY TANK, YOU WILL NOT BE USING IT. YOU HAVE NO INSURANCE. SO THE DEDUCTIBLES ARE A TOTAL CATASTROPHE FOR PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU GOT RID OF THOSE BORDERS AND YOU LET COMPANIES COMPETE, YOU WOULD BRING DOWN THE COST AND THEN WE WOULD FIND A WAY THROUGH THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE UNABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. BECAUSE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, WE HAVE TO DO THAT. JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME. WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD YOU ACTUALLY RUN FOR PRESIDENT? DONALD TRUMP: I THINK IT IS VERY GOOD. I WANT TO SEE THIS COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. THE COUNTRY IS IN BIG TROUBLE. WE COULD MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREATER THAN IT EVER WAS. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US HERE ON THE WEBSITE AND THE MOBILE APP [APPLAUSE] . OF COURSE, THANK YOU, VERY MUCH, DONALD TRUMP, FOR BEING HERE. THANK IT TO THE AUDIENCE FOR PARTICIPATING. EVERYONE, HAVE A GREAT NIGHT. ? [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG]
