Then he hardly mentioned global warming.\n\nBut despite these lousy beginnings, Obama\u2019s accumulating accomplishments on climate change might define his legacy.\n\nWednesday saw a major breakthrough. In Beijing, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a serious, medium-term, joint greenhouse emissions deal, a landmark agreement of the sort that critics argued would never happen. The pact does not merely commit the countries to trajectories they are already taking. It will require both nations to push harder toward cleaner energy.\n\nPresident Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping toast at a lunch banquet in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday.

It will always be tough to get many nations to move together, and keep moving together, in the same direction. But two dominant \u2014 and historically reluctant \u2014 players now are.\n\nObama could pull this off because of several things his administration has done since his initial failure on climate legislation. The decades-old Clean Air Act gives the executive branch various powers to restrict air pollution \u2014 including, the Supreme Court confirmed, carbon dioxide. Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency has used these powers. The EPA struck a bargain with automakers to drastically increase the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks sold in the United States. Then it set greenhouse emissions standards on new and significantly rebuilt power plants, and after that on existing power plants, the most significant anti-carbon measure in the country\u2019s history. Add in a variety of smaller initiatives that affect the country\u2019s carbon footprint, and the result is Obama\u2019s increasingly ambitious Climate Action Plan.\n\nMeanwhile, the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s other major policy accomplishment, is once again in serious legal peril. The Supreme Court last week announced it would hear a challenge to a crucial piece of the policy\u2019s design \u2014 the subsidies that enable low- and middle-income Americans to buy coverage. The argument against the law is shaky. But the justices might nevertheless unravel the policy, just as it was beginning to succeed.\n\nA future Republican president, of course, might also try to do the same with Obama\u2019s carbon dioxide initiatives, and courts will have to pass judgment on how the EPA implements its anti-carbon programs. Obama\u2019s legacy could end up being one of tragic policy frustration. But there\u2019s still a good chance he will be remembered best as the president who finally started the country down a responsible path on greenhouse emissions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Global warming might be the issue he's remembered for.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/strombergsteve", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Global warming might be the issue he's remembered for.", "title": "Barack Obama: The climate-change president?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/11/12/barack-obama-the-climate-change-president/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/11/12/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/APTOPIX_China_US_Obama-06c4d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@strombergsteve"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/11/12/barack-obama-the-climate-change-president/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama climate, china climate, china climate deal, china us climate deal, us climate, climate change, climate change policy, climate change deal, china global warming, obama global warming, obama global warming deal, us china global warming, us china global warming deal, global warming agreement, china global warming agreement, china climate change agreement, climate news, climate change news, xi jinping, global warming news, global warming agreement, climate change agreement, climate change negotiations, global warming negotiations", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/strombergsteve"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama climate, china climate, china climate deal, china us climate deal, us climate, climate change, climate change policy, climate change deal, china global warming, obama global warming, obama global warming deal, us china global warming, us china global warming deal, global warming agreement, china global warming agreement, china climate change agreement, climate news, climate change news, xi jinping, global warming news, global warming agreement, climate change agreement, climate change negotiations, global warming negotiations"}, "article_summary": "President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping toast at a lunch banquet in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday.\nIn Beijing, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a serious, medium-term, joint greenhouse emissions deal, a landmark agreement of the sort that critics argued would never happen.\nBut there\u2019s still a good chance he will be remembered best as the president who finally started the country down a responsible path on greenhouse emissions.\nMeanwhile, the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s other major policy accomplishment, is once again in serious legal peril.\nIn his first term, President Obama put his political muscle behind passing health-care reform and financial regulations instead of a global warming bill, missing the best opportunity ever to establish a comprehensive national climate program."}
