Georgia is 30th.\n\nThe state\u2019s lowest ranking, 46th, in terms of federal grants per person, is the money doled out for projects like highways, sewer projects, education and Medicaid.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal decided not to take advantage of bonus grants if the state expanded its Medicaid coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act, but that didn\u2019t take effect until after the period analyzed. However, that decision means Georgia most likely received less grant money per person than states that expanded their Medicaid health coverage for the poor.\n\nAlso in the category of grants is funding for transportation. The state has passed up offers of federal grants to build passenger-rail lines, but transportation leaders here complain that the state doesn\u2019t get its share of road funding.\n\nPHILOSOPHY AND FUNDING\n\nIn fiscal year 2013, Georgia received $1,163 per person in overall federal grants compared to the national average of $1,600.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, federal policy makers turn to intergovernmental grants to encourage state and local governments to adopt federal policy priorities,\u201d said the Congressional Budget Office in its report on \u201cGrants to State and Local Governments.\u201d\n\nThe rejection of that approach by Georgia policy makers may explain why the state ranks where it does. Besides the examples of Medicaid expansion and passenger rail, there are dozens of other cases where the state has brushed aside federal incentives.\n\nOne oft-repeated argument for this year\u2019s transportation-funding legislation in the General Assembly was to raise more funds within the state to gain independence from federal requirements and procedures.\n\n\u201cThrough the governor\u2019s leadership and the leadership of our House and Senate transportation committees, they worked very hard to come up with a solution that frees us a little bit from the federal handcuffs that we\u2019ve been given,\u201d said Georgia Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry.\n\nSimilarly, Deal\u2019s argument for rejecting Medicaid expansion was that the state would not have flexibility and that its own costs would rise.\n\nBeside, Georgia\u2019s leaders are fiscal conservatives.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in the thinking of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank well respected among the Republican leaders in state government.\n\n\u201cOf course, we want our state to be fairly funded by the federal government, but it\u2019s exactly this kind of thinking \u2013 trying to maximize federal funds \u2013 that contributes to our growing national debt,\u201d said foundation President Kelly McCutchen. \u201cWe should spend more time encouraging Congress to devolve more programs to the states than fighting for greater funding.\u201d\n\nWhen you ask members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, they mostly agree with McCutchen. Some exceptions are their efforts to get the federal portion of the $700 million cost to deepen 40 miles of the Savannah River.\n\nFirst District Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., calls it a priority.\n\n\u201cSince I took office, it has been a priority of mine to ensure federal dollars are spent in a responsible manner on important projects that work like our military installations and the maintenance of our ports in the First District, including the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cSHEP will create thousands of jobs and increase our nation\u2019s competitiveness while boasting an unprecedented $5.50 return on every $1 dollar invested.\n\nIf that\u2019s not a good investment, I\u2019m not sure what is.\u201d\n\nThe entire delegation has pursued the deepening funds, but each district has similar individual concerns. In the 12th District, Rep. Rick Allen, R-Ga., is focused on money for the Army\u2019s Cyber Command at Fort Gordon, notes his spokeswoman Virginia Dent.\n\n\u201cHe is also committed to working to ensure federal resources continue to support growth at Fort Gordon,\u201d she said. \u201cCongressman Allen was pleased that full funding requested by the Army was included in the FY 2016 NDAA, and with funding levels in the FY 2016 military construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill and the House defense appropriations bill that passed the House, and will work to make sure these funds are included in future legislation.\u201d\n\nGeorgia has two representatives on Congressional budget committees, both members of the ruling Republican majority. Freshman Sen. David Perdue and Rep. Tom Price, who chairs the House committee.\n\nPerdue was elected last year on a campaign emphasizing his experience as a CEO of Fortune 500 companies and his concern about runaway federal spending.\n\n\u201cInstead of allowing Washington to make excuses for spending more taxpayer dollars, we must make Washington more transparent and accurate in its overall budgeting and accounting of everything its spending,\u201d he recently said.\n\nHe says that\u2019s the reason he is pushing the U.S. Department of State to locate its training facility for security officers in Brunswick at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, not trying to boost Georgia\u2019s share of federal spending. Using the existing center would save $1 billion over 10 years, he said.\n\nPrice actually oversaw the writing of the House version of the budget. Instead of maximizing direct payments, the area Georgia ranks highest in, he vows to tamp them back.\n\n\u201cFederal spending is being driven in large part and increasingly so by the nation\u2019s health and retirement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, while at the same time those programs are headed toward insolvency,\u201d he said in response to a recent upward revision in the Budget Office\u2019s projection of the annual budget deficit. \u201cPositive, principled solutions are needed to save and strengthen these vital programs for current and future generations and to help restore balance to our nation\u2019s fiscal outlook.\u201d\n\nFollow Walter Jones on Twitter @MorrisNews and Facebook or contact him at walter.jones@morris.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Walter C.
