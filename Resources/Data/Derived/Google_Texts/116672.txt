You might have noticed a rather large crane by the Threefoot building in downtown Meridian on Saturday.

No major work is being done on the building. Workers were simply removing old T-Mobile equipment.

Several companies have used the building for radio equipment, but most have removed the equipment. There are now just two companies with equipment on the Threefoot.

Saturday's removal will not impact cell service.
