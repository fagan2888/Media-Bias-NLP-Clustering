In fact, he\u2019s so ready to attack Iran that he\u2019s openly discussing the possibility of initiating hostilities within hours of taking the oath of office as the next president of the United States. Here\u2019s what the Republican governor of Wisconsin and 2016 candidate said over the weekend at a press conference in Iowa:\n\nWALKER: It\u2019s very possible \u2013 God forbid, but it\u2019s very possible \u2013 that the next president could be called to take aggressive actions, including military action, on the first day in office. And I don\u2019t want a president who is not prepared to act on day one. So, as far as me, as far as my position, I\u2019m going to be prepared to be president on day one.\n\nYou really can\u2019t get more hawkish than to float the possibility of launching a war before the inaugural ball. This wildly bellicose rhetoric from Walker is part of his campaign to be the most aggressively irresponsible critic of the new multilateral diplomatic framework to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Walker\u2019s already promised to withdraw from the deal immediately upon taking office and instead pursue sanctions that will \u201ccripple\u201d Iran. He hasn\u2019t convincingly explained how he\u2019d do that (withdrawing from the deal would alienate every partner and ally we\u2019d need to impose a \u201ccrippling\u201d sanctions regime) but \u201chaving a coherent plan\u201d is less important to Walker than demonstrating his unshakeable opposition to this Obama legacy item.\n\nWalker is also trying to lay down a marker for opposition to the Iran deal and make the case that other Republicans in the 2016 field are insufficiently committed to its demise. As Jim Newell noted this morning, Jeb Bush \u2013 who is no fan of the Iran deal \u2013 broke with some of his fellow candidates by taking the (relatively sensible) position that he would wait until his national security and diplomatic teams are in place before moving to unwind a major international agreement and putting us on the path towards yet another war in the Middle East. In response, Walker\u2019s team is blasting Jeb as an indecisive squish.\n\nHere\u2019s an actual statement Team Walker put out from former U.S. delegate to the United Nations Robert O\u2019Brien:\n\nThe next president must terminate this disastrous deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran on Day 1, as Governor Walker has repeatedly pledged to do. In fact, the process of undoing this deal begins right now. We don\u2019t need more information, we don\u2019t need to wait to confirm the next Secretary of State, we need decisive leadership and we need it now. This won\u2019t be easy, but when America leads, and has a strong president with clear priorities who believes in American strength, the rest of the world will follow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans fight Iran diplomacy like they fight Obamacare: if you're not 100% against it, you basically support it", "title": "Scott Walker\u2019s deranged hawkishness: He\u2019s ready to bomb Iran during his inauguration speech", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans fight Iran diplomacy like they fight Obamacare: if you're not 100% against it, you basically support it", "title": "Scott Walker\u2019s deranged hawkishness: He\u2019s ready to bomb Iran during his inauguration speech", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/20/scott_walkers_deranged_hawkishness_hes_ready_to_bomb_iran_during_his_inauguration_speech/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/scott_walker19.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans fight Iran diplomacy like they fight Obamacare: if you're not 100% against it, you basically support it", "title": "Scott Walker\u2019s deranged hawkishness: He\u2019s ready to bomb Iran during his inauguration speech", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/scott_walker19.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Foreign policy, Healthcare Reform, Iran, Iran deal, Iranian nuclear talks, Jeb Bush, National security, Obamacare, Republican Primary, Scott Walker", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13a6\"", "article_summary": "Walker\u2019s already promised to withdraw from the deal immediately upon taking office and instead pursue sanctions that will \u201ccripple\u201d Iran.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Foreign policy, Healthcare Reform, Iran, Iran deal, Iranian nuclear talks, Jeb Bush, National security, Obamacare, Republican Primary, Scott Walker, Elections News, Politics NewsScott Walker is ready to start a war with Iran.\nIn fact, he\u2019s so ready to attack Iran that he\u2019s openly discussing the possibility of initiating hostilities within hours of taking the oath of office as the next president of the United States.\nSo, as far as me, as far as my position, I\u2019m going to be prepared to be president on day one.\nWalker is also trying to lay down a marker for opposition to the Iran deal and make the case that other Republicans in the 2016 field are insufficiently committed to its demise."}
