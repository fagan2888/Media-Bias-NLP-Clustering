Mann recently received his full teaching certification.\n\nHe taught young children with autism. And now that he's gone, some local parents are grieving his loss.\n\nParent Allison Albano said, \"He didn't realize the gift he had, a very humble man but he had a gift. He had a lot more to give and we needed him a lot longer.\"\n\nParent Zsuzsanna Darvai said, \"He was just a wonderful person a very genuine and he had a special gift to be able to work and teach our children.\"\n\nAllison Albano and Zsuzsanna Darvai have autistic children who were in Mann's class.\n\nBoth parents say teaching an autistic child is tough, but with Mann they say there is noticeable improvement in their children's learning.\n\nAlbano says Mann used drawings as a way to teach the children in his class.\n\n\"She (daughter) loves drawing so as long as she was doing her class work he would draw until his hand hurts and he was an amazing artist,\u201d said Albano.\n\nAllison says she still hasn't told her daughter about her teacher's death. She says she's not sure that she will understand\n\n\"We'll probably just tell her that he's gone. And I'm really not sure what school is going to be like for her,\u201d said Albano.\n\nRight now both families are just remembering what a great teacher, and person Jason Mann was.\n\n\"He did change our children's life tremendously and he would have been able to change the lives of other children as well,\u201d Darvai said.\n\nFriends have set up a memorial account to help pay Mann's funeral expenses. Tomorrow all accounts will become active at any Hancock Bank branch.\n\nFuneral services for Mann are scheduled for 5 p.m. Saturday at Southerland\u2019s Funeral Home.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Some local families are mourning the sudden death of an autism teacher.", "language": "english", "author": "A-mila West", "og": {"description": "Some local families are mourning the sudden death of an autism teacher.", "title": "Local Families Mourn Death of Autism Teacher", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/--Local-Families-Mourn-Death-of-Autism-Teacher--237439161.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/830/CD3/830CD359B742417B98EF937C11C4A309", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D94/5B6/D945B68B81FE4EF0A44B26D801D83289.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Some local families are mourning the sudden death of an autism teacher.", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/--Local-Families-Mourn-Death-of-Autism-Teacher--237439161.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Capture23.PNG", "title": "Local Families Mourn Death of Autism Teacher", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Local Families Mourn Death of Autism Teacher", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local Families Mourn Death of"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12a1\"", "article_summary": "Breakfast point academy teacher Jason Mann died just before Christmas of a sudden illness.\nRight now both families are just remembering what a great teacher, and person Jason Mann was.\nSome local families are mourning the sudden death of an autism teacher.\nBoth parents say teaching an autistic child is tough, but with Mann they say there is noticeable improvement in their children's learning.\nParents say 41-year-old Jason Mann made a huge impact on the lives of their children."}
