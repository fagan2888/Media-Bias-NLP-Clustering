When Means\u2019 water broke roughly halfway through her term, the religious hospital reportedly sent her home without any treatment. When she returned the following day with bleeding, painful contractions, and signs of infections, she was once again turned away by hospital staff. It wasn\u2019t until her third visit, when she suddenly began to deliver the baby, that doctors finally intervened.\n\nIn a press release published Monday by the ACLU, the rights organization charges that the suffering Means endured was an immediate outcome of prohibitive directives set forth by the USCCB. \u201cThe directives prohibit a pre-viability pregnancy termination, even when there is little or no chance that the fetus will survive, and the life or health of a pregnant woman is at risk,\u201d the nonprofit organization wrote. \u201cThey also direct health care providers not to inform patients about alternatives inconsistent with those directives even when those alternatives are the best option for the patient's health.\u201d\n\nMeans, whose miscarriage would have been her fourth child, told reporters that she was appalled by the hospital\u2019s failure to inform her about the health risks attending the premature rupture of her membranes as well as the delivery itself. \u201cThey never offered me any options,\" she said in a statement released by the ACLU. \"They didn't tell me what was happening to my body. Whatever was going on with me, they discussed it amongst themselves. I was just left to wonder, what's going to happen to me?\"\n\nThe current case dovetails with the recent legal challenges to Texas Senate Bill 5 \u2014 a set of restrictive abortion provisions whereby a clinic offering pregnancy terminations must have inpatient admitting privileges at a fully equipped health center within 30 miles. The law, which was the subject of a well-publicized filibuster that elevated Senator Wendy Davis (D-Tex) to internet fame, has so far forced abortion clinics in 24 counties to close shop. Some women\u2019s rights activists argue that only a handful of clinics will survive under the new law.\n\nWith USCCB et al. v. ACLU, the abortion debate is widened to include a more diverse array of cases, as Means\u2019 predicament shows that directives set forth by religious authorities are sometimes indiscriminately generalized across all pregnancies \u2014 be they wanted or not. Writing for Slate, Amanda Marcotte submits that by refusing to acknowledge the state of the fetus and denying Means the care she obviously needed, the hospital essentially prioritized a faceless religious principle over the actual life of a mother of three children. Such decisions, she argues, call into question the anti-abortion movement\u2019s purported goal of protecting all life.\n\n\"The best interests of the patient must always come first and this fundamental ethic is central to the medical profession,\u201d Kary Moss, executive director of the ACLU of Michigan, said in a statement. \u201cIn this case, a young woman in a crisis situation was put at risk because religious directives were allowed to interfere with her medical care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "catholic hospital refuses to treat miscarrying woman, aclu sues bishops, tamesha means, mercy health partners, texas abortion law", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tamesha Means says that area hospital Mercy Health Partners put her through needless pain and suffering by refusing to recognize her pregnancy as a miscarriage.", "title": "Catholic Hospital Refuses To Treat Miscarrying Woman", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/catholic-hospital-refuses-treat-miscarrying-woman-aclu-sues-catholic-bishops-over-reproductive", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/04/court.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tamesha Means says that area hospital Mercy Health Partners put her through needless pain and suffering by refusing to recognize her pregnancy as a miscarriage.", "title": "Catholic Hospital Refuses To Treat Miscarrying Woman", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/catholic-hospital-refuses-treat-miscarrying-woman-aclu-sues-catholic-bishops-over-reproductive", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/04/court.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/04/court.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-12-04T17:16:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-04T17:16:40-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Tamesha Means says that area hospital Mercy Health Partners put her through needless pain and suffering by refusing to recognize her pregnancy as a miscarriage."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd049e\"", "article_summary": "When Means\u2019 water broke roughly halfway through her term, the religious hospital reportedly sent her home without any treatment.\n\u201cIn this case, a young woman in a crisis situation was put at risk because religious directives were allowed to interfere with her medical care.\u201d\nIn a press release published Monday by the ACLU, the rights organization charges that the suffering Means endured was an immediate outcome of prohibitive directives set forth by the USCCB.\nWhen she returned the following day with bleeding, painful contractions, and signs of infections, she was once again turned away by hospital staff.\nIt wasn\u2019t until her third visit, when she suddenly began to deliver the baby, that doctors finally intervened."}
