In 1953, President Eisenhower, less than two months on the job, re-organized several agencies of the federal government into a new Cabinet department \u2013 Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nBut it was Johnson who began a large-scale intrusion into education, an all-out effort that has not abated in half a century. And since those early days, the federal role in education has only grown, both in terms of its size and scope, as well as its cost to the American taxpayer.\n\nFrom the ESEA to the Department of Education to No Child Left Behind, the new Common Core program is just the latest, and by far the worst, federal intrusion into American schools. Senator Mike Lee has rightly labeled it the \u201cObamacare of education,\u201d a plan that will result in \u201cthe DC takeover of our school system. It will dumb down standards and cheapen the education our children receive.\u201d\n\nIt will cheapen the education every American receives, no doubt, but it certainly won\u2019t be cheap on the pocketbook of the taxpayers, if history is any indication. In the last 40 years we have seen a 375 percent increase in federal education spending with no sign Washington will stop anytime soon.\n\nSince the 1965 ESEA, the total is $2 trillion. Annually, American taxpayers spend $13,000 per student, roughly a quarter of a million dollars per classroom, more than any other nation on the planet by far.\n\nWith so much money being spent, the question is: why are our schools still failing?\n\nBecause, as Investors\u2019 Business Daily has editorialized, all this federal money \u201cfeeds a bureaucratic monster sheltered from competition.\u201d With a monopoly on education, there is no incentive or good reason to improve public education. And that\u2019s not to mention the vast and complex sociological concerns underlying the present failed system.\n\nThe results have been horrendous. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the United States spends \u201cmore per pupil than any other country, but among industrialized nations, American students rank near the bottom in science and math. Only 13 percent of high school seniors know what high school seniors should know about American history.\u201d\n\nIn December 2013, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) released its latest study and found that American teens have slipped to 31st in math, 24th in science, and 21st in reading. Shamefully, Third World and underdeveloped nations actually finished ahead of America.\n\nIn Mississippi, once again we are ranked dead last. This is unacceptable.\n\nIn my eight years in the senate I have fought to free us from federal intrusion and repeal Common Core.\n\nWith much hope, conservatives in the senate believed this year would finally see the end of Common Core. And after years of blocking any effort to get rid of Common Core, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves indicated that he supported the cause. Yet when an amendment reached the floor designed to finally eliminate Common Core, Reeves mustered the necessary votes to kill it.\n\nSo on the specific instructions of Lt. Gov. Reeves, Common Core survives and will remain the standards for Mississippi schools.\n\nBut we fight on. Simply put, in keeping with our system of federalism, Washington has no right to meddle in our schools. It is only through state and local efforts that our schools can improve.\n\nUnlike Washington bureaucrats, I care deeply for public education. My father was a college professor. My wife and mother-in-law are public school teachers. My children attend public schools. I will never turn my back on public education.\n\nBut I will say no to continued federal involvement in it.\n\nMy philosophy of education is based on one simple fact, one that is shared by the vast majority of Mississippians: I care more for my children than any bureaucrat in Washington, DC.\n\nAnd it is only with that kind of thinking can we once again regain our position as world leader in education.\n\nSenator Chris McDaniel is an attorney, conservative commentator, and was a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 2014.
