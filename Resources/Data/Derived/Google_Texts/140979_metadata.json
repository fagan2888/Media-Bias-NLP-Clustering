The agency also is considering furloughs, hiring freezes and other steps to close a funding gap for the budget year that ends Sept. 30.\n\nThe VA said it wants authority to use up to $3 billion from the new Veterans Choice program to close the budget gap, with as much as $500 million going to treat hepatitis C. A single pill for the liver-wasting viral infection can cost up to $1,000.\n\nThe Choice program, the centerpiece of a VA overhaul approved last year, makes it easier for veterans to receive federally paid medical care from local doctors. Congress approved $10 billion over three years for the Choice program as it responded to a scandal over long waits for veterans seeking medical care and falsified records to cover up the delays.\n\nDeputy VA Secretary Sloan Gibson told Congress that VA health care sites experienced a 10.5 percent increase in workload for the one-year period since the scandal erupted in April 2014.\n\nThe VA needs flexibility from Congress to close the budget gap, Gibson said, adding that action is needed in the next three weeks to avoid drastic consequences.\n\nLawmakers from both parties faulted the VA for failing to announce the impending shortfall before last month. Lawmakers also criticized the agency for failing to anticipate or fix budget problems, including a failed VA hospital project in Denver that is more than $1 billion over budget.\n\nRep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said he was troubled at \u201cVA\u2019s continued lack of transparency and refusal to be forthright with Congress,\u201d but said, \u201cveterans must not be penalized for VA\u2019s ongoing mismanagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is far from the first time VA has disclosed problems far too late and turned its blatant mismanagement into a fiscal emergency,\u201d Miller said Monday night.
