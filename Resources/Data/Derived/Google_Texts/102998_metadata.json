That's the seasonally adjusted number of job openings in June, the highest value in more than 13 years.\n\nWonkbook\u2019s Chart of the Day: This chart offers a bird's-eye view of what Americans said in their 1.1 million comments about the FCC's net-neutrality proposal.\n\nWonkbook's Top 4 Stories: (1) Ferguson, Mo., shooting controversy; (2) experimental Ebola drug barriers; (3) more evidence of imminent wage hikes?; (4) the not-so-legal, legal marijuana.\n\n1. Top story: The racially charged controversy over the Missouri shooting\n\nSt. Louis remains one of the most racially segregated metro areas in the U.S. \"Residents, advocacy groups and onlookers far from St. Louis are focused on the details surrounding the fatal confrontation....But there's a much broader piece of context here that has to do with a legacy of racial segregation in U.S. cities, which has eroded more slowly in St. Louis than many other big metros. St. Louis remains among the most segregated metropolitan areas in the country. According to data from Brown University's US2010 Project, looking at the 50 metropolitan areas with the largest black populations as of 2010, St. Louis ranks as the 9th most segregated.\" Emily Badger in The Washington Post.\n\nWhen police officers don't look like the cities they're meant to protect. \"Non-whites in metropolitan St. Louis have been far overrepresented in low-paying civil service jobs. And their representation among high-paying ones has fallen well below what we might expect given the demographics of the local community. These trends help explain why blacks repeatedly show greater distrust of public institutions like police departments and court systems, as my colleague Aaron Blake wrote yesterday....Ferguson isn't merely reacting to the shooting of Michael Brown; it's reacting to the shooting of Michael Brown by someone who represents an institution of power that's supposed to protect the public.\" Emily Badger in The Washington Post.\n\nFeds to launch broad review of police tactics. \"The Justice Department is leading a broad review of police tactics, including the kind of deadly force that prompted recent protests in Missouri and New York....The review is being conducted as the department weighs creating a national commission to provide new direction on such controversial issues. In addition to deadly force, the review is expected to examine law enforcement's increasing encounters with the mentally ill, the application of emerging technologies such as body cameras, and police agencies' expanding role in homeland security efforts since 9/11.\" Kevin Johnson in USA Today.\n\nThe FAA has restricted airspace over Ferguson, Mo. \u2014 and that's not unusual. \"According to the FAA\u2019s website, the agency restricted the airspace above the St. Louis suburb 'to provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.' It prevents any aircraft from flying in the area below 3,000 feet, the notice said....It\u2019s not unusual for the FAA to restrict flights over crime scenes, particularly high-profile ones, as law enforcement seeks to restrict access by news media with helicopters. Recently, the FAA clamped down on flights during the standoff between Cliven Bundy\u2019s supporters and the Bureau of Land Management in Nevada \u2014 as well as immediately after the Boston Marathon bombing.\" Lucy McCalmont in Politico.\n\nWhat is the FBI looking for in its criminal investigation? \"Attorney General Eric Holder says the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in a St. Louis suburb deserves a full review. Holder's statement Monday comes as the Justice Department dispatched its Community Relations Service to the scene to try and help calm the area's racial tension. The service helps communities resolve conflicts and tensions arising from racial differences. The FBI is looking into possible civil rights violations in the shooting of 18-year old Michael Brown. Police said Brown was shot multiple times Saturday after an altercation with an officer in Ferguson, Missouri.\" Associated Press.\n\nWhat the law says on when police can use deadly force. \"The police account of Saturday's events is that Michael Brown fought for a gun in a police cruiser before being shot dead a short distance from the car. Given that account, one question in Brown\u2019s shooting death at the hands of Ferguson police is whether Brown would be considered a non-dangerous suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court imposed a constitutional limit on the police use of deadly force to apprehend unarmed fleeing felons in a 1985 case from Memphis where an African-American 8th grader was shot fleeing a home burglary. That decision, Tennessee v. Garner, rested on the shoulders of a St. Louis case from the 1970s.\" William Freivogel in St. Louis Public Radio.\n\nWhat does the law say on releasing the involved officer's name? \"Rothert said that under Missouri\u2019s public records laws, police incident reports, comprising the names of officers, must be made public within 72 hours. Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, claimed on Tuesday that exceptional circumstances meant that did not apply in this case....Jackson later told NewsChannel 5 that he would not be releasing the name unless directed to by a judge or required to, if or when official charges are filed. Police officials backtracked after initially saying that they would publish the officer\u2019s name on Tuesday. They said that the officer and the department at large had received threats of violence.\" Jon Swaine in The Guardian.\n\nWhy Obama's statement on the shooting was measured. \"The measured nature of Obama\u2019s Tuesday remarks may be in part situational \u2014 the Justice Department is investigating the death, and he can\u2019t presuppose the results of their inquiry; the facts of the shooting are in dispute; and any more emotional response might threaten to further inflame the passions he sought to tamp down....Not much distance had been trod in the two years between the deaths of [Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown], and the country seemed not that much further along in what Obama described in his elaboration last year as 'this long, difficult journey.'\" Cathleen Decker in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAnecdotally, gun sales rise for some shops in St. Louis after shooting. \"For the past two days, Steve King has been 'unbelievably busy' at his gun store....King said business spiked 50 percent as local residents respond to the violent events taking place in Ferguson....King, who owns the store that has 17 employees and 2013 revenue of about $2 million, added that customers have ranged from new firearm buyers to those upgrading their current arsenal. He said both black and white individuals have purchased firearms at his store over the past few days.\" Vince Brennan in St. Louis Business Journal.\n\nOther legal reads:\n\nGuns to play major role in first post-Newtown governor's race in Connecticut.

Josh Hicks in The Washington Post.\n\nEPSTEIN: What's missing in Ferguson, Mo. \"Missing, not that anyone is likely to have noticed, was the calming voice of a national civil-rights leader of the kind that was so impressive during the 1950s and '60s. In those days there was Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; Roy Wilkins of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young of the National Urban League, Bayard Rustin of the A. Philip Randolph Institute \u2014 all solid, serious men, each impressive in different ways, who through dignified forbearance and strategic action, brought down a body of unequivocally immoral laws aimed at America's black population.\" Joseph Epstein in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTop opinion\n\nTHOMA: Immigration does help domestic workers. \"The contentious debate over immigration in both the U.S. and Europe is largely based on the worry that immigration hurts domestic workers, particularly low-skilled workers. But is this actually true?...Could it be that immigrants actually help native workers? New research on this topic suggests that they do help. In particular, a recent paper by noted immigration researcher Giovanni Peri and his co-authors Michele Battisti, Gabriel Felbermayr and Panu Poutvaara finds that 'both high-skilled and low-skilled natives would benefit from a small increase in immigration from current levels.' Most economists will not be surprised by this result.\" Mark Thoma in CBS News.\n\nSALAM: The threat of health care market consolidation. \"In theory, the Affordable Care Act was designed to do away with the problem of uncompensated care by dramatically reducing the number of uninsured individuals. With the uncompensated care problem 'solved,' there would presumably be less need for the public sector to stand idly by as hospitals consolidate to increase their pricing power. As Chris Pope observes...however, the Affordable Care Act has if anything exacerbated the problem of monopoly pricing power in medical care. Yet the story of government\u2019s role in driving provider concentration is not primarily about the Affordable Care Act. The bigger culprit is Medicare.\" Reihan Salam in National Review.\n\nM. KLEIN: Government spending booms are not so great for economic growth. \"Most of the world\u2019s population lives in countries that aren\u2019t rich, so it makes sense that economists and policymakers spend a lot of time trying to figure out how poorer countries can develop into wealthy ones. One old idea that remains popular is the 'big push': getting an activist government to spend a lot of money on infrastructure projects in the hope that the new roads, bridges, etc. will boost long-term productivity. A new working paper from the IMF suggests these investment booms do more harm than good.\" Matthew C. Klein in The Financial Times.\n\nGONZALES: Obama's time for immigration action. \"Some constitutional scholars argue that the president has no inherent power....Others believe in an expansive inherent power....Still others believe, as I do, the scope of the president's inherent power lies somewhere...between these two extremes. What is clear, however, is that the courts have generally been inclined to defer to the executive's discretion in executing the law based upon competing priorities and budgetary constraints. Furthermore, often the courts refuse to even hear cases that present a political question. Thus, disputes over allocation of power between the elected branches are frequently resolved in the public arena, not the courts.\" Alberto R. Gonzales in USA Today.\n\nLUBBEN: Do living wills for banks even make sense? \"The basic question is whether this exercise is ever going to work. Unlike the orderly liquidation authority, Chapter 11 has no mechanism for government financing. And let\u2019s just stipulate now that there will be no private funding....While in theory foreign companies...can file Chapter 11 petitions, there are good reasons to worry about the reaction of foreign regulators to a bankruptcy filing....All of which leads to the likely conclusion that the big financial institutions, as currently constituted, probably cannot come up with a reasonable resolution plan under the bankruptcy code, as currently constituted.\" Stephen J. Lubben in The New York Times.\n\nCHAIT: Did Republicans extend the recovery to 2016? \"The fiscal vise has had the likely side effect of extending the duration of the recovery....The faster an economy reaches its peak capacity, the more likely it is to overheat. When businesses are humming and unemployment is low, it is easier for either inflation to accelerate or for bubbles to form....Inflation can provoke the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, bringing the recovery to an end; popped bubble can cause a systemic crash....Obviously, economies don\u2019t always follow schedules. But the possibility of having manufactured the perfect economic conditions for their 2016 opponent must exasperate more cool-headed Republicans,\" Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine.\n\nCAPRETTA: How should the GOP govern? \"To really advance a new governing agenda, the GOP needs to win the White House again. And that means preparing and advancing conservative reforms that have the potential to resonate broadly with middle class and working class Americans \u2014 many of whom voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. This is not to suggest that a GOP takeover of the Senate in 2015 would be unimportant....It is also possible that some conservative reforms might get enacted under such a scenario, even with President Obama in office. But to really pursue an ambitious pro-growth agenda...that\u2019s going to require capturing the White House. The GOP would do well to keep this in mind.\" James Capretta in AEIdeas.\n\nSARTWELL: The downside of consensus. \"In sincerely trying to find the truth about factual claims, it is often important to decide whom to believe. To do that, it\u2019s important to figure out who is advocating something on the basis of evidence. The people most likely to be sensitive to evidence \u2014 and therefore most worth listening to \u2014 often disagree with the consensus of the people around them on factual matters. We ought provisionally to regard people who frequently act as dissidents, heretics, and pariahs in their own political group as being more committed to speaking the truth than people who usually or always agree with the consensus.\" Crispin Sartwell in The Atlantic.\n\nSPROSS: Why reform conservatives should embrace universal income. \"If reformocons truly want to remake the American social safety net for the 21st century, they're going to need one additional policy. It's rather radical for the political mainstream, but its radicalism flows from some of the best insights conservatism has to offer. And it falls right in with reformocons' renewed focus on the interests of the poor and working class. It's called a universal basic income....The government writes a check for the same amount to every American....Most importantly for reformocons, a UBI would plug the final gaping hole in their economic agenda: what to do about worker bargaining power.\" Jeff Spross in The Week.\n\nAnimals interlude: Videos of adorable elephants to celebrate World Elephant Day.\n\n2. The barriers to finding \u2014 and distributing \u2014 new Ebola drugs\n\nWHO ethics panel approves use of experimental Ebola drugs. \"The ethics panel, made up of researchers, ethicists, and patient safety advocates, reached consensus that under certain circumstances in this outbreak, 'it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with as yet unknown efficacy and adverse effects, as potential treatment or prevention.' They also concluded that 'there is a moral obligation to collect and share all data generated, including from treatments provided for compassionate use' and 'a moral duty to evaluate these interventions (for treatment or prevention) in the best possible clincial trials under the circumstances.'\" Kai Kupferschmidt in Science.\n\nAudio: Why there's no drug to treat Ebola. Richard Harris in NPR.\n\nBut who should get these drugs first? \"The provision of ZMapp, which is in extremely limited supply, to foreign aid workers has raised broad ethical questions about the disparities in treatment between white outsiders and the Africans who form the overwhelming majority of victims in the epidemic. Those concerns were heightened further after Spanish officials confirmed that they had obtained a supply of ZMapp for a third patient, a 75-year-old Spanish priest who died Tuesday....ZMapp and other potential treatments are in such short supply that another politically charged question remains: Who should get them?\" Andrew Pollack in The New York Times.\n\nMany months before more doses become available. \"Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant WHO director general, said she hopes that work to produce more of the medication developed by a small San Diego biopharmaceutical company, as well as other drugs, could result in wider availability sometime late in 2014 \u2014 perhaps between November and January of 2015....A small number of doses of an experimental treatment \u2014 perhaps 1o total, Kieny said \u2014 were exhausted with their distribution to Liberia on Monday for the treatment of two doctors there...according to Mapp Biopharmaceutical, which developed the drug.\" Abby Phillip and Lenny Bernstein in The Washington Post.\n\nU.S. is helping firm scale up production of drug given to 2 Americans. \"Mapp Biopharmaceutical\u2019s drug ZMapp has shown some promise. The drug has been used to treat two Americans who have contracted Ebola. But the company said Tuesday it has run out of supplies. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says it will take months to make more of the drug. Even in that timeframe, the company will only be able to produce less than a hundred treatment courses. He said the government was trying to help Mapp 'scale up' so that it could produce more of the medicine.\" Ferdous Al-Faruque in The Hill.\n\nRelated: Canada to donate experimental vaccine to WHO. Anjali Cordeiro and Simeon Bennett in Bloomberg.\n\nZMapp's success could bolster approaches for other diseases like HIV. \"The Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. drug, called ZMapp, is an antibody cocktail designed to block the virus from entering cells. The strategy was thought to be best at preventing infections, but ZMapp\u2019s outcomes in animals, and now possibly humans, suggests the antibodies may treat the sick as well. While it\u2019s too early to say the Mapp drug works, the attention may help speed development of antibody-based treatments against other diseases, including HIV-AIDS, responsible for an estimated 1.6 million deaths globally in 2012, and drug-resistant bacterial infections, the killer of about 23,000 people in the U.S. each year.\" John Lauerman and Caroline Chen in Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: What would happen if someone got Ebola in America?

Niraj Chokshi in The Washington Post.\n\nMARSH: Fast-tracking access to experimental Ebola drugs. \"Giving treatments, which are unlicensed and untested in humans, is an ethical issue. Likewise, not administering a potentially life-saving therapy is also problematic....There are other issues to consider: what if the experimental therapeutic makes the disease worse? And who decides who to treat when only small numbers of doses are available?...Although there is currently no end in sight for this outbreak, research and clinical trials of these new therapies for Ebola virus needs to continue. That way, when the next Ebola virus outbreak occurs...the discussion about whether unlicensed drugs should be used will be negated.\" Glenn Marsh in The Conversation.\n\nGOTTLIEB: Stopping Ebola in U.S. could prompt use of controversial tools. \"The diagnosis of some cases on American soil shouldn\u2019t be reason to panic. We have a plethora of tools and public health practices to readily combat its spread. Yet because the virus is so dangerous, and feared, its arrival in America would likely to trigger a robust response from our public health establishment. For most Americans, it may be the first time they glimpse the tools that our government has staked out over the last decade, as preparation for public health emergencies like a pandemic flu, or even bioterrorism. Some of these authorities are wholly necessary. Others will prove controversial and worthy of closer scrutiny.\" Scott Gottlieb in Forbes.\n\nROSS: The real Ebola ethics dilemma. \"The real ethical dilemma here is...whether medical research should be funded by a predominantly market-driven system with the work of critical drug discovery left to the underfunded public sector. Yes, we have the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a few other federal research systems in place to fund critical research that might not fare well in the market system. But as we have seen with the AIDS vaccine, and indeed with an Ebola vaccine, the federal research machine \u2014 the only vehicle we have at present to investigate science without a near-term promise of profit \u2014 cannot possibly support the volume of inquiry that is necessary to unlock vaccine secrets for challenging emerging viruses.\" Heather M. Ross in The Hill.\n\nBOYD: Ebola and the 'right to try.' \"As concerns over the devastating Ebola outbreak in Western Africa have spread across the world this week, one story continues to be underplayed amidst the outpouring of alarming reports. There was a non-FDA-approved antidote flown into Liberia that is being credited with the recoveries of the two infected U.S. missionaries \u2014 but that, under current standards, may not be an option for citizens living in most states, should the outbreak happen here....'Right-to-Try' legislation gives those...with no remaining options the ability to hope again.\" Lindsay M. Boyd in Forbes.\n\nScience interlude: Debunking some key myths about Shark Week.\n\n3. Legal marijuana is facing some unexpected legal barriers\n\nMarijuana dispensaries need loans, too, and have to go to great lengths to get them. \"Marijuana dispensaries, legal in some states but forbidden by federal law, have had a notoriously hard time finding financial firms willing to wade into the gray area. Regulatory constraints aside, a strip club or head shop might seem risky, or simply distasteful, to Main Street lenders....The ad campaign sounds more dicey with a little more context. Sexy Business Funding specializes in a kind of high-priced loan called a merchant cash advance, in which small business owners sell a portion of their future sales for an upfront payment.\" Patrick Clark in Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\nA sign of hope for lending to legal marijuana sellers. \"A top federal official on Tuesday said that 105 banks and credit unions are doing business with legal marijuana sellers, suggesting that federal rules giving financial institutions the go-ahead to provide services to dealers are starting to work. The Obama administration in February gave the banking industry the green light to offer financing and accounts to pot distributors who can legally conduct business in 20 states and the District. Sellers hailed the decision as a step toward bringing marijuana commerce...into the mainstream financial system. But banking groups said the guidance did little to allay fears of doing business with companies whose products remain illegal under federal law.\" Danielle Douglas in The Washington Post.\n\nUtilities' dilemma: How to serve the energy-intensive pot industry without violating federal law? \"The intertwined relationships between state and federal governments mean that acting to lower marijuana's energy usage could endanger millions of dollars in federal grants or electricity deliveries from federal hydroelectric dams. As a result, utilities find themselves planning in stealth for what is shaping up to be a major power consumer that is as hungry for electricity as corporate data centers, according to a study....With ballot initiatives to make recreational pot legal on the ballot this November in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., the clash between federal and state laws is heating up.\" David Ferris in EnergyWire.\n\nColorado case puts workplace drug policies to the test. \"It's been 25 years since the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act was passed, creating requirements for federal government workers and contractors. Many companies...followed suit, and today more a third of private employers have drug-testing policies. Although marijuana is now legal in two states and approved for medical use in nearly half, the drug policies of many companies haven't kept pace. Coats has sued Dish Network over its marijuana policy; his case is now before the Colorado Supreme Court....For now, businesses are neither changing nor relaxing the way they test for pot....And at least in Colorado, the legalization of pot is putting employers in even murkier legal territory.\" Yuki Noguchi in NPR.\n\nWell, this stinks: Marijuana sparks odor complaints in Colorado. \"Long confined to isolated areas far from prying eyes and sniffing noses, the marijuana industry has gone mainstream, and that you-can-smell-it presence has upset some people. This year, about 30% of the smell complaints coming into Denver's code enforcement office are about the pot smell coming from the largely industrial areas away from most homes, schools and parks....Even though the city has received dozens of complaints about pot smells, Siller has not yet measured any marijuana smell that violates the city's standard.\" Trevor Hughes in USA Today.\n\nMedical-marijuana research runs up against federal law. \"Dr. Sisley\u2019s case is an extreme example of the obstacles and frustrations scientists face....Dating back to 1999, the Department of Health and Human Services has indicated it does not see much potential for developing marijuana in smoked form into an approved prescription drug. In guidelines issued that year for research on medical marijuana, the agency quoted from an accompanying report that stated, 'If there is any future for marijuana as a medicine, it lies in its isolated components, the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives.' Scientists say this position has had a chilling effect on marijuana research.\" Serge F. Kovaleski in The New York Times.\n\nOops: Colorado needs to make more legal marijuana. \"Even though sales have surged, only about 60% of the marijuana sold is the legal variety. The rest is either illegal or grown unregulated in the so-called gray market, where unlicensed citizens can grow for their own use....As a result, Colorado state regulators are trying to increase the amount of marijuana produced and sold by legal retailers....However, new data comparing demand for marijuana in Colorado with the legal supply suggest that criminal enterprises could stay in business.\" Katie Kuntz in Rocky Mountain PBS I-News.\n\nChart: Marijuana legalization in Colorado didn't stop the state's decline in teen pot use.

More evidence that wage are gradually rising?\n\nFresh data shows U.S. jobs market tightening. \"The share of unemployed Americans competing for each open job hit a six-year low in June, suggesting a labor market tightening that could give way to faster wage growth....'There is not enough qualified supply out there to fill the job openings that exists,' said Jacob Oubina, a senior U.S. Economist at RBC Capital Markets....Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased to a seasonally adjusted 4.67 million in June, the highest level since February 2001. At the same time, hiring reached its highest point since February 2008.\" Lucia Mutikani in Reuters.\n\nICYMI: The jobs that had replaced the lost ones so haven't paid as much. Eric Pianin in The Fiscal Times.\n\nTeam Yellen has its eyes on that report. \"Today\u2019s figures are among those on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s employment 'dashboard,' which she uses to help guide monetary policy. The increase in openings, combined with the highest readings on the number of people hired and leaving their jobs since 2008, means the healing in the labor market is broadening, albeit at a measured rate....Although it lags the Labor Department\u2019s other jobs data by a month, Yellen follows the report as a measure of labor-market tightness and worker confidence.\" Nina Glinski in Bloomberg.\n\nBackground readings:\n\nCertain sectors have shown signs of pay hikes.
