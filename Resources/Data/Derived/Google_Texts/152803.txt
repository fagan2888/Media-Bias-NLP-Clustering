People you didn't know were on SNL

The President will appear live via satellite from the White House on Thursday, March 20 to discuss his new health care initiative. The President's appearance, his first since 2008 when he was campaigning for the Oval Office, comes less than 11 days before the deadline to sign up for ObamaCare.

The President most recently appeared as a guest on Zach Galifianakis' Funny or Die fake talk show "Between Two Ferns" to talk about the Affordable Care Act.

Ellen airs weekdays. Check local listings for time and channel. Are you excited to see the President appear?
