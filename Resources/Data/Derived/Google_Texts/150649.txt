I don’t always watch cable news, but when I do, I watch the Fox News Channel.

It’s my cable news channel of choice and, yes, I consider that consistent with, or related to, the fact that I’m a Republican. Why fake it?

Now that those cards are on the table, I’ll tell you that even I had to turn off host Megyn Kelly this week as she railed against Obamcare “architect” Jonathan Gruber and his caught-on-tape insults against, well, pretty much all Americans outside of his own elite circle of liberal Ivy League geniuses.

Did I turn off the TV because I disagreed with Kelly’s outrage? No. Gruber’s statements are absolutely outrageous. It’s more that I didn’t relate to her energy over the whole thing. There is absolutely nothing about this news that is one little bit surprising. This isn’t a “man bites dog” story. It’s closer to a “sky is blue” headline.

The health care law is a disaster that was designed by big-government, big-brother-type liberals. That one of them appears to routinely refer to Americans as “stupid” is simply to be expected. I wish I could get more worked up about this, but Gruber’s elitist world view isn’t a revelation.

Another health care non-revelation this week was that small-business health care “SHOP” exchanges are an unmitigated failure.

Only 12,000 small employers have utilized the state-run SHOP exchanges – part of the Small Business Health Options Program – as of June, according to a new Government Accountability Office report. To put that in context, there are about 6 million small employer firms in the U.S. today.

Numbers supposedly aren’t available for the federally-run SHOP exchanges, but there isn’t a health care analyst in America who thinks participation in the federal exchanges will be any better than the state exchanges. In fact, the participation rate in federally-run SHOP exchanges is likely to be even worse.
