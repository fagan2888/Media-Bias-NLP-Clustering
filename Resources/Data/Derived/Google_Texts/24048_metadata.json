A new proposal released today shows just how difficult a task that is.\n\nThe agency proposed a strategy to deal with the failure of a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d (SIFI) while simultaneously protecting the rest of the economy from collateral damage.\n\nRelated: Why Jack Lew Is Kidding Himself About Too Big to Fail\n\nThe problem is, according to at least two FDIC board members, the proposal might wind up creating unfair competitive advantages for large firms vis-\u00e0-vis their smaller brethren, and in the end, might not protect the taxpayer anyway.\n\nFDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig released a statement noting that the agency faces \u201ca series of obstacles as it develops a resolution plan should a SIFI fail and not be resolvable under bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nFDIC Director Jeremiah O. Norton, while praising the agency staff\u2019s work on the proposed rule, expressed similar concerns, \u201cthere are a number of key issues that require further consideration and analysis.\u201d\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandated that for the most part the resolution of insolvent financial institutions should take place through normal bankruptcy procedures. Shareholders, creditors, and in some cases, depositors take the hit \u2013 not the Treasury Department. But the drafters of the law recognized that there are some financial institutions in the U.S. that are simply so large that allowing them to go bankrupt in the typical sense could cause severe and cascading structural harm to the U.S. economy.\n\nRelated: Break Up Big Banks? Here's A Better Solution\n\nFor that reason, lawmakers gave the FDIC what\u2019s called \u201cOrderly Liquidation Authority\u201d over SIFIs, meaning that the agency can put a large financial firm into receivership to prevent an uncontrolled collapse.\n\nToday\u2019s proposal outlined what the agency calls a \u201cSingle Point of Entry\u201d method of resolving a failed megabank.\n\nThe FDIC would create a \u201cbridge company\u201d that would take the place of the holding company and would assume control over all of its subsidiaries and affiliates, which would continue to operate, preventing widespread market disruptions. The bridge company would be capitalized from the assets of the failing institution or, if available capital was insufficient, from loans from the private sector or the government.\n\nBecause the bridge company would not be insolvent, most counterparties to the bank in derivatives transactions would not have the right to close out their contracts, theoretically preventing the \u201cfire sale\u201d of assets.\n\nRelated: 5 Years After The Crisis: What Banks Haven't Learned\n\nBut Hoenig and Norton identified several possible problems with the agency\u2019s proposal.\n\nFirst, by assuring the subsidiaries of a SIFI will continue to operate in the event of the holding company\u2019s failure, the FDIC may be handing those subsidiaries a competitive advantage over competitors not affiliated with a SIFI, Hoenig pointed out.\n\n\u201cIn times of financial stress, the knowledge that operating units will be provided funding to meet liquidity demands could serve to encourage corporate treasurers and others to place their funds with SIFIs\u2019 operating subsidiaries over other financial firms for whom such assurances are unavailable.\u201d\n\nAnother issue is how to determine whether the amount of capital and debt held by the bridge company is sufficient. If it is not, wrote Norton, \u201cWithout sufficient intra-company debt to recapitalize a failed subsidiary, the desired orderliness\u2026might not be achievable.\u201d\n\nRelated: Volcker Rule Lets Bank Ceos \u201cOff The Hook\u201d\n\nA third problem is that, while the proposal clearly intends to insulate the Treasury from the costs of resolving a SIFI, it isn\u2019t clear that the agency could actually do so in practice.\n\n\u201c[G]iven the practice in the U.S. and elsewhere, and since [the proposal] can be implemented only if the SIFI's failure would have systemic consequences,\u201d Hoenig wrote, \u201cit is likely that the government would step in to assure an operating subsidiary does not fail.\u201d\n\nThe result, he wrote, \u201crepresents significant public support for these institutions.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of small financial institutions were dubious about the proposal, and said that they didn\u2019t believe that it would prevent future government bailouts of large financial institutions.\n\n\u201cThe single point of entry strategy doesn\u2019t eliminate too big to fail,\u201d said Chris Cole, senior vice president and senior regulatory counsel with the Independent Community Bankers of America.\n\n\u201cYou are still going to have institutions that are too big to fail,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re eventually going to have to do is break them up.\u201d\n\nFollow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarver\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After the financial debacle that caused a near economic depression in the U.S.", "title": "FDIC Plan to Combat 'Too Big to Fail' Is Flawed", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/10/FDIC-Plan-Combat-Too-Big-Fail-Flawed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01182013_bank_crack_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/10/FDIC-Plan-Combat-Too-Big-Fail-Flawed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01182013_bank_crack_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After the financial debacle that caused a near economic depression in the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd980c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou are still going to have institutions that are too big to fail,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe single point of entry strategy doesn\u2019t eliminate too big to fail,\u201d said Chris Cole, senior vice president and senior regulatory counsel with the Independent Community Bankers of America.\nToday\u2019s proposal outlined what the agency calls a \u201cSingle Point of Entry\u201d method of resolving a failed megabank.\nRelated: 5 Years After The Crisis: What Banks Haven't LearnedBut Hoenig and Norton identified several possible problems with the agency\u2019s proposal.\nHere's A Better SolutionFor that reason, lawmakers gave the FDIC what\u2019s called \u201cOrderly Liquidation Authority\u201d over SIFIs, meaning that the agency can put a large financial firm into receivership to prevent an uncontrolled collapse."}
