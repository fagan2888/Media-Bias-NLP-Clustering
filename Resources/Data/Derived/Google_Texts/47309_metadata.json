By issuing rules and executive orders, he will bypass Congress\u2014which many argue is in some cases unconstitutional\u2014to create \u201cthe America\u201d he desires. And our \u201cleader\u201d even threatens his citizens to do as he says or he will punish us by withholding our very own tax dollars from our school children and hospitals.\n\nMost notable was a directive from his education and justice departments instructing schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. A Wall Street Journal editorial said, \u201cAs the nation\u2019s public schools learned Friday, this gives \u2018guidance\u2019 new meaning. That meaning is that the Obama Administration intends to obliterate what is left of federalism, the principle that states retain powers not delegated to the national government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a historical example of how government grows and how, by redistributing our tax dollars and offering funding, it sinks its claws into the states, making them dependent, so the feds can call the shots\u2014or else.\u201d\n\nI have heard many views expressed on the topic. One person pointed out that the federal government is attempting to reach into every area of our lives and tell us what we must do\u2014even in the bathroom. He said it is ironic that liberals are the first ones to use \u201cscience\u201d when arguing such issues as global warming, but want to ignore simple anatomy and physiology in the bathroom debate. Those same liberals also want to claim that using the bathroom of your choosing based on how you \u201cfeel\u201d is a civil rights issue\u2014but these hypocrites will deny a disadvantaged child the ability to choose a school based on where they \u201cfeel\u201d safe or \u201cfeel\u201d they can get the best education. What about those civil rights?\n\nI found Obama\u2019s comments in his recent commencement speech at Rutgers University amusing. He said, \u201cFacts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science\u2014these are good things. These are qualities you want in people making policy.\u201d Too bad our president is missing so many of those qualities in this situation.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard the joke, \u201cI am with the federal government, and I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d Why do we laugh and react with such a cynical view\u2014or even anger\u2014toward our nation\u2019s capital? Maybe it\u2019s our history.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education recounts its own history by stating \u201cits origins go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation\u2019s schools. However, due to concern that the department would exercise too much control over local schools, the new department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868.\u201d Then in 1979, President Jimmy Carter elevated the department to cabinet level. (Thanks, Jimmy.) The next president ought to eliminate the department and return the money and power to the states.\n\nThis is a historical example of how government grows and how, by redistributing our tax dollars and offering funding, it sinks its claws into the states, making them dependent, so the feds can call the shots\u2014or else. The president and federal government want to dictate from Washington on matters that should be guided by states\u2019 rights. This is the fear of Medicaid expansion. It also fueled much of the debate over Common Core, when the U.S. Department of Education got involved. Citizens know politicians love power and want control for their own agenda.\n\nBut it is not just the control of our public schools involved here. The same week the directive on bathrooms was sent, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a new rule regarding the implementation of nondiscrimination protections under the Affordable Care Act. It guarantees that transgender people cannot be denied health care by professionals who receive federal funding, and also that it is discriminatory to refuse them access to gender transition-related services. Refuse, and you can lose your funding.\n\nAnd the rule does not include a complete religious exemption for faith-based providers who would prefer not to provide such services due to their beliefs. The rule could also strike down laws in states that ban Medicaid funds from being used in sex-reassignment procedures.\n\nRoger Severino, director of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation, told The Washington Times, \u201cI think it\u2019s another striking example of federal overreach and intrusion, not only into the operations of the states, but into the operations of individual hospitals, physicians, and insurers, who should have the ability to make their own decisions when it comes to controversial treatments.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, the president wants to run the hospitals, doctor\u2019s offices and businesses, too.\n\nBut Obama is not satisfied with just health care and bathrooms; he wants to tell you how to pay and treat your employees, too. We know of his push for an increase in the minimum wage, but now his Department of Labor just issued another new rule guaranteeing overtime rights and raising the threshold to salaried employees earning under $47,476 per year. But the outcome may not be what the liberals and the president expect.\n\nDavid French, a senior vice president for the National Retail Federation, said, \u201cThese rules are a career killer. With the stroke of a pen, the Labor Department is demoting millions of workers.\u201d\n\nSome warn that workers could actually lose out as employers try to avoid the extra costs by converting salaried workers to hourly positions in order to more closely track their time. Others see an increased burden on small businesses having to handle more part-time employees, scheduling and paperwork. Some salaried workers could lose hours\u2014or if they get new overtime pay, have their benefits or bonuses reduced to offset. And if costs do rise, some businesses may just raise prices and pass it on to consumers. So we all pay.\n\nFrench said, \u201cThese regulations are full of false promises. Most of the people impacted by this change will not see any additional pay.\u201d\n\nIn all of these situations, the federal government and President Obama are deciding what is best for our lives and how to run our schools and companies in a display of \u201cabsolute despotism.\u201d\n\nI believe the Declaration of Independence said we were \u201cendowed by [our] Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed\u2014that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has been driving a \u201clong train of abuses and usurpations\u201d that has gone off the tracks, and many people now feel that duty calls to \u201cthrow off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Baton Rouge Business Report", "description": "As President Barack Obama\u00a0approaches his last six months in office, he seems hell-bent on teaming up with his attorney general and staff to issue orders, rules and \u201cguidance\u201d that reach into every area of our lives and businesses\u2014much like a dictator might behave.
