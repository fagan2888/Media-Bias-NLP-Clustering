But scientists have for a while wondered about tapping into ecstasy\u2019s hidden medicinal secret: a potential to be therapeutic for people with mental health issues, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nA new study out of the Imperial College London in England examined the psychedelic drug\u2019s effect on certain parts of the brain, including areas that are linked to memory and emotion, and found that MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) could have a positive effect on anxiety as well as PTSD. \u201cIn healthy volunteers, MDMA seems to lessen the impact of painful memories,\u201d Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, an author of the study and a professor in the department of medicine at Imperial College London, said in a press release. \u201cThis fits with the idea that it could help patients with PTSD revisit their traumatic experiences in psychotherapy without being overwhelmed by negative emotions, but we need to do studies in PTSD patients to see if the drug affects them in the same way.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the study analyzed twenty-five volunteers who experienced brain scans on two separate occasions \u2014 once after taking the drug, and once after taking a placebo, without knowing which they had been given. The study discovered that MDMA diminished activity in an area in the brain linked to emotions, called the limbic system, and also reduced communication between the medial temporal lobe and medial prefrontal cortex, which is associated with emotional control. This decrease in communication and activity in the limbic system was the \u201copposite\u201d to what was seen in anxiety patients, according to the study\u2019s press release.\n\n\u201cWe found that MDMA caused reduced blood flow in regions of the brain linked to emotion and memory,\u201d Carhart-Harris said in the press release. \u201cThese effects may be related to the feelings of euphoria that people experience on the drug.\u201d\n\nMDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy\n\nThis is not the first study to look into ecstasy\u2019s effect on PTSD patients. Last year, researchers in Vancouver studied how the drug could be helpful in medicinal portions. Dr. Andrew Feldmer, a psychologist in Vancouver who helped run the study, notes that the amount of the drug ingested plays a large role in deciding whether or not it has the potential to be therapeutic. \u201cThe very same substance can be poison or medicine, depending on the dosage, depending on the circumstances in which it is ingested,\u201d he said.\n\nOrganizations such as the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) have poured time and funds into researching medicinal benefits of psychedelic drugs like MDMA, as well as marijuana. On its website, MAPS explains that MDMA used for therapeutic purposes is not the same as the ecstasy sold on the streets. \u201cSubstances sold on the street under the name Ecstasy do often contain MDMA, but frequently also contain harmful adulterants,\u201d MAPS writes. \u201cIn laboratory studies, pure MDMA \u2014 but not Ecstasy \u2014 has been proven sufficiently safe for human consumption when taken a limited number of times in moderate doses.\u201d MAPS is planning on undertaking an eight-year, $18.5 million plan to help make MDMA an FDA-approved prescription medication.\n\nIn the meantime, the authors of the Imperial College London study have admitted they will need to do further research on the topic, and to next test actual PTSD patients for more clarified results. \u201cThe findings suggest possible clinical uses of MDMA in treating anxiety and PTSD, but we need to be careful about drawing too many conclusions from a study in healthy volunteers,\u201d David Nutt, a co-author and professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imerial College London, said in the press release. \u201cWe would have to do studies in patients to see if we find the same effects.\u201d\n\nSource: Carhart-Harris R, Murphy K, Leech R, Erritzoe D, Wall M, Ferguson B, et al. \"The Effects of Acutely Administred 3,4- Methylenedioxymethamphetamine on Spontaneous Brain Function in Healthy Volunteers Measured with Arterial Spin Labelling and Blood Oxygen Level-Depending Resting-State Functional Connectivity.\" Journal of Psychiatric Neuroscience and Therapeutics. 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ecstasy, ptsd, psychedelic drugs, molly, mdma, post traumatic stress disorder, ecstasy for ptsd", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study examined the effect of ecstasy on emotion and memory in the brain, and suggests that the psychedelic drug may have therapeutic benefits for PTSD patients.", "title": "How Ecstasy Can Help Overcome Painful Memories", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/treating-ptsd-psychedelics-how-ecstasy-rave-drug-may-help-trauma-patients-overcome-painful-memories", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/18/ecstasy-tablets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study examined the effect of ecstasy on emotion and memory in the brain, and suggests that the psychedelic drug may have therapeutic benefits for PTSD patients.", "title": "How Ecstasy Can Help Overcome Painful Memories", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/treating-ptsd-psychedelics-how-ecstasy-rave-drug-may-help-trauma-patients-overcome-painful-memories", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/18/ecstasy-tablets.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/18/ecstasy-tablets.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-01-18T14:35:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-18T14:35:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study examined the effect of ecstasy on emotion and memory in the brain, and suggests that the psychedelic drug may have therapeutic benefits for PTSD patients."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd76e3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThese effects may be related to the feelings of euphoria that people experience on the drug.\u201dMDMA-Assisted PsychotherapyThis is not the first study to look into ecstasy\u2019s effect on PTSD patients.\nOn its website, MAPS explains that MDMA used for therapeutic purposes is not the same as the ecstasy sold on the streets.\nIn the meantime, the authors of the Imperial College London study have admitted they will need to do further research on the topic, and to next test actual PTSD patients for more clarified results.\nOrganizations such as the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) have poured time and funds into researching medicinal benefits of psychedelic drugs like MDMA, as well as marijuana.\n\u201cSubstances sold on the street under the name Ecstasy do often contain MDMA, but frequently also contain harmful adulterants,\u201d MAPS writes."}
