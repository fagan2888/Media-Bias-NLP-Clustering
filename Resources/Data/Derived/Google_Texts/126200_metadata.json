Merck, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, says there may be up to 10 vials with the glass remnants, although the company has since recalled an entire lot of the vaccine.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement saying between Aug. 20 and Oct. 9, any shipments received by offices and clinics of lot number J007354 should be returned immediately. While administering the vaccine with glass particles, which can potentially fit inside a needle, does not reduce the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness the CDC said people may experience redness and swelling around the injection site. To date, the agency hasn\u2019t received reports of any adverse effects.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect delayed side-effects to occur,\u201d the report states. \u201cIf you or your child recently received HPV vaccination, there is no need to be revaccinated.\u201d\n\nHPV vaccination, much like other forms of vaccination, has received mixed opinions \u2014 many of the opponents cite anecdotal evidence of increased promiscuity among pre-teen daughters, severe side-effects of decreased egg formation, and links to other disorders, most popularly autism. However, many doctors reject the idea that vaccines do harm \u2014 the HPV vaccine in particular, as the virus currently stands as the leading cause of cervical cancer.\n\nAccording to the CDC, some 79 million Americans currently live with HPV. The virus is so common, in fact, nearly all sexually active people will contract it at some point in their lives, the agency reports. Many never know they have the virus, as it may not show symptoms.\n\nDespite the 743,360 vials involved in the lot, which Merck believes could contain glass as a result of a packaging break during the manufacturing process, the CDC said the vaccine itself won\u2019t see any changes.\n\n\u201cMerck is contacting offices or clinics who received vaccine from lot J007354 and providing them with procedures to return any of the vaccine that has not been used,\u201d the agency stated. \u201cThis voluntary recall does not affect the supply of vaccine. Clinicians\u2019 offices who have administered this vaccine do not need to re-vaccinate anyone.\u201d\n\nThe CDC maintains its recommendation that boys and girls receive three doses of the HPV vaccine by the time they reach 11 or 12 years of age.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hpv vaccine, gardasil, gardasil recall 2013, recall of hpv vaccine, hpv vaccination, risk of hpv, cervical cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Drug manufacturer Merck has issued a recall of 750,000 vials of Gardasil, a popular vaccine for HPV.", "title": "HPV Vaccine Gardasil Recalled Over Glass Shards In Vials", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gardasil-recall-2013-hpv-vaccine-pulled-over-threat-glass-shards-vials-265768", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/hpv1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drug manufacturer Merck has issued a recall of 750,000 vials of Gardasil, a popular vaccine for HPV.", "title": "HPV Vaccine Gardasil Recalled Over Glass Shards In Vials", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gardasil-recall-2013-hpv-vaccine-pulled-over-threat-glass-shards-vials-265768", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/hpv1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/hpv1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2013-12-24T14:25:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-24T14:25:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Drug manufacturer Merck has issued a recall of 750,000 vials of Gardasil, a popular vaccine for HPV."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd43a7\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 750,000 vials of the popular human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil have been recalled over a fear of glass shards contained in the vials.\nHowever, many doctors reject the idea that vaccines do harm \u2014 the HPV vaccine in particular, as the virus currently stands as the leading cause of cervical cancer.\nMerck, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, says there may be up to 10 vials with the glass remnants, although the company has since recalled an entire lot of the vaccine.\n\u201cMerck is contacting offices or clinics who received vaccine from lot J007354 and providing them with procedures to return any of the vaccine that has not been used,\u201d the agency stated.\nClinicians\u2019 offices who have administered this vaccine do not need to re-vaccinate anyone.\u201dThe CDC maintains its recommendation that boys and girls receive three doses of the HPV vaccine by the time they reach 11 or 12 years of age."}
