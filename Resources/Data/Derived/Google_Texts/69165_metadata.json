They had come from as far away as Hunt County to the green-domed complex. To \u201cStop the Islamization of America,\u201d as the mother\u2019s hand-drawn sign urged.\n\nA pickup tooted on its way down Esters Road, not the first or last driver to endorse the message. Right behind the truck, a sedan pulled out of the Islamic Center of Irving lot, where afternoon prayers had just finished, and blasted Arabic music as it passed.\n\nTwo men on the sidewalk mocked the song, distorting foreign lyrics into gibberish as the car sped away. Then they huddled in the cold around their cigarettes, guns and flags, waiting for another passer-by to pay attention. It was a strange protest, held at a strange time in a suburb strangely relevant to America\u2019s brand of anti-Islamic politics.\n\n\u201cWe tried to talk to the mosque before we did this, but they wouldn\u2019t return our messages,\u201d said David Wright, dressed in black all the way from his backwards baseball cap to the barrel of his tactical shotgun. \u201cSo here we are.\u201d\n\nWright said he organized the rally in the wake of an Islamic terrorist group\u2019s massacre of Parisian civilians this month. Like millions of Americans, he wants to block Syrian refugees from U.S. shores, lest they replicate the attack here.\n\nBut like a fraction of those millions, he was convinced that Irving\u2019s mosque had established the country\u2019s first Islamic court earlier in the year\u2014a false rumor that started online but grew in popularity after Mayor Beth Van Duyne made it the focus of speeches to Tea Party groups.\n\n\u201cThey shut the illegal court down,\u201d Wright said, incorrectly. \u201cAnd then, they threatened to kill the mayor.\u201d\n\nThus, the guns. A protester with a bandana over his face showed off his AR-15 to traffic. A 20-year-old who wants to join the Army and ban Islam in the United States carried a Remington hunting rifle while his mother held the sign.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re mostly for self-defense or protection,\u201d Wright said, eyeing his 12-gauge. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie. We do want to show force. \u2026 It would be ridiculous to protest Islam without defending ourselves.\u201d\n\nThat sounded a bit ridiculous to David Palmer, a City Council member who wandered down to the protest in sweatpants after a concerned mosque member told him about it.\n\n\u201cDoes it look like there\u2019s any threat here? Nobody\u2019s even close to them,\u201d Palmer said, standing in a parking lot where police cars nearly outnumbered the four or five mosque members who watched the spectacle.\n\n\u201cMy initial impression was they were using them for intimidation,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cI doubt that they\u2019d be happy if some of the Muslim churchgoers here showed up at their Christian church, their Baptist church, their Methodist church tomorrow morning with rifles slung over their shoulders.\u201d\n\nPalmer said the police chief personally warned mosque leaders about the rally. They in turn urged their worshippers to steer clear of the group, which calls itself the Bureau of American Islamic Relations and had recycled some of the signs it took to a Richardson mosque last month, on a national day of protest against Islam.\n\nThe worshippers largely took that advice, ignoring the protest until it broke up after a couple hours. The Muslims in the tiny audience declined to share their opinion \u2014 instead offering praise for freedom of speech and variations on \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\nBut back on the sidewalk, a man who wore a name tag that read \u201cBig Daddy Infidel\u201d and was afraid to give his full name worried about the day he would be forced to use his hunting rifle to take a human life.\n\n\u201cYou know, I hope 10 years from now, we just stood out here and froze to say what we wanted to say, and nothing ever came of it on either side,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI hope the supplies I have in my house, the food and the water and medical supplies, I have to use up in my retirement years.\u201d\n\nBut, he concluded, \u201cThis stuff is among us. People are blind if they don\u2019t think it is.\u201d\n\nUpdate 6 p.m.: The protestors went home at 4 p.m., as planned. The police filed out soon afterwards. Muslim worshippers who streamed in and out of the mosque all afternoon rarely came within 100 feet of them.\n\nI\u2019m working on a full write up, and will update here later this evening.\n\nOriginal report: IRVING \u2014 More than a dozen armed protesters gathered outside the Islamic Center of Irving this afternoon, upset about plans to let in Syrian refugees as well as online rumors of a Sharia court at the mosque.\n\nDressed all in black with a tactical shotgun on his hip, organizer David Wright said the weapons were \u201cmostly for self-protection. But I\u2019m not going to lie. We do want to show force. We\u2019re not sitting ducks.\u201d\n\nWright and his group, the Bureau of American Islamic Relations, had, like most everyone, heard about the massacres in Paris carried out by Islamic terrorists.\n\nHe had also heard \u2014 though the News has seen no evidence of it \u2014 that local Muslims had made death threats against Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne earlier this year after she led the city council to support a state bill aimed at blocking Muslim influence in the U.S. court system.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to think we\u2019re out to kill people or shoot people,\u201d Wright said as dozens of Muslim worshipers and students at the Islamic school pulled out of the parking lot past him, some standing in groups to stare at the protests in wonderment. \u201cIt would be ridiculous to protest Islam without defending ourselves.\u201d\n\nMore protesters were arriving this afternoon and the group planned to be there until 4 p.m. Several police cars are scattered around the area to guard against confrontation although mosque leaders warned their congregation not to engage with the group.\n\nMore details to come.\n\nTwitter: @aviselk", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2FybWVkLXByb3Rlc3RlcnMtc2V0LXVwLW91dHNpZGUtaXNsYW1pYy1jZW50ZXItb2YtaXJ2aW5nLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Avi Selk", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Updated at 7:30 p.m.: New details have been added, and early reports have been merged into a longer article.
