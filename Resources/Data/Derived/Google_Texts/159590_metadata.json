There have been a few near misses, cars pulling out of briefly empty spaces, but there\u2019s always someone waiting for that space, getting there just a second before you. Your car is a cacophony of seasonal torment: The pop music on the radio mercilessly full of holiday cheer, your little one in the car seat with a runny nose, your school-aged kid kicking the back of your seat and your teenager sitting with her legs on the dashboard while she sullenly tunes you out in favor of her iPod and its noise-cancelling earphones.\n\n\u2018Tis the season\u2026\n\nStudy after study shows us that the holidays are stressful for both parents and kids. (Like we needed a study?) People are cranky, irritable, rushed and unruly. All of us await the holidays with great anticipation and high expectations \u2014 family, fun, presents, togetherness. And these experiences are reinforced by the multitude of ads we all see on TV. Yet, for most of us, there are immeasurable stresses.\n\nThe stress can be about almost anything: the guests, the gifts, the recents divorces or deaths.\n\nAnd people with psychiatric disorders often have an even harder time. Depression and substance abuse worsen, and suicide attempts appear to increase. Don\u2019t misunderstand \u2014 the holidays are also wonderful, but we\u2019d be fooling ourselves if we ignored the yearly misery that the holidays can potentially engender.\n\nSo, how do we navigate these frenzied days and stay on an even keel?\n\nIt turns out that there are some things we can do to manage the tough times, and though many of these things seem obvious, it\u2019s their very obviousness that often causes us to forget. Here are 10 tips to remember:\n\n1. Pace Yourself (if possible)\n\nAdults and children rarely do well when they\u2019re rushed. Kids detect the panicked demeanor of their parents, and parents then get irritable when their anxious kids act out. So, don\u2019t do everything at once.\n\nIf you can, spread out the errands and ask your family members to help with the chores and preparations.\n\n2. Pick Your Battles\n\nThe ever-present background frenzy means that most attempts at reprimand will be met with a greater than normal emotional response. If you tell that teenager to take her feet off the dashboard, you might get more than the average earful, and it might not be worth that level of discord. Save your angry moments for the times when things are really going south. Remember that emotions are always raw at the holidays.\n\n3. Plan Some Fun\n\nShopping in a crazed mall with a zillion people all fighting for the latest toy stinks. Remember that you can also shop online, as well as enlist your family to help. Furthermore, some of the best movies come out around the holidays.\n\nThis is the time for incentives (read: gentle bribes). Your school-aged kid will be a lot more malleable if he gets a chance to laugh at a silly holiday flick or a seasonal puppet show. Local libraries arrange readings, schools have fairs \u2014 attend these activities with your kids. It\u2019ll make the necessary shopping more palatable for all of you. And, try to play with each other at home! Playing board games or cards, watching old home videos, doing a crafts project, cooking a cool dessert, or singing together are activities never forgotten. These memories can last forever, whereas toys and other presents might lose their value over time.\n\n4. Talk About The Tough Stuff\n\nThe economy has gotten better, but the holidays still remind families that luxuries they could afford five or ten years ago are sometimes no longer possible. Don\u2019t let that issue go unrecognized. The kids are surely noticing what\u2019s missing, but they may be imagining something much worse than the truth. In a way that makes sense for your child\u2019s age, tell him or her that there is less money but that the same amount of fun, goodwill and love remains. Toddlers and younger children will especially be glad for this discussion \u2014 many young children interpret fewer toys as less love. That\u2019s not spoiled behavior; it\u2019s just the way kids think.\n\nHelping them to remember that they are loved just as much will make a difference. But remember to talk to your kids in a way they can understand. Explaining economic problems to school-aged kids is different than explaining such matters to teens.\n\nAdolescents have a greater understanding of the hardships of financial pressure, and will appreciate the extent to which you involve them in nuanced and sophisticated discussions.\n\n5. Consider Alternative Ways Of Giving\n\nWhile many see the holidays as a time to be excessive (eating, spending), maybe there are alternatives. If your family is experiencing economic hardship, try picking names out of a hat, and having each family member gives another ONE gift of a certain amount. This way there are fewer gifts, but perhaps greater consideration for each present given. This also keeps the meaning of giving front and center. The holidays may be better (and more memorably) spent sharing time together rather than spending too much on too many. Giving TIME is much more precious than giving GIFTS.\n\n6. Be Aware Of Worsening Psychological Suffering\n\nAs we noted, psychiatric symptoms often worsen during the holidays. This makes sense \u2014 just as asthma worsens with dust, psychiatric symptoms worsen with stress. There is, however, an even more insidious stressor with the holidays. People hear nothing but messages that they are supposed to be happy. That message can make individuals with psychiatric conditions suffer even more if they are already not doing well. Help your loved ones to get the extra care they need, and don\u2019t hesitate to call your doctor.Those calls can be life-changing and even life-saving.\n\n7. Don\u2019t Forget Who Is Not There\n\nSomeone is always missing during the holidays. It may seem painful to bring up a lost one, or a family member who cannot make it home, but telling stories, watching old videos and looking at photos is always helpful in bringing the family together. Kids love to hear stories about family members \u2014 where they came from, what they did, what they\u2019re doing now. Don\u2019t forget that physical absence is not the same as emotional absence.\n\n8. Don\u2019t Let The Ghosts Of Holidays Past Haunt You\n\nMany people find the holidays to be incredibly stressful when they painfully recall holidays in the past. This is especially the case for families with old and not easily forgotten family conflicts. Adults might recall the bitter disputes between their parents, fights between parents and grandparents, or battles between parents and kids. Some families have individuals who experienced the holidays under traumatic situations involving domestic violence, alcoholism and substance abuse. In these circumstances, the holidays can come to carry an important and difficult reminder: the loss of an \u201cideal\u201d family, or, at least, one that is peaceful and happy. Kids pick up on these memories like sponges. While painful memories cannot be erased, dwelling on past grievances without resolution is not likely to be productive. It\u2019s far better to acknowledge the pain than to try and make life in the moment better for all.\n\n9. Keep The Focus On Gratitude\n\nEvery year has its ups and downs. The holidays can be an important venue for reflecting on seminal moments in family and personal life and most importantly in relationships. It\u2019s fitting that we traditionally sing \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d New Year\u2019s Eve. This tune never fails to evoke nostalgia. Keeping the focus on gratitude \u2014 how grateful we are to be together regardless of the adversities or losses we have suffered \u2014 is resilience-building. There exists something precious in family conversations about the past, especially if we emphasize the gifts of being together in the here and now.\n\n10. Don\u2019t Aim For Perfection\n\nA sure formula for depression, demoralization and upset is setting standards too high for the holidays. No dinner is perfect; something breaks; someone triggers an old family fight. This is the normal course of things, and it\u2019s beneficial to keep in mind that something will likely not go according to plan rather than letting it catch you off guard. Setting expectations too high for the holidays is certain to upset you and your kids \u2014 they already know that you\u2019re stressed.\n\nThe holidays are not necessarily difficult, but they can be enormously trying. Don\u2019t let the hustle and bustle ruin your time with family and friends. Slow it down. After all, it\u2019s only once a year.\n\nGene Beresin is executive director of The MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
