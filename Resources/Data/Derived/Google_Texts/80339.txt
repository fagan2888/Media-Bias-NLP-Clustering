N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory might be getting tired of answering reporters’ questions.

The governor joked that the state already has enough journalists, in comments he made yesterday at a press conference for an effort to evaluate what skills North Carolina employers need in future workers, according to this account from the Triad Business Journal.

McCrory — who, like almost all politicians, ever, has had a testy relationship with the press — was making a point that the state’s workforce needed more people trained for trade professions, like truck drivers.

“We’ve frankly got enough psychologists and sociologists and political science majors and journalists. With all due respect to journalism, we’ve got enough. We have way too many,” McCrory said to laughter from the audience. He said we have too many lawyers too, adding that some mechanics are making more than lawyers. “And journalists, did I say journalists?” he said for emphasis.

Mark Binker, of WRAL, sidestepped the slight about reporters and vetted McCrory’s claim today about North Carolina had enough psychologists. Turns out North Carolina is one of many states with a shortage of mental health workers, including psychologists.

Journalism is far from a growing profession, of course. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the total number of reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts at 57,600 in 2012 across the nation, and predicts those numbers will contract even more in coming decades.

And more than a few people hold the profession in low regard. More than a quarter of Americans think journalists contribute nothing or very little to society, according to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center.
