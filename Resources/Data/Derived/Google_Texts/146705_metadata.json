REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n3904467\n\nObamacare\u2019s roll-out has been such a debacle that even the president\u2019s largest cheering section can\u2019t help but take notice.\n\n\u201cMedia outlets have struggled to find anyone who\u2019s actually been successful,\u201d CBS News reported. \u201cThe Washington Post even illustrated that sought-after person as a unicorn, and USA Today called the launch an \u201cinexcusable mess\u201d and a \u201cnightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t designed well, it wasn\u2019t implemented well, and it looks like nobody tested it,\u201d a programmer who supports the health care law told the network, adding, \u201cI would be ashamed and embarrassed if my organization delivered something like that.\u201d\n\nThe most famous example of someone who actually successfully navigated the website turned out to have never purchased health insurance through it. \u201cI saw so many numbers in one night, I was tired,\u201d he explained.\n\nFor Obamacare\u2019s most dogged supporters, there can be only one logical explanation. Cue the Beastie Boys: it\u2019s sabotage.\n\nLiberal groups were taking this line long before the 404 errors started popping up, churning out lists like \u201cFive major ways that Republicans are trying to sabotage Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a variant of one of the most annoying arguments of the last five years: Republicans just want Barack Obama to fail.\n\nRush Limbaugh wants him to fail. Mitch McConnell wanted him to be a one-term president. Now Republicans are frantically trying to stop Obamacare, because they know its awesomeness will help millions of people, exposing the country to a Democratic president\u2019s benevolence and wisdom.\n\nThis is a childish way of looking at political disagreements. There was scarcely a Democratic elected official in the country who wanted to see George W. Bush re-elected. I think we can say with confidence that position was etched in stone pretty much from the moment Bush v. Gore was handed down.\n\nJohn Kerry even joked about the need for \u201cregime change\u201d in the United States. Kerry was as successful at securing that regime change as he has so far been in Syria, so perhaps this was a harbinger of what he would be like as secretary of state.\n\nMost Democrats didn\u2019t like Bush\u2019s tax cuts and many wanted to repeal them, especially for the upper earners. This was the case even though the Bush tax cuts, unlike Obamacare, were set to expire.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "W.
