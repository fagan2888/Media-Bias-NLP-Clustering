Counterterrorism worked well in Yemen until the emergency evacuation of embassy and Special Ops forces \u2014 and the loss of millions in arms.\n\nThe president\u2019s half-hearted \u201cwar\u201d on the Islamic State is also a \u201csuccess.\u201d As is ObamaCare, never been working better. Just as he promised.\n\nJobs are finally humming along with unemployment numbers down (because so many gave up looking). The economy actually shriveled in the first quarter, but that\u2019s because of some unexpected phenomenon called winter.\n\nThe Mexican border is secure now because the president says so. Since Bill Clinton was already named the first black president, the actual first black president claims he\u2019s given such staunch support to Israel that he\u2019s in reality the first Jewish president.\n\nOy vey! What gives with this guy? If Obama says something, it\u2019s true. He\u2019s Obi-wan Kenobi employing The Force: \u201cThese are not the droids you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nAt his news conference closing the G-7 meeting Monday, Obama declared that ObamaCare\u2019s costs \u201chave come in substantially lower than even our estimates about how much it would cost. \u2026 None of the predictions about how this wouldn\u2019t work have come to pass.\u201d\n\nEveryone here keep the doctor they liked? Anyone\u2019s hours cut to part-time? Premiums steady? Everyone get their promised $2,500 health care savings?\n\nOn IS, Obama admitted that nine months after announcing his hastily written strategy to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d the terrorist army, \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have a complete strategy.\u201d This is Obama speaking, so of course, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault: The Iraqis for not being trained fast enough.\n\nNothing prevents Obama aides from declaring his strategy a \u201csuccess,\u201d even as Ramadi fell. That\u2019s a mere \u201csetback,\u201d as in the Mosul setback and the Fallujah setback. We\u2019re setbacking ourselves to victory.\n\nThe setbacks occur because IS is \u201cnimble, and they\u2019re aggressive, and they\u2019re opportunistic.\u201d No kidding. Wait till these JV guys play varsity come fall.\n\nAs opposed to, say, the brave pilots who venture out hunting IS targets with no ground support, then must circle an hour or so awaiting White House permission to attack each target. Three of four U.S. planes return with ordnance undropped.\n\nOr take Obama\u2019s illegal executive order strategy on illegal immigration. Those darned federal judges pestering the imperial president to a halt. If only they understood the Constitution as well as the part-time constitutional law lecturer who clearly says they\u2019re legal.\n\nA promising politician back in 2008 accurately spoke out on a major political affliction. Americans, he said, \u201care tired of hearing promises made and 10-point plans proposed in the heat of a campaign only to have nothing change.\u201d\n\nThat was Obama himself, whose disconnected, empty blather has now become a major American affliction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leadership: President Obama was in Germany the last few days, but too many of his recent remarks sound like he's been in high orbit \u2014 around another", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Leadership: President Obama was in Germany the last few days, but too many of his recent remarks sound like he\u2019s been in high orbit \u2014 around another planet.
