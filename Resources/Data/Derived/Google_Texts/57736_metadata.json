Hearing this, awaiting a public execution, a battalion of eager Babylonians in the hotel ballroom cluck and stomp and clap. But the Reverend Al Sharpton stops them short. \u201cHe has the right,\u201d says this country\u2019s go-to raja of race. \u201cAnd he has the ability to be respected by a community that he rose from.\u201d\n\nThe setting is a Sheraton on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. The audience is the annual conclave of Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, a coming-together of thousands of African-American achievers, apostles and agitators, who range from chiefs of police and big-city mayors to street-level organizers and the daughters of Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King.\n\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong with America,\u201d says Sharpton, as some in the audience jeer at his invited guest. \u201cI do not expect people to agree with me, even though I\u2019m always right.\u201d\n\nWith this as a backdrop, the plenary session offers tepid applause as Dr. Benjamin Solomon Carson, Sr., M.D.\u2014eminent pediatric neurosurgeon, creationist and Seventh-Day Adventist, champion of juvenile literacy and eponym of the Carson Scholars Fund and Carson Reading Rooms nationwide, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, steady-handed separator of Siamese twins, subject of a biographical movie starring Cuba Gooding, Jr., and (still unofficial) candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States in 2016\u2014rises to address an audience that is as black as he is.\n\n\u201cThe person who has the most to do with your life is you,\u201d the physician declares, puncturing with a single phrase the conference\u2019s perennial focus on homicidal policemen, employment discrimination, \u201cthe school-to-jail pipeline,\u201d and systemic racism as the engines of inner-city poverty, illiteracy, addiction, rage and hopelessness. \u201cWe need to talk about stuff we don\u2019t talk about,\u201d he goes on. \u201cWe need to talk about the fact that 73 per cent of our babies are born out of wedlock, and that baby is four times as likely to grow up in poverty. Unless we talk about it, nobody else is going to talk about it.\u201d\n\nThe room goes silent.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Ben Carson doesn\u2019t love black people,\u2019 \u201d the surgeon chides the (nearly) all-black crowd. \u201cWhat a bunch of crap that is.\u201d\n\nIf Carson, former director of pediatric neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, is to be the Republican nominee in 2016\u2014and if he is to defeat Hillary Clinton next November to become the second consecutive African-American president of the United States\u2014it is because of a speech he gave 26 months ago with President Barack Obama sitting just two chairs away.\n\nRelated reading: Dirty, viral tricks: The 2016 U.S. election is already getting ugly\n\nThis was at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Carson, whose Medal of Freedom was presented by George W. Bush in 2008 in recognition of his extraordinary medical career, tore into the sitting President\u2019s Affordable Care Act, in particular, and into the liberal agenda in general (\u201cPeople are afraid to say Merry Christmas at Christmastime\u201d), with such in-your-face, truth-to-power effrontery that he instantly became a favourite son of the faith-and-firearms right.\n\nSuddenly, Carson, who never has held or run for elective office, was scoring highly in various \u201cstraw polls\u201d far in advance of the actual 2016 caucuses and primaries. He was second (to Mitt Romney, who no longer is running) in last fall\u2019s Bloomberg-Des Moines Register presidential survey, won a clear victory at the Polk County Republican dinner in Des Moines and captured the straw poll at the Western Conservative summit in Denver.\n\nBut since his explosive coming-out, Carson has been uttering opinions that have inflamed the ire of the left-wing media while enchanting many of his brothers and sisters in Christ.\n\nTo wit: a comparison of the rag-tag insurgents who won the American Revolution with the barbaric decapitators of Islamic State: \u201cThey got the wrong philosophy, but they\u2019re willing to die for what they believe, while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness.\u201d\n\nAnd: \u201cYou know Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And it is . . . slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.\u201d And: saying in the presence of a reporter from GQ that Obama\u2019s neat attire and clean image makes him appear \u201clike most psychopaths.\u201d And: declaring that homosexuality must be a matter of choice, because so many people \u201cgo into prison straight\u2014and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople say that if you don\u2019t want them to be married, then you hate them,\u201d Carson counterpunches at the Sharpton confab. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care what any man says. I care what God says.\u201d\n\nUnluckily for Carson, he is far from the only Bible-quoting, gun-toting Republican in the field. In fact, there are more than a dozen of them. Nearly all the others come to the fray with extensive senatorial (Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham) or gubernatorial (Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee) experience. All are, or profess to be, fervent Christians.\n\nThe last man to be elected president without previous service in state or federal government was Dwight Eisenhower\u2014and all Ike did before throwing his five-starred hat into the ring in 1952 was command the Allied armies against Adolf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich. Going all the way back to George Washington himself, no one has become the U.S. president without previously having been a state governor, member of Congress, military commander or cabinet secretary.\n\nIn March, Carson\u2019s \u201cexploratory committee\u201d gathered US$2,143,945 from 40,130 donors, an average of $53 apiece. But Cruz, the Calgarian-Texan firebrand and filibusterer, pulled in $31 million in a single weekend after making his formal declaration of candidacy. And Bush, the former governor of Florida, already has tens of millions banked for the attack-ad demolition of his primary rivals and, later, for the destruction of the wife of the man who defeated his own father\u2019s bid for a second term back in 1992. (Carson will make his own formal declaration in early May.)\n\nFor all his honours and clinical reputation, Carson is not even the only medical man in the Republican race. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has been polling within range of the inevitable Hillary herself in some recent swing-state surveys, is an ophthalmologist who can parry Carson\u2019s uplifting tales of safely detaching conjoined twins with his own stories of helping the blind to see. One of Sen. Paul\u2019s supporting groups, subtly enough, is named Vision4America.\n\nRelated reading: Which Americans does Hillary Clinton love most?\n\nWhat separates Carson from the herd at this early stage is his colour (he is the only African-American in the Republican field), his temperate bedside manner, his distance from state-house cat-fighting and Washington gridlock, and the retro-viral video of that insolent (to the left) or courageous (to the right) anti-Obama speech that he made in 2013 with Obama himself sitting just an arm\u2019s length away.\n\n\u201cWhen he did the Prayer Breakfast, I thought, \u2018That\u2019s who he is,\u2019 \u201d says Dr. George Jallo, Carson\u2019s long-time collaborator in pediatric neurosurgery at Hopkins. \u201cHe is always calm. I don\u2019t think I have ever seen him get upset. He is not an emotional person. He\u2019s a very straightforward person. What his beliefs are is what you see.\u201d\n\nJallo is asked: \u201cCould you envision him as president of the United States?\u201d He replies: \u201cI don\u2019t follow politics. I still think of him as a great neurosurgeon.\u201d\n\nIn New York, as soft-spoken, measured and self-controlled as always\u2014in contrast to Sharpton\u2019s thunder and lightning\u2014Carson spins a life story so extraordinary, it seems to belong in the Pentateuch.\n\nIt begins 63 years ago in a Detroit family that collapsed when Mom found out that Dad had another wife and children across town, and continues in Boston, where the mother (herself one of 24 children; married off at the age of 13) checks in and out of mental institutions. It returns to the Motor City as young Benjamin (\u201cthe class dummy\u201d) veers toward indolence and anger, then sees him spared and protected (like Shadrach; like Daniel in the lions\u2019 den) by a series of deus ex machina interventions: a $10 bill lying on a sidewalk when he is a bankrupt freshman at Yale; seeing the answers to a chemistry exam appear in a dream; a belt buckle blunting a knife thrust to the belly of his best friend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure when I actually turned to God,\u201d Carson writes in his bestselling autobiography, Gifted Hands, one of his eight books. \u201cI do know that when I was 14, I finally understood how God can change us.\u201d\n\nBy 2014, respondents to a Gallup poll had elevated Carson to No. 6 on a list of the world\u2019s most admired men, behind Obama, Pope Francis, Rev. Billy Graham, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, but ahead of Stephen Hawking, Benjamin Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201c \u2018Carson\u2019s a strange guy,\u2019 \u201d he says of himself in Manhattan, mocking his critics. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s a neurosurgeon, but he doesn\u2019t believe in science.\u2019 That\u2019s a bunch of crap. I don\u2019t believe in something from nothing. I don\u2019t believe that everything came from the Big Bang fully formed. People say: \u2018Carson believes the world is only 6,000 years old.\u2019 I never said I believed that. What I said is that God is God, and he can create a world as old as he wants it to be . . . That\u2019s the wonderful thing about God. You don\u2019t have to have a Ph.D. to talk to him.\u201d\n\nIt is not Sharpton and his devotees who are going to crown or not crown Carson at the Republican national convention in Cleveland next summer. It is the white-bred, white-bread Christians of the Hawkeye State of Iowa, and the granite-eyed old women and men of the mountains of New Hampshire who hold the key primary cards.\n\nThey are voters such as a retired hospital food-service worker from Merrimack, N.H., named Pamela Skovira, who attended a meet-and-greet with Carson last week, then told this reporter that \u201che\u2019s not a politician, for one thing, and he still knows right from wrong, while everybody else in politics these days doesn\u2019t seem to be able to figure that out.\u201d Skovira, who supported Mitt Romney in 2012, looks around her country now and sees that \u201ceverything that could go wrong is going wrong. Obama has taken us down such a bad trail, we don\u2019t have anybody\u2019s respect.\u201d\n\nCarson, on the other hand, \u201chas the ideals and the morals and the ethics that I value, and he\u2019s not afraid to speak up for them. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s a doctor. It\u2019s his upbringing and his ethics.\u201d\n\nAt the convention of the National Action Network, Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, N.J., is asked about Carson as a possible president and Baraka snaps, \u201cHe\u2019s a fine doctor.\u201d The same question is put to the congressman from Harlem, Charlie Rangel, and the 84-year-old, much pleased with himself, beams back: \u201cI\u2019m glad his doctorate is in medicine and not in politics.\u201d\n\nEven one of the few African-American Republicans in the crowd is hesitant about backing Carson all the way to the Oval Office. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d says Neill Franklin, a retired senior Maryland state police officer who now heads an organization dedicated to opposing \u201cthe wasteful futilities and harms of our current drug policies.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be gentle, or anything like that, and I\u2019m not saying that I could never support Ben Carson. But even though he came up from an impoverished background, I somehow feel that he is a little removed from some of the communities that need our social programs to get to a place where they can thrive. He didn\u2019t raise himself up. He had a very strong mother.\u201d\n\nFranklin is asked: \u201cDo you mean that you wouldn\u2019t vote for him just because you both are black?\u201d and he replies, \u201cI do see race as one of the important things, but, when it comes to choosing a president, you have to put race aside. Right now, I\u2019d have to go for Rand Paul.\u201d\n\nIt is the rise of Obama in reverse: In 2016, the Republican Party could nominate an African-American for whom African-Americans will not vote. \u201cIn the black community, we don\u2019t need to wait for other people to help us,\u201d Carson declares to the people of Babylon.\n\n\u201cDr. Carson, you may not be my choice for president,\u201d Sharpton retorts to a chortling crowd, \u201cbut if I ever need surgery, you\u2019re my man.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "How Ben Carson\u2014an African-American neurosurgeon with no political experience\u2014become a top candidate for the Republican nomination for president", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Macleans.ca", "description": "How Ben Carson\u2014an African-American neurosurgeon with no political experience\u2014become a top candidate for the Republican nomination for president", "title": "How a neurosurgeon could save the Republican Party", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MAC17_DRCARSON_FEATURE01.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-13T12:49:18+00:00", "url": "http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ben-carson-the-ultimate-outsider-who-could-save-the-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Macleans.ca", "image": {"src": "http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MAC17_DRCARSON_FEATURE01.jpg"}, "description": "How Ben Carson\u2014an African-American neurosurgeon with no political experience\u2014become a top candidate for the Republican nomination for president", "card": "summary", "title": "How a neurosurgeon could save the Republican Party"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-04-26T21:17:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-13T12:49:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0d8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe need to talk about stuff we don\u2019t talk about,\u201d he goes on.\nI care what God says.\u201dUnluckily for Carson, he is far from the only Bible-quoting, gun-toting Republican in the field.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure when I actually turned to God,\u201d Carson writes in his bestselling autobiography, Gifted Hands, one of his eight books.\nFor all his honours and clinical reputation, Carson is not even the only medical man in the Republican race.\nWhat I said is that God is God, and he can create a world as old as he wants it to be ."}
