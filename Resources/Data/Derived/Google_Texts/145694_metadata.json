There are three secrecy levels above it.\n\nIn another development, German weekly Der Spiegel, which has been at the forefront of revelations about U.S. spying in Germany, said it has filed a criminal complaint alleging that it was the victim of spying.\n\nThe magazine said the criminal complaint, filed with the Federal Prosecutors Office, is based on a classified German government document it obtained, which it claims shows that the CIA was monitoring its communication with senior officials.\n\nIt said the complaint is initially directed against \u201cunknown persons\u201d but that it hopes to compel the government to provide further information that would identify those it claims broke German laws on espionage and communications privacy.\n\n\u2022 Frank Jordans contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Germany's foreign minister said Friday that new allegations of U.S. eavesdropping on senior German government officials' telephones need to be clarified \"as quickly as possible\" and that he hoped Washington would be forthcoming with information.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Germany\u2019s foreign minister said Friday that new allegations of U.S. eavesdropping on senior German government officials\u2019 telephones need to be clarified \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d and that he hoped Washington would be forthcoming with information.", "title": "Germany wants quick clarification of new NSA spy allegations", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/3/germany-wants-quick-clarification-of-new-nsa-spy-a/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/08/b3cc83f89a58d119780f6a70670011e9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/08/b3cc83f89a58d119780f6a70670011e9.jpg", "description": "Germany's foreign minister said Friday that new allegations of U.S. eavesdropping on senior German government officials' telephones need to be clarified \"as quickly as possible\" and that he hoped Wash", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Germany wants quick clarification of new NSA spy allegations"}, "Author": "David Rising", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, German Government, Germany, Angela Merkel, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0aee\"", "article_summary": "BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s foreign minister said Friday that new allegations of U.S. eavesdropping on senior German government officials\u2019 telephones need to be clarified \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d and that he hoped Washington would be forthcoming with information.\nAsked about his use of the word \u201cspying attack,\u201d Seibert said the term was accurate for the situation described in the press reports.\nMerkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert said Friday that the government was examining the information in the reports and assessing the security of its communications.\nThe latest list, which was partially redacted, reportedly contained phone and fax numbers used by the German economy and finance ministries, among others.\n\u201cI hope the Americans will be helpful in this clarification,\u201d he told reporters."}
