That captures their imagination as an authentic American tale: the mogul versus the Socialist Vermont senator with a Brooklyn accent. That's the story they long to write and tell.\n\nThe media's heart had several suitors going into the 2016 cycle, and it has flirted with a few darlings, contenders and a drop-out, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The media's heart swore never again to fall for a Texas governor, as it did in 2000 with George W. Bush.

Dignity is her strong suit. The media fancied presidential hopeful Barack Obama in 2008, which showed in the heartland primary field reports. The press glee was palpable when a tall, handsome star from Illinois won the Iowa caucuses, the first race. How romantic. We were swept away.\n\nBefore the first vote is cast in 2016, the heart of the media is now practically permafrost when it comes to Hillary, no matter how much laughing, clapping and dancing she does on the \"Ellen\" show to show how relatable she is, really, folks. The private e-mail server story has proved a perfect storm of seizing upon a true flaw, Clinton's penchant for secrecy, and stoking it with the media's worst fears about her.\n\n\n\n[READ: The Lowest Bar]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Mindless Media Wants Trump and Sanders in 2016, Not Clinton", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "In our hearts, we want more Trump and Sanders and less Clinton.", "title": "Our Mindless Media", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/jamie-stiehm/2015/09/14/mindless-media-wants-trump-and-sanders-in-2016-not-clinton", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/b8/0ca606b80a2619ebc3efd5c6df63ad/media:d54fce57e19e4bbf8e2523d1ac3822f6DEM2016Sanders.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In our hearts, we want more Trump and Sanders and less Clinton.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Mindless Media Wants Trump and Sanders in 2016, Not Clinton"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 14, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jamie Stiehm,TJS,media,2016 presidential election,Clinton, Hillary,Bush, Jeb,Walker, Scott,Sanders, Bernie,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "In our hearts, we want more Trump and Sanders and less Clinton."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb727\"", "article_summary": "It's apparent the political media is champing for a showdown between brash Donald Trump and underdog Bernie Sanders.\nThe media's heart had several suitors going into the 2016 cycle, and it has flirted with a few darlings, contenders and a drop-out, Texas Gov.\nThe media's heart swore never again to fall for a Texas governor, as it did in 2000 with George W.
