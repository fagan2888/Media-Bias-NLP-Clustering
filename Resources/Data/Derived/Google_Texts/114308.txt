Clark, SD

Now in its sixth year, a deer hunt near Clark is doing what it can to increase access and awareness for kids with disabilities.

The annual event provides a hunting trip free of charge to the kids. And it's reaching its goals.

You might as well consider this hunting lodge near Clark booked every year in the foreseeable future on this opening weekend of the youth deer hunting season.

"You know we just want to show these kids a good time so they can get out and enjoy the outdoors just like every other kid," Dean Rasmussen said.

Volunteers make whatever arrangements they need to make sure kids overcome any barriers their disabilities might present.

Felicia Charging Elk went hunting for her first time ever today.

Erich Schaffhauser: If it wasn't for the PDR Youth Hunt, do you think you would have gone?

Felicia Charging Elk: I don't think so.

Through its six years the hunt has raised awareness even in Pierre. Because of his disability, a kid needed help from his dad to shoot a gun. So legislators amended a law making that legal, even during the youth season.

Don Jones has noticed that increased awareness the hunt has brought. He was so thankful after his daughter participated last year, he started making bracelets as a fundraiser for the event.

"With Michaela my daughter we've seen that confidence just boost, just skyrocket from events like this," Don Jones said.

And participants can list other perks it brings too. And this hunt's goal is to see any kid have access to them.

"Cause it's a lot of fun, get to spend time with Dean, my dad and all the other guys," Austin Clark said.

Organizers want to see that repeated kid after kid, year after year. If you plan to use this hunting lodge near Clark for anything else on this September weekend, good luck.

The event started last night and goes through tomorrow. Donations from multiple sources make it possible.
