Inspira saw an opportunity to improve scores measuring noise in their hospitals, which were affected in part by a high volume of overhead pages. By implementing Practice Unite\u2019s communications solution, Inspira was able to eliminate this disturbance to patients. The solution was first deployed at its Vineland location. Overhead pages were cut from 150 a day to only 3 overnight! Patient satisfaction scores for quietness increased by 26 percent as compared to the prior twelve months. This solution was subsequently deployed at its other locations and initial scores are also trending upwards.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, patient satisfaction has become even more important. Having a low patient satisfaction or HCAHPS scores can directly impact the financial operations of a healthcare organization as well as its reputation in the community. Over the last year, Inspira\u2019s IT team has been a key part of the healthcare systems Quiet Hospital Initiative that will help to create a better experience for patients in its hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe always strive to provide a great patient experience at Inspira,\u201d said Tom Pacek, chief information officer, Inspira Health Network. \u201cIt was clear that we needed to reduce the number of overhead pages in our three main facilities. The problem was that our nurses had become dependent on this system to reach physicians. Practice Unite, Futura Mobility and Pursuit Healthcare worked with our IT team to design an innovative solution that has allowed us to all but eliminate overhead paging. This made an immediate impact that is already showing up as increased HCAHPS scores.\u201d\n\nThe Practice Unite solution makes it easy for nurses to reach physicians. They send a secure text from their desktop to a secure mobile app on the physician\u2019s phone. The physicians call the nurses back directly by clicking on the message which routes automatically to the nurses at their assigned extension. These extensions can change on a daily basis. The Practice Unite app makes it simple for the nurse to change this daily.\n\n\u201cThe impressive increase in patient satisfaction survey results that Inspira has experienced is a direct result of the innovation and creative implementation of our solutions that can be truly customized to meet different hospital, physician and patient needs,\u201d said Adam Turinas, chief executive officer, Practice Unite. \u201cThis initiative is part of a long-term roadmap with Inspira to help them improve a wide range of workflow challenges that will help Inspira with its transition to the new model of Value-based care.\u201d\n\nAbout Practice Unite\u00ae\n\nPractice Unite is designed to be a healthcare organization\u2019s platform for HIPAA-compliant mobile communication and collaboration applications.
