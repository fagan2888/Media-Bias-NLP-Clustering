PITTSBURGH — One western Pennsylvania county is cutting off benefits to same-sex partners of its employees unless they’re married.

Allegheny County officials say they’re changing the policy now that a federal judge has allowed same-sex couples to marry in Pennsylvania. The county once limited benefits to those married to county employees, but made an exception years ago for unmarried same-sex partners when they couldn’t marry.

Now that both homosexual and heterosexual couples can marry, the county is limiting benefits only to spouses of employees.

The county has 11 employees with same-sex partners receiving benefits. Those benefits will be terminated Aug. 1, and those people can apply for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act championed by President Barack Obama.

Pittsburgh, the county seat, offers benefits to spouses and all unmarried domestic partners.
