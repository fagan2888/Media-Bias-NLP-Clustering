Bernie Sanders of Vermont continued to dog her with victories in caucuses in Utah and Idaho.\n\nClinton\u2019s win by 20 percentage points in delegate rich Arizona showed once again her mastery over Sanders in more racially diverse states. It also added to the narrative that it would be virtually impossible for the liberal senator to overcome Clinton\u2019s sizeable lead in the overall delegate race.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Attacks on Clinton\u2019s Foreign Policy Could Help Trump\n\nBut Sanders declared this week during an appearance on CNN, \u201cI\u2019m not a quitter.\u201d And with more caucuses and primaries looming in states receptive to Sanders\u2019s populist themes of income equality and the evils of Wall Street and major trade agreements, Sanders appears determined to fight Clinton all the way to the Democratic national convention this summer.\n\nThe caucuses in Utah and Idaho were swamped by huge turnouts of Democrats, a fact noted by Sanders in arguing that his campaign is sparking far more excitement and interest among young people and working class Americans than Clinton\u2019s is. He is convinced that party leaders will eventually conclude that he would be the stronger nominee to take on Republican Donald Trump in the general election \u2013 especially with nagging concerns over an FBI investigation of Clinton\u2019s handling of emails at the State Department.\n\nYet in the wake of the terrorist bombings in Brussels Monday that startled Europe and swiftly altered the rhetoric on the campaign trail in the U.S., Sanders may find it more difficult to challenge Clinton on issues of national security and combating terrorism -- issued that once again are front and center in the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen we began this campaign we talked about a need for millions of people to become involved in the political process,\u201d Sanders told a crowd of supporters in San Diego late Tuesday. \u201cTonight in Utah, tonight in Idaho, and tonight in Arizona there are record-breaking turnouts.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump vs. Clinton\u2014Who Has the \u2018Steady Hands\u2019 to Manage the Mideast?\n\nArizona, with 75 Democratic delegates at stake, was the biggest contest of the night and Clinton described her big victory over Sanders as \u201cexciting\u201d and rewarding. But she quickly turned her attention back to the tragedy in Belgium \u2013 and has plans to deliver a major address on terrorism at Stanford University today.\n\n\u201cWe live in a complex world,\u201d she said in Seattle. \u201cWe need leadership that is strong, smart and above all steady.\u201d The former secretary of state and New York senator proclaimed herself the \u201cmost ready\u201d to assume the mantle of commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nSanders won big over Clinton in Utah and Idaho by margins of 78 percent to 80 percent, and probably picked up a net of 20 delegates throughout the night in the three contests. But while his strong showings in Utah and Idaho gave Sanders an important boost after losing five states including Florida and Ohio to Clinton last week, it does little to alter Clinton\u2019s steady march towards the nomination.\n\nAccording to CNN, by the end of the night Clinton had amassed 1,711 delegates, including both pledged and \u201csuper\u201d delegates, while Sanders\u2019s tally stood at 939. Clinton is more than half way to the magic number of 2,383 delegates needed to claim the party\u2019s nomination.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It was another night of split decisions for the Democrats Tuesday as former Secretary", "title": "With Arizona Win, Clinton Needs a Little More Than 600 Delegates to Clinch It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Arizona-Win-Clinton-Needs-Little-More-600-Delegates-Clinch-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/clinton_celebration.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Arizona-Win-Clinton-Needs-Little-More-600-Delegates-Clinch-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/clinton_celebration.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It was another night of split decisions for the Democrats Tuesday as former Secretary", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "According to CNN, by the end of the night Clinton had amassed 1,711 delegates, including both pledged and \u201csuper\u201d delegates, while Sanders\u2019s tally stood at 939.\n\u201cTonight in Utah, tonight in Idaho, and tonight in Arizona there are record-breaking turnouts.\u201dRelated: Trump vs. Clinton\u2014Who Has the \u2018Steady Hands\u2019 to Manage the Mideast?\nClinton\u2019s win by 20 percentage points in delegate rich Arizona showed once again her mastery over Sanders in more racially diverse states.\nClinton is more than half way to the magic number of 2,383 delegates needed to claim the party\u2019s nomination.\nArizona, with 75 Democratic delegates at stake, was the biggest contest of the night and Clinton described her big victory over Sanders as \u201cexciting\u201d and rewarding."}
