The trust fund has been financed by receipts from an18.4 cents per gallon gas tax and a 24.4 cents per gallon diesel fuel tax. More recently, revenues have seriously lagged behind highway project expenditures and the government has had to shift money from other accounts to keep the fund solvent.\n\nRelated: Why You\u2019ll Need a Tank to Drive America\u2019s Highways\n\nAfter this year\u2019s terrible winter, some state and local governments have already begun pulling back on plans for critical road repairs. Things could get worse if Congress and the Obama administration allow a four-year transportation funding authorization law to expire this fall without a replacement.\n\n\u201cThe moment is dire,\u201d Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said at a Bloomberg Government event Tuesday. He said the trust fund \u201cis quickly running toward insolvency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing states slowing down their programs of work,\u201d Foxx also told D.C. radio station WTOP. \u201cBy June or July, we\u2019ll start to see states slowing down some ... contracts [for] the fall. We have 700,000 jobs that are going to be at risk. Obviously, we\u2019re losing the opportunities to create the connections and the safety that Americans count on in their road systems.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Floats Interstate Toll Option to Fund Road Repair\n\nAs just one example, Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois recently announced a six-year transportation plan to complete dozens of key projects. But because the plan anticipates using $6.99 billion in federal funding to match $1.16 billion in state funding and $450 million in local funding, projects may not make it off the drawing board without the certainty of that federal contribution, according to a new study by Transportation for America, an alliance of elected, business and civic leaders.\n\nRecently, Foxx visited the site of a bridge replacement and corridor improvement in the Quad Cities on the border of Iowa and Illinois. The project could face serious delays if new work can\u2019t begin next year.\n\nLawmakers are grappling with a Sept. 30 deadline for reauthorizing the government\u2019s surface transportation bill, which provides funding for road and transit projects nationwide. A Senate panel this week unveiled bipartisan legislation that would authorize six years of highway programs acting with construction projects at risk of slowing months before the November mid-term congressional elections.\n\nRelated: A Glimmer of Hope for Ending Highway Construction Crisis\n\nThe bill, drafted by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and other members, would provide the current level of spending plus inflation. However, it doesn\u2019t address how precisely to raise the revenue \u2013 a matter that will be left until later for congressional tax-writers and that threatens the proposal\u2019s chances of making it into law.\n\nMeanwhile, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA) hasn\u2019t yet offered his version of the legislation.\n\nThe non-partisan Congressional Budget Office told senators recently they would have to either increase the federal gas tax by 10 or 15 cents per gallon \u2013 a nonstarter in an election year \u2013 or find between $13 billion and $18 billion per year from other sources to maintain current infrastructure spending projects.\n\nDuring his Bloomberg appearance yesterday, Foxx said that temporarily boosting U.S. taxes on companies\u2019 overseas earnings is the most feasible way to provide the additional funding needed to rebuild aging highways and mass transit systems.\n\nPresident Obama proposed a four-year, $302 billion bill that would raise $150 billion through taxes on overseas earnings and by closing loopholes that would normally let companies defer those obligations.\n\nRelated: Obama Looks to Tax Reform to Save America\u2019s Highways\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) so far has declined to take a position on the funding source. He said he was against passing a short-term extension by the Sept. 30 deadline for reauthorizing the current surface transportation-funding bill. \u201cIt would be a tragic mistake to let highway funding become another stop-and-go extender,\u201d Wyden said.\n\n\u201cRight now our proposal is the best way to thread the needle and get something done,\u201d Foxx said of Obama\u2019s overseas earnings tax plan.\n\nIn another bid to highlight the looming highway funding crisis, Obama will be in New York on Wednesday to discuss U.S. infrastructure needs near the 58-year-old Tappan Zee Bridge, which connects Westchester and Rockland counties, north of Manhattan, and was designed to last just 50 years. A $3.9 billion replacement is currently in the works.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration warned on Tuesday that failure to head off a threatened bankruptcy of the federal Highway Trust Fund this summer could mean a delay in about 112,000 roadway projects and 5,600 transit projects \u2013 and cost as many as 700,000 construction jobs over the coming year.", "title": "700,000 Jobs at Risk If Highway Trust Fund Falters", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/14/700000-Jobs-Risk-If-Highway-Trust-Fund-Falters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03202012_highway_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/14/700000-Jobs-Risk-If-Highway-Trust-Fund-Falters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03202012_highway_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Obama administration warned on Tuesday that failure to head off a threatened bankruptcy of the federal Highway Trust Fund this summer could mean a delay in about 112,000 roadway projects and 5,600 transit projects \u2013 and cost as many as 700,000 construction jobs over the coming year.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcecfe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt would be a tragic mistake to let highway funding become another stop-and-go extender,\u201d Wyden said.\nThings could get worse if Congress and the Obama administration allow a four-year transportation funding authorization law to expire this fall without a replacement.\nThe trust fund has been financed by receipts from an18.4 cents per gallon gas tax and a 24.4 cents per gallon diesel fuel tax.\nMore recently, revenues have seriously lagged behind highway project expenditures and the government has had to shift money from other accounts to keep the fund solvent.\nLawmakers are grappling with a Sept. 30 deadline for reauthorizing the government\u2019s surface transportation bill, which provides funding for road and transit projects nationwide."}
