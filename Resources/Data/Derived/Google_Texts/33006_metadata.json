He will face Mark Fisher in the Sept. 9 primary.\n\nThe Editorial Board of MassLive.com and The Republican will meet with Baker. We want to know what questions you have for the candidate. Please file your questions in the comments section below or email us directly at letters@repub.com.\n\nFollowing is background about him largely taken from his campaign website:\n\nSecretary of Administration and Finance under former governors William Weld and A. Paul Cellucci, and former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Baker helped turn a billion-dollar deficit into a surplus, create a half million jobs, and enact education reforms. He oversaw a number of cost-saving reforms, modernizing state government and making it more efficient. He received the Distinguished Service Award from the National Governor\u2019s Association in 1998.\n\nHe has spent the past three years as an entrepreneur in residence at the venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners.\n\nRaised in Needham, Baker attended public schools and is a graduate of Harvard College. He earned an MBA from Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.\n\nHe has proposed a series of economic initiatives aimed at increasing opportunity for Massachusetts workers with a focus on growing small businesses, especially in regions that are suffering from economic stagnation and high unemployment. The initiatives include increasing the minimum wage and boosting the Commonwealth\u2019s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Baker said he will also eliminate burdensome regulations, and provide tax credits for small businesses to offset the impact of raising the minimum wage.\n\nHe promises not to raise taxes and to reform the state tax code that he calls \u201coverly complicated \u2013 benefiting only special interests while harming workers, families, and small businesses.\u201d\n\nHe opposes the automatic gas tax hike, whose repeal will appear on the November ballot as a referendum question.\n\nHe is in favor of welfare reform.\n\nOn education, he looks to the state\u2019s intervention in the Lawrence School District as a model of how to improve the lowest performing schools and districts. He favors increasing the number of charter schools and removing restrictions on the number of students who can attend them in the lowest performing districts.\n\nHe promises to make higher education more affordable and better connect school to employment.\n\nIn addition, Baker promises to \u201cprotect local aid as his top priority, and will increase it by at least as much as any increase in overall state revenue. Equally important, he will ensure the state never imposes unfunded mandates on cities and towns and that local officials always have a seat at the table on issues affecting them. Charlie will also strive to improve the multi-year budgeting process for aid to municipalities, so that funding is more predictable and aid is never held hostage by Beacon Hill.\u201d\n\nBaker wants to implement \u201ca series of reforms aimed at protecting victims and their children in abusive homes, as well as getting tough on offenders. The plan stiffens penalties for abusers, delivers more support for victims and empowers victims to prevent attacks.\u201d\n\nHe favors \u201ca comprehensive solution\u201d to battle the opioid abuse problem that \u201cwill involve increasing resources for treatment, as well giving law enforcement, prosecutors and judges more tools to deal with non-violent offenders and get them the help they need.\u201d\n\nCalling the Affordable Care Act a disaster, Baker will pursue a waiver for Massachusetts from it.\n\nIn response to the Probation Department hiring scandal, he would request that the inspector general conduct annual audits of hiring practices, rotating among state agencies. He would have the state ethics committee conduct annual in-person training days for public officials and rate agencies based on their compliance with ethics rules. He would \"integrate\" the probation and parole departments with a memo laying out the responsibilities and goals of each one. He would also require that online job postings remain online after a job is filled with information about the person hired, their experience and whether they were recommended by a state official.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "The Republican Editorials", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "2014-campaign, 2014-campaign-roundtable, 2014-massachusetts-governor-race, 2014-primary-elections, charlie-baker, opinion", "title": "Call for questions: What shall we ask Charlie Baker, Republican candidate for governor", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Call for questions: What shall we ask Charlie Baker, Republican candidate for governor\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/08/call_for_questions_what_shall_3.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/15607975-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13632111\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-15T17:49:21Z\", \"author\": \"The Republican Editorials\", \"tags\": [\"2014-campaign\",\"2014-campaign-roundtable\",\"2014-massachusetts-governor-race\",\"2014-primary-elections\",\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"charlie-baker\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/15607975-standard.jpg", "description": "The Editorial Board of MassLive.com and The Republican will meet with Baker.
