The case was called Locke v. Davey, and it concerned the constitutionality of a Washington State college scholarship that excluded students studying religion\u2014a key issue for the movement conservatives Cruz considered his political allies. Texas wasn\u2019t a party in the case, but the ambitious lawyer was already gaining a reputation for inserting himself into national debates by filing briefs about attention-grabbing cases with no direct relation to his state.\n\nLike all legal briefs, Cruz\u2019s cited cases, laws and law journal articles as authorities to back up his argument. Among those sources was an obscure article about animal sacrifice, which the author argued should be allowed as an expression of religious liberty. The subject matter was unusual for a Supreme Court brief, but even more unusual was the article: It was a student\u2019s analysis published nearly a decade earlier in a conservative journal at Harvard Law School.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz didn\u2019t name the student author in his brief. But if the justices had looked it up, they would have found a surprise: It was a 24-year-old Harvard law student named Ted Cruz.\n\nIn fact, Cruz cited his own 1994 article not once but twice before the Supreme Court: in briefs submitted in Locke v. Davey and in another religious liberty case in 2006, Anderson v. Town of Durham. Cruz referred to the article only to support a few general statements\u2014nothing groundbreaking or controversial. But he didn\u2019t identify himself as the article\u2019s author either time\u2014which was a violation of the legal citation guidelines in place at the time and, legal experts say, was a bit deceptive.\n\n\u201cI think the court would have preferred to know, and might have felt somewhat misled if anyone went to read the note,\u201d says Douglas Laycock, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and a leading legal authority on religious liberty. \u201cI would have identified myself.\u201d\n\nLeah Litman, a lecturer at Harvard Law School who served as a clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy, agrees that it was \u201ca little strange\u201d Cruz didn\u2019t identify himself. \u201cHe\u2019s identified as the author of the piece [in the journal]. And when you cite a secondary source in a brief, you give the author. There really isn\u2019t a good reason not to,\u201d she says.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment for this article.\n\nCruz\u2019s secret self-citations might be minor details in the story of a bright young lawyer rising to political prominence. But these details\u2014and the article itself, which has never been publicly analyzed\u2014offer an important window into the tactics and thinking of a man whom law school classmates and political colleagues have described as arrogant and sharp-elbowed. The arguments in the article also offer a glimpse at the intellectual development of an unflagging conservative who promises as president to nominate \u201cprincipled constitutionalists\u201d to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Ted Cruz of 20 years ago, it turns out, was much the same as the Ted Cruz of today.\n\n***\n\nPublished in 1994 in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, a conservative student journal for which Cruz served as an editor, the article is well-written. But it is also brash, legal scholars said, combining a focus on religious liberty with a level of self-regard unusual even among Harvard Law students. And its arguments about the First Amendment fall further right than even the most conservative Supreme Court justice supported at the time and, from the perspective of a constitutional conservative, go strategically beyond the case at hand.\n\nCruz analyzes a Supreme Court case involving Santeria, a Cuban religion fusing African-Yoruba beliefs with Catholicism in which adherents perform animal sacrifices on special occasions. When a group wanted to open its own church in a city near Miami in 1987, the city council got worried. It held an emergency meeting at which residents cheered the idea of throwing people practicing Santeria in jail, and the local police department\u2019s chaplain called the religion \u201can abomination to the Lord.\u201d The council quickly passed a series of ordinances banning the ritual slaughter of animals. The official reason for the new laws was protecting public health and safety, but everyone knew they were really about keeping Santeria out of town.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided the case, Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, in 1993 and unanimously overturned the city\u2019s ordinances for violating the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom to practice religion. The justices said that even though the ordinances were written in a neutral way\u2014they outlawed ritual sacrifice regardless of what religion wanted to do it\u2014they were actually targeted at Santeria and so were unconstitutional.\n\nCruz agreed wholeheartedly with that decision, writing that the court was \u201cabsolutely correct.\u201d\n\nBut he took issue with a more technical part of the court\u2019s decision, staking out a position described by constitutional law experts as unusually conservative. The issue was the way in which the First Amendment\u2019s protection for freely exercising religion was applied\u2014or \u201cincorporated,\u201d in the legal jargon\u2014to state and local governments, rather than just the federal government.\n\nThe court used the 14th Amendment\u2019s due process clause (no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d); that is a common strategy for incorporation, but one that some conservatives dislike because it rests on the definition of \u201cdue process,\u201d which might change over time. Worried that the strategy would make it too easy for courts to trample on religious liberty in the future, Cruz called the use of the due process clause \u201ca symbol of illegitimate judicial activism.\u201d Instead, he argued that a different part of the 14th Amendment\u2014prohibiting states from denying equal protection of the law\u2014would give activist judges less leeway to infringe on religious freedom than the due process clause and therefore should be used for incorporation.\n\nCourts haven\u2019t adopted the equal protection idea, which amounts to a wholesale rethinking of how the Bill of Rights applies to the states and survives just in the writings of some conservative legal thinkers. Not even Justice Clarence Thomas, known to be the furthest right on the Supreme Court, embraces the approach to incorporation that Cruz advocated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty radical view,\u201d says Michael Dorf, a constitutional law professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cThomas\u2019 view requires you to reconfigure some doctrine, but it doesn\u2019t require you to undo most of incorporation doctrine,\u201d as Cruz\u2019s position would.\n\n\u201cThis is the note of an extremely conservative activist,\u201d Laycock agrees.\n\n***\n\nThe writing in Cruz\u2019s article stands out too, illustrating a degree of brashness unusual in such staid settings as legal journals, according to the legal experts who read the article for this story. \u201cThere\u2019s something both arrogant and un-scholarly about the prose style,\u201d Dorf says.\n\nCruz called the court\u2019s decision \u201cabsolutely\u201d correct not once but twice\u2014an uncommon claim for a law journal that is conservative not only in its politics, but also in its prose. He also unreservedly endorsed the decision in a predecessor of the Lukumi decision, Employment Division v. Smith\u2014which was actually quite controversial at the time among conservatives. Smith held that a generally applicable law, one that applied to everyone regardless of religion, was constitutional even if it harmed members of one religion more than another. Some conservatives worried that the reasoning in Smith would severely weaken the free exercise of religion clause because it might allow lawmakers to come up with rules that appear to be evenhanded but actually have the effect of discriminating against a particular religion.\n\nThis was an apparent weakness in the argument of a defender of religious freedom. \u201cHe glibly signs on to a disaster for religious liberty\u201d by unconditionally supporting the Smith decision, Laycock says, even as \u201che postured himself as arguing to save religious liberty.\u201d\n\nThe animal sacrifice article wasn\u2019t the only piece of writing Cruz published in law school. As an editor on the Harvard Law Review, he most likely wrote short articles\u2014describing Supreme Court cases, reviewing books and the like\u2014but student pieces in the law review are published unsigned. The Review has a policy against identifying the authors of student articles, and when asked to identify which work was his, two of Cruz\u2019s contemporaries on the law review and two current editors all declined to do so.\n\nThere was one other legal article, though, that Cruz did put his name on. A dense argument about contract and tort liability law, it was much less ideological than his animal sacrifice piece. Cruz and his co-author and law school friend, Jeffrey Hinck, argued that an idea known as the \u201cinformed minority\u201d theory\u2014that a marketplace will remain efficient even if most consumers don\u2019t understand what\u2019s in the contracts they sign, so long as some consumers do\u2014doesn\u2019t hold up in practice. The pair made clear that they supported free markets; their goal, they wrote, was to strengthen the rhetorical position of free-market supporters by persuading them to abandon a theory that Cruz and Hinck saw as a losing argument.\n\nTogether, the contracts and animal sacrifice articles illustrate the breadth of Cruz\u2019s academic work. He was busy in law school: Alongside his spot on the Harvard Law Review and his midlevel editor post on the Journal of Law and Public Policy, he helped found the Harvard Latino Law Review and worked as a research assistant for several professors. One of them, Alan Dershowitz, a legendary criminal defense attorney who later represented O.J. Simpson, has described Cruz as \u201coff-the-charts brilliant.\u201d\n\nBill Waller, who was an editor on the Journal of Law and Public Policy when Cruz wrote his Lukumi analysis, says the topic of Cruz\u2019s article is a testament to his intellectual abilities\u2014not every student got to write about high-profile Supreme Court decisions. \u201cHe was just an overall a very good writer. He got a really good topic,\u201d Waller says.\n\nDorf, the Cornell law professor, agrees that the article\u2019s description of the law was \u201ccertainly competent.\u201d\n\nCruz, not surprisingly, seemed to think well of his writing, too. He opened the article with an extended quote from John Locke\u2019s A Letter Concerning Toleration, seemingly equating his own arguments to those of the famous Enlightenment thinker.\n\nHe remained proud to share that writing years later\u2014even directing the justices of the Supreme Court to read it, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "How his \u2018extremely conservative\u2019 law school article about ritual sacrifice made it to the highest court.", "title": "That Time Ted Cruz Submitted a Supreme Court Brief Citing \u2026 Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/02/ted-cruz-2016-ritual-sacrifice-213681", "image": "http://static.politico.com/5b/a2/1974ecce48418ef7730cee50b0bf/160227-linhorst.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "How his \u2018extremely conservative\u2019 law school article about ritual sacrifice made it to the highest court.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He remained proud to share that writing years later\u2014even directing the justices of the Supreme Court to read it, too.\nTwelve years ago, in the fall of its 2003 term, the U.S Supreme Court received a written brief from Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz with a very unusual footnote.\nNot even Justice Clarence Thomas, known to be the furthest right on the Supreme Court, embraces the approach to incorporation that Cruz advocated.\nLike all legal briefs, Cruz\u2019s cited cases, laws and law journal articles as authorities to back up his argument.\nCruz analyzes a Supreme Court case involving Santeria, a Cuban religion fusing African-Yoruba beliefs with Catholicism in which adherents perform animal sacrifices on special occasions."}
