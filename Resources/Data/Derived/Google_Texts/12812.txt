Headed off to college next fall and wondering which colleges and universities offer the best bang for your buck? No problem. U.S. News and World Report has released a list of the best value higher education institutions.

The value ranking lists schools that offer high academic quality, as defined by the 2014 U.S. News Best Colleges ranking, along with low average cost of attendance, when the average federal financial aid is taken into account.

The value list also divides schools into four categories: national universities, liberal arts colleges, regional universities and regional colleges. Under the two regional categories, the schools are divided up into four geographical areas: West, Midwest, South and North.

During his speech at State University of New York Buffalo in the end of August, President Barack Obama condemned lists like the one released by U.S. News and World Report.

“Right now, private rankings — like U.S. News and World Report puts out each year their rankings — and it encourages a lot of colleges to focus on ways to — ‘How do we game the numbers?’ and it actually rewards them, in some cases, for raising costs,” Obama said at the time.

He instead suggested that colleges should be ranked by “opportunity,” or those that help students from all backgrounds succeed. The POTUS also proposed metrics such as average debt after graduation and the ease of paying it off.

But in case you don’t buy into Obama’s system, here’s the top five national universities and liberal arts colleges on the new value-based list. Check out U.S. News and World Report for more schools.
