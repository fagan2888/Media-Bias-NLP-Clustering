The cost to the state of Alaska to provide decent health care to these wage-earning Alaska families over the short term is zero, and over the long term is miniscule. The federal government will pick up 100 percent of the Medicaid expansion costs through 2016, decreasing slightly annually thereafter until it dips to 90 percent in 2020 and all subsequent years. Over the next nine years, 93 percent of the cost of the expanded coverage would be borne by the federal government; Alaska's Medicaid obligation would grow by a mere 2.8 percent.
