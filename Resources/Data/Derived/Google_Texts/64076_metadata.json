Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) \u2014 allows the chairs of the budget committee to consider revenue-neutral transactions involving lands, excluding national parks, preserves and monuments.\n\nSuch transactions would still require the approval of Congress and the president's signature.\n\nSeveral current laws allow some form of land transfers from federal agencies.\n\nA Daines spokeswoman said in an email that the Murkowski amendment safeguards future locally supported land transfers from budgetary hurdles.\n\n\"This budget marks the first time since 2001 that Congress has passed a balanced budget \u2014 taking long-overdue steps to rein in our nation's debt and ensure Congress is accountable to the American people,\u201d Daines said in a press release. \u201cI am strongly opposed to any efforts to sell off Montana's treasured public lands and remain committed to finding balanced solutions to increase access and protect our public lands for future generations.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) voted against the package on Tuesday, saying the resolution \u201c...guts Medicare, increases student loan payments, opens the door for selling off public lands, and gives tax breaks to the wealthy few. \u2026 (and) would increase military spending overseas while slashing infrastructure spending here at home.\u201d\n\nHe called for a new highway bill; the current highway bill expires on May 31.\n\n\u201cWe have folks here in Congress who eagerly swipe the nation's credit card when it comes to investments in the Middle East,\u201d he said on the Senate floor. \u201cBut these same members of Congress won't even open up the wallet to fill a pothole next to a school.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Montana's Congressional delegation had different views of the budget resolution passed Tuesday evening by Congress.", "og": {"url": "http://www.krtv.com/story/28997838/zinke-and-tester-slam-land-transfer-provision-in-budget-resolution", "image": "http://KRTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7687555_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Montana's Congressional delegation had different views of the budget resolution passed Tuesday evening by Congress.", "title": "Zinke and Tester slam land-transfer provision in budget resolution"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KRTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7687555_G.jpg", "description": "Montana's Congressional delegation had different views of the budget resolution passed Tuesday evening by Congress.", "card": "summary", "title": "Zinke and Tester slam land-transfer provision in budget resolution"}, "wnreadableurl": "zinke-and-tester-slam-land-transfer-provision-in-budget-resolution", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KRTV", "fb": {"app_id": 161591973908016}, "date": "2015/05/06", "KEYWORDS": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "news_keywords": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac2c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI am strongly opposed to any efforts to sell off Montana's treasured public lands and remain committed to finding balanced solutions to increase access and protect our public lands for future generations.\u201dU.S.\nZinke said he supported some elements of the budget resolution, like its aim of ending the Affordable Care Act and balancing the budget within 10 years.\nThe resolution is just the start of Congress' budget process, setting a roadmap for the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.\nA Daines spokeswoman said in an email that the Murkowski amendment safeguards future locally supported land transfers from budgetary hurdles.\nSeveral current laws allow some form of land transfers from federal agencies."}
