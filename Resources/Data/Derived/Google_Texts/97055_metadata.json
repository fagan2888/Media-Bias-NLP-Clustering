Ted Cruz said to allow companies to sell insurance across state lines. It's basically the same answer as Trump's.\n\nThis is rhetoric that sounds good, but is likely to be untrue. It could lead to a terrible outcome with higher prices for less coverage, by eliminating \"states' rights\" for setting their own standards for coverage.\n\nRight now, no federal law or regulation stops insurance companies from selling policies in every state in the nation. The insurers just have to comply with each state's regulations.\n\nIf you remove state regulatory boundaries, all the insurance companies will set up shop in states with the fewest regulations. This has happened with the credit-card industry.\n\nIn the 1980s, Citibank offered then-Gov. Bill Janklow a deal: If South Dakota completely lifted its interest rate cap, the banking giant would move its credit-card operations to South Dakota \u2014 along with 400 good jobs.\n\nThe bill was introduced and passed in the space of a day. South Dakota became the host of most credit-card companies, since there was no cap on what interest rate could be charged. Until then, card issuers generally had to follow the interest caps in the state where each customer resided.\n\nIf the same thing were to happen with ACA and other health insurance polices, we would have a world where coverage would become cheaper for the young and healthy, but very expensive and harder to obtain for older persons needing more care.\n\nThe insurance companies would write the rules. This would not foster competition, just higher prices for the sick.\n\nJoseph N.
