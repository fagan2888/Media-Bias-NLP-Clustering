STAMFORD, Conn., Aug. 5, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GoTelecare, a leading provider of comprehensive telehealth and medical billing services in the U.S., announces today the introduction of its franchising business across the U.S., which will allow healthcare facilities and medical practitioners throughout the nation to provide video consultation services using the company's proprietary online platform.

GoTelecare virtualizes doctor visits by facilitating secure HIPAA-complaint video consultations, combined with a comprehensive practice management platform and low cost medical billing service, that increases patient access to medical services while reducing telehealth and office billing costs for medical practices, healthcare facilities and healthcare services organizations.

"Given our proven success over the last two years at bringing online the 'brick & mortar' doctor appointment experience for healthcare providers and their patients at skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare organizations in the Northeast, extending these much needed services across the U.S. to a broad range of healthcare organizations through our new franchising organization may help enhance healthcare in those areas where it is desperately needed, and is also a strategically sound step toward extending our business," said Terrence Doeberl, director, project management of ATNcare Franchising LLC, dba GoTelecare. "With our unmatched technology and operations capability, we will provide opportunities for healthcare centers nationwide to facilitate these video consultations to allow a physician to add online capabilities to their medical practice as well as extremely low cost medical billing for both telehealth services and their existing medical practice. These medical billing services also apply to a broad range of healthcare facilities and medical services organizations current operations."

Client services for telehealth and low cost medical billing that will be offered through franchisees address the needs of a broad range of physicians practices as well as healthcare organizations such as, but not limited to, nursing home & rehabilitation centers, assisted living facilities, hospitals, managed long term care, home health agencies, durable medical equipment companies, MLTCs, Medicare HMOs, and pharmacy benefits management organizations.

"In the face of an increasing shortage qualified healthcare providers, combined with increased insurance roles under the Affordable Care Act, aging American demographic trends, and declining revenues coupled with increasing costs for physicians and most healthcare service organizations, our unique service not only bridges the divide between patients and healthcare providers online through real-time video consultations, but also handles patient insurance claims processing and billing for both the virtual and physical practice needs," added Mr. Doeberl.

Initial franchising activities will take place in 33 states with others being added in the near future.

Key benefits for franchisees include:

Low initial franchise price compared to other franchise types

Franchisee office is company headquarters, with hours determined by franchisee

Ongoing, residual income from recurring patient consultations and billing services

Unmatched training, marketing materials & sales support provided by GoTelecare
