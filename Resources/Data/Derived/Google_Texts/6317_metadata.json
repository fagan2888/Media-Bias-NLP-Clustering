Note: All this week, Daily Reckoning editor Peter Coyne has been reporting from Havana, Cuba. In today\u2019s email edition, he relayed a harrowing story of one poor soul who fell ill while traveling through that \u201ccommunist mecca\u201d\u2026 and the surprisingly efficient medical care he received. In keeping with that theme, our resident health care guru, Jud Anglin, describes a unique way around some of the inefficiencies in the current U.S. health care sector. Read on\u2026]\n\nWith the Obamacare open enrollment period for 2015 now in full swing (it started on Nov. 15 \u2014 just 11 days after the mid-term elections), I strongly maintain my position that you should \u201copt out.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m referring, of course, to enrollment in the federal and state insurance exchanges as mandated under the Affordable Care Act. You don\u2019t have to enroll. Most likely, you will not incur any penalties. After all, since Obamacare was enacted, the government has continued to add exemptions at a rapid pace. They\u2019re currently up to 14.\n\nFor example, if \u201cyou experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance,\u201d you are exempt. Or \u201cif you recently experienced the death of a close family member,\u201d you are exempt.\n\nI don\u2019t imagine that an IRS agent will show up at your door demanding proof of such excuses.\n\nThe reason you should opt out of Obamacare is because of the significantly higher costs in insurance deductibles, the higher premiums, and the limited plan choices on offer.\n\nIf you are covered by Medicare or a corporate plan, you may be safe for a short while with regard to coverage. However, you are likely to find it harder in the coming months to escape the increasing premium and deductible costs.\n\n\u201c\u2026average savings through MediBid are 80% versus billed rates, and 50% versus \u2018insurance discounted\u2019 rates.\u201d\n\nWe think you can do better on your own. If you\u2019re willing to think and act differently\u2026\n\nIn 2011, Ralph Weber published a book entitled MediCrats: Medical Bureaucrats That Rule Your Health Care. In it, the Canadian-born Weber explains the problems plaguing the current health care system, while also providing readers with a \u201cformula to fight back [and] take control of their own health care and beat the medicrats.\u201d\n\nBut Weber did more than just write about what people should do. As an entrepreneur, he set about helping people find a solution by founding his own health services company called MediBid. This is what I want to introduce you to today.\n\nFounded in 2010, MediBid is a Web-based \u201cmarketplace for medicine\u201d platform that allows seekers of health care to meet up with providers of care in a private auction \u201cexchange.\u201d\n\nIt works like this: If you find that your health insurance deductibles are too high for a surgical procedure that you\u2019re seeking, simply visit MediBid\u2019s website, register, pay a $25 \u201cseekers fee,\u201d and then submit an online request for your desired procedure.\n\nWithin a short period of time, you\u2019ll begin receiving competitive bids from surgeons who are interested in taking your case. In addition to their quoted price, these surgeons also include their bios and practice licenses, along with references, so as to increase your comfort level for selecting them.\n\nThe most obvious advantage of using MediBid is the amount of money you can save.\n\nAccording to Weber, \u201caverage savings through MediBid are 80% versus billed rates, and 50% versus \u2018insurance discounted\u2019 rates.\u201d\n\nSo far, approximately 120,000 consumers have now used MediBid to find doctors for medical procedures.\n\nPerry Hunt, a 50-year-old man from California, is one such person who has used the service. He was profiled by CNNMoney earlier this year. In the article, he discusses how he used the website to find a surgeon for a hip replacement. His local doctor quoted him $70,000. But through MediBid, \u201che accepted a bid from a doctor for $21,000\u2026 The surgery ended up being a huge success.\u201d\n\nJust how many doctors are registered with the website? WebMD says that the most recent figure is approximately 6,000 doctors or surgery centers, in addition to a limited number of hospitals.\n\nAs with any service business, there are pros and cons that you have to consider.\n\nOn the downside, once you find the right doctor and price on MediBid, you will likely have to travel to the location of the doctor to undergo your procedure. This means you\u2019ll have to factor in transportation and lodging costs associated with your surgical procedure.\n\nMore importantly, Matthew DeCamp, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins, notes that \u201csince doctors participate voluntarily, consumers won\u2019t always have a full range of choices and may not pick the most experienced doctor.\u201d\n\nThis is why you should conduct extensive homework before going ahead with any procedure. You can do this by vetting doctors through Web searches and phone calls to references, in addition to contacting hospitals and clinics where the doctor currently works.\n\nMediBid also recommends that you \u201ccall the state licensing board for the state of the doctor [you] are going to see [to] verify that everything is correct.\u201d These details can be found by visiting the website of the American Medical Association.\n\nI can see how you could also use MediBid as a negotiation tool with your local surgeon.\n\nIf after reviewing the physician and facility you find that you\u2019re not satisfied, MediBid will not charge you again to reopen your bid request.\n\nAs for international doctors, seekers should make sure that the surgeon is employed by a large, reputable hospital, preferably one that is JCI-accredited. JCI is the international division of the Joint Commission, the U.S. accreditation body based in Chicago.\n\nBased upon my experience as a medical tourism facilitation agent, I can see how you could also use MediBid as a negotiation tool with your local surgeon. After obtaining several bids, you could take them to your local surgeon to see if he or she can compete.\n\nAs a consequence of Obamacare, the increasing insurance premiums and deductibles will continue to lead to more innovations like MediBid.\n\nI certainly expect this number to increase significantly over the coming months.\n\nRegards,\n\nJud Anglin\n\nFor The Daily Reckoning\n\nP.S.
