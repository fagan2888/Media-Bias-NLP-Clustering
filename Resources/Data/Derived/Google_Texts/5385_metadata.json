In London alone, some neighborhoods have higher TB rates than poorer parts of the world.\n\nScurvy, tuberculosis, scarlet fever may conjure up images of a Charles Dickens\u2019 tale. However, diseases of the Victorian Era are re-emerging in modern day Britain.\n\n24 year old Josie Garrett is nearing the end of intensive treatment for TB. She\u2019s studying for a Masters degree, but a year ago, was isolated in hospital.\n\n\u201cI contracted TB from my boyfriend. He caught TB from his friend in south east London, his friend contracted TB from his dad, his dad first was diagnosed TB in the 90s after traveling to India. And it basically re-emerged as a drug resistant form of the disease. Up until this point I wasn\u2019t able to work, wasn\u2019t able to socialize, I wasn\u2019t able to kind of live a normal life,\u201d said Garrett.\n\nTB is one disease often synonymous with poverty, affecting the most vulnerable. However, health officials warn strains of the disease lie undetected in all parts of modern society and could break out in the future.\n\n\u201cThe bacteria in Tuberculosis can infect and stay in your body for a long time. And it becomes re-awakened again and manifests itself as a disease where something happens to your immune level,\u201d said Dr Onkar Sarhota, London Assembly.\n\nTuberculosis was one of the deadliest diseases in the modern era, killing 1 in 4 people at one point. Of course, the situation isn\u2019t as bad today but there are parts of London where TB rates are higher than they are in Rwanda or Iraq and a recent study by Britain\u2019s National Health Service found that other disease common in the 19th century are making a comeback.\n\n\u201cNotably there has been a huge rise in Scarlet fever, 14,000 cases in the last year, the highest since the 1960s. We have seen a rise in the cases of tuberculosis, we\u2019ve seen a rise in cases of whooping cough, we have seen more measles in the last 10 years than in the last ten years before that,\u201d said Dr. Nuria Martinez-Alier, Guys\u2019 and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital London.\n\nIn fact, over the last five years in England, cases of scarlet fever have risen 136%, scurvy by 38% and cholera by 300%, though for scurvy and cholera the numbers are very small.\n\nSo why the resurgence?\n\n\u201cReduced vaccine uptake for example with measles, reduced population immunity for example with whooping cough, increased poverty as well as an influx in migration and malnutrition,\u201d said Dr. Martinez-Alier.\n\nTwo hundred years later, age old afflictions: malnutrition, poverty and lack of access to health care contributing to the rise of Victorian-Era diseases today.\n\nCopyright 2015, CNN.
