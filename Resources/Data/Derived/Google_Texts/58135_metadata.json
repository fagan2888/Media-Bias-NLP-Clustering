It\u2019s sparked outrage from some in the town who are asking the company to pay for the youth league football field where it built the market.\n\nThe outrage was followed by a petition from parents of the Luther Lions youth football team. The mother who wrote the petition called the closure \u201ca slap in the face\u201d and she wants the company to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by paying for a new field.\n\nOne parent commented on the petition saying their son \u201csacrificed\u201d when the town sold the land to Wal-Mart and said even more plainly, \u201cthis sucks\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did Wal-Mart not know coming into this eight months ago that they weren't going to make the kind of money that they were expecting?\u201d Aaron Edwards asked Thursday afternoon while standing in front of the soon to be defunct store.\n\nEdwards is a small town filmmaker who made a YouTube video title \u201cHow Wal-Mart Ruined My Town\u201d about the closure and the reaction from the town.\n\nEdwards said the youth league team was forced to play on the high school field instead, which meant forfeiting revenue from concessions sales. The team used the money to pay for uniforms, helmets and pads, according to Edwards.\n\nThis neighborhood market is one of six Wal-Mart locations that closed Thursday in Oklahoma and one of 154 the company was forced to close after lackluster sales in 2015.\n\nWhen asked if Wal-Mart would honor their request a spokesperson said via email \"Our plan is to make a $3,000 donation to the local food bank serving the communities of every closed store and to fund applications from charities in the affected areas.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also said employees at the marketplace would be kept on the payroll through Feb. 10 for store cleanup and anyone not transferred by that date would be paid for an additional 60 days.\n\nBut for Edwards, it's about more than just a field or some money. It's about loyalty and doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cA customer here should be the same as a customer in Edmond or in Oklahoma City or in major city. A customer is a customer,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Eight months after opening in Luther, a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market closed its doors for good Thursday.
