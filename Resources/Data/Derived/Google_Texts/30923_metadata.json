Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.) would have meant that the Court could have said, \u2018We deferred to the IRS, the IRS determined that all marketplaces should have subsidies, and we defer to the agency.\u2019 If that had been the basis for the decision, the next administration, with a different head of IRS, could have made a different interpretation, and could have reversed that, saying, \u2018Yes, in the Obama administration, the IRS ruled this way, but we ruled differently.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t use agency deference as the rationale. They used the way the law was written. So they found that the basis of the law meant that all exchanges should be eligible for subsidies. It could have been a bit more tenuous. If the Chevron precedent had been used, it could have been overturned in the future. This is now a ruling on the law itself. So absent repeal, it stands.\n\nNEWSHOUR: How are you personally feeling about the decision?\n\nSEBELIUS: You know, a lot of people always talk about what this says to the president, or how I feel. And we\u2019ve been the lucky ones. I\u2019ve always had affordable health care. But I get stopped on the street every day. I get stopped in the grocery store. I get stopped on an airplane. And people immediately tell me their story about their mother, their kid, themselves, and say, \u2018This has changed my life. I can do things.\u2019 There is a wonderful diner now open in Lawrence, Kan. \u2014 the Ladybird Diner. Meg Heriford is the head of it. When she opened her diner, and I was there eating her fabulous pies for the first time, she said, \u2018I could only do this because of the Affordable Care Act. I have a preexisting health condition. I could not leave my job because I would never be insured. Having this law pass meant that I could fulfill my lifetime dream and open a diner.\u2019 It\u2019s wildly popular. She\u2019s very happy. But I think that story is repeated now 10 million times. And it\u2019s really fabulous.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who oversaw Obamacare's passage and rocky implementation, said on Friday that the Supreme Court's latest decision on the law will strengthen it against leadership changes in the future.", "pubdate": 20150626, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who oversaw Obamacare's passage and rocky implementation, said on Friday that the Supreme Court's latest decision on the law will strengthen it against leadership changes in the future.", "title": "Former HHS Secretary Sebelius says health law strengthened with latest Supreme Court decision", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-451337620-1.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/former-hhs-secretary-kathleen-sebelius-says-health-care-law-strengthened-latest-supreme-court-decision/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who oversaw Obamacare's passage and rocky implementation, said on Friday that the Supreme Court's latest decision on the law will strengthen it against leadership changes in the future.", "title": "Former HHS Secretary Sebelius says health law strengthened with latest Supreme Court decision", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-451337620-1.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Supreme Court"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, kathleen sebelius, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda239\"", "article_summary": "So they found that the basis of the law meant that all exchanges should be eligible for subsidies.\nSebelius, who oversaw Obamacare\u2019s passage and rocky implementation, told the NewsHour that the the decision will strengthen the law against leadership changes in the future.\nHaving this law pass meant that I could fulfill my lifetime dream and open a diner.\u2019 It\u2019s wildly popular.\nThey used the way the law was written.\nSEBELIUS: You know, a lot of people always talk about what this says to the president, or how I feel."}
