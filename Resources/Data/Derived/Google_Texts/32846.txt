VANCOUVER - (AP) - Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, will cheer on the United States in the Women's World Cup final on Sunday.



The U.S. women's national team plays defending champion Japan in the title match at Vancouver's BC Place.



The Bidens will lead a delegation including U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman, Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Evan Ryan, and former U.S. players Cobi Jones and Mia Hamm.



"We're honored to be part of the Women's World Cup Final," the Bidens said in a statement.



"Team USA has inspired millions around the globe - especially girls and other young athletes who know that the power of sports can change lives. The team is a source of pride and unity, and we can't wait to see them represent the United States on the world stage. Let's cheer the team on and bring the World Cup trophy home."
