Federal prosecutors have decided to bring criminal charges against the friend and neighbor of one of the San Bernardino shooters.

Several federal law enforcement officials say the first criminal charges to stem from the massacre will be brought against Enrique Marquez, a long-time friend and former neighbor of gunman Syed Rizwan Farook.

The charges could be filed as early as today.

Investigators say Marquez bought the two assault rifles three years ago that wound up being used in the shooting.

Officials say Marquez has told them he did it as a favor so that Farook would not have to go through a background check or be on record as the purchaser.
