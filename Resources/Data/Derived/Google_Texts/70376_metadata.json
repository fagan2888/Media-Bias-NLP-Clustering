But new moves by some major suppliers mean competition is starting to reduce that cost barrier.\n\nCree on Wednesday is putting a $19.97 price tag on a new bulb sold through Home Depot. It\u2019s got the equivalent light output of a 100-watt incandescent bulb, a desirable brightness level for many home applications that has, until now, carried a high premium.\n\nThe Durham, N.C., company was one of the first makers of light-emitting diode chips, only entering the market for consumer LED bulbs a year ago. Cree is also reducing prices on the other bulbs it sells through Home Depot by up to 23%.\n\nOne of Cree\u2019s 60-watt equivalent bulbs, for example, will fall to $9.97 from $12.97, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe are making an affordability statement,\u201d said Mike Watson, Cree\u2019s vice president of product strategy.\n\nAnd competition means more savings all around. One of Cree\u2019s biggest rivals, Philips, on Monday announced a 60-watt equivalent bulb at $9.97.\n\nThe consumer electronics giant, which offers a 100-watt equivalent bulb for $24.97, stresses that most of its bulbs are certified under a U.S. government program called Energy Star that can qualify them for utility rebates. (Cree says its 75-watt and 100-watt bulbs are still under Energy Star evaluation).\n\nMost LED bulbs from Philips are round with a distinctive flattened head, but the new \u201cSlimStyle\u201d bulb announced Monday has a more two-dimensional design, a bit like a loop. Cree\u2019s bulbs look more like incandescent bulbs, distinguished mainly by a white circular heat sink.\n\nOther companies are planning to keep battling in the low-priced LED bulb sector. One is Switch, a startup in San Jose, Calif. The company says some of its 40-watt and 60-watt equivalent bulbs now retail for $11.99, and expects to offer 75-watt and 100-watt bulbs in the budget price class later this year.\n\nPhilip Smallwood, research director for the LEDs and Lighting Group at the market research firm Strategies Unlimited, estimates that worldwide revenues for LED bulbs in incandescent-replacement class known as A19 were only $1 billion in 2013. Aided by price declines, however, he sees the market growing to $5.2 billion by 2018.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that is stopping consumers in the residential sector is price,\u201d says Philip Smallwood, an analyst at the market research firm Strategies Unlimited. \u201cWith Cree cutting down these prices so much, and others coming down, it really is the driving factor for adoption.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Consumers who would like to start saving energy by switching to LED lightbulbs have been put off by the price tags\u2014but new moves by some major suppliers mean competition is starting to reduce that cost barrier.", "title": "New Pricing Makes LED Bulbs More Affordable for Homeowners", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2014/03/12/new-pricing-makes-led-bulbs-more-affordable-for-homeowners/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BW397_CREEBU_P_20140312004446.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "New Pricing Makes LED Bulbs More Affordable for Homeowners", "description": "Consumers who would like to start saving energy by switching to LED lightbulbs have been put off by the price tags\u2014but new moves by some major suppliers mean competition is starting to reduce that cost barrier.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Don Clark", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Personal Tech News Blog", "page.subsection": "Personal Tech News", "article.summary": "Consumers who would like to start saving energy by switching to LED lightbulbs have been put off by the price tags\u2014but new moves by some major suppliers mean competition is starting to reduce that cost barrier.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-03-12T11:00:40-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2014/03/12/new-pricing-makes-led-bulbs-more-affordable-for-homeowners/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-268B-139", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Tech", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Consumers who would like to start saving energy by switching to LED lightbulbs have been put off by the price tags\u2014but new moves by some major suppliers mean competition is starting to reduce that cost barrier.", "title": "New Pricing Makes LED Bulbs More Affordable for Homeowners", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2014/03/12/new-pricing-makes-led-bulbs-more-affordable-for-homeowners/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BW397_CREEBU_P_20140312004446.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Personal Tech News", "article.id": "BL-268B-139", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-12T16:49:55-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd991\"", "article_summary": "Cree\u2019s bulbs look more like incandescent bulbs, distinguished mainly by a white circular heat sink.\nThe Durham, N.C., company was one of the first makers of light-emitting diode chips, only entering the market for consumer LED bulbs a year ago.\nOne of Cree\u2019s 60-watt equivalent bulbs, for example, will fall to $9.97 from $12.97, the company said.\nOther companies are planning to keep battling in the low-priced LED bulb sector.\nThe company says some of its 40-watt and 60-watt equivalent bulbs now retail for $11.99, and expects to offer 75-watt and 100-watt bulbs in the budget price class later this year."}
