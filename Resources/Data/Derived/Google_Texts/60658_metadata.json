He has enacted $5 billion in tax cuts, eliminated income taxes for small businesses and grew the state\u2019s rainy day fund to $2 billion. He says the tax code should be simpler.\n\nEducation: Kasich is against federal education standards and believes parents should have more say in their children\u2019s learning. As Ohio governor, he increased the number of vouchers available for students and helped freeze college tuition.\n\nEnvironment: Kasich says he believes climate change is a real issue, but does not feel the EPA should regulate emissions.\n\nGun control/rights: The Ohio Governor has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association, advocating to protect gun rights and gun owners\u2019 privacy.\n\nHealth care: Like many other Republican presidential candidates, Kasich says he would repeal and replace Obamacare. He says greater emphasis should be placed on keeping Americans healthy. Kasich is against abortions and pushed for funding of rape crisis centers.\n\nImmigration: Kasich says undocumented immigrants should be able to stay in the country legally, but he does not support a guaranteed path to citizenship.\n\nNational security: \u201cWiping ISIS off the map requires a complex, collaborative strategy involving mutual defense action by NATO- as well as regional allies- in the wake of the attack on France, intensifying international intelligence cooperation, increasing support to the highly-effective Kurdish military, creating safe havens and no-fly zones,\u201d Kasich says on his website. He says we need to strengthen our cyber defenses, stand up to Russia and counter China.\n\nSocial issues: Kasich opposes gay marriage, but says we should embrace the court\u2019s decision. He\u2019s said if one of his daughters was gay, he would accept them.\n\nSocial:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JohnKasich\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/JohnKasich/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JohnKasich\n\nWebsite: https://johnkasich.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Campaign ended: May 4, 2016 Current position: Governor of Ohio Career: Ohio Governor 2011 to present, U.S. House of Representatives 1983 to 2001, Ohio Senate 1979 to 1983 Hometown: McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania Family: Married to Karen Waldbillig with two daughters Religion: Anglican ...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "ab9b95eb1a995697f3c88253f276fa87"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox8.com", "description": "Campaign ended: May 4, 2016 Current position: Governor of Ohio Career: Ohio Governor 2011 to present, U.S. House of Representatives 1983 to 2001, Ohio Senate 1979 to 1983 Hometown: McKees Rocks, Pe\u2026", "title": "Republican presidential candidate John Kasich: You Decide 2016", "url": "http://fox8.com/2016/01/22/republican-presidential-candidate-john-kasich-you-decide-2016/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/john-kasich.jpeg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/john-kasich.jpeg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox8news", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox8news"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324686068", "fb": {"pages": 74758790293}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/ea8bceb705ffdd1b50e02de092ee74b4?s=16", "application-name": "fox8.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland", "published_time": "2016-01-22T17:16:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T17:31:12+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland"}, "keywords": "2016 presidential candidate bios, john kasich, you decide 2016", "google-site-verification": "RrRVvAvDXFfRHU6-TtZJh28fqDSaZbTLz1xSvv0udQ8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "John Kasich, Ohio, governor, GOP, Republican, president, election, candidate, Kasich"}, "article_summary": "Health care: Like many other Republican presidential candidates, Kasich says he would repeal and replace Obamacare.\nAs Ohio governor, he increased the number of vouchers available for students and helped freeze college tuition.\nGun control/rights: The Ohio Governor has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association, advocating to protect gun rights and gun owners\u2019 privacy.\nEnvironment: Kasich says he believes climate change is a real issue, but does not feel the EPA should regulate emissions.\nImmigration: Kasich says undocumented immigrants should be able to stay in the country legally, but he does not support a guaranteed path to citizenship."}
