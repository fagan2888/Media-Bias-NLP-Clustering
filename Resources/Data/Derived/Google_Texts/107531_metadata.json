Kamaljeet Singh Kalsi, Capt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan and Cpl. Simran Preet Singh Lamba \u2014 were allowed to serve while wearing turbans and beards in expression of their Sikh faith.\n\nIn 2011, Orthodox Rabbi Menachem Stern of Brooklyn, N.Y., successfully sued the Army for the right to wear a beard because shaving it would violate his faith.\n\nNavy Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, spokesman for the Pentagon\u2019s personnel and readiness office, said the Defense Department does not know how many troops would be affected by the amended policy, but the hope is it \u201cwill enhance commanders\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 ability to promote the climate necessary to maintain good order and discipline, and would reduce both the instances and perception of discrimination among those whose religious expressions are less familiar to the command.\u201d\n\nReaction to the change was split among religious-freedom advocates.\n\nNihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, applauded the decision and called it important \u201cto broaden the religious rights of American military personnel, and [we] hope this updated policy will allow all those in uniform to practice their faith while serving the nation.\u201d\n\nThe New York-based Sikh Coalition, which lobbied for the soldiers, said its members are \u201cdeeply appreciative\u201d that the Pentagon had established a formal process. But the group\u2019s policy director, Rajdeep Singh, said the regulations are disappointing.\n\n\u201cThe resistance has been to turbans and beards, so basically we were looking for a framework so that a Sikh who wants to join the military has a pretty clear understanding of what needs to be done,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cThe problem with the new regulations \u2026 is that the accommodations are never guaranteed. They could be revoked at any time.\u201d\n\nThe bigger problem, he said, is the requirement that service members requesting accommodation abide by the current uniform policy until their requests are granted.\n\n\u201cThis has a chilling effect on Sikhs who might want to join the military,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat incentive do they have under these guidelines \u2026 when they are required to violate their religion to even request an accommodation?\u201d\n\nJerry Boykin, executive vice president of the Family Research Council, said his organization is \u201ccautiously optimistic about this new instruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful phrasing only goes so far. Unless the new policy is backed by action, it will remain just words on a piece of paper,\u201d said Mr. Boykin, a retired Army lieutenant general and former undersecretary of defense for President George W. Bush.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pentagon has relaxed its policy on religious accommodations, allowing service members to grow beards and wear head covers such as turbans and headscarves as part of their faith.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Pentagon has relaxed its policy on religious accommodations, allowing service members to grow beards and wear head covers such as turbans and headscarves as part of their faith.", "title": "Pentagon relaxes dress code to allow turbans, scarves", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/23/pentagon-relaxes-dress-code-allow-turbans-scarves/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/23/us-army-beard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/23/us-army-beard.jpg", "description": "The Pentagon has relaxed its policy on religious accommodations, allowing service members to grow beards and wear head covers such as turbans and headscarves as part of their faith.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Pentagon relaxes dress code to allow turbans, scarves"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Religion Belief, Pentagon"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd240c\"", "article_summary": "The Pentagon has relaxed its uniform policy to allow service members to grow beards and wear coverings such as turbans, yarmulkes and head scarves as expressions of their faith.\nIn recent years, however, select cases have been won by service members lobbying for religious freedom while in uniform.\nThey could be revoked at any time.\u201dThe bigger problem, he said, is the requirement that service members requesting accommodation abide by the current uniform policy until their requests are granted.\nSimran Preet Singh Lamba \u2014 were allowed to serve while wearing turbans and beards in expression of their Sikh faith.\nBut the group\u2019s policy director, Rajdeep Singh, said the regulations are disappointing."}
