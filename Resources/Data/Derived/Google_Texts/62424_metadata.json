Provider may have EHRs in place, but their technology tools are often borderline unusable, causing productivity to plummet as convoluted workflows potentially put patients at risk.\n\nHealth information exchange and data interoperability remain spotty at best, due in part to the fact that the stampede to collect Stage 1 incentive dollars created an artificial demand for technologies that were not mature enough to meet future goals of the meaningful use programs.\n\nExpensive EHR replacements and required upgrades to new editions of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) left providers with empty pockets and a sour taste in their mouths.\n\nSpeak up \u2013 CMS is listening\n\nTo its credit, CMS has done its best to respond to the pain points caused by meaningful use by repeatedly expanding the scope of exemptions, offering more opportunities for public comment, and even significantly modifying regulations to cut some of the trickiest thresholds.\n\n\u201cSince late last year we have been working side by side with physician organizations across many communities \u2014 including with great advocacy from the AMA \u2014 and have listened to the needs and concerns of many,\u201d Slavitt said during his speech.\n\nNow, as the shifting tides of partisan politics open up uncertainties about the future of the federal vision for healthcare improvement, CMS is moving the spotlight away from meaningful use and towards something that everyone in the industry can agree on: a simpler, more interoperable, more cost-effective framework for ongoing reform.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the bipartisan MACRA legislation is a major item squarely on our punch list that has everyone\u2019s attention,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cAt its most basic level, it is a program that brings pay-for-value [reimbursement structures] into the mainstream through something called the Merit-Based Incentive Program (MIPS), which compels us to measure physicians on four categories: quality, cost, the use of technology, and practice improvement.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) brought an unusual moment of unity to the healthcare industry as physicians celebrated the demise of the hated Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which brought an annual threat of steep Medicare payment cuts and a yearly battle in Congress to institute temporary patches to avoid a financial meltdown.\n\nThe legislation also brought MIPS onto the horizon. The program was envisioned to be a successor to meaningful use, rolling the last few years of the EHR Incentive Programs into a three-pronged quality initiative that promotes value-based reimbursement and broader use of alternative payment models (APMs) to improve quality and motivate providers with bonuses and penalties.\n\nCMS has started to slowly roll out the details of the initiative, making sure to emphasize that the framework will do its best to avoid some of the pitfalls of prior reform schemes.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are high for this program,\u201d acknowledged Slavitt. \u201cAs any physician will tell you, physician burden and frustration levels are real. Programs designed to improve often distract. Done poorly, measures are divorced from how physicians practice and add to the cynicism that people who build these programs just don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimplify, simplify.\u201d\n\nSimplification is the name of the game for MIPS, Slavitt continued, echoing the famous quote by Henry David Thoreau. \u201cWe have the opportunity to sunset three old programs and align them together in a single new program. That program needs to be streamlined and simple to use so physicians can focus where they need to \u2013 on their patients.\u201d\n\nCMS has been careful, this time, to collect copious industry feedback before committing to its designs, Slavitt stressed. \u201cWe are designing from the outside-in,\u201d he said. We started by working with front-line physicians, tech companies, and practice managers over a four day session and through an RFI to garner direct feedback on the right measures for each specialty and how to implement the program most simply. [AMA CEO Dr. James L. Madara] and the AMA team were of significant help.\u201d\n\nThe American Medical Association has been a vocal critic of meaningful use, decrying the financial and administrative burdens that the program has placed on overworked, stressed out physicians. At its 2015 Interim Meeting in November, the society vowed to take on the \u201cmorass of regulation\u201d that has \u201cfailed to focus on interoperability and has instead created new barriers to easily exchange data and information across care settings.\u201d\n\nSlavitt wants providers to know that CMS isn\u2019t just listening, but is taking action on the critical issue of health data exchange after a long year in which protests against a lack of health data interoperability forced some vendors to change their tune on HIE fees and data ownership questions.\n\n\u201cWe are deadly serious about interoperability,\u201d he asserted. \u201cWe will begin initiatives in collaboration with physicians and consumers toward pointing technology to fill critical use cases like closing referral loops and engaging a patient in their care. And technology companies that look for ways to practice \u2018data blocking\u2019 in opposition to new regulations will find that it won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe EHR vendor community has previously protested that there is little hard evidence of intentional or malicious information blocking, but did admit that sometimes unavoidable circumstances get the better of health information exchange efforts.\n\nThey may be less likely to protest the use of open, standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow plug-and-play tools to bolt onto existing health IT infrastructure. Many vendors have already eagerly embraced the API mentality, leveraging emerging standards such as FHIR to develop a more interoperable ecosystem and enable the development of healthcare\u2019s very own Internet of Things.\n\nIn the future CMS will be \u201crequiring open APIs in order to the physician desktop can be opened up and move away from the lock that early EHR decisions placed on physician organizations so that allow apps, analytics tools, and connected technologies to get data in and out of an EHR securely,\u201d Slavitt said.\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic\u201d\n\nFollowing the speech, more than thirty hospitals and health systems set a letter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell reiterating their deep concerns about what would happen if Stage 3 meaningful use went forward as currently planned.\n\nPublished on the blog of Beth Israel Deaconess CIO John Halamka, the letter starts out by recognizing the success of meaningful use in driving EHR adoption into 80 percent of healthcare organizations, but quickly points out that \u201cwe must now turn our attention to ensuring that all of the practices in our respective communities have high-functioning technology to achieve interoperability across all care settings.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur collective experience with MU has shown that the current measures and pass-fail approach deter participation,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cIn particular, the MU program has diverted clinician, staff, and other resources away from activities with greater patient benefit and has forced technology to develop in a way that limits innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Stage 3 final rule, like its predecessor rules, is too focused on pass-fail requirements and lacks emphasis on outcomes,\u201d said the organizations. Stage 3 also lacks the ability to truly address foundational interoperability concerns, as it causes health information to be \u201cshoehorned into a format that was designed for MU measures, and not in a way that accommodates the needs of physicians and patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy maintaining this flawed structure, we do not believe Stage 3 will support movement towards more innovative care models or encourage continued participation.\u201d\n\nHalamka adds that following Slavitt\u2019s speech, the unhappy healthcare organizations are \u201coptimistic\u201d that appropriate changes may materialize.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, what are the odds?\n\nSlavitt may have big plans for 2016 and beyond, but is the end of meaningful use really as certain as naysayers might hope? After all, as Acting Administrator, Slavitt has yet to face a confirmation hearing that would put him firmly in charge.\n\nCongress has already it made abundantly clear that politics will play a major role in that process, and Slavitt\u2019s history in healthcare is not completely clear of blemishes. Partisan bickering and his own experience with the rocky rollout of Healthcare.gov may cause him problems in front of a legislature still tussling over the fate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIndeed, even bigger changes may be afoot for CMS and its regulatory plans as the Obama Administration bows out, said Robert Tennant, Senior Policy Advisor at the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA), to HealthITAnalytics.com in April, immediately after the release of the initial Stage 3 proposed rule.\n\n\u201cSomething important is happening in 2016, and it\u2019s called a presidential election,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a brand new administration. And as a student of politics, I can tell you that no new president comes in and simply says, \u2018Oh, yeah, whatever policies my predecessor had, we\u2019ll just continue those.\u2019 That never happens, even if we stay within the same party. So, the reality is that everything could change.\u201d\n\nIt may be too early to throw a farewell party for meaningful use, but Slavitt\u2019s bold assertions that CMS is ready to face a future of increased transparency, responsiveness, and streamlined operations likely bodes well for providers who have previously had little insight into what was churning under the surface of the federal agency.\n\n\u201cFrom my not-so-distant past, I remember how CMS often felt opaque to me, and I probably said more than once how helpful it would be to know CMS\u2019s agenda rather than divining them by poring through an often intricate set of regulations like they were Fed minutes,\u201d Slavitt said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m blessed to be here now because in many ways the day-to-day work of CMS at this point in time is to start up new consumer and provider-facing capabilities and then scale them, nurture and mature them. It demands we change our culture and execute with clarity, with discipline, and with collaboration. Things we haven\u2019t always been known for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe maintain our cultural focus on listening and learning that we really launched in earnest this year,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe are committed to continuing to work side-by-side with you to make this happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will CMS scrap meaningful use in 2016 and focus instead on improving health data interoperability as it looks towards a future of value-based care?", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/cms-gets-deadly-serious-about-interoperability-as-mu-fades", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-503802319.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "CMS Gets \u201cDeadly Serious\u201d About Interoperability as MU Fades"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will CMS scrap meaningful use in 2016 and focus instead on improving health data interoperability as it looks towards a future of value-based care?", "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-503802319.jpg"}, "title": "CMS Gets \u201cDeadly Serious\u201d About Interoperability as MU Fades", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Expensive EHR replacements and required upgrades to new editions of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) left providers with empty pockets and a sour taste in their mouths.\nIn 2016, \u201cthe meaningful use program as it has existed, will\u2026be effectively over and replaced with something better,\u201d Slavitt stated.\nAfter years of back-and-forth proposals, last-minute exemptions, extensions, and broad modifications related to the EHR Incentive Programs, Slavitt bluntly told his audience exactly what many of them wanted to hear.\nAs with so many other government initiatives, many observers would argue that the ends don\u2019t justify the means.\nAfter all, as Acting Administrator, Slavitt has yet to face a confirmation hearing that would put him firmly in charge."}
