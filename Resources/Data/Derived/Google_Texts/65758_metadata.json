What kind of shape is it in? In simplest terms, the diagnosis is mixed.\n\nAmong college-educated, relatively affluent couples, marriage is doing pretty well. Where education and income levels are lower, it\u2019s often a different story \u2014 higher divorce rates; far more children being born out of wedlock, including many to single mothers.\n\nThere\u2019s broad sentiment that this \u201cmarriage gap\u201d is unfortunate, but no consensus on what to do about it. Some believe government-funded marriage-promotion programs can make a difference. Others depict marriage-focused solutions as misguided and say the problems can be eased only by broader economic and social initiatives benefiting all types of households.\n\n\u201cThere is no one silver bullet,\u201d said David Blankenhorn, head of a centrist think-tank, the Institute for American Values, that focuses much of its work on marriage and families.\n\nYet despite uncertainty about solutions, he and others believe there is now an opportunity to bridge the left-right split over marriage, particularly in light of the sweeping gains for gay and lesbian couples.\n\nFor many years, the gay-marriage debate was intertwined with assertions about \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d between a man and a woman. A federal act passed in 1996 and a subsequent wave of amendments adopted in many states used the term \u201cdefense of marriage\u201d to deny recognition to same-sex unions. Many opponents of same-sex marriage argued that allowing gays to wed would somehow undermine heterosexual marriage.\n\nSuch arguments have fared poorly in recent federal court cases. And there\u2019s a strong likelihood that the Supreme Court will order the legalization of same-sex marriage in all 50 states in a ruling expected soon. Opinion polls show a solid majority of Americans support it.\n\n\u201cMarriage as culture war in America can now be replaced by marriage as common cause,\u201d said a coalition of scholars and civic leaders in their manifesto for a new initiative called Marriage Opportunity.\n\nThe group, with Blankenhorn as an organizer, envisions liberals fighting for economic opportunity, conservatives fighting for stronger families and gays who have now won marriage rights for themselves all uniting to confront the marriage gap.\n\nScholars who have chronicled the gap say it stems in large measure from the loss of stable, well-paid industrial jobs \u2014 consigning many young adults to precarious, low-paid work, and prompting some to put off marriage even while having children out of wedlock.\n\nIn contrast, college-educated young adults are more likely to wait until marriage to have children and then have the prospect of raising them in a household supported by two good incomes.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, the share of American adults who\u2019ve never married is at a historic high. In 2012, 20 percent of adults 25 and older had never been married, compared to 9 percent of adults in 1960. Back then, according to Pew, the likelihood of being married didn\u2019t vary according to level of education; now men with advanced degrees are far more likely to have married than those who didn\u2019t go beyond high school.\n\nAnother striking figure: Unmarried mothers account for 40.6 percent of children born in the U.S., according to recent Census data. In the African-American community, the rate is 71.5 percent.\n\nTera Jordan, a professor of human development at Iowa State University, has studied various aspects of marriage and relationships among black Americans.\n\nShe sees a need for multiple changes \u2014 more access to good-paying jobs, better educational opportunities, a lowering of the incarceration rate for young black men. Her advice to young adults wondering about marriage: \u201cBe clear about your goals, be patient. Finish your education.\u201d\n\nBefore moving to Iowa, Jordan worked with a federally funded marriage-strengthening program in Georgia. In all, according to experts who study the field, more than $1 billion in public funding has been spent since 2005 on such programs, yet their effectiveness remains subject to debate.\n\nThe largest, most durable state-level program is the Oklahoma Marriage Initiative, recently renamed Project Relate. Since its launch in 1999, it has served more than 400,000 Oklahomans \u2014 about 10 percent of the population.\n\nOne of its primary programs, Family Expectations, entails 30 hours of classes for low-income expectant parents who want to strengthen their relationships. Independent assessments found that couples taking the program are more likely to stay together than other couples.\n\nKendy Cox, a senior director of Project Relate, said many low-income couples believe in the concept of marriage, yet are unsure if it\u2019s the right step for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become seen as sort of pie in the sky for some couples,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong Family Expectations\u2019 graduates is Rachel Chudoba, 27. She and her then-fiance, Chad \u2014 now her husband \u2014 were 19 when they signed up in 2007; they\u2019re now parents of a son and a daughter.\n\nChudoba said communications skills they learned came in handy when Chad, a member of the Army National Guard, was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to acknowledge that you need a timeout in a conversation when you don\u2019t get to talk very often,\u201d Chudoba said. \u201cBut being separated for a year, you are going to have disagreements.\u201d\n\nChudoba said she and her husband came from challenging backgrounds. Both of Rachel\u2019s parents had multiple divorces; Chad spent time in foster care.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of positive examples of how to have a relationship and how to raise children,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a huge thing for me and my husband \u2014 not repeating the mistakes of the older generation.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of her extended family are in their early 20s, and wondering about marriage. \u201cI see people who are apprehensive,\u201d Chudoba said. \u201cI see a lot of looking for answers.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.
