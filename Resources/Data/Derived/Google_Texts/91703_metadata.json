Behind the seductive commercials for breakthrough treatments, multinational brands and technocrats are concocting supranational policies to hold poor patients hostage to pharmaceutical markets across the Global South through elaborate intellectual property schemes in international trade. And while the industry sutures the future of medicine to the business of exploiting disease, poor countries serve as an incubator for neoliberal policies that boost the industry\u2019s power in Washington, capitalizing on regional inequality to degrade public health on a global scale.\n\nThe struggle for access to medicine presents a legal and ethical minefield for rich and poor countries alike\u2014one that is being fought out as humanitarians challenge corporations over intellectual property rights. A recent landmark decision by the Indian Supreme Court thrust that conflict into popular awareness. The ruling blocked a request by the global pharmaceutical giant Novartis for a patent on a Leukemia drug, Gleevec. The company claimed to be introducing a new formulation of the drug that warranted a fresh patent. But the court determined that the new Gleevec was virtually identical to the old one. This cleared the way for mass production of a much cheaper generic version. While a cancer patient in the United States might spend around $70,000 for Gleevec, India\u2019s version could cost as little as $2,500.\n\nThe defeat of Novartis sent shockwaves across the drug industry. Companies have long structured their profit systems around an obscure set of intellectual property controls, and the ruling represented a growing global pushback against their political and commercial hegemony. The case raised a preeminent question in the struggle for global health equity: when the laws of commerce override the human right to medicine, can society protect public health from unbridled private markets?\n\nIn the United States and other rich industrialized nations, \u201cbig pharma\u201d is already the gatekeeper for life-saving medicines. The Global South is the next frontier in the patent war, where public health advocates form the front line against an industry seeking to colonize nascent health care markets. The Novartis ruling is just one of many legal showdowns that have embroiled the drug industry in recent years. Meanwhile, corporations are pushing back through trade deals and other intellectual property reforms. The outcome could be devastating\u2014stripping government and citizens of authority over health care costs and lavishing more market power on top drug manufacturers. The mechanisms by which the drug companies pursue this power, however, are off the public radar, designed by international bodies determined to evade democratic control.\n\nThough the Novartis case jarred drug makers, their lobbyists have been working for years to secure their global market share with regional and bilateral \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements aimed at erecting draconian transnational intellectual property regimes. Just as the ink was drying on the Novartis decision, the European Union was hammering out a pending free trade deal with India that would harden intellectual property protections. Commercial rules etched into the deal would encourage the \u201cevergreening\u201d of medicine patents, where companies can repeatedly extend patents (often by inserting, for instance, a new inert ingredient) and thereby undermine efforts to sell the same drugs at cheaper prices\u2014precisely the kind of corporate practice that the Indian court rebuffed.\n\nIndia\u2019s patent landscape is pivotal because it is one of the world\u2019s largest generic drug producers, supplying much of the Global South\u2019s medicine markets with cheaper analogs of their exorbitantly priced Western counterparts. The Indian generics industry is on track to grow from about $11 to $74 billion by 2020, according to industry financial estimates, making up for low prices with sheer volume. And since India\u2019s patent law structure is still developing, many Western brand-name drugs like Gleevec were first marketed there without a patent and are finding local health authorities resistant to those drugs\u2019 conversion into pricey, brand-name equivalents.\n\nThe struggle for access to medicine presents a legal and ethical minefield for rich and poor countries alike\u2014one that is being fought out as humanitarians challenge corporations over intellectual property rights.\n\nIn April Cambodian activists issued a statement in opposition to the EU trade deal with India, warning that the price of medicine would skyrocket and cost lives. The coalition of self-described representatives of \u201cgarment workers, sex workers, entertainment workers, people living with HIV, LGBTs, university students, feminists and human rights activists from different networks and organisations\u201d told the European negotiators of the importance of made-in-India drugs for millions of people. The trade deal, they argued, \u201cmust stop right now. It is a true example of putting profits before people\u2019s lives and [taking] advantage of people\u2019s illness for corporate profits. Our lives should not be regarded as a business opportunity.\u201d\n\nTheir protest comes in the face of an even larger pending agreement: the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TTP), a free trade scheme central to the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia.\u201d Intellectual property provisions in the leaked draft of the agreement seem designed precisely to preempt \u201ctrade barriers\u201d that protect access to medicines. Covering twelve countries in the Pacific Rim (Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States), the TPP has triggered worldwide opposition, with many anti-globalization groups warning that it would entail an array of neoliberal policies aimed at undermining the autonomy of national governments, eviscerating protections for local industries, and attacking health and environmental regulations.\n\nNegotiators are now weighing numerous provisions that could dramatically impact future access to affordable drugs. According to an analysis by public health advocates with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, the proposed policies \u201cwould make it extremely difficult for generic competitors to enter the market, keeping prices unaffordably high, with devastating public health consequences.\u201d\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry\u2019s chief aim, activists fear, is to establish a new global standard for governing the control of patents, empowering companies to control medicine markets more expansively and for longer periods of time.\n\nThe TPP would set a broad standard patent term of twenty years, with opportunities for extensions. Moreover, at the behest of U.S. negotiators, it could tighten the exemptions allowed under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, a set of rules governing patents, intellectual property, and copyright set by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Expanding TRIPS is a key plank in Washington\u2019s market-liberalization agenda to dismantle trade barriers and encourage corporate consolidation in emerging markets in technology and medicine\u2014ironically, under the banner of making trade more \u201cfree.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cU.S. proposal for the TPP would make it more difficult to reject\u201d evergreening patents such as the one involved in the Novartis case, says Krista Cox, a staff attorney with the intellectual property policy think tank Knowledge Ecology International. That would pave the way for drug industry giants to avoid the kind of public interest challenges at issue in the Indian court, thus easing market expansion throughout the Pacific Rim.\n\nOne especially harsh proposal raised in the ongoing trade talks would bar a legal mechanism known as \u201cpre-grant opposition,\u201d which currently enables civil society groups to oppose pending patent applications by challenging the validity of the proposal. Without pre-grant opposition, a patent would typically have to be challenged via the courts, which could stymie generic competition for years as the litigation is pending, even if the patent is ultimately found to be invalid.\n\nThough the TPP has not been finalized, U.S. and EU negotiators are working to shape a framework that would affix in international law the structural asymmetries in health care access between rich and poor nations. Activists say these deals aim not only to penetrate \u201cemerging\u201d pharmaceuticals markets in participating countries, but to spread neoliberal policies around the world that would bolster corporate power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that the TPP is, in part, a closed-door hemispheric rule-making against public health,\u201d says Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Access to Medicine program. The Obama administration\u2019s free trade agenda, he adds, actually threatens to unravel some of the hard-fought gains in access to medical treatment that were initiated under the Bush administration\u2019s international HIV/AIDS initiatives.\n\nFrom an economic development perspective, \u201cmiddle-income\u201d countries that produce generics, like India, could face a double blow: patients would be hit with overpriced brand-name drugs in domestic markets, and their generic medicine industries would face an assault from multinationals.\n\nBut the politics of free trade in drug markets have a way of creeping northward from the Global South as well. Health advocates say free trade deals enable rich states to implement pro-corporate policy frameworks abroad and then import them back home under the guise of neoliberal \u201creform.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the trade in medicine, the Global South\u2014with an anemic regulatory infrastructure and legions of desperately poor patients\u2014makes a perfect petri dish for such \u201cpolicy laundering.\u201d Intellectual property rules that expand the already enormous U.S. and European drug industry might provoke opposition if aired on the floor of the U.S. Congress, but might be eased through in a closed-door session among non-elected international trade representatives. This kind of shadow politics is illustrated in Washington\u2019s promotion of \u201canti-counterfeiting\u201d protections in trade deals, which parallel similar digital piracy policies that lawmakers unsuccessfully tried to push in Congress amid fierce public outcry. Even though digital-rights activists prevailed against the Stop Online Piracy Act on Capitol Hill, the same kinds of structures are at play internationally in more shadowy political arenas: insider negotiations over intellectual property rules in pending U.S.-backed trade accords, including the TPP, have threatened to bolster transnational monopolies in software and other products.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that sometimes people in the U.S. don\u2019t realize,\u201d says Brook Baker, a senior policy adviser at the Health Global Access Project, an HIV/AIDS-focused advocacy group. \u201cThese trade agreements not only tie our trade partners\u2019 hands, they tie our hands, too, in terms of policy. It\u2019s really a back door effort by big pharma and other IP [intellectual property] industries\u2026[T]hey seek all these heightened IP protections in trade agreements, and then they come back and bite us.\u201d\n\nFree Trade Rules\n\nThe purported idea behind intellectual property protections is to create market incentives for innovation\u2014in the case of the pharmaceuticals industry, guaranteeing a return on sales for drugs. The value proposition gets muddy when humanitarian needs and market dynamics diverge\u2014when malaria treatments for a rural village, for example, turn vastly less profit than the hot new anti-depressant. Or when a drug\u2019s price is derived almost entirely from the label on the box.\n\nThe generic drug sector operates on a different tier of the market. With production driven in large part by India-based firms, it still operates within a market-based system, but generics are exponentially more affordable for poor communities compared to the prices charged by dominant pharmaceutical brands. Cheap generics are the crux of global campaigns to expand HIV/AIDS treatment and other medical solutions for patients in poor countries, supplying UNICEF and the U.S.-sponsored PEPFAR program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A landmark ruling against Novartis highlights practices that make healthcare unaffordable in developing countries", "title": "How drug companies price patients out of survival", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/02/how_drug_companies_price_patients_out_of_survival_partner/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "A landmark ruling against Novartis highlights practices that make healthcare unaffordable in developing countries", "title": "How drug companies price patients out of survival"}, "twitter": {"description": "A landmark ruling against Novartis highlights practices that make healthcare unaffordable in developing countries", "title": "How drug companies price patients out of survival", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Michelle Chen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dissent Magazine, drug companies, India, Inequality, Novartis, patents, Pharmaceutical companies", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcec9\"", "article_summary": "The Novartis ruling is just one of many legal showdowns that have embroiled the drug industry in recent years.\nThe defeat of Novartis sent shockwaves across the drug industry.\nThe ruling blocked a request by the global pharmaceutical giant Novartis for a patent on a Leukemia drug, Gleevec.\nCompanies have long structured their profit systems around an obscure set of intellectual property controls, and the ruling represented a growing global pushback against their political and commercial hegemony.\nMeanwhile, corporations are pushing back through trade deals and other intellectual property reforms."}
