The \u201cbig three\u201d TV networks offered gavel-to-gavel coverage, and the parties\u2019 eventual contenders emerged slowly and methodically as ballots were cast.\n\nFor the 1968 conventions, with the American public turning against the Vietnam War and amid arrests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, last-place ABC took a gamble on something different: pitting conservative William F. Buckley with liberal firebrand Gore Vidal for a series of point-counterpoint conversations.\n\nThe strategy worked. Viewers tuned in by the millions to watch the founder of National Review go toe-to-toe with the effete writer of \u201cMyra Breckenridge\u201d in a series of increasingly heated exchanges.\n\n\u201cI loved the idea of two titans of thought and language going head to head. It all felt like a story that needed to be told now,\u201d said Robert Gordon, co-director of \u201cBest of Enemies,\u201d a documentary about the infamous debates that recently showed at the District\u2019s AFI Docs film festival and which will open in the area Friday.\n\nMr. Gordon and his collaborator, Morgan Neville, not only parsed the footage of the Buckley-Vidal debates but also interviewed, over the course of a half-decade, Dick Cavett, Christopher Hitchens and Buckley\u2019s own brother to gain insight into how the fierce tet-a-tet defined both men for the remainder of their lives.\n\n\u201cThe whole ABC media story was something we didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Neville. \u201cWe knew a bit about it, but we didn\u2019t know how big a part of the story that was going to become until we really started talking to newspeople who were there at the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to highlights of a unique moment in American political theater, \u201cBest of Enemies\u201d also makes the case that the Buckley-Vidal debates were at least partly responsible for the ascendancy of the 24-hour news cycle \u2014 far more populated with talking heads and \u201canalysts\u201d than actual reporting. Mr. Gordon said that when he saw the footage of Buckley and Vidal, \u201cit spoke immediately to me of the present and the culture wars. It was as if a forecast were being made in 1968, and it turned out to be very accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was \u2018the\u2019 moment, but I would say this was one of the moments that accelerated the direction that things went,\u201d concurred Mr. Neville. \u201cI think ABC needed something to happen. They were looking for sparks, and they got a fire.\u201d\n\nIn the final debate, on Aug. 28, 1968, the dialectic went off the rails, devolving into ad hominen attacks from both sides. As the shouting escalated, Vidal called Buckley a \u201ccryto-Nazi\u201d; the National Review editor, rather out of character, lost his temper and hurled the world \u201cqueer\u201d at his opponent, much to the shock and consternation of the ABC brass and the censors.\n\nThe bottom line, however, told a different story.\n\n\u201cI think initially ABC was embarrassed about what happened, but everyone else looked at the ratings and realized that people wanted to watch this,\u201d Mr. Neville said. \u201cAnd what I think is tragic, in a way, is that Buckley and Vidal were both very smart men who, for the most part, were not this petty and personal on television. I think it was not their finest moment, but I think what the networks got from it is that you don\u2019t need people of intelligence to create sparks; you just need the sparks.\u201d\n\nLess than a decade later, Sidney Lumet\u2019s film \u201cNetwork\u201d satirized a near-future where news is effectively replaced by shock and bloviation, with the ranting Howard Beale (Peter Finch, in his Oscar-winning \u2014 and final \u2014 film performance) exhorting the public to get \u201cmad as hell\u201d and not take it anymore.\n\nLife imitated art, with CNN going on the air in 1980, soon enough filling its round-the-clock roster with commentators in addition to coverage. Fox News and the rest weren\u2019t far behind. Arguably, Howard Beale is the fictional grandfather of figureheads like Glenn Beck.\n\n\u201cCommentary is cheap,\u201d Mr. Neville said of the 24-hour news outlets. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to send camera people to foreign countries. You can just have people come into the studio and talk.\u201d\n\nThe filmmakers maintain that their aim in realizing \u201cBest of Enemies\u201d was not to \u201cside\u201d with one man or \u201cget caught up in the left and right of it,\u201d but rather to elucidate the ways in which people argue.\n\nMr. Neville hopes that substantive debate can be had on television, especially during next year\u2019s elections, rather than the theatrics of the \u201cstraw men\u201d of cable news, which he said would \u201cbe something that would actually be good for our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Gordon adds that what is needed in the 21st century is a \u201cfailing network\u201d to rejigger the cable news model to be a more civilized bastion of debate rather than the home of polemics it is now.\n\n\u201cLet us try this insane idea of giving smart people room to have real dialogue, and let\u2019s see if we can develop an audience,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gordon believes one reason that Buckley, still held up as a bastion of conservative thought, could not flourish in the contemporary media culture is that there is \u201cno place to grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, it\u2019s plastic window dressing,\u201d Mr. Gordon said of the current media environment. \u201cIt\u2019s about how commentary on TV has become, instead of about the comment, about appearance. That\u2019s why there are no Buckleys, there are no more Vidals, because where will they make themselves known?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, it\u2019s not about the substance,\u201d said Mr. Neville. \u201cIt\u2019s just about the conflict.\u201d\n\nWhile the National Review sponsored one of the screenings of \u201cBest of Enemies\u201d at AFI Docs, Buckley\u2019s son, Christopher, refused to be interviewed by the filmmakers.\n\nBuckley died in 2008; Vidal followed him in 2012. In addition to archival footage of the two men, Mr. Neville and Mr. Gordon brought in Hollywood heavyweights Kelsey Grammer and John Lithgow to read the words of Buckley and Vidal, respectively, off-camera.\n\n\u201cI take it as a high compliment that both sides, fans of each man, are fans of the movie,\u201d said Mr. Gordon. \u201cBecause I think that indicates we achieved the goal of not making it about the argument but about how we argue \u2014 not making it about one side or the other but about how the sides come together and have fallen apart.\u201d\n\nAlthough acolytes of both Buckley and Vidal praise the film, the rift between the men never healed. Each wrote scathing attack pieces about the other \u2014 which led to libel suits and countersuits \u2014 long after the \u201868 election was settled and Richard Nixon became president. Upon Buckley\u2019s 2008 passing, Vidal wrote a \u201cnonobituary\u201d on TruthDig in which he cheerily decreed of his old adversary: \u201cRIP WFB \u2014 in hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo [Vidal], having him and Buckley\u2019s name in the same sentence only works if the words \u2018conquered Buckley\u2018 was in there,\u201d said Mr. Neville. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like being treated on an equal playing field.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As quaint as it may now seem, there was a time when the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees were unknown until the conventions.
