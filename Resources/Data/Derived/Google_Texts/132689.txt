SAN DIEGO (AP) — Season 5 of The CW’s “The Vampire Diaries” ended with characters Damon and Bonnie (played by Ian Somerhalder and Kat Graham) being separated from their loved ones as they enter a mysterious, purgatory-like dimension.

The cast returned to Comic-Con on Saturday where they played a video of Somerhalder and Graham wondering about their fate off-screen, now that their characters are trapped in oblivion. Are they off the show? Will they get a spin-off?

Somerhalder, Graham along with Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, Matt Davis and showrunner Julie Plec attended the panel to tease the new season premiering Oct. 6 at 8 p.m. EDT.

“The Vampire Diaries” is a about vampires, werewolves, doppelgangers, witches and a few humans living in and around the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia. It’s loosely based on a book-series.
