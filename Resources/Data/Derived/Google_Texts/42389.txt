President Obama made a surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan today, according to the Associated Press. The visit comes a day prior to the Memorial Day holiday, which remembers those who have died in service to our country.

At Bagram Airfield, the president spoke to around 3,000 troops, thanking them for their service and promising a “responsible end” to the war in Afghanistan by the close of this year. The war began over a decade ago, and has claimed the lives of 2,184 U.S. Military service members, as of May 23, 4014, according to a report from Defense.gov.

“I thank you as your commander in chief because you inspire me,” President Obama said, according to the New York Times. “I’m here to say thank you. And I’m here to say how proud I am of you.”

President Obama would not be meeting with outgoing Afghanistan president, Hamid Karzai during the trip. A presidential election is scheduled for June 14 of this year, and Obama has said he’ll work with either of the candidates in the future.

“Once Afghanistan has sworn in its new president, I’m hopeful we will sign a bilateral security agreement that lets us move forward,” Obama said, the Times reported. “And with that bilateral security agreement, assuming it is signed, we can plan for a limited military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014.”
