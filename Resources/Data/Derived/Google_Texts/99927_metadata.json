But the exemptions already contained within the bill, gay rights activists fear, provide a blue print for employers to discriminate against gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender peoples in the context of the Hobby Lobby decision.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby has made it all the more important that we not accept this inappropriate provision,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and four LGBT groups wrote in withdrawing their support for ENDA. \u201cBecause opponents of LGBT equality are already misreading that decision as having broadly endorsed rights to discriminate against others, we cannot accept a bill that sanctions discrimination and declares that discrimination against LGBT people is more acceptable than other kinds of discrimination.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe decision also puts Obama in a bind over a promised executive order banning companies that do business with the federal government from discriminating against LGBT employees. Religious groups and leaders, including Rick Warren, who delivered the invocation at Obama\u2019s first inaugural, and Michael Wear, who worked in Obama\u2019s faith-based initiatives office in his first term and on faith outreach in his reelection campaign, wrote the President on the day of the Hobby Lobby decision to ask for increased religious exemptions from the federal rule. The idea is that in order to do business with the federal government, many religious groups would have to go against their core beliefs that only heterosexual married sex is condoned in the eyes of God. Religious charities work closely with the government in development and education at home and abroad.\n\nSo the rule, whenever it is issued, will likely either offend religious or gay groups.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmakers from both chambers of Congress on Wednesday introduced legislation to address the Hobby Lobby decision. The bill would reinforce the language in the original Affordable Care Act that guarantees health insurance coverage of contraception.\n\n\u201cAfter five justices decided last week that an employer\u2019s personal views can interfere with women\u2019s access to essential health services, we in Congress need to act quickly to right this wrong,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and one of bills\u2019 cosponsors. \u201cThis bicameral legislation will ensure that no CEO or corporation can come between people and their guaranteed access to health care, period. I hope Republicans will join us to revoke this court-issued license to discriminate and return the right of Americans to make their own decisions, about their own health care and their own bodies.\u201d\n\nThus far no Republicans have signed on, and although a handful of Republicans voted for ENDA, it is unlikely given their universal opposition to Obamacare that any will sign on to Murray\u2019s bill, entitled the Protect Women\u2019s Health from Corporate Interference Act. The Democratic push is sure to anger religious groups, which objected to and sued the governmentto change the original Obamacare language \u2014 all of which means the bill will likely have a tough time passing the Senate and is a non-starter in the House.\n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat and the only openly gay senator, was the lead co-sponsor of ENDA. She said on Tuesday that she is looking at revising her bill to reflect the Hobby Lobby decision. She will surely be watching closely whatever language the White House lawyers come up with for Obama\u2019s executive order. Finding a way to appease women, gays and religious groups is looking increasingly hard. A cynic\u2019s answer to how this plays out is: Ahead of the midterm elections, is which group is the least important at the polls?", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Obama's seminal gay rights legislation is the latest casualty of the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "How the Supreme Court\u2019s contraction decision brought down the President\u2019s signature gay rights legislation", "title": "Hobby Lobby Puts Obama Between God and Gays", "url": "http://time.com/2970055/hobby-lobby-obama/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/barack-obama2.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/barack-obama2.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Hobby Lobby Puts Obama Between God and Gays", "description": "How the Supreme Court\u2019s contraction decision brought down the President\u2019s signature gay rights legislation", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "barack obama, god, gays, lgbt, hobby lobby, supreme court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "barack obama, god, gays, lgbt, hobby lobby, supreme court"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86af\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers from both chambers of Congress on Wednesday introduced legislation to address the Hobby Lobby decision.\nShe said on Tuesday that she is looking at revising her bill to reflect the Hobby Lobby decision.\nBut the exemptions already contained within the bill, gay rights activists fear, provide a blue print for employers to discriminate against gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender peoples in the context of the Hobby Lobby decision.\nFinding a way to appease women, gays and religious groups is looking increasingly hard.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s seminal gay rights legislation has become the latest casualty of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow Hobby Lobby to deny their employees contraception on religious grounds."}
