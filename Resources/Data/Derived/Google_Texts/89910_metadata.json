Except for one thing: There is a good chance they\u2019ll never work again.\n\nThese are the sobering conclusions of a new paper by three Princeton University economists including Alan B. Krueger, the former chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors. The paper, presented Thursday at the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, is part of a growing body of research showing that the prospects of people who lose jobs deteriorate rapidly unless they find new jobs quickly.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis has important, but opposite, implications for monetary and fiscal policymakers. It suggests the Federal Reserve has limited power to reduce long-term unemployment without tolerating higher inflation, which Professor Kreuger and his colleagues argue is affected primarily by the level of short-term unemployment. At the same time, it suggests that legislators acting with greater force and urgency could help people whose hopes are slipping away.\n\n\u201cOvercoming the obstacles that prevent many of the long-term unemployed from finding gainful employment, even in good times,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwill likely require a concerted effort by policy makers, social organizations, communities and families, in addition to appropriate monetary policy.\u201d\n\nThe idea that the long-term unemployed are on the margins of the labor market, exerting little pressure on wages or prices, is relatively new. On Wednesday I asked Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, what she thought of papers that have reached the same conclusions as Mr. Krueger\u2019s group.\n\n\u201cI think it would be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on either how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market,\u201d she responded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t endorse \u2014 I certainly don\u2019t think our committee would endorse the judgment of the research that you cited.\u201d\n\nThe basic argument made by the new paper, and others like it, is that the long-standing relationship between movements in inflation and unemployment, which appeared to break down during the Great Recession and its aftermath, can be restored by writing off long-term unemployment. The Phillips curve, a description of this relationship, predicted a decline of one percentage point per year between 2009 and 2013. The actual average was just 0.2 percentage points.\n\nAdjust for \u2013 which is to say, ignore \u2013 long-term unemployment and voila! The difference almost completely vanishes.\n\nPeople are only counted among the long-term unemployed if they say they are still looking for jobs. As time passes, people tend to give up, and those who do are no longer counted as members of the labor force. So why do the people who persist in trying become less successful with time?\n\n\u201cEither because, on the supply side, they grow discouraged and search for a job less intensively or because, on the demand side, employers discriminate against the long-term unemployed, based on the (rational or irrational) expectation that there is a productivity-related reason that accounts for their long jobless spell,\u201d the new paper says. It adds that the two explanations are complementary, \u201cas statistical discrimination against the long-term unemployed could lead to discouragement, and skill erosion that accompanies long-term unemployment could induce employers to discriminate against the long-term unemployed.\u201d\n\nBut there is no necessity to this explanation, and the paper itself contains some countervailing findings. It notes that the long-term unemployed tend to be older and more highly educated, suggesting their labor is relatively more expensive, and their prospects may improve with the economy.\n\nThe paper also presents striking evidence that few people are finding jobs in new industries. Professor Krueger and his colleagues draw the conclusion that government may be able to help. The authors write, \u201cThese results suggest that assisting unemployed workers to transition to expanding sectors of the economy, such as health care, professional and business services, and management, is a major challenge.\u201d But if long-term unemployment is more common in industries recovering more slowly, because would-be workers are trapped in those industries, this too suggests that the problem may be economic rather than personal.\n\nThere is a way to resolve the question. Fiscal and monetary policy makers could try to help, and we could all see what happens.\n\nInstead, the debate seems increasingly likely to remain purely academic, and the long-term unemployed permanently lost.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140320150246, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Krueger, Alan B", "org": "Federal Reserve System", "keywords": "Krueger Alan B,Labor and Jobs,Unemployment,Federal Reserve System,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Unemployed?
