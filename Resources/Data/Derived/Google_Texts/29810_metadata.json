He has brought in strong organizational talent. His alliances are multiplying in the early nominating states. And his standing among the grassroots has never been better. But one important area remains a source of concern: fundraising.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt\u2019s a vulnerability Cruz is working to address. Earlier this month, the senator slipped away to Los Angeles for a series of meetings with top GOP donors, a trip that included a dinner at the California Club with a group of some 20 Republicans who served as bundlers for Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nConservative radio host Hugh Hewitt moderated the event, and said many of the attendees\u2013whom he described as \u201cSteve Forbes Republicans\u201d\u2013came away impressed. \u201cThere were blunt electability questions,\u201d Hewitt said. By the time Cruz departed the dinner, he added, \u201cthey were all very, very pleasantly surprised.\u201d\n\nHewitt declined to repeat Cruz\u2019s argument for his own electability, but said: \u201cHe\u2019s in the process of proving to people that he\u2019s more Reagan than Goldwater. Opponents of his want to stick the Goldwater tag on him, so his challenge is proving that he\u2019s more Reagan than Goldwater.\u201d\n\nThe California swing came on the heels of a whirlwind tour through Manhattan in late November, which included a lengthy one-on-one meeting with GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. Cruz aimed in both trips to correct what he calls a media-driven \u201ccaricature\u201d of himself\u2013one that took hold last year after he spearheaded a strategy to defund the Affordable Care Act that ultimately led to a government shutdown.\n\nDespite the recent coastal visits, Cruz\u2019s charm offensive begins in his own backyard, with some of the same Texas donors who shunned him two years ago.\n\nRead the rest of the story here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016: Ted Cruz Woos Big Money GOP Donors", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "2016: Ted Cruz Woos Big Money GOP Donors", "title": "2016: Ted Cruz Woos Big Money GOP Donors - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Republicans/cruz-hand-up-ap.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-17T18:54:11-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/16/2016-ted-cruz-woos-big-money-gop-donors/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2016: Ted Cruz Woos Big Money GOP Donors", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Republicans/cruz-hand-up-ap.jpg", "title": "2016: Ted Cruz Woos Big Money GOP Donors - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mitt Romney, Senate, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-12-16T19:28:12-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2014-12-17T18:54:11-07:00", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb797\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom National Journal:The foundation of a Cruz presidential campaign looks solid.\nDespite the recent coastal visits, Cruz\u2019s charm offensive begins in his own backyard, with some of the same Texas donors who shunned him two years ago.\nConservative radio host Hugh Hewitt moderated the event, and said many of the attendees\u2013whom he described as \u201cSteve Forbes Republicans\u201d\u2013came away impressed.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt\u2019s a vulnerability Cruz is working to address.\n\u201cThere were blunt electability questions,\u201d Hewitt said."}
