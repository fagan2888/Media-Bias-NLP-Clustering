And there was a photo stand where attendees could have pictures taken of themselves and their families.\n\nWhether one person or 10, \u201cyou can have your photo taken,\u201d Salvation Army Divisional Commander Lt. Col. Dan Starrett said.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful they support us, because we are a poor family,\u201d said Marisol Veana, 23, who came to the event with her daughter, Ashley, 3, and other members of her family.\n\nThe children, she said, wanted to open the presents right away. \u201cThey want to open them now, but they have to wait until midnight.\u201d\n\nDanitza Morales, 8, sat patiently, coloring at a table with seven other members of her family as they waited to have dinner. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would sit on Santa\u2019s lap,\u201d she said with a smile.\n\n\u201cThis is great,\u201d said her mother, Marisa Gutierrez, 47.\n\nRyan Johnson, 28, volunteered to help, and brought along his two young children and his wife, Kayla, 29.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is what life is all about; it puts in perspective how fortunate you are,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event was a chance for his son Leon, 4 and daughter, Aria, 2, to learn about those who have less, he said.\n\nRon Kay, 52, and his son, Ben, 17, also volunteered to help. \u201cAs a kid its not the biggest thing you want to do on Christmas Eve,\u201d Ben said. \u201cBut it is really great to see how you are helping people out.\n\n\u201cI want our family to keep doing this because it is a great thing to do and it is what the season is about.\u201d\n\nSafeway provided 850 pounds of ham, 200 pounds of potatoes, 10 cases of cranberry sauce and 250 pies for the meal, and 70 of the grocery chain\u2019s employees were among the corps of volunteers.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Salvation Army feeds Christmas dinner to Denver needy", "title": "Salvation Army feeds Christmas dinner to Denver needy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/24/salvation-army-feeds-christmas-dinner-to-denver-needy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224_111727_army.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224_111727_army.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-24T19:20:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:16:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Whether one person or 10, \u201cyou can have your photo taken,\u201d Salvation Army Divisional Commander Lt.
