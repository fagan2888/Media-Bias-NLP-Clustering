Pixabay\n\nFrom spelt in the Bronze Age to baked goods in modern grocery stores, wheat \u2014 and its corresponding protein component, gluten \u2014 has been a prevalent component of human meals throughout the ages. Yet the gluten-free diet has become an increasingly popular trend due to fears of gluten sensitivity and digestive problems. What many people don\u2019t realize, however, is that gluten is a natural component of most whole grains, and we\u2019ve been consuming it since we first started cultivating said grains.\n\nGluten is a Latin word that means \u201cglue,\u201d due to its ability to hold grains like wheat, barley, and rye together. It\u2019s a protein composite that gives pasta, bread, and other wheat products their chewy, flexible texture. It\u2019s also critical in making dough rise in the oven, resulting in leavened bread. This distinction between leavened and unleavened bread is perhaps the most telling about gluten, as breads that don\u2019t contain gluten are typically flat (imagine communion wafers, or Jewish unleavened bread).\n\nGluten seems harmless and natural enough, but to some one in 133 Americans (about 1 percent of the population), gluten can cause indigestion, headache, nausea, skin rashes, chronic fatigue, and even depression. That\u2019s quite a few symptoms for a little glue protein. Celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder that destroys the small intestine) is enough to make gluten a major issue in the food and restaurant industry, as sufferers must avoid it at all costs in order to prevent debilitating nausea and stomach pain. And another one in seven people have some form of gluten intolerance or sensitivity \u2014 not the full-blown celiac disease, but enough for it to cause discomfort.\n\nWhole grains are made up of three parts that can be eaten: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. Pixabay\n\nBut if we\u2019re going to look at the history of gluten and gluten intolerance, we need to understand its source: whole grains, especially wheat.\n\n8800 BCE. The story of wheat in humanity is a long and varied one, but historians believe humans first began harvesting the grains in wild grasses in the Fertile Crescent \u2014 in ancient times consisting of Assyria, Mesopotamia, and the Nile Valley in Egypt \u2014 around 8800 BCE.\n\nWheat is just one type of whole grain, a term that refers to entire seeds of plants, also known as kernels. Whole grains are made up of three parts that can be eaten: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm \u2014 and in their natural \u201cwhole grain\u201d state, they contain plenty of fiber, protein, minerals, vitamins \u2014 and, of course, gluten. According to the Mayo Clinic, whole grains reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.\n\nAfter 8000 BCE, the cultivation of wheat \u2013 particularly emmer wheat \u2013 began spreading to other parts of the world, hitting Greece, Cyprus, and India by 6500 BCE; and Germany by 5000 BCE.\n\nSpelt was widespread among peasants in Europe during the Bronze Age and medieval times, but today it's a fashionable health food. CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nThe Bronze Age (3000 BCE - 1200 BCE) to medieval times. During the Bronze Age, spelt \u2014 a species of wheat \u2014 spread through central Europe, becoming a staple in people\u2019s diets. Spelt was introduced to Switzerland, Tyrol, and Germany during the Middle Ages. Containing gluten, a good amount of protein, fiber, carbs, vitamins, and minerals, spelt was hearty food for peasants during this time \u2014 but today has become something of a specialty health food.\n\nThe Age of Discovery (15th century). French, English, and Portuguese explorers brought wheat and other grains to North and South America, which had previously only been cultivated in the Old World.\n\n19th century. The Industrial Revolution swept through the Western world in the 18th and 19th centuries, and it sped up the process of bread-making significantly. As a result, wheat \u2014 which had previously been available to only a small number of people \u2014 became far more widespread.\n\n1992. The original American Food Guide Pyramid, created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1992, listed whole grains as one of the most important food groups, stating that one should eat at least 6-11 servings of whole grains per day. This further solidified the prevalence of wheat and other grains in the American diet, around the time that celiac disease cases began rising. Some researchers believe that this increase in grain consumption is parallel to the rise in gluten intolerance.\n\n2000s. There\u2019s no denying that modern wheat is quite different from what it was thousands of years ago \u2014 and even what it was in the 20th century. Due to cross-breeding over many years, modern wheat\u2019s composition went through a transformation: now, it is about two feet tall with large seeds, whereas before it was much taller. Gluten structure in modern wheat has also changed somewhat, though in essence it\u2019s still gluten; and modern wheat also contains higher levels of the starch Amylopectin A.\n\nSome research has examined how wheat cross-breeding in recent decades may or may not have contributed to the spike in celiac disease cases. One might imagine that the rise in celiac disease or gluten sensitivities in the modern age has to do with improved diagnostic tools and awareness, but it\u2019s also possible that wheat\u2019s altered state has something to do with it. More research is needed on that front; scientists still aren\u2019t sure whether this modern \u201cwheat composition\u201d has a negative impact on health.\n\nToday, plenty of gluten-free products exist for the gluten-intolerant patients out there, including pseudocereals like buckwheat, chia seeds, and quinoa); as well as millet and rice.

In the book, Davis claims that cutting wheat from your diet is the pathway to a healthier, more energetic life. Grains and gluten can make some people feel sick, he argues, and the type of grains we eat today have been so altered and modified over the years that they\u2019re no longer what they used to be. Wheat Belly contributed to the anti-gluten wave that prevented many regular people to avoid bread, pasta, and cereal \u2014 even when they had no visible gluten sensitivity.\n\nBut some scientists agree that there\u2019s little to no scientific evidence behind Davis\u2019 argument that it\u2019s harmful for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a small group of people who have a pathological response to gluten,\u201d Lawrence Cheskin, director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center and associate professor of health, behavior and society at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd for them it\u2019s absolutely essential to eat a gluten-free diet. Everyone else may be limiting their choices unnecessarily.\u201d\n\nIndeed, removing bread, cupcakes, and pasta from your diet may help you lose weight \u2014 but it has nothing to do with gluten. In fact, you can eat as many gluten-free products or gluten-free junk food as you want, and you still won\u2019t lose weight.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gluten, wheat intolerance, gluten free", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Gluten is a protein found naturally in several whole grains, particularly wheat \u2014 and though it\u2019s been a part of our diets for thousands of years, it\u2019s only recently that large amounts of people are falling ill from it.", "title": "A Brief History Of Gluten And \u2018Wheat Intolerance\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brief-history-gluten-protein-baked-goods-how-wheat-intolerance-has-risen-over-years-353244", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/17/wheat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gluten is a protein found naturally in several whole grains, particularly wheat \u2014 and though it\u2019s been a part of our diets for thousands of years, it\u2019s only recently that large amounts of people are falling ill from it.", "title": "A Brief History Of Gluten And \u2018Wheat Intolerance\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brief-history-gluten-protein-baked-goods-how-wheat-intolerance-has-risen-over-years-353244", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/17/wheat.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/17/wheat.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-09-18T07:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T07:10:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Gluten is a protein found naturally in several whole grains, particularly wheat \u2014 and though it\u2019s been a part of our diets for thousands of years, it\u2019s only recently that large amounts of people are falling ill from it."}, "article_summary": "Gluten structure in modern wheat has also changed somewhat, though in essence it\u2019s still gluten; and modern wheat also contains higher levels of the starch Amylopectin A.\nWheat and other whole grains contain large amounts of gluten, a protein that causes celiac disease in one in 133 Americans.\nPixabayBut if we\u2019re going to look at the history of gluten and gluten intolerance, we need to understand its source: whole grains, especially wheat.\nPixabayFrom spelt in the Bronze Age to baked goods in modern grocery stores, wheat \u2014 and its corresponding protein component, gluten \u2014 has been a prevalent component of human meals throughout the ages.\nMore research is needed on that front; scientists still aren\u2019t sure whether this modern \u201cwheat composition\u201d has a negative impact on health."}
