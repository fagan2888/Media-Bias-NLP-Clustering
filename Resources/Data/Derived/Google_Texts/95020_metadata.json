And when you\u2019re done, clean-up is a breeze.\n\nDo you have kids? Know any kids? Know someone who knows someone whose kids also like breakfast and lunch?\n\nWhat about appetizers? Do you eat those?\n\nWell, call right now, and you can order anything from Kula onion rings to homemade tortilla chips.\n\n(Just pay separate shipping and handling.)\n\nYou get it all! Huevos Rancheros ($8), Biscuits and Gravy ($8), Mediterranean Quinoa Salad ($9), Kids\u2019 Mac-N-Cheese ($5) and a BLT ($9), enjoyable in a uniquely dark, super depressing, \u201cabandoned mall food court sans mall\u201d atmosphere.\n\nOperators are standing by!\n\nThe new Zing Maui in the Main Street Promenade may not solve all your problems, but it does offer area residents and workers a range of traditional, local and Mexican-style breakfast and lunch options.\n\nWe started with a Breakfast Burrito ($8).\n\nFilled with scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, cheese, beans, salsa and sour cream, this is one gut buster that may just keep you running \u2018til dinner time.\n\nNo surprises here.\n\nJust plenty of freshly prepared, locally sourced ingredients pushing the envelope of what one humble flour tortilla can reasonably be asked to hold.\n\nIf breakfast food isn\u2019t so much your bag, the menu also offers a wide variety of lunch options.\n\nThe Beer Battered Zucchini Sticks ($6) with lemon aioli may very well thin out the weaker members of your pack\u2026 But what a way to go.\n\nThe aioli borders on dessert sweet, but there\u2019s something about the contrast of the crisp, savory fried veggie sticks and the creamy, sugary mayo dip that\u2019s a touch addictive.\n\nWorried about your waistline?\n\nDefinitely avoid the Pan Fried Artichoke Hearts ($6).\n\nEight sections of artichoke are coated in an intensely seasoned breadcrumb mix. Once again, the super sweet lemon aioli makes an appearance.\n\nPillsbury called. They want their mayo-based frosting recipe back.\n\nPerhaps better matched with some marinara sauce or even ranch dressing, these delectable fried thistle flowers are hard to resist.\n\nYou could spend hundreds at local watering holes trying to get the job done, or take care of that irrepressible bar food craving with one call to Maui Zing AND keep your job.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe wanted \u201csomething like a Cobb salad\u201d and were steered toward the Chopped Salad ($9).\n\nEssentially a Cobb sans avocado, all the veggie ingredients were notably fresh and crisp. thereby countering-balancing the thin strips of deli meat and chalky texture of the pre-shredded cheddar.\n\nHowever, the fresh bacon bits and copious amounts of cucumber more than tip the scales toward craveability.\n\nThe 4 Cheese Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($9) answers the question \u201ccan a grilled cheese sandwich have too much cheese?\u201d with a resounding YES.\n\nFilled with cheddar, provolone, Swiss and mozzarella, there is so much cheese inside this bad boy that several slices weren\u2019t quite melted in spots. At all.\n\nThe highlight was the fresh and flavorful side salad, indicating there is plenty of room for gussying up the main event.\n\nA layer of fig jam perhaps? Some fresh arugula and tomato? An unexpected (Stilton? aged Gouda?) cheese \u2013 and less of it \u2013 or more unique and substantial bread perhaps?\n\nA little more oomph is needed before we\u2019d order it again.\n\nBut don\u2019t despair!\n\nThe Homemade Tortilla Chips ($5) with house made salsa fresca and guacamole aim to put a smile on your face.\n\nThe chips themselves are perfection: crisp and light. Local Mexican restaurants not making their own would do well to start sourcing their offerings from Zing.\n\nThe fresh, vibrant pico de gallo and rich and creamy guacamole were faultless accompaniments, we just wish there were more than a tablespoon of each.\n\nSeven chips in and we were all but licking the tiny ramekins. Where\u2019d that lemon icing aioli stuff go?\n\nThe restaurant staff is friendly and helpful, and appearances suggest the person behind the counter also had a hand in making your food.\n\nIn contrast, the food court in which Zing is located is one of the more depressing spots in all of Maui.\n\nDark and cavernous, it would be a good place to work on your bleak poetry or dystopian novel, but we suggest doing your actual eating elsewhere.\n\nAs for what to eat elsewhere, you cannot go wrong with the Rueben ($9).\n\nThey had us at house roasted corned beef.\n\nCorned beef: You complete me.\n\nTwo slices of thick, flavorful marble rye (maybe make the lackluster grilled cheese on some of this?) are filled with corned beef, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing and melted Swiss cheese.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic made exactly how it should be.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, the accompanying pasta salad is delightful. Chockablock with lightly pickled cucumbers, it lightens and brightens the otherwise ho hum standard.\n\nNot into Ruebens? With ten sandwich options in the $9 range, you\u2019re sure to find a love match.\n\nWhy spend hundreds on food that doesn\u2019t satisfy when Zing Maui is here to meet your hunger needs?\n\nThis is the one-two gut filling power punch you\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nAct now while supplies last!\n\n*******\n\nZing Maui is located at 2050 Main Street in Wailuku.
