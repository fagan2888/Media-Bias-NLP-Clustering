Though the complexities of Obamacare have been a boon to benefit consultants nationwide, New York consulting firms have seen especially strong growth in employment over the past year.

New York accounted for 10.5% of consultant jobs created nationally in the past year, though the local consultant workforce constituted just 5.3% of overall employment among the city's largest benefit consulting firms, according to Crain's research.

Eight of 10 new jobs created last year at Chernoff Diamond & Co. were in the New York area. Nearly a third of the Segal Group's 40 new jobs last year were created in the region. And for Alliant Insurance Services, 20% of its new jobs were here.

"Buyers in the New York area are more sophisticated and more demanding," said Steven Lewis, executive vice president of Willis Group. "They have higher expectations for all of their advisers of benefits, or any other services."

Though Willis Group's local consultants have clients in all 50 states, its New York clientele is a "big driver" in its growth. The firm created eight new jobs in New York, while headcount remained flat firmwide.

The biggest percentage disparity between local and nationwide hiring was at National Financial Partners Corp., which reported 29% growth in New York-area professionals in 2012 from a year earlier to 310, compared with 3% to 2,540 nationwide.
