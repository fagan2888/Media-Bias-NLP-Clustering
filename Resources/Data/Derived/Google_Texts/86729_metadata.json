Hobby Lobby ruling, but what he actually did in that case seems to be unclear to many Missourians.\n\nDue in part to Hawley\u2019s liberal description of his efforts, some Missouri Republicans are surprised that when they hear Hawley say that he argued the case, as he didn\u2019t actually do any speaking in the case at all. In fact, he wasn\u2019t admitted to the bar to argue at all before the Supreme Court in March 2014.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have heard Josh Hawley speak multiple times and is my recollection and hers that he argued the Hobby Lobby case before the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Rep. Rocky Miller, R-Miller County, said. \u201cWhen we both found out he was not admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar until after the case and, therefore could not argue before them, we were shocked.\u201d\n\nIn one of the biggest rulings of 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that closely held corporations could be exempt from laws to which owners \u201creligiously object.\u201d Hawley is listed as one of the lawyers on a brief in the case.\n\nThe brief was prepared for and submitted in conjunction with the Becket Fund in support of Hobby Lobby. Court records show that the only litigator who did any actual arguing before the court was Paul D. Clement, who is a partner at Bancroft PLLC and formerly served as the 43rd Solicitor General of the United States from June 2005 until June 2008.\n\nClement is listed alongside Michael McGinley as attorneys with Bancroft PLLC in Washington, D.C. Peter Dobelbower and John Graham are listed General Counsel and Assistant Counsel for Hobby Lobby.\n\nKyle Duncan, a former Louisiana Solicitor General, is listed as the counsel of record and Eric Rassbach, Luke Goodrich, Mark Rienzi, Lori Windham, and Adele Keim are listed with The Becket Fund in Washington D.C.\n\nJoshua Hawley is listed last with the University of Missouri School of Law with his taxpayer-funded office address and phone line listed as his contact information.\n\nIn February 2014, Hawley was marketed to Newton and Jasper County Republicans as the \u201cHobby Lobby Lawyer\u201d and made the featured speaker of the Republican dinner.\n\nA June 2014 press release from Hawley\u2019s group \u2013 the Missouri Liberty Project \u2013 called Hawley \u201cHobby Lobby Litigator Josh Hawley.\u201d The release lead with \u201cMissouri Liberty Project founder Josh Hawley, an attorney who helped Hobby Lobby and its owners in their landmark victory for religious liberty at the U.S. Supreme Court\u2026\u201d\n\nToday, his campaign website says, \u201cJosh Hawley is a conservative constitutional attorney who has been to the Supreme Court and won.\u201d\n\nHis campaign biography echoes Hawley\u2019s involvement with the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIn the last five years, Josh has been active in some of the country\u2019s most important court cases. As Senior Counsel for The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, he has won twice at the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nAgain, some would argue that these statements may have overstated his experience. The respondent briefs he participated in writing appears to be the extent of his on-the-record involvement in the Hobby Lobby case. The Missouri Times reached out to the Supreme Court, who said Hawley was admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States on May 26, 2015, just weeks before Hawley\u2019s attorney general campaign was launched.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby case was argued in March 2014 and the decision was announced on June 30, 2014 \u2013 over a year before Hawley\u2019s bar admittance. A representative from court admissions shared that those not admitted to the bar can file briefs as long as paperwork submitted to the office is pending. However, without bar admission, no one could argue a case before the Supreme Court or even be allowed to sit at the counsel table while a case was being argued.\n\nRule 13 of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Guide for Counsels specifically defines \u201carguing counsel\u201d and specifies they are the attorney who will be arguing before the court. It also outlines details of courtroom decorum as well as how they are to enter the building and take their seat at either the respondent or petitioner table.\n\nIt also specifically lists those who are able to sit inside the court\u2019s brass railing as only members of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, meaning Hawley would not have been able to enter in without bar admittance.\n\nHowever, Rule 13 does state that, \u201cIf arguing counsel desires to reserve space in the public section, counsel must contact the Marshal\u2019s Office,\u201d which means that the arguing counsel, Paul Clement, could have reserved Hawley a seat and he would have been permitted to witness Clement\u2019s arguing of the case \u2013 alongside other members of the general public in the gallery.\n\nThe fact that he observed the proceedings from the gallery and not as an arguing counsel came as a surprise to one Republican activist who heard Hawley speak last Monday night in Camden County, where she remembered Hawley say he \u201clooked across at the opposing counsel table where the Solicitor General was making arguments he could not believe.\u201d\n\nHawley has stated he argued the Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court to numerous media outlets including The Missouri Times, and many Missouri media outlets have differing ways of describing his involvement before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Columbia Daily Tribune listed him as a counsel for The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. It described his accomplishments as, \u201cparticipated in writing briefs in the Hobby Lobby case, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allows closely held companies to cite religious objections to refuse to pay for contraceptive coverage. Executive Director Kristina Arriaga said Hawley has resigned from his position with the Becket Fund to run for office.\u201d\n\nThe University of Missouri School of Law\u2019s website marketed his efforts as an attorney for Hobby Lobby.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, March 25, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments on Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., the case involving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate. Prof. Joshua Hawley is one of the attorneys for Hobby Lobby.\u201d\n\nHis University biography page also touts his appearances on MSNBC, PBS, and National Public Radio.\n\nHis campaign website says he was co-counsel on the case where he describes himself as, \u201cA leading national expert on the issue of religious freedom, Josh was co-counsel on the landmark Supreme Court case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, the most important decision on our First Amendment liberties in decades.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Hawley painted himself as someone who had expertise practicing before the Supreme Court. \u201cIf you want someone who has the expertise to stand up in the Supreme Court of the United States and defend our liberties and defend our values, then elect a constitutional lawyer.\u201d\n\nKMOX referred to Hawley as a constitutional scholar who \u201chelped argue an earlier ObamaCare case before the Court.\u201d\n\nBarb Shelly, liberal columnist and editorial writer for the Kansas City Star, used Hawley\u2019s efforts on the case to promote the Yale educated professor as an attractive alternative for conservatives to his primary opponent, Sen. Kurt Schaefer, R-Columbia.\n\n\u201c[Schaefer] has a GOP primary opponent, Josh Hawley, whose impeccable conservative credentials include arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of \u2018religious freedom\u2019 in the contraceptives case involving the Hobby Lobby stores,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShelly\u2019s praise of Hawley was included in an editorial where she referred to Schaefer\u2019s work on the Sanctity of Life Committee that would ultimately result in the University of Missouri ending their agreement with the doctor of Planned Parenthood\u2019s Columbia affiliate to facilitate providing abortions worthy of naming him \u201cthe scariest person in Missouri government.\u201d Schaefer did not return calls for comment.\n\nThe race for attorney general has already been an exciting one, with Schaefer announcing very early, followed by St. Louis County Assessor Jake Zimmerman and former Cass County Prosecutor Teresa Hensley.\n\nHawley\u2019s campaign has largely avoided controversy out of the gate.\n\nHe announced his campaign the day before a decision by University of Missouri Board of Curators adjusted the public university\u2019s policy on professors taking leave to run for state office. Hawley also argued that the Sunshine Law does not apply to certain communications of taxpayer funded academics.\n\nOutside of his work on the Hobby Lobby case, he has worked with a large law firm and was a clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts. Hawley did not work for Roberts during the time when the latter cast the deciding vote in support of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Hawley campaign has proven its legitimacy through a very successful fundraising effort putting over $650,000 in the bank in contributions over $5,000 since the account opened in July.\n\nHawley received $500,000 of that from the Humphreys family just days after the failure to override right-to-work legislation in the veto session. The Humphreys have previously been outspoken in support of a right-to-work law.\n\nThe contribution raised eyebrows amongst right-to-work supporters, as well as many who had advocated supporting legislators who voted for the bill. Schaefer voted not only for the bill, but for the previous question to force a vote on the bill, a procedural motion typically reserved for House floor debate. Until May, the PQ was derided by many senators, which made Humphreys\u2019 very large contribution to Hawley was concerning to some, such as House members who switched their votes to support the bill.\n\nSchaefer reported having $1.3 million on hand in July with that number topping $1.4 million with recent $5,000+ contributions. His campaign is ran by Barklage & Knodell, while the Columbia Tribune reported last week that that noted Republican campaign operative James Harris was no longer with the Hawley campaign.\n\nNeither Hawley nor his campaign returned calls for comment.\n\nUpdated Sept. 29, 3:22 p.m.: The Becket Fund, which led the charge in the Hobby Lobby case, sent this statement after this article was posted.\n\n\u201cThe Becket Fund has had incredible success at the Supreme Court, and Josh Hawley has been an integral part of it,\u201d it reads. \u201cJosh served as co-counsel both in Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC (2012) and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014). In both cases, his work and Supreme Court expertise were critical to our success at every stage of the litigation.\u201d\n\nUpdated Sept. 30, 8:37 a.m.: A gentleman named Brad Todd from OnMessage, Inc. emailed a statement on behalf of the Hawley campaign explaining how Hawley was involved in the Supreme Court cases and providing a statement from Duncan PLLC. Todd was quick to call out primary opponent Sen. Kurt Schaefer.\n\n\u201cJosh Hawley was proud to serve as co-counsel at the Supreme Court for both the Hobby Lobby case and the Hosanna-Tabor case,\u201d emailed Todd. \u201cBoth were landmark victories. Winning victories at the Supreme Court is something that happens over months and sometimes years of litigation. Josh was proud to be an integral part of that litigation in both cases. Josh is one of the nation\u2019s leading experts in defending religious liberty \u2014 and that is a key point of differentiation in this race for Attorney General against Senator Schaefer, who has been an opponent of religious liberty as a state politician.\u201d\n\nTodd calls himself a consultant with Josh Hawley\u2019s campaign and is a founder of OnMessage Inc., a consulting firm out of Alexandria, Va.\n\nYou can view the PDF of Duncan PLLC\u2019s statement here.\n\nHawley still has not returned requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2013 Josh Hawley, college professor and Republican candidate for attorney general, has been touring the state for well over a year speaking at Republican events and touting his accomplishments arguing last year\u2019s Burwell v.
