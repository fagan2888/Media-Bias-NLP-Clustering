Owide said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 41 new drugs last year, with 17 intended to treat rare diseases.\n\n\n\n\"Schemes such as the FDA\u2019s Fast Track Development Program and Breakthrough Designation accelerate the approval of novel drugs and add value to the market by meeting demand more quickly,\" Owide said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A newly released report expects the U.S. pharmaceutical market will expand dramatically by 2020 due in large part to changes under the Affordable Care Act.
