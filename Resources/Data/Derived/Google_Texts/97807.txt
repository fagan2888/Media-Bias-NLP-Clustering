Chisholm Creek Park Lake in urban Wichita is under a blue-green algae warning.

Blue-green algae is is hazardous to humans and deadly to pets.

The algae is caused by excessive amounts of fertilizer and animal waste that runs off fields.

Inside city limits, lawn fertilizer is a big cause of blue-green algae.

"So if you have high water levels and someone has already fertilized their lawn....prior to the flooding and then the flooding recedes, it concentrates all that fertilizer that has been washed off that lawn into the bodies of water,' said Sara Belfry of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

Other lakes recently added to the Blue-Green Algae warning are Brown County State Fishing Lake; Concannon State Fishing Lake in Finney County; Lovewell Reservoir in Jewell County; and Memorial Park Lake in Barton County.
