To hear Republicans talk about it, the Affordable Care Act is tantamount to a national economic plague. To hear Democrats talk about it, the ACA is an antidote to many of the nation's economic woes.

Economists have an answer of their own: We don't know what it will do.

The National Association of Business Economists surveyed 230 members and found that 42 percent said the health law will have no significant effect on economic growth, 30 percent say it will reduce growth and 18 percent say it will raise growth. Ten percent didn't know or had no opinion.
