The next day representatives of conservative, anti-tax organizations urged committee members to continue to say \u2018no\u2019 to expansion, despite the billions of additional federal dollars it would inject into the Kansas economy.\n\nBut the hearings also attracted scores of everyday citizens. They included those who need the coverage that expansion would provide and others opposed to extending benefits to non-disabled adults.\n\nMary Weber is a single mother of three who works as a para-professional in the Wichita school district. She helps students with disabilities keep up in the classroom.\n\nWeber\u2019s children qualify for Medicaid \u2013 known in Kansas as KanCare \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t. Adults with dependent children must earn less than one-third of the federal poverty level to be eligible for KanCare. That translates into about $8,000 a year for Weber\u2019s family of four.\n\nAt the same time, Weber\u2019s annual income isn\u2019t enough to qualify her for federal subsidies that would all but cover premiums for private coverage purchased in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. She\u2019s caught in what has come to be known as the Medicaid expansion gap.\n\n\u201cI make too much for Medicaid and not enough for the ACA (tax credits),\u201d Weber said.\n\nWeber had health problems that sent her to the hospital last year. The care she received cost about $1,200 and she couldn\u2019t pay the bill.\n\n\u201cFor a single mom, that\u2019s a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended up having to pay for part of it, but the hospital wrote off a big chunk of it.\u201d\n\nThe need for such write-offs has been lessened in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs to cover adults earning up to a third more than the federal poverty level \u2013 about $16,000 for individuals and nearly $33,000 for families of four.\n\nBut many Kansas hospitals have seen their \u201ccharity care\u201d numbers climb at the same time that they are dealing with reductions in Medicare payments.\n\nWeber said she understands that Medicaid expansion is a politically charged issue because of its connection to Obamacare. But from her perspective, the politics are blinding legislators to the fact that expansion could provide coverage to about 150,000 Kansans, most of whom are now uninsured.\n\nWeber stuttered as she searched for a respectful way of expressing her frustration. But after a few stops and starts she gave up and said what was on her mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of crap,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Medicaid expansion would give a lot of us who do work and who are trying to make a living the health insurance we need.\u201d\n\nWalter Cunningham also has strong opinions on the issue. He was one of several people who attended the hearings wearing green T-shirts that said \u201cLight the Fire of Freedom in Kansas\u201d on the front and \u201cIdeas Don\u2019t Work Unless You Do\u201d on the back. The shirts were supplied by Americans for Prosperity Kansas, a conservative group with ties to Wichita\u2019s Koch brothers that lobbies for smaller government.\n\nCunningham, also from Wichita, said welfare benefits make people too dependent on the government. He cited his adult daughter as an example.\n\n\u201cI have a daughter who chose obesity and chose to smoke to the point where she ended up losing a part of her leg (to diabetes),\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cShe\u2019s now on kidney dialysis. She has no insurance. So she\u2019s plaguing the system.\u201d\n\nHis daughter receives about $1,000 a month in Social Security disability benefits, Cunningham said.\n\n\u201cI told her not to take any of the money and \u2018you can come die with us because that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to end up doing,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo, the government \u2013 Social Security and Medicare \u2013 have given her a cushion, which she did not deserve.\u201d\n\nThe lobbyists for AFP and conservative think-tanks who spoke against expansion weren\u2019t as blunt as Cunningham but there were echoes of his objections in their testimony.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion, in my opinion, is morally indefensible because it puts able-bodied folks in line ahead of the disabled. The arguably not-needy ahead of the truly needy,\u201d said Dean Clancy, a Washington, D.C., veteran of conservative causes who now works for the Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability.\n\nThe disabled Kansans on Medicaid waiver waiting lists that Clancy referred to actually are receiving medical care. However, they are waiting for Medicaid support services to help them live independently.\n\nEliminating the waiting lists appears to be a prerequisite for Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, though it would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the state\u2019s share of expansion costs.\n\nThat reality appears to make it even less likely that Kansas lawmakers will seriously consider a bill backed by the Kansas Hospital Association that requires the Brownback administration to craft an expansion proposal and negotiate its approval with federal officials.\n\nThe chairman of the HHS committee, Wichita Republican Dan Hawkins, has said he has no immediate plans to schedule a vote on the bill.\n\nJim McLean is executive editor of KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "The recent legislative hearings on Medicaid expansion brought representatives from dozens of powerful groups to the Kansas Statehouse.
