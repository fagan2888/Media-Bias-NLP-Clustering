It was the snowiest December on record.\n\n\u201cTravel on the reservations would have been impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would be stuck in their buildings.\u201d\n\nThe snow accumulated quickly and the temperature dropped to 6 below zero on December 21, Vonderheide said. Snow fell for a week, followed by arctic air.\n\nLeonard Anthony, Navajo, was 11 when the blizzard hit. He lived with his family in Greasewood Springs, Arizona, a small community west of the Navajo Nation\u2019s capital city and close to the Hopi reservation.\n\n\u201cAt first, my dad told us to go out in our shorts and roll in the snow, but after that, it just kept coming down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t let up. It kept snowing and we couldn\u2019t go anywhere. All the people who were homebound couldn\u2019t get out.\u201d\n\nAfter a couple of days, Anthony\u2019s father walked to the trading post for food. Because the snow was four or more feet deep, Anthony\u2019s father wrapped gunny sacks around his feet and walked on top of the snow drifts. While he was out, he stopped at the chapter house to determine what was being done for residents stuck in the more remote areas.\n\n\u201cI remember hearing that some of the people were found frozen because they tried to get out of their houses and walk to find food,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cEventually, after the sixth or seventh day of snow, people were starving.\u201d\n\nOn December 18, 1967, as the blizzard continued to rage, the U.S. Air Force began conducting helicopter rescue missions, dropping food and medical supplies to stranded residents. The Associated Press on December 19 of that year reported that Navajo officials were making pleas for state and federal aid in the form of \u201cequipment and men.\u201d\n\nTribal Chairman Raymond Nakai told the Associated Press that the situation was \u201cthe most critical in the modern-day history of the Navajo Nation.\u201d Six days into the storms, 32 deaths had been reported, including three on the Navajo reservation. The snow storms also hit neighboring states and led to a total of 51 deaths.\n\nNakai estimated that 60,000 Navajo citizens were affected by the storms, included some that had gone without food for 10 days. Nakai also said that 1 million cows, horses, sheep and other livestock were threatened.\n\nAnthony\u2019s uncle helped the National Guard locate stranded residents. Because the helicopters couldn\u2019t land in the deep snow, rescuers dropped food, emergency kits and livestock feed to residents.\n\n\u201cThe rescuers couldn\u2019t find the hogans, they couldn\u2019t find the sheep corrals because they were covered in snow,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t find life at all in some places.\u201d\n\nMany people lost their livestock, Anthony said. Residents whose animals survived butchered sheep or cows so other people could eat.\n\n\u201cAt that time, as a young boy, I began to see there was a lot of community effort to take care of people in remote areas,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember my father sacrificing some of his sheep to butcher so other people could eat.\u201d\n\nAlthough the blizzard of 1967 was severe, roads still become impassable during snowstorms, and emergency situations can arise quickly, Vonderheide said.\n\n\u201cThere are huge tracts of land in the West, particularly on the reservations, where there are very few people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are hurt by the extreme weather, and the blizzards also get the livestock.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Dec. 14, 1967, a blizzard hit the Navajo and Hopi Nations, covering the ground with as much as seven feet of snow, trapping residents in homes.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/14/native-history-blizzard-devastates-navajo-and-hopi-nations-152675", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/blizzard-1967-food-hay.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Native History: Blizzard Devastates Navajo and Hopi Nations"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-14T10:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Native History: Blizzard Devastates Navajo and Hopi Nations"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/14/native-history-blizzard-devastates-navajo-and-hopi-nations-152675", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American History, Navajo Nation, Hopi, Arizona, Snow, Severe Weather", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Native History: Blizzard Devastates Navajo and Hopi Nations"}, "article_summary": "Leonard Anthony, Navajo, was 11 when the blizzard hit.\nThis Date in Native History: On December 14, 1967, a blizzard hit the Navajo and Hopi Nations, covering the ground with as much as seven feet of snow, trapping residents in their homes and rendering roads impassable.\n\u201cThe rescuers couldn\u2019t find the hogans, they couldn\u2019t find the sheep corrals because they were covered in snow,\u201d Anthony said.\n\u201cI remember hearing that some of the people were found frozen because they tried to get out of their houses and walk to find food,\u201d Anthony said.\nHe lived with his family in Greasewood Springs, Arizona, a small community west of the Navajo Nation\u2019s capital city and close to the Hopi reservation."}
