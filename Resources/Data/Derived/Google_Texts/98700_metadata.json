Bush. By the end of Bush\u2019s term, focus groups were telling pollsters they despised the very four-letter word B-U-S-H. When John McCain faced Obama in 2008, Democrats gleefully slammed McCain\u2019s quest as the \u201cthird Bush term.\u201d\n\nGiven Obama\u2019s light resume and see-no-flaws cheerleading by an adoring media, Obama\u2019s fall was inevitable. If absolute power corrupts absolutely, absolute adoration comes close.\n\nIn practically anointing Obama, our \u201cwatchdog\u201d media ignored a thin resume full of red flags. So in four years, Obama shoots from unknown state lawmaker, with little private sector and no executive experience, to president \u2014 all in a nanosecond by political standards.\n\nLook at Obama\u2019s rise. By his own admission, he is an indifferent student who somehow finds himself at Harvard Law. Co-members elect Obama president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review publication, where, oddly, he publishes nothing, at least not under his name.\n\nHe becomes a Chicago \u201ccommunity organizer,\u201d whose achievements appear to be holding lots of meetings and yelling at government to do more. He may have helped get asbestos removed from a lower-class housing complex. Or he may or may not have had a hand in it being removed after Obama left town for law school. Hard to say.\n\nThe Obama rise continues.\n\nFormer fugitive and still unrepentant domestic-terrorist-turned- government-paid-professor Bill Ayers co-writes a proposal to the Annenberg Foundation. It brings a $49.2 million education award to \u201cimprove\u201d Chicago public schools. Just three years out of law school, Obama is asked to chair the newly formed Chicago Annenberg Challenge board. Money spent includes hundreds of thousands of dollars given in grants to Ayers\u2019 Cross City Campaign for Urban School Reform and Chicago School Reform Collaborative projects.\n\nBy their own admission, the Annenberg project group failed.\n\nObama runs for state senator, and somehow manages to kick off his other principal rivals over their alleged signature-gathering violations. He serves as an indifferent state lawmaker, voting \u201cpresent\u201d numerous times.\n\nObama runs for U.S. Senate. Rivals seem to suddenly drop out after formerly private confidential information about them become public. Luck or manipulation \u2014 either way, the rise continues.\n\nImmediately after getting elected to the Senate, Obama runs for president.\n\nAs candidate, he survives scandals \u2014 or rather, would-be scandals \u2014 that would have torpedoed the chances of a typical pol. Tony Rezko, Bill Ayers and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright \u2014 are all overlooked or minimized in importance by our Obama-for-president media\n\nElected, Obama pursues \u2014 and succeeds in signing into law \u2014 a left-wing agenda more ambitious than any in modern history. His record: $1 trillion \u201cstimulus\u201d; $150 billion spent, per \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d on \u201cgreen tech\u201d with nothing to show for it; higher taxes on \u201cthe rich\u201d; Dodd-Frank, the financial regulations bill that does nothing to address the cause of the Wall Street/housing meltdown; an EPA unleashed on coal; and the creation of a brand-new entitlement program \u2014 Obamacare.\n\nTo pass Obamacare, Obama made a number of broken promises including, but not limited to: \u201cIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor\u201d; Obamacare will \u201cbend down\u201d the \u201ccost curve\u201d; Obamacare will save the \u201ctypical family \u2026 $2,500 a year\u201d; and Obamacare will reduce the deficit over the next 10 years \u2014 a projection the Congressional Budget Office says it can no longer stand by.\n\nObama\u2019s supporters, like former President Jimmy Carter, blame Obama opposition on \u201ca belief among many white people, not just in the South but around the country, that African-Americans are not qualified to lead this great country.\u201d Actors James Earl Jones, Morgan Freeman and Samuel L. Jackson publicly call the tea party, an important part of the GOP base, \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nSo Obama\u2019s post-election narrative becomes: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the leftist agenda that triggers GOP opposition. Nor is it Obama\u2019s growth-retarding policies that have produced the worst recovery since the Great Depression. No, what drives Republican opposition? Racism!\n\nHow does that translate into presidential action?\n\nLeftist pundits like CNN\u2019s Roland Martin urged Obama to \u201cgo gangsta\u201d and make \u201crecess\u201d appointments. Now, Congress said it was not \u201cin recess\u201d and thus the President could not make any \u201crecess\u201d appointments. Obama did anyway. Why not take extra, possibly illegal, measures to achieve results? Why not use expansive executive orders, ignore deadlines and unilaterally waive statutory requirements? After all, we\u2019re dealing with racists here!\n\nBut in a stunning 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court said Obama overreached in making the recess appointments. Congress, said the court, not the President, determines its rules. Congress, said the court, not Obama, decides when it is in recess.\n\nHouse Republicans say they intend to sue Obama, arguing abuse of separation of powers. Respected left-wing legal scholar, Jonathan Turley, who twice voted for Obama, encourages a lawsuit. \u201cWhat\u2019s emerging,\u201d Turley said, \u201cis an imperial presidency. \u2026 Barack Obama is really the president Richard Nixon always wanted to be.\u201d\n\nObama, encouraged by supporters, went \u201cgangsta\u201d \u2014 on America.
