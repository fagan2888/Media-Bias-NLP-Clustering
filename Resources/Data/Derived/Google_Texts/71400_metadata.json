Specifically, that it\u2019s the duty of the federal government to guarantee that the entire population is educated and healthy.\n\nThere is almost no debate that people should have health care and education. But why should the federal government be involved?\n\nIn the fantasy lexicon of government bureaucracy, education means, \u201csomeone will pay for your college degree\u201d or \u201cyou will pass tests\u201d and health care means \u201csomeone will pay for your health insurance.\u201d Sadly these definitions have nothing to do with what health care and education are really about.\n\nEducation is about learning. Learning can occur in many places outside of traditional classrooms. Measuring learning effectively is difficult, because each child is different, so the government seeks to quantify it through examining who goes to school or who passes tests. Most recently, the federal government has sought to extend control of educational outcomes through \u201cCommon Core\u201d standards and assessments.\n\nAs an educator, I find the idea of creating uniform standards of measurement, for every public school in the nation located in those states which have adopted such standards, disturbing. Teachers understand that students are not robots. Government-imposed educational standards limit creativity and force teachers to abandon innovation in favor of conformity.\n\nThe issue is not just the quality or lack thereof of the standards themselves. It\u2019s that government-imposed standards come with government-defined goals and measurements, and a government-directed student database.\n\nFor example, the Common Core standards operate according to a premise that the education of a child should be for the purpose of\u201ccollege, career and life\u201d <http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/> readiness. What is \u201clife readiness?\u201d How is that term even defined, and how is it measured when a youth graduates from high school?\n\nBy pretending it has the ability to define and measure readiness for \u201ccollege, career, and life\u201d the government can promise to bring comprehensive change to public education when, in reality, it is simply accruing power.\n\nThough they are not often linked, the arguments for federal government involvement in healthcare and education are strikingly similar. Like education, government uses definitional changes to trick citizens and fake its own success on the issue of health care. Notice in the debate over health care, what the government actually mandated was a product \u2013 health insurance. Health care is not health insurance. Yet, in the world of bureaucratic control, these are the same. Notice that the government measures Obamacare\u2019s success not by whether citizen\u2019s health has improved but by how many citizens have signed up. This is absurd.\n\nHealth care and education are intensely personal and are not given to standardized measurements and centralized controls. By redefining education and healthcare and then pretending to be able to solve the problems in each, the federal government shields itself from the truth. Uncle Sam\u2019s attempted solutions often have only made matters worse. Politicians love to promise us the things we desire, but informed citizens should scrutinize carefully what they are really saying.\n\nIt is time we stopped letting politicians pretend they know how to run our lives. If local communities can no longer educate their children or take care of their sick, then America is in trouble. Government has the power to coerce but not the power to heal. Government has the power to regulate but not the ability to educate. It is time for Americans to stand and reclaim their freedom from the bureaucratic leviathan lest, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people,\u201d shall perish from the earth.\n\nNathan Oppman is lectures coordinator at the Family Research Council, and is currently pursuing his Ed.D. at Bob Jones University.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Common Core and Obamacare: Two Peas in a Pod"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf132\"", "article_summary": "Notice that the government measures Obamacare\u2019s success not by whether citizen\u2019s health has improved but by how many citizens have signed up.\nNotice in the debate over health care, what the government actually mandated was a product \u2013 health insurance.\nWhat is \u201clife readiness?\u201d How is that term even defined, and how is it measured when a youth graduates from high school?\nHealth care is not health insurance.\nMost recently, the federal government has sought to extend control of educational outcomes through \u201cCommon Core\u201d standards and assessments."}
