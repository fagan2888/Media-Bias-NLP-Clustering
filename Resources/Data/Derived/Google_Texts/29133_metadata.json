And in the first four months of this year, at least 260 breaches occurred at health care facilities, exposing sensitive data of some 8 million people.\n\nFrom coffee shops to corporate computer networks, at your computer or at cash registers where you shop, on the phone or on the road, the risks are so widespread that two-thirds of 3,110 respondents to a Consumer Reports survey said they do nothing to protect themselves \u2013 the apathetic result of what experts call data-breach fatigue from the seemingly nonstop parade of high-profile hacking of customer records at Target, Neiman Marcus, Adobe and others, often orchestrated by foreign-based scammers.\n\nBad move. \u201cThe most effective defense against an international onslaught of shadowy hackers is a well-informed and vigilant individual,\u201d notes Consumer Reports.\n\nThat\u2019s why AARP launched Fraud Watch Network. Our network of experts, law enforcement and everyday people like you, who share news and views of scams occurring in their state and in cyberspace, is a way to protect yourself and stay one step ahead of scammers. Other ways to safeguard your personal data:\n\nDon\u2019t share anything you don\u2019t have to. That includes your Social Security number at the doctor\u2019s office or on medical forms (if needed, your insurer can provide it); where you live, work, shop or vacation on social media; or any personal or financial information in phone calls or emails you do not initiate.\n\nMonitor your financial life. Don\u2019t rely solely on monthly statements from your bank or credit card companies; check account activity online or by phone at least weekly for quick indicators of fraud. Also, do what many Americans don\u2019t: Access your free credit reports every four months at AnnualCreditReport.com. If you\u2019re not planning to apply for new credit, enact a security freeze at each of the three credit reporting bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. You can always \u201cunthaw\u201d it if needed.\n\nProtect your technology. In addition to using strong and different passwords on different accounts and on all electronic devices, change them frequently (take note, smartphone users). Take an extra step, too, by checking for updates on security software, just in case not all are automatic.\n\nBe a smart shopper. Use a credit card over a debit card when shopping online, traveling, at the gas station and most everywhere else. Never shop (or do any financial transaction, including checking banking or credit card accounts) on public Wi-Fi networks. And when online shopping (ideally from a secure home account), always try to type website addresses yourself; relying on links in emails, advertisements or online searches can take you to a scammer-run site or download malware to your computer. When using your smartphone to shop, use retailers\u2019 dedicated apps, rather than your phone\u2019s browser.\n\nBe skeptical. Those \u201cDear Customer\u201d emails from retailers with which you do business? They\u2019re likely bogus (they have your name, but do they have your email?), so don\u2019t click on their links. And even with a personalized email, before clicking, hover your computer mouse over the link and you should see a full website address. If it\u2019s not what appears in an email-offered link, assume you\u2019re being directed to a scammer-run website or about to download malware. Don\u2019t trust emails, text messages or phone calls that ask you to confirm recent transactions (legitimate retail sites will send an order confirmation, usually with instructions on how to track the delivery of your purchase, but they will not ask for confirmation). Also beware of \u201cwarnings\u201d from your bank asking you to confirm your account; look up the phone number yourself if you\u2019re worried.\n\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network.
