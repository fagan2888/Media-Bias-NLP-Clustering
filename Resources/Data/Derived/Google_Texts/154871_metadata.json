(photo: Ted Nesi/WPRI)\n\nCENTRAL FALLS, R.I. (WPRI) \u2013 Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton made a campaign stop in Rhode Island\u2019s smallest city on Saturday, urging her supporters to head to the polls in Tuesday\u2019s primary while mostly training her fire on the Republican field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy to be back here in Rhode Island,\u201d Clinton told more than 1,000 supporters gathered in the gym at Central Falls High School. \u201cI love this little state. I have so many friends here.\u201d She described Rhode Islanders as \u201cresilient and hardworking.\u201d\n\nIn her first local campaign stop since the fall of 2014, Clinton rarely mentioned rival Bernie Sanders but repeatedly criticized GOP hopefuls Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. She said of Trump: \u201cLoose cannons tend to misfire \u2013 and what we have with him is the loosest of all cannons.\u201d And noting recent comments by a top Trump aide that the candidate\u2019s bombast is in some ways an act, she said: \u201cIf we buy that, shame on us.\u201d\n\nClinton drew cheers as she discussed her support for higher wages, organized labor, abortion rights, immigration liberalization, the Affordable Care Act, gun restrictions and climate action, with one of the loudest reactions coming after she called for \u201cequal pay for women.\u201d Members of the Laborers and other unions made their presence felt in the crowd.\n\nAs for Sanders, Clinton drew an implicit contrast between his more ambitious proposals and what she sees as her realism, declaring: \u201cI am not making promises I can\u2019t keep.\u201d Calling the Vermont senator \u201cmy esteemed opponent,\u201d she critiqued his well-known proposal for free college tuition, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want free college for people who can pay for it, like Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAfter the Central Falls event, Clinton\u2019s motorcade took her to the Atwood Grille in Johnston, where she met up with Mayor Joseph Polisena and other Democrats. Clinton schmoozed with diners, took selfies and joked with one woman about how becoming a grandmother for the first time has made them both \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nDespite scoring an 18-point victory over Barack Obama in Rhode Island eight years ago, Clinton is facing a tough challenge from Sanders this time around, though she has near-universal support from top local Democrats. With 24 elected delegates at stake in Tuesday\u2019s primary, both sides acknowledge the race is competitive.\n\nSanders himself will be in Rhode Island on Sunday for a noontime rally at Roger Williams Park that\u2019s expected to draw a sizable crowd. Neither candidate had campaigned personally in the state before this weekend. And in another sign of how seriously Clinton\u2019s aides are taking Rhode Island, her campaign announced late Saturday that former President Bill Clinton will return Monday for his second visit this month; details were not available.\n\nIn-Depth Coverage: 2016 Voter Resource Guide\n\nAt the Central Falls rally, Clinton made her entrance by the side of U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, who consistently ranks as Rhode Island\u2019s most popular politician in public opinion surveys. Clinton, who served with Reed in the Senate, said he \u201cunderstands as much about national security as anybody in the Congress, and probably nearly anywhere else.\u201d\n\nBefore Clinton took the stage, a parade of elected officials \u2013 including Gov. Gina Raimondo, all four members of Congress, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and Central Falls Mayor James Diossa \u2013 urged attendees to vote Tuesday. Gorbea noted voters can cast an emergency ballot on Monday if they can\u2019t get out to vote the following day.\n\nRaimondo seemed to acknowledge the growing buzz in Rhode Island political circles that Sanders could win the state on Tuesday, telling that crowd that \u201cshe\u2019s going to overcome the odds and she\u2019s going to win!\u201d\n\nWith the Clinton campaign making a major push for the Latino vote, Diossa, Gorbea and Congressman David Cicilline spoke in both English and Spanish. The campaign also announced that Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego will visit Central Falls for Clinton on Sunday, the second stop by a prominent Latino member of Congress.\n\nTaking the stage after Raimondo, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse declared: \u201cWhat better thing could we be doing than help the first woman governor of Rhode Island elect the first woman president of the United States?\u201d Earlier Cicilline had taken aim at Trump, calling the Republican frontrunner \u201ca dangerous man.\u201d\n\nVoters in the crowd who are supporting Clinton generally cited her experience and perceived pragmatism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m liberal but I\u2019m not extreme liberal,\u201d said Lloyd Mumford, a 48-year-old from Woonsocket, as he contrasted her with Sanders.\n\nGrayson Murphy, a 76-year-old from Cumberland, said the current vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court is a crucial issue for him that has made him prioritize picking someone who can win. \u201cShe\u2019s electable,\u201d he said.\n\nKaren Zelano, a 53-year-old from Providence, decided to back Clinton two weeks ago, saying she loves \u201cBernie\u2019s idealism\u201d but fears he isn\u2019t pragmatic. \u201cI just think she\u2019s got a broader platform of issues,\u201d Zelano said. But she added that her three young adult children are all leaning toward Sanders.\n\nThe visits by Clinton and Sanders are part of a busy pre-primary weekend in Rhode Island that also saw Republican hopeful John Kasich hold a town hall at Bryant University earlier Saturday. Trump and Cruz have not indicated any plans to visit the state before Tuesday.\n\nTed Nesi (tnesi@wpri.com) covers politics and the economy for WPRI.com.
