From misleading Kentuckians on his votes against the Violence Against Women Act, to voting against equal pay for equal work, Senator McConnell has failed to lead on issues important to women and their families.\"\n\n\"Republicans think a substance-free insult is the right way to deal with a qualified, popular woman challenger \u2013 at least their rhetoric is consistent with their anti-woman policies,\" said Jess McIntosh, communications director at EMILY's List, which endorsed Grimes.\n\n\"The only surprising part of all this is the GOP\u2019s continued unwillingness to understand that other women \u2013- including Kentucky women -\u2013 can hear them when they say this stuff. It\u2019s why women turned out in historic numbers for Democratic candidates last election, and it\u2019s why we\u2019ll see a repeat next November.\"\n\nGrimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, has been hesitant to talk about policy specifics since she officially jumped into the 2014 Senate race. But she has pushed to raise the minimum wage, been vocal about her support for reproductive rights, and announced her intention to delay the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.\n\n\u201cThe president and I disagree on a lot of things,\u201d she said in an August interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman. \u201cSen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.\n\n\u201cWell, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated with comment from the Grimes campaign.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: War On Women War On Women\n\n1 of 6 99 Problems (JAY-Z) Eric Fehrnstrom, senior campaign adviser for Mitt Romney, said on Sunday that issues pertaining to women's reproductive rights, such as abortion and birth control, were \"shiny objects\" meant to distract voters from the real issues. \"Mitt Romney is pro-life,\" he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. \"He'll govern as a pro-life president, but you're going to see the Democrats use all sorts of shiny objects to distract people's attention from the Obama performance on the economy. This is not a social issue election.\" Share this slide:\n\nThe Raw Story", "article_metadata": {"description": "A month after Kentucky Democratic senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-05 09:04:01 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "A month after Kentucky Democratic senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes", "title": "GOP Strategist Calls Female Senate Candidate 'An Empty Dress'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/04/alison-lundergan-grimes-empty-dress_n_3865060.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1333502/images/o-LUNDERGAN-GRIMES-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A month after Kentucky Democratic senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes", "creator": "lebassett", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1333502/images/o-LUNDERGAN-GRIMES-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "GOP Strategist Calls Female Senate Candidate 'An Empty Dress'", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-04 09:04:01 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3865060", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,Mitch McConnell,Alison Lundergan Grimes,alison lundergan grimes mitch mcconnell,alison lundergan grimes empty dress,brad dayspring alison lundergan grimes,brad dayspring empty dress,mitch mcconnell alison lundergan grimes", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "video,Mitch McConnell,Alison Lundergan Grimes,alison lundergan grimes mitch mcconnell,alison lundergan grimes empty dress,brad dayspring alison lundergan grimes,brad dayspring empty dress,mitch mcconnell alison lundergan grimes", "published_time": "2013-09-04 09:04:01 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-04 14:06:36 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded8f\"", "article_summary": "\"The only surprising part of all this is the GOP\u2019s continued unwillingness to understand that other women \u2013- including Kentucky women -\u2013 can hear them when they say this stuff.\nA month after Kentucky Democratic senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes pulled slightly ahead of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) in the polls, Republican strategists seem to be sharpening their claws.\nBrad Dayspring, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called Grimes \u201can empty dress\u201d in an interview with The Hill published Wednesday.\n\u201cWell, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen.
