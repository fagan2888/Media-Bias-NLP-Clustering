Christmas for gamers was ruined for many who use the Sony PlayStation 4 or Xbox One gaming consoles after hackers take down the networks required for many games to function.

Adam Linthicum is a manager at Game Xchange in Wichita. He says that the hackers repeatedly were logging into the networks, bogging them down and overloading them.

"It's like a traffic jam, it floods the services to access, not necessarily sensitive information, but just to get on the network," Linthicum said, "so when a legitimate user tires to get on, there are so many attempts to access, that you cannot get on." He says that the hackers are not accessing information like credit cards but rather bottling up the system and disrupting service.

The networks were taken down on Christmas Eve and for some, there is still no connectivity.

Xbox One consoles appear to be working like they should and Sony PlayStation 4 units are slowly coming back online.

The group Lizzard Squad has claimed they are the reason for the shut down.

12-year-old Espon Dziewulski received a $700 setup with a PlayStation and five games. Most of the games cannot be played or have limited access when it comes to functionality. "All I can do is sit there and try to mess around with out, trying to get it to work and it doesn't ever work," Dziewulski said. He and his mother are frustrated and want the people who took the network down to be held responsible.
