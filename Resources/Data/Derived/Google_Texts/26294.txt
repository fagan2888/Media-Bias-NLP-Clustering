SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Quarterback Brett Hundley led No. 14 UCLA to a 31-6 halftime lead and the Bruins held off No. 11 Kansas State 40-35 on Friday night in the Alamo Bowl.

Kansas State (9-4) scored 22 of the first 25 points in the second half, cutting it to 34-28 on quarterback Jake Waters’ 1-yard run with 4:54 left.

Paul Perkins countered for UCLA (10-3) with a 67-yard run with 2:20 to go. Waters threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett with 1:21 left, but UCLA recovered the onside kick and ran out the clock.

Perkins ran for 194 yards on 20 carries.

Lockett had 13 catches for 164 yards for Kansas State.

Waters was 31 of 48 for 338 yards, but was sacked seven times — twice by Butkus Award winner Eric Kendricks — and threw two interceptions and lost a fumble.

Hundley ran for 96 yards and two touchdowns on 11 carries and passed for 136 yards.
