Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.\n\nThe nonprofit organization, which operates from 75 locations, issued a statement by its CEO and president, Derald Walker, saying, \"It is not Cascadia's practice to comment on pending litigation. However, we strive to treat all employees fairly and equitably.\"\n\nReporter Aimee Green has the full story, which as of this writing had generated more than 200 reader comments.\n\nNext, a preview of changes coming to the workplace generated nearly as many comments, as readers reacted to one or more new employer requirements taking effect because of state and federal legislation and voter-approved initiatives.\n\n\"The short list of major issues includes an increase in the minimum wage, the Affordable Care Act employer mandate, legalization of recreational marijuana, and the expansion of paid sick leave,\" George Rede reported.\n\nLastly, Bob Bussel, director of the UO Labor and Education Research Center, took time to answer a few questions about President Obama's executive actions on immigration, announced in late November, which could potentially affect tens of thousands of undocumented Oregon residents.\n\nThat interview, too, generated several dozen reader comments.\n\nHave any story ideas relating to the workplace?
