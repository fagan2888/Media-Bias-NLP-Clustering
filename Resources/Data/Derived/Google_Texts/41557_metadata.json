The rule then allows the territories to allocate up to half of their catch limit to Hawaii-based longline fishing vessels. The nearly doubles the amount of bigeye that U.S. ships may catch in the central and western Pacific, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe complaint asked the court to void the rule and declare the agency in violation of federal law.\n\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service office in Honolulu couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nEarthjustice attorney David Henkin said the U.S. should lead by example. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to solve the overfishing problem for bigeye unless all nations play by the rules,\u201d Henkin said in a statement.\n\nLongline fishing vessels string a line in the ocean, ranging from one mile to 50 miles long, to catch fish. They run smaller lines with baited hooks off the central line and wait for bait to attract fish.\n\nAnother type of fishing vessel - purse seine - targets skipjack tuna but also catches bigeye. These vessels are large industrial ships that use giant nets to surround and capture schools of tuna.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Environmental groups on Thursday sued the National Marine Fisheries Service to challenge a new rule for fishing bigeye tuna, a popular species for sushi and fish steaks.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Environmental groups on Thursday sued the National Marine Fisheries Service to challenge a new rule for fishing bigeye tuna, a popular species for sushi and fish steaks.", "title": "Groups sue feds over Pacific bigeye fishing rule", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/20/groups-sue-feds-over-pacific-bigeye-fishing-rule/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/11/15/20121115-174056-pic-139906148.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/11/15/20121115-174056-pic-139906148.jpg", "description": "Environmental groups on Thursday sued the National Marine Fisheries Service to challenge a new rule for fishing bigeye tuna, a popular species for sushi and fish steaks.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Groups sue feds over Pacific bigeye fishing rule"}, "Author": "Audrey McAvoy", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Honolulu, National Marine Fisheries Service, Earthjustice"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8dc\"", "article_summary": "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Environmental groups on Thursday sued the National Marine Fisheries Service to challenge a new rule for fishing bigeye tuna, a popular species for sushi and fish steaks.\nThe rule then allows the territories to allocate up to half of their catch limit to Hawaii-based longline fishing vessels.\nThe nearly doubles the amount of bigeye that U.S. ships may catch in the central and western Pacific, the lawsuit said.\nThe Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, which regulates commercial fishing between Indonesia and Hawaii, has established an annual quota of 3,763 metric tons of bigeye for U.S.-flagged longline vessels in the central and western Pacific.\nLongline fishing vessels string a line in the ocean, ranging from one mile to 50 miles long, to catch fish."}
