Participants taking the drug had an average reduction in LDL cholesterol of approximately 60% compared to placebo.Evolocumab was approved in Europe last month.It is the second PCSK9 inhibitor to get FDA approval.The agency gave the green light to alirocumab (Praluent/Sanofi-Regeneron) for use in addition to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks or strokes, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. Cardiologists have been eagerly awaiting these drugs.In an i nterview last month, MD Magazine asked New York City cardiologist David Vorchheimer, MD, of the Montefiore Einstein Center for Heart and Vascular Care what PCSK9 approvals could mean for physicians and patients. Vorchheimer has offices on Manhattan\u2019s Upper Eastside, and at the Bronx-based Montefiore system\u2019s main campus.Vorchheimer said \u201cFor most patients PCSK9 inhibitors will not be first-line agents,\u201d and added, \u201cBut for the person who is not tolerating a statin, or who is not at goal with LDL lowering, for me, a cardiologist, this is very exciting.\u201dVorchheimer estimated that about 10% to 15% of his own patients might be candidates for PCSK9 inhibitors. Others have estimated that as many as 50% of patients now taking statins might instead take the new drugs.The fact that the drugs have to be injected is seen as a drawback, compared to statins.Cost is a big factor compared to statins, Vorchheimer said.But for patients with HeFH, the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors could be far lower than that of two existing drugs according to Rare Disease Report .
