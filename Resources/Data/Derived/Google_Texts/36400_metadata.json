Among lots expected to generate major interest among collectors and dealers is Aivazovsky's Arrival of the Columbus flotilla to the American coast.\n\nPaintings by Nikolai Roerich and Ivan Aivazovsky will be the main lots at Bonhams' Russian Sale, November 26.\n\nOne of the key lots will be Aivazovsky's Arrival of the Columbus flotilla to the American coast (1892), with a pre-sale estimate of \u00a3700-900,000.\n\nThis painting is part of a series of five paintings that the Russian maritime artist dedicated to the life of Columbus in 1888. The painting is considered \"one of the grandest and most beautiful\" in the series.\n\nThe auction also includes 11 paintings by Nikolai Roerich, all from private collections. The works include sketches of theatre decorations, landscape paintings of Finnish lakes, canyons in Arizona, snowy Alpine peaks and mountain ranges in Mongolia and Tibet, as well as the monumental symbolic compositions Roerich created during his travels.\n\nSignificant interest is expected when Roerich's Ecstasy, comes under the hammer. Depicting a hermit standing in silent contemplation on top of a mountain, Roerich painted it in 1918 in Finland where he lived during the Russian Revolution. Part of the permanent collection of the Roerich Museum in New York until 1935, in 1971 it was gifted to Brandeis University in Massachusetts, later becoming part of a private collection. The painting's auction estimate is available to bidders only on request.\n\nEcstasy by Nikolai Roerich.
