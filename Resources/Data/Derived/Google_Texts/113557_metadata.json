So many credit-impaired residents have been forced into renting that rents have risen to where they no long make economic sense vis-\u2026-vis buying. Therefore, those who can buy, do.\n\nSecondly, historically low interest rates are allowing homeowners to trade up to a bigger home, perhaps twice as large, with little increase in their monthly mortgage payment. Those who expect rate increases to kill the market should note that today\u2019s rates in the 3 percent to 4 percent range would have to double to return to where they were 20 years ago.\n\nConsidering that the national economy is growing sluggishly, any rapid or large rate increases are unlikely.\n\nFurther, lenders and appraisers are being prudent. Flipping houses for a quick profit has not become a widespread practice. And entrepreneurs in the state\u2019s new and controversial cannabis business are, in part, responsible for the recent rush of all-cash buyers.\n\nSince it is difficult to bank their profits, they buy homes instead, a practice that, one way or another, is unlikely to last.\n\nTo be sure, there are signs of frothiness. Public auctions are attracting 30 or 40 bidders instead of the handful who would attend a few years ago. And the average time on the market is five days. In other words, if your home doesn\u2019t sell in a week, it\u2019s overpriced.\n\nStill, keep in mind that some real estate booms of the past elsewhere \u2014 in parts of the Northeast in the \u201980s and Las Vegas more recently \u2014 had annual price increases as high as 35 percent. And at 10 percent a year, it still takes more than seven years for a home price to double.\n\nDenver also is not land-constrained, unlike San Francisco, New York City and some perennially high-priced areas. Distant suburbs, all the way out to Brighton and Frederick, are growing and will take some of the heat out of the Denver market.\n\nAs home building picks up, it will act as a brake on prices, too, as will the troublingly high price-to-income ratio. A continuing trickle onto the market of the ghost inventory \u2014 homes in foreclosures held by lenders \u2014 will do the same. Economically, the area also is much less affected by the vicissitudes of the energy and mining industries than it was in the past.\n\nBottom line: That was then; this is now. And if some naysayers and worrywarts dispute that this is a new normal, tell them the only bubble you see is coming from a bottle of champagne.\n\nCongratulations, Denver. Your real estate market has finally recovered.\n\nDouglas Hauck is vice president and employing broker at American Home Agents in Aurora.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Denver home prices are a rebound, not a replay", "title": "Guest Commentary: Denver home prices are a rebound, not a replay", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/05/guest-commentary-denver-home-prices-are-a-rebound-not-a-replay/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605__OP08HAUCKp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605__OP08HAUCKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T17:22:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T14:18:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e84\"", "article_summary": "Distant suburbs, all the way out to Brighton and Frederick, are growing and will take some of the heat out of the Denver market.\nYour real estate market has finally recovered.\nThe impressive rise \u2014 and a spate of recent news stories about multiple bids, a minuscule inventory and auctions with all-cash buyers \u2014 might spark memories of past real estate booms and busts.\nOver the past year, Colorado\u2019s capital has come within a rounding error of being the hottest residential real estate market among the nation\u2019s major cities.\nFirst of all, it is the rental market that\u2019s overheated, and it\u2019s playing a big part in driving up home prices today."}
