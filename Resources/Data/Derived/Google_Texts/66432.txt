After a 5-month drug investigation, New York State Police have arrested a Tompkins County man accused of selling heroin.

27-year-old Aljamal Bovian of Trumansburg was arrested on a warrant in the Town of Ulysses.

He's in the Tompkins County Jail on $10,000 cash bail or $20,000 bond.

After searching his apartment, investigators reported the discovery of approximately 51 grams of heroin, a scale, a stun gun, cell phones, and about $3,000.

The warrant also led to the arrest of 20-year-old Imani Austin, of Ithaca, who is charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, criminally using drug paraphernalia, and endangering the welfare of a child.

She was released after a court appearance.
