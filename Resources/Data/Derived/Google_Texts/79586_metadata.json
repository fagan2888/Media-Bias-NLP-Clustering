Luis Guti\u00e9rrez threw a \u201cHail Mary pass\u201d in Congress this week with his introduction of legislation to extend the Affordable Care Act to undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. While acknowledging the measure has slim chances in the Republican-controlled Congress, Guti\u00e9rrez, a Democrat from Illinois, said providing free and low-cost healthcare to noncitizens serves moral and economic purposes.\n\n\u201cDoing unto others as you would have them do unto you means moving forward with no restrictions on which brother and sister and neighbor we think of as \u2018eligible\u2019 or \u2018deserving,\u2019\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said Wednesday on the floor of the House of Representatives, according to a report by The Hill newspaper. A broad coverage expansion would create younger, healthier patient pools, while lowering the cost of insurance for citizens who are already enrolled, he argued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we all benefit when we spread the risk, require younger, healthier workers to join our exchanges with the rest of us, reduce the costs of compensating hospitals for caring for the uninsured, and decrease the number of uninsured who live and work here,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said. The congressman, who is of Puerto Rican descent, has been considered one of Capitol Hill\u2019s staunchest supporters of immigration reform, which has stalled over partisan disagreements about whether to give amnesty or deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.\n\n\u201cObamacare,\u201d as it\u2019s colloquially called among opponents of the 2010 law, explicitly bans undocumented immigrants from enrolling in federal health insurance exchanges. Guti\u00e9rrez's legislation would repeal that provision, requiring undocumented workers to pay for insurance like legal citizens.\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Yuri Gripas\n\n\"It gives them access to the healthcare exchanges in Obamacare under the ordinary rules of residency in the states in which they live and makes them eligible for subsidies if and when they file taxes \u2014 just like the rest of us,\" Guti\u00e9rrez said Wednesday. \"The goal is to make integration and inclusion real for millions of families that are locked out under current law.\"\n\nThe legislation has no chance in a Congress controlled by Republicans, who fought to repeal the health care law and refused to take up immigration reform bills. \"The current hysteria on the campaign trail makes action by these Republicans or any Republicans unlikely,\" the Illinois congressman said. \"Even though I still believe we have the votes \u2014 like we did for the last several years \u2014 to pass immigration reform in the House I don\u2019t think the Speaker, even as a lame duck, will allow a vote.\"\n\nContinue Reading Below", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "immigration reform, immigration reform obamacare, immigration reform senate, immigration reform house, immigration reform dhs, immigration reform departmebt of homeland security, immigration reform homeland security, immigration reform republicans", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "An expansion of coverage would create younger, healthier patient pools and lower the cost of\u00a0insurance\u00a0for current enrollees, the House Democrat who introduced the legislation argues.", "title": "Illegal Immigration Obamacare?
