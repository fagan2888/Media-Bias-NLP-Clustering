The Mavs are off to a fast start this season, and Monta Ellis, The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week, is a huge reason.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Ellis was superb during the evaluation period of Nov. 15-21 with averages of 25.5 points and 4.8 assists in four games for the Mavericks, all wins. Eills shot 50.7 percent from the field, 47.1 percent from 3-point range and 85.7 percent from the charity stripe. He was a plus-16.8 in those contests going into Saturday\u2019s game against in-state rival Houston.\n\nBackground: Ellis has been a steady and dynamic scorer for the Mavericks since signing as a free agent in 2013. In two seasons, he\u2019s averaging 19.1 points per game and has become a more efficient scorer. His shot attempts are the lowest of his career with any team (averaging 15.5), but his field-goal accuracy is high \u2014 over 45 percent \u2014 and he\u2019s going to the free-throw line at the highest rate of his career.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: The move to Dallas has been the best professional decision Ellis ever made. He had a lot more to give a team as a lead scorer, and under the watchful eye of Rick Carlisle, one of the NBA\u2019s most underrated coaches, he has blossomed into an attack-minded player who picks and chooses his attempts with the most discerning eye of his career.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mavericks,Monta Ellis,NBA,spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Monta llis was superb during the evaluation period of Nov. 15-21 with averages of 25.5 points and 4.8 assists in four games for the Mavericks", "title": "Monta Ellis: Spotlight on the Mavericks guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/22/monta-ellis-spotlight-mavericks-guard/12122/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/Monta-Ellis-495x349.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Monta llis was superb during the evaluation period of Nov. 15-21 with averages of 25.5 points and 4.8 assists in four games for the Mavericks", "title": "Monta Ellis: Spotlight on the Mavericks guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/22/monta-ellis-spotlight-mavericks-guard/12122/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/Monta-Ellis-495x349.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Monta Ellis was superb during the evaluation period of Nov. 15-21 with averages of 25.5 points and 4.8 assists in four games for the Mavericks"}, "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Monta Ellis, guard, MavericksWhen: You need to look no farther than the state of Texas to find one of the hottest teams in the NBA \u2014 the Dallas Mavericks.\nThe Mavs are off to a fast start this season, and Monta Ellis, The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week, is a huge reason.\nBackground: Ellis has been a steady and dynamic scorer for the Mavericks since signing as a free agent in 2013.\nWhat\u2019s up: Ellis was superb during the evaluation period of Nov. 15-21 with averages of 25.5 points and 4.8 assists in four games for the Mavericks, all wins.\nIn two seasons, he\u2019s averaging 19.1 points per game and has become a more efficient scorer."}
