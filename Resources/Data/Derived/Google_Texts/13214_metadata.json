Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, introduced the bill in April.\n\n\u201cWe all failed Stoni and Stephen because Michigan does not maintain a list of homeschooled children, and so we have no way to identify and then protect any child who could be at risk for abuse,\u201d Chang said in a statement. \u201cMost homeschool parents have their child\u2019s best interest in mind, and many do a fine job homeschooling, but with Stephen and Stoni, that wasn\u2019t the case. Michigan can and must do better to ensure that every child is accounted for and not leave anyone behind. My bill could help prevent future tragedies like that of the Blair family.\u201d\n\nIn March, the bodies of Stoni Blair and Stephen Berry were found in a freezer when authorities evicted their mother from her Detroit apartment. Authorities have said the children were dead for several years.\n\nTheir mother, Mitchelle Blair, 35, has been charged with their deaths. Blair explained their absence from school by saying she had decided to homeschool the children.\n\nAudrey Spalding, the director of education policy at The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, wrote in an op-ed that homeschooling laws are not to blame for the tragedy.\n\nSpalding writes that it is \u201cunderstandable that legislators would want to do something in response to a parent torturing and killing her children,\u201d but that \u201cIncreasing the regulations on homeschooling families, sadly, will not prevent these types of atrocities.\u201d\n\nSpalding told The Daily Signal the bill places an \u201cadditional burden\u201d on homeschooling.\n\nShe said the language in the bill is vague and doesn\u2019t specify what sort of \u201crecord\u201d must be kept of the meetings.\n\nSpalding said children enrolled in public schools see school administrators on a daily basis and thus \u201cmeet that requirement every day,\u201d and yet still may be victims of abuse.\n\nShe added that Child Protective Services \u201cfailed to fully investigate\u201d the Blair case.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press reports that Eric Fredlund, Stoni Blair\u2019s former teacher, did report his concerns about her well-being to Child Protective Services after her extensive absence from school.\n\nAccording to the Home School Legal Defense Association, Michigan is one of 11 states that does not require parents to notify the state they will be homeschooling their children. Under current Michigan law, parents report homeschooled children to their local school district on a voluntary basis.\n\nAccording to the Home School Legal Defense Association, 15 states require only that homeschooling parents notify the state; many others require items such as test scores and student progress be reported. Some states require further evaluation such as home visits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a woman killed her kids and told the school she was homeschooling them, a bill would force parents to have kids seen by professionals twice yearly.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After a woman killed her kids and told the school she was homeschooling them, a bill would force parents to have kids seen by professionals twice yearly.", "title": "Michigan Bill Would Add to Regulations on Homeschooling", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Michigan-Homeschooling.png", "updated_time": "2015-06-03T14:05:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JqqXUH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After a woman killed her kids and told the school she was homeschooling them, a bill would force parents to have kids seen by professionals twice yearly.", "title": "Michigan Bill Would Add to Regulations on Homeschooling", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Michigan-Homeschooling.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "school choice", "published_time": "2015-06-03T13:14:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T14:05:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "homeschooling, Michigan legislature, Mackinac Center for Public Policy, Mitchelle Blair, Stephanie Chang,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ec2\"", "article_summary": "Legislation has been introduced in the Michigan Legislature that would enact stricter regulations on homeschooling in the state.\nUnder current Michigan law, parents report homeschooled children to their local school district on a voluntary basis.\nAccording to the Home School Legal Defense Association, Michigan is one of 11 states that does not require parents to notify the state they will be homeschooling their children.\nAccording to the Home School Legal Defense Association, 15 states require only that homeschooling parents notify the state; many others require items such as test scores and student progress be reported.\nMichigan can and must do better to ensure that every child is accounted for and not leave anyone behind."}
