Kerlikowske says Chiara, second from left, is 'giving a voice to the millions.' W.H. praises de Blasio daughter

The White House drug policy director on Tuesday commended Chiara de Blasio, the 19-year-old daughter New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, for opening up about her struggles with depression and substance abuse and for her decision to seek treatment.

“Today, Chiara demonstrated tremendous bravery in speaking out about her recovery, and I applaud her and the entire de Blasio family for addressing this important public health issue,” Gil Kerlikowske, director of National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement issued by the White House.

The statement came in response to a five-minute video released Tuesday by Bill de Blasio’s transition team in which Chiara disclosed her experience seeking treatment and encouraged an open conversation about mental health and drug and alcohol abuse.

“Chiara is giving a voice to the millions who suffer from substance use and mental health disorders, and we encourage others to join her,” Kerlikowske said. “By talking about addiction in the light of day — and by celebrating recovery out loud — we can help correct the misinformation and stigma that too often become obstacles for the millions of Americans who deserve to live healthy, productive lives.”

In addition to applauding Chiara de Blasio, Kerlikowske also pointed to provisions in the Affordable Care Act that expand mental health coverage.

“[B]y expanding access to treatment to millions through the Affordable Care Act, we’ll be giving many more a chance to follow Chiara’s footsteps,” the statement read. “By giving the millions of Americans in recovery a voice, we’re making real progress to end discrimination, stigma, and other obstacles to recovery that hinder our ability to make America healthier and stronger.”
