Levin has told his listeners that the subtitle of his new book, Plunder and Deceit, is even more important than the title.\n\nThe subtitle reads: \u201cBig Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future.\u201d This is a book written about, and for, the young Americans who were so important to Barack Obama\u2019s election and re-election\u2013and who are the main victims of his policies, which have exacerbated the nation\u2019s fiscal crisis and eroded public trust in the political system itself.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLevin\u2019s starting point is a paradox: namely, the fact that so many parents today\u2013whom he calls the \u201cruling generation\u201d\u2013who genuinely care for their children\u2019s well-being behave politically in ways that doom their children\u2019s future.\n\nThere is also another paradox, he adds: the \u201crising generation\u201d itself purports to challenge authority and the status quo, yet \u201cin large numbers its members sanction both through their political behavior and voting patterns.\u201d\n\nBoth the \u201cruling\u201d and \u201crising\u201d generations have a common interest in a better future; why are they ruining it?\n\nEach chapter then lays out, in grim yet captivating detail, the ways in which today\u2019s utopian politics are destroying tomorrow\u2019s potential.\n\nThe country\u2019s fiscal situation and its entitlement systems, Levin writes, are sapping the prosperity of future decades. Medicare and Obamacare are undermining the health care system; our lax immigration policy is substituting a fractious multiculturalism for our hitherto liberal (small \u201cl\u201d) social order; and the neglect of our national defense is allowing new threats to emerge that our children may be ill-equipped to confront.\n\nPerhaps the most arresting chapter is Levin\u2019s exploration of the environmental movement, which claims to make the world more sustainable but does the opposite. Many conservatives are familiar with critiques of the \u201cclimate change\u201d agenda, but Levin goes far deeper, exposing the \u201cdegrowther\u201d movement that revives 19th-century communism in the guise of 21st-century science, and which is at the heart of contemporary environmental activism and policy.\n\nThat movement, Levin argues, is hurting young people by discouraging the technological innovation that helps to save time\u2013which is, for the young and ambitious, \u201cthe one priceless commodity, the most passionately needed.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Levin points out, the young have been \u201cthe main beneficiaries\u201d of modern labor-saving devices. \u201cAnd if the production and, above all, the invention of such devices is retarded or diminished by the ecological crusade, it will be one of the darkest crimes against humanity\u2013particularly because the victims\u2019 agony will be private, their voices will not be heard, and their voices will not be noticed\u2026\u201d.\n\nIt is that silent constituency for which Levin speaks, in two ways. First, he argues for the general interest of the public as a whole, which is often overlooked by the central government because its policies create vocal minorities that are better able to defend their interests.\n\nSecond, he argues for the specific interest of future generations, who are neglected by policymakers, both because of indifference to the unintended consequences of policy, and because of a tragic cognitive dissonance that causes the rising generation to vote for its own impoverishment.\n\nIf Levin\u2019s Liberty and Tyranny, published in 2008, was one of the first books to anticipate the ruin of the Obama era (from the vantage point of the late George W. Bush era, when it began), Plunder and Deceit is one of the first to survey the damage that will be left as Obama retreats, reluctantly, from the spotlight.\n\nLevin\u2019s prescription is for a \u201cnew civil rights movement\u201d\u2013an activist generation that will \u201cinject itself into purposes and events that affect its well-being\u201d and follow progressives\u2019 model by insinuating itself into every institution, big and small.\n\nWhat might that movement look like? Events of the past few weeks provide a glimpse, as the young consumers of \u201cdisruptive\u201d technologies like Uber, Airbnb, Lyft and others have pushed back efforts by their so-called \u201cprogressive\u201d heroes to defend the sclerotic monopolies of 20th century statism.\n\nThe shock of realizing that Hillary Clinton is on the wrong side of that battle is a potential wake-up call to the disillusioned millennial generation.\n\nIn Plunder and Deceit, Levin has prepared a new list of targets for them to \u201cdisrupt.\u201d Our national future depends on it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Levin's 'Plunder and Deceit': A Wake-up Call to the Millennial Generation", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Levin's 'Plunder and Deceit': A Wake-up Call to the Millennial Generation", "title": "Levin's 'Plunder and Deceit': A Wake-up Call to the Millennial Generation - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3999, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Mark-Levin-2-Nicholas-Kamm-AFP-Getty.jpg", "height": 2999}, "updated_time": "2015-07-29T08:40:00-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/29/levins-plunder-and-deceit-a-wake-up-call-to-the-millennial-generation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Levin's 'Plunder and Deceit': A Wake-up Call to the Millennial Generation", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Mark-Levin-2-Nicholas-Kamm-AFP-Getty.jpg", "title": "Levin's 'Plunder and Deceit': A Wake-up Call to the Millennial Generation - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "civil rights movement, disrupt, Mark Levin, millennial generation, obama era, plunder and deceit,Big Government, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-07-29T08:12:22-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T08:40:00-07:00", "tag": "plunder and deceit", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In Plunder and Deceit, Levin has prepared a new list of targets for them to \u201cdisrupt.\u201d Our national future depends on it.\nThe shock of realizing that Hillary Clinton is on the wrong side of that battle is a potential wake-up call to the disillusioned millennial generation.\nPerhaps the most arresting chapter is Levin\u2019s exploration of the environmental movement, which claims to make the world more sustainable but does the opposite.\nEach chapter then lays out, in grim yet captivating detail, the ways in which today\u2019s utopian politics are destroying tomorrow\u2019s potential.\nThe country\u2019s fiscal situation and its entitlement systems, Levin writes, are sapping the prosperity of future decades."}
