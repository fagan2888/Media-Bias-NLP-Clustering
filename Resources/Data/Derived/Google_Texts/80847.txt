Dear Carolyn: My married daughter, with two young daughters of her own, has decided to file for a separation. I felt from the beginning that things may not work out. They were both young, my daughter just 22, and it was the pregnancy that mostly pushed them to marry six years ago. I remained optimistic and embraced my new son-in-law and his extended family. I have also tried to respect their lives and not be the pushy mother-in-law. I adore my grandchildren; they are both amazing.
