She was asked.\n\nYes, dentistry is one of the services offered at the health center, she said, with many Evanston and Skokie school children receiving their initial examination before starting school.\n\nSome of the other services the center offers include one-to-one diabetes education, vision exams, prenatal nutrition classes, group cooking classes and a family running program, all with the aim of empowering patients to take charge of health.\n\nBefore Thanksgiving last year, participants in the group cooking class put together a recipe to make a low-sugar pie crust.\n\nDid Robinson sample it?\n\n\"Of course,\" she said.\n\nThis first federally-assisted center in the North Shore area has seen its usage shoot upward since opening in November 2013 at its permanent new home at 1285 Hartrey Ave.\n\nSince then, roughly 5,000 people have visited the center, many of whom hadn't seen a doctor in years.\n\nMonthly patient visits are up 400 percent from the center's first temporary site, a cramped suite of offices in the Lorraine H. Morton Civic Center.\n\nWomen account for 30 percent of the total patients while children make up 53 percent at the center, according to usage figures.\n\nAbout one third of the patients are uninsured and pay on a sliding scale basis to Erie, which accepts all patients regardless of the ability to pay.\n\nDr. Avery Hart, medical director at the site, said many of the people coming in are experiencing acute issues such as diabetes, hypertension or other chronic diseases they have been dealing with for years and without a doctor's attention.\n\nHart, who also treats patients, only needed to consult that day's appointment book for an example.\n\nThe patient, a 52-year-old Evanston woman had made her first visit to the office, experiencing symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath.\n\nA feeling of exhaustion would come over her, even after a short walk.\n\n\"We ran diagnostic tests and quickly determined she was anemic, to the point she was missing about half of her red blood cells,\" Hart said.\n\nErie then arranged for the woman to undergo more diagnostic tests at Evanston Hospital, a member of the NorthShore University HealthSystem, and a major contributor to the center and one of its medical partners.\n\nThe tests provided more information, guiding Erie to put the woman on track to address the symptoms. She is now back to health, her blood count close to normal, Hart said.\n\nWhen Erie first opened, \"I think we knew wherever there was a community without access to care there will be neglected conditions and advanced diseases,\" said Hart. \"But when you actually meet the patients, I would say it is distressing to encounter folks who are in that situation and it's gratifying to be able to help them.''\n\nA federally-qualified health center for the area was set in motion in 2007 when Evanston closed its city health department in a cost-cutting move.\n\n\"We had five clinics. They had operated for over 150 years,\" Evanston Health Director Evonda Thomas-Smith recalled at a symposium at the Evanston Public Library last summer, \"and when those clinics closed, we had generations of families for whom the health department was their safety net provider, that kind of fell out of care.\"\n\nSome time after that, \"we started to see some shifts in our data, we started to see some really unacceptable trends that kind of resonated between 2008 and 2010,\" said Thomas-Smith, a certified nurse.\n\nOne of those areas was teen pregnancy, where rates soared to their highest in nearly a dozen years, she said.\n\nSexually-transmitted diseases among young people was another area showing a sharp increase, said Thomas-Smith.\n\n\"It started to raise a warning flag for us in public health and health care,\" she said. Thomas-Smith said Evanston Mayor Elizabeth Tisdahl was among those concerned about the situation.\n\n\"We have to do something about it,'' the mayor told her.\n\nMeanwhile, neighboring Skokie was in the midst of its once-in-every-five-years community health survey.\n\nThe survey identified obesity and access to medical care as major community concerns, said Dr. Catherine Counard, the community's health director who joined Thomas on the panel.\n\n\"Skokie is a welcoming community so we had that going for us,\" said Counard. On the other hand, the village is one of the most diverse, with 40-percent of the village's population foreign-born. Many families were bringing members from other countries to live with them.\n\nFor health care, \"people from Skokie were taking their parents down to Stroger (John H. Stroger Hospital on Chicago's West Side),\" she said.\n\nThe two municipalities joined together on an application to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, seeking support for a community health center for a medically-underserved area.\n\nThe new health center, Erie's first outside of Chicago, received an annual operating grant of $650,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the NorthShore University HealthSystem contributed $1.2 million for the new permanent health center, as well as committing $600,000 in operating support over three years.\n\nErie officials say the expanded space of the new center has filled up quickly, accommodating the new services.\n\n\"We're growing rapidly,\" said Hart. \"We started with three rooms in the civic center. We're using 15 (in the new space).\n\nMany of the center's providers are bi-lingual, an asset in working with the large number of Spanish-speaking patients who use Erie. In addition, the center engages an interpretive services firm to aid staff in dealing with patients who speak other languages.\n\n\"I have patients from Iraq who speak a language, Assyrian, which is basically a language that was spoken in Palestine 2,000 years ago,\" Hart noted.\n\nHe saw a couple of families who only spoke Mongolian, prompting a call to interpretive services.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Health center services in demand at new site in Evanston", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Lisa Robinson, the operations director at the Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center, was leading some visitors around the center earlier this year when she stopped in front of a station where a health worker in medical gown and surgical mask was leaning over a patient.", "title": "Health center services in demand at new site in Evanston", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/news/ct-evr-eriefocus-tl-0310-20150413-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-552c1a5a/turbine/ct-evr-eriefocus-tl-0310-20150413", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center, health care, Tisdahl, Affordable Care Act, NorthShore University HealthSystem", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/83285872", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-13", "Description": "Local officials see Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center playing major role in meeting health needs.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center, health care, Tisdahl, Affordable Care Act, NorthShore University HealthSystem"}, "article_summary": "A federally-qualified health center for the area was set in motion in 2007 when Evanston closed its city health department in a cost-cutting move.\nThe two municipalities joined together on an application to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, seeking support for a community health center for a medically-underserved area.\n\"It started to raise a warning flag for us in public health and health care,\" she said.\nYes, dentistry is one of the services offered at the health center, she said, with many Evanston and Skokie school children receiving their initial examination before starting school.\nIn addition, the NorthShore University HealthSystem contributed $1.2 million for the new permanent health center, as well as committing $600,000 in operating support over three years."}
