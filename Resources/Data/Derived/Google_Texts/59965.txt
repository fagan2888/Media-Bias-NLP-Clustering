On today's Your Call, we’ll talk about decisions affecting the ability to lie in political ads, buy a gun while lying to the dealer about who the gun is for, and sue corporations for toxic chemical contamination. We’re still waiting for decisions affecting the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act, cell phone searches, and greenhouse gases. What do you want to know about these cases? It’s Your Call with Rose Aguilar and you.
