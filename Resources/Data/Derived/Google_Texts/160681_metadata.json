Why are people who live in the richest and most powerful country in the world so disgruntled and depressed that they\u2019ll turn to a democratic socialist or a bombastic billionaire to lead the country?\n\nIn a word, they feel \u201ccheated.\u201d And they figure many people were looking the other way or even winking at the bad behavior that was undermining their dreams. The status quo wasn\u2019t working for them in any institution. So enter Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders\u2014two outsiders who say, \u201cYou\u2019re right! You have been cheated, and I\u2019m going to fix it.\u201d\n\nIt probably started just after the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when Enron, a company that employed 20,000 people, declared bankruptcy and its executives were ultimately accused of fraud.\n\nRelated: Trump Supporters Want Leader Who Ignores the Rules\n\nCompanies suspected of accounting fraud, insider trading and other schemes totaling billions were in the SEC\u2019s crosshairs. The list included executives of Tyco, who were indicted for earning $600 million through stock fraud; Cendant, $3 billion; WorldCom, $6.1 billion; Health South, $1.4 billion; and the father of all Ponzi schemes, Bernard Madoff, $65 billion.\n\nSo big business lies and cheats. What about everyone else?\n\nCheating starts early \u2014 and often:\n\n80% of the country's best students cheated to get to the top of their class.\n\nMore than half the students surveyed said that they don't think cheating is a big deal.\n\n95% of cheaters say they were not caught.\n\n40% cheated on a quiz or a test\n\n67% copied someone else's homework\n\nOk, but what about everyone else?\n\nOur sports heroes don\u2019t cheat, do they? Aside from tennis star, Maria Sharapova, how many baseball, football and basketball stars have willingly admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs? And we haven\u2019t even talked about Deflategate.\n\nRelated: Trump Voters\u2014Cut Trump Loose Se He Can Shake Up the Country\n\nHmmm. OK, but what about everyone else?\n\nOk, let\u2019s get back to business. If price gouging is cheating, then let\u2019s talk about Martin Shkreli, the pharma bro CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals who acquired a 62-year old drug, Daraprim, and raised its price more than 5,000 percent to $750 a pill from $13.50. But he\u2019s not alone. Prices for four of the nation's top 10 drugs have increased more than 100 percent since 2011. Six others went up more than 50 percent. Together, the price increases on drugs for arthritis, high cholesterol, asthma and other common problems added billions in costs for consumers, employers and government health programs.\n\nYikes! OK, but what about everyone else?\n\nThere are two institutions that should have been off-limits to corruption of any sort \u2014 schools and places of worship. Well, they weren\u2019t. Voters learned that 600 teachers accused of misconduct in New York were sent to \u201crubber rooms\u201d at full pay for months or years at a time awaiting resolution of their cases. In other states, teachers would be dismissed from one school or district and reassigned to another \u2014 even if they were accused of child abuse. That strategy was also used to reassign Catholic priests accused or suspected of sexually abusing children.\n\nHoly S\u2026. OK, there are still some institutions that don\u2019t screw up, aren\u2019t there?\n\nWell, being duped by the government on the Iraq War, which took the lives of nearly 5,000 soldiers and contractors and cost almost $6 trillion dollars \u2014 that counts. So does the billions of taxpayer money wasted on Afghanistan reconstruction, the incompetent and costly launch of Healthcare.gov, the inexcusable hacking of millions of taxpayer social security numbers at the IRS.... But maybe I\u2019m getting off track.\n\nRelated: Not So Fast Hillary, Bernie\u2019s Right About Breaking Up the Banks\n\nOMG. OK. That still doesn\u2019t explain the massive voter anger.\n\nWell, I saved the dessert for last \u2014 the Great Recession. And once again, we\u2019re back to unmitigated greed. I\u2019m not going to explain mortgage-backed securities, or credit default swaps, or other derivatives, but think of it this way: Selling houses to people who couldn\u2019t afford to pay for them was just the first step in a giant mortgage scheme. Cutting up that mortgage into little pieces and repackaging it with pieces of other mortgages created \u201ctoxic assets\u201d that were sold and resold globally until the entire toxic house of cards collapsed.\n\nTo stop a complete collapse of the U.S. financial system, the government bailed out the banks, but not the homeowners who were underwater: So, 8.8 million people lost their jobs, 3 million lost their homes, and an entire generation of 80 million millennials came of age thinking they had no future.\n\nDoes that make you angry?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Why are Americans angry?", "title": "How Voter Anger Finally Erupted and Gave Us Trump and Sanders", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/07/How-Voter-Anger-Finally-Erupted-and-Gave-Us-Trump-and-Sanders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/0o1a3567-1082.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/07/How-Voter-Anger-Finally-Erupted-and-Gave-Us-Trump-and-Sanders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/0o1a3567-1082.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Why are Americans angry?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Trump Voters\u2014Cut Trump Loose Se He Can Shake Up the CountryHmmm.\nRelated: Trump Supporters Want Leader Who Ignores the RulesCompanies suspected of accounting fraud, insider trading and other schemes totaling billions were in the SEC\u2019s crosshairs.\nCheating starts early \u2014 and often:80% of the country's best students cheated to get to the top of their class.\nAside from tennis star, Maria Sharapova, how many baseball, football and basketball stars have willingly admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs?\nSo enter Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders\u2014two outsiders who say, \u201cYou\u2019re right!"}
