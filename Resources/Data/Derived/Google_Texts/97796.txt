Johnathon Walker

Police say a father shot his daughters, his girlfriend and her mother in their home and then killed himself after the shooting that left three generations of women dead and a 12-year-old critically injured.

New York Police Department spokesman Steve Davis says Jonathon Walker's body was found in a car, with a gun inside, in an isolated part of Queens after Saturday's pre-dawn shootings.

A 7-year-old, her 31-year-old mother and 62-year-old grandmother were killed on a suburban-style street near John F. Kennedy International Airport. A great-uncle says the 12-year-old called 911 to alert police and has been undergoing surgery.

Relatives say they're staggered by the shootings and had never seen any sign of trouble in the family.
