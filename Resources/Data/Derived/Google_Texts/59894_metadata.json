He always tries to make it that he has the moral authority, and everybody else is wrong, not just wrong in terms of an opinion, or a point of view, but wrong morally. And I just find that arrogant, and I find it troubling, and I also find it a very sort of cheap way to keep from having a legitimate discussion about proper policy of dealing with radical jihadism. You don\u2019t have a discussion when you say, look, I\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong, end of discussion. And it\u2019s not just on this issue, but whether it\u2019s Obamacare, or whether it\u2019s gun control, this is a president who always sort of lifts his head, puts his nose up in the air, and tells us that we\u2019re just not as strong morally, and we just don\u2019t have the same virtue and character that he does when it comes to assessing these issues, and I think a lot of Americans truly resent that.\u201d\n\nHuckabee also responded to comparisons between Syrian refugees and the Pilgrims with, \u201cit\u2019s one thing to come to America because you\u2019re escaping tyranny. It\u2019s another to come to America because you want to create a tyranny of a caliphate. And we have every right, you know what, we have a responsibility to make sure that we know the difference between people who want to come here because they love America, they love freedom, and they want to live the American Dream, and people who want to come here and take us back to the 7th century, and blow up our children, our neighborhoods, our schools, and our shopping malls. You know, the Boston Marathon bombers came here. They even became citizens. We hear about assimilation. But, you know, after they got assimilated, they did not lose that basic fanaticism that caused them to wreak the carnage that they did at the Boston Marathon. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to prevent. I think we have every right to do that, Tucker.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Huckabee: Obama 'Always' Tells Us 'We Just Don't Have the Same Virtue' He Does", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Huckabee: Obama 'Always' Tells Us 'We Just Don't Have the Same Virtue' He Does", "title": "Huckabee: Obama 'Always' Tells Us 'We Just Don't Have the Same Virtue' He Does - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Huckabee-1128-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/28/huckabee-obama-always-tells-us-we-just-dont-have-the-same-virtue-he-does/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huckabee: Obama 'Always' Tells Us 'We Just Don't Have the Same Virtue' He Does", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Huckabee-1128-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Huckabee: Obama 'Always' Tells Us 'We Just Don't Have the Same Virtue' He Does - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Mike Huckabee, President Obama, Syrian refugees,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obama,Huckabee", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Syrian refugees", "published_time": "2015-11-28T11:44:28-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "You don\u2019t have a discussion when you say, look, I\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong, end of discussion.\nHe always tries to make it that he has the moral authority, and everybody else is wrong, not just wrong in terms of an opinion, or a point of view, but wrong morally.\nIt\u2019s another to come to America because you want to create a tyranny of a caliphate.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHuckabee said, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the frustrating things about this president.\nI think we have every right to do that, Tucker.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
