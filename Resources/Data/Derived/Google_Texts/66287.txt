Hi Johnnie. What are the plans for the land along the St. Vrain on Boston Avenue, just across from Budget Home Center where the trailer park was located before being flooded out?

Heavy equipment has been working there from time to time for the past few months. I thought at one time that this was going to become part of the greenway with maybe trees and stuff. â€” CD

Hi CD. That's the site of the former Royal Mobile Home Park, which after being flooded in September of 2013 was purchased by the city.

"Currently, the land is being used as an equipment staging area by contractors working on the Main Street Pavement Reconstruction and Main Street Bridge Replacement at St. Vrain Creek projects," city spokeswoman Jennifer Loper said in an email response.

Loper said the site also will be used as a staging site during the South Pratt Parkway bridge replacement, which is scheduled for construction after completion of the Main Street bridge replacement. That's expected to be in the fall of 2016.

"Long-term, this area is included in Resilient St. Vrain, the City's project to make the community more resilient to up to 100-year flood flows by widening the creek channel and reducing the size of the floodplain throughout Longmont," Loper said.

The city has applied for federal funds for the portions of the project upstream of Main Street, which includes the former mobile home park, she said. The timing of the projects will depending upon the availability of funding.

"Future plans for the former Royal Mobile Home Park site could include a public space with accessibility to the creek, as well as an art piece commemorating the flooding," Loper said, adding that specifics, including the timetable, will not be available for this area until funding is secured.

CD, if you or others want to keep track of the flood-recovery process, you can do so at LongmontColorado.gov/flood-info or 303-651-8376.
