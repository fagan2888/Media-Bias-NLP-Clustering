DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/g5zg84/us_generic_drug) has announced the addition of the "US Generic Drug Market Opportunity Outlook 2020" report to their offering.

Generic drugs are being actively accepted by various stake holders of US pharmaceutical industry due to higher cost arbitrage without compromising in quality. They do not have to go through legal issues due to which number of generic firms is increasing. Manufacturing process is already standardized due to which lesser input in terms of technological development is required. Physicians also have familiarity with these drugs making them easy to try generic versions of branded drugs.

It helps both patients and government in long-term to achieve higher cost arbitrage. Several regulations have been made in past years which makes it easy for generic firms to enter in competition. With time, improvement has been made in existing infrastructure making it possible to achieve higher growth in US market.

Generic drugs have emerged as an important part of US pharmaceutical industry due to which it has become imperative to develop this industry. However, some critics have raised concerns over increasing commercialization of generic medicines. Developers of new drugs are investing a lot in research and development segment and presence of generic will compete with their product in same category leading to loss of market shares.

This scenario will lead to aversion among pharmaceutical developers leading to lesser innovation and introduction of costly drugs. Balance between rights of developers and profits has to achieve by regulators in coming years. FDA is patient centric organization and it would not expose patients to undue risk for cost saving purposes. Their regulations have been changed with time in order to make them more amenable for both patients and drug developers.
