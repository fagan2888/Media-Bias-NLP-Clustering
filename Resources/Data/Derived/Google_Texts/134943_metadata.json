To the burgeoning genre of conservative analyses attributing Trump\u2019s rise to things conservatives already hate, National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar adds the passage of Obamacare:\n\nIma\u00adgine, for a mo\u00adment, the state of the 2010 midterms without Obama\u00adcare in the equa\u00adtion. Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans would have run against the stag\u00adnant state of the eco\u00adnomy with some suc\u00adcess. But without the gal\u00advan\u00adiz\u00ading op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion to Obama\u2019s health care law\u2014Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans net\u00adted a whop\u00adping 63 House seats that year\u2014Demo\u00adcrats would likely have nar\u00adrowly kept con\u00adtrol of Con\u00adgress, and con\u00adtin\u00adued to press for\u00adward with Obama\u2019s agenda. There would be tea-party-aligned Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans elec\u00adted, but ab\u00adsent the wave, not enough to form the con\u00adcer\u00adted op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion that emerged. \u2026 With in\u00adtensi\u00adfy\u00ading en\u00adergy on the Right, the biggest polit\u00adic\u00adal threat to mem\u00adbers emerged from with\u00adin their own party, and they ad\u00adap\u00adted ac\u00adcord\u00adingly.\n\nLong story short, by shepherding a major social reform that has cut the uninsured rate in half while coming in well below its projected costs and bringing health-care inflation down to its lowest rate in recorded history, Obama angered Republicans, forcing them to nominate an ignorant, bigoted clown.\n\nOf course, one might just as easily follow this historical analysis back to a different starting point. For instance, by successfully designing and implementing a reform that managed to bring down the uninsured rate in a market-friendly way that did not disrupt existing private insurance, Mitt Romney made it irresistibly tempting for Obama to follow his model. Romney is the one who paved the way for Trump!\n\nBut there is also another inescapable implication of Kraushaar\u2019s argument. Kraushaar has insisted many, many times that the law is a political debacle for Democrats, and even predicted in 2013 that Democrats in Congress would probably join with Republicans to repeal it. Kraushaar has also predicted that Republicans have an edge that should make them the natural favorites to win in November.\n\nBut now he is saying that Obamacare set in motion a series of events that will lead to Republicans nominating an unelectable buffoon who, as Kraushaar has also said, \u201ccould blow the party to smithereens.\u201d Not only has the law proven a substantive triumph, but it has all but guaranteed the election of a Democratic successor to Obama (who otherwise would have lost) and possibly destroyed the opposition party.
