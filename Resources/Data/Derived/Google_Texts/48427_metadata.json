First, Shell Oil pulled the plug on its horrific current drilling effort there two weeks ago.\n\nNow the Obama administration has taken its first concrete steps to reduce future threats. Yesterday, it cancelled new lease sales scheduled for next year and 2017 in our Polar Bear Seas\u2014the Chukchi and Beaufort\u2014off the north Alaskan coast. And just said \u201cNo\u201d to extension requests from Shell and others holding existing leases in the region.\n\nThis is big. Up to now, the federal government has treated Arctic Ocean drilling as a done deal. As recently as last May, the President tweeted: \u201cwe can\u2019t prevent oil exploration completely in region.\u201d\n\n.@BigBennyFL 2/ But since we can't prevent oil exploration completely in region we're setting the highest possible standards \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) May 28, 2015\n\nHis administration focused on excluding some high value areas and saying drilling would be subject to high standards. It tentatively proposed to allow more leasing in the Arctic Ocean (and the Atlantic) after 2017.\n\nBut the tide has changed. Shell made a spectacle of itself, rushing to drill. Mother Nature asserted herself. Human error propagated in the harsh conditions.\n\nKayaktivists spotlighted Arctic drilling as a climate issue\u2014rightly, because huge new investments in dirty fuels can\u2019t be harmonized with accelerating the shift to a clean energy future.\n\nShareholders demanded that Shell explain how its exploration policies squared with limiting damage from global warming. Again rightly, not least because of the likelihood that increasingly effective carbon regulation and affordable efficiency and clean fuel alternatives will \u201cstrand\u201d fossil fuel assets, forcing companies to write them off.\n\nAlaska Natives joined environmentalists to enforce protective laws when the federal government didn\u2019t, setting back efforts to jam through new drilling.\n\nAnd yesterday, the Obama administration is starting to actively pull our energy policy away from the Arctic Ocean. Turns out drilling there may not be inevitable. \u201cAll of the above\u201d was always a slogan, not literally a policy: there were always some places off the table. Now we have a real shot at adding the U.S. Arctic Ocean to that list\u2014if we don\u2019t let up.\n\nSo hurrah for Obama, props to all those who raised their voices and/or their paddles, and let\u2019s keep on keepin\u2019 on.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\n14 Reasons Why We Must Never Drill in the Arctic\n\nArctic Warming Produces Mosquito Swarms Large Enough to Kill Baby Caribou\n\n10 Awesome Tweets From #ShellNo to Arctic Drilling Day of Action\n\nDon\u2019t Let Wall Street Leave You Behind: It\u2019s Time to Divest From Fossil Fuels", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration cancelled new leases in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the north Alaskan coast.
