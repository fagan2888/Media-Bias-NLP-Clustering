His time was expected to be secluded from the media, the cameras and the questioning.\n\nIt was anything but that Sunday as he responded to an al-Jazeera investigative documentary, \u201d The Dark Side,\u201d which alleged that Manning, the Broncos\u2019 veteran quarterback, received human growth hormone (HGH) from an anti-aging clinic in Indianapolis in 2011 when he was a member of the Colts and recovering from four neck surgeries.\n\nA discrepency in the allegations is the time of work and the role of al-Jazeera\u2019s primary source, Charles Sly, in the claims against Manning.\n\nSly, a man labeled in the documentary as a former pharmacist at The Guyer Institute, was recorded in the undercover investigation saying he mailed HGH to Manning\u2019s wife, Ashley, to avoid any link to the quarterback. Sly was a licensed pharmacy intern from April 27, 2010 to May 1, 2013, according to Indiana state records. The al-Jazeera report alleges he worked at the institute in 2011, when Manning was a patient at the clinic during his rehabilitation from the neck surgeries.\n\nBut The Guyer Institute; Manning\u2019s adviser, Ari Fleischer; and Sly, in comments made after the report\u2019s publication, said Sly was an intern at the clinic in 2013, not in 2011.\n\nSly recanted his comments in the documentary via a video statement published Saturday night, and he later told ESPN that he was not an employee of The Guyer Institute in 2011, as the report said, but was instead a pharmacy intern there in 2013.\n\nFleischer, a former White House press secretary and the head of a sports communications agency, told The Denver Post on Saturday that Sly was an unpaid intern of the clinic in 2013, from February to May.\n\nDr. Dale Guyer released two statements since the publication of the al-Jazeera report, disputing its claims of Sly\u2019s time of work and corroborating the dates provided by Fleischer.\n\n\u201cCharles Sly was never an employee of The Guyer Institute,\u201d Guyer said in a statement released Monday. \u201cAt the time in question, Mr. Sly was a pharmacy student in Nevada who emailed my office a request for an internship. Arrangements for his internship, including the specific start and end dates, were made through his school adviser.\n\n\u201cMr. Sly began his unpaid student internship with us on February 18th, 2013. He had no patient responsibilities at any time. Further, he had no affiliation with our office prior to February 18th, 2013 and has had none subsequent to the conclusion of his internship in May of 2013.\u201d\n\nSly\u2019s internship, according to the institute, was arranged through Roseman University of Health Sciences College of Pharmacy in Henderson, Nev.\n\nSince the al-Jazeera report, Manning has vehemently denied taking HGH, has said he\u2019s contemplated suing for defamation, and has denied knowing or ever meeting Sly.\n\nal-Jazeera reporter Deborah Davies has stood by her team\u2019s findings, telling al-Jazeera America\u2019s David Shuster, as well as Sports Illustrated\u2019s Peter King, that they have confirmation of Sly\u2019s work at the clinic in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe have confirmed absolutely Charlie Sly worked in the Guyer clinic,\u201d Davies told Shuster. \u201cI rang them directly before the program went out, and they gave me the precise start date that he worked there in 2011. We know that for sure growth hormone was shipped to Ashley Manning in Florida.\u201d\n\nManning told ESPN on Sunday that he was \u201csick\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the report when he first learned of it, then went on to call it \u201cfabricated\u201d and \u201d a freaking joke.\u201d\n\nManning said he was a patient of the institute in 2011, but his treatments \u2014 use of a hyperbaric chamber, intravenous nutrient treatments and enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP), a non-surgical treatment that aims to increase blood flow \u2014 were under the supervision of the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n\u201cAny medical treatments that my wife received, that\u2019s her business,\u201d Manning told ESPN\u2019s Lisa Salters in a television interview Sunday. \u201cThat has nothing to do with me. Nothing that\u2019s ever been sent to her or my wife has used have I ever taken. Absolutely not. I have my treatments that I do. She may have hers, and that\u2019s her business. There is no connection between the two. I would love to understand why this guy is saying this, why he\u2019s making it up, and then he admits that he makes it up, yet it still becomes a story. I\u2019d like to be told and explained that.\u201d\n\nThe NFL on Monday said it is reviewing the matter and that it is league procedure to follow up on any information that potentially involves a violation. The NFL Players Association has declined to comment.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clinic in Peyton Manning report disputes role, time of work of al-Jazeera source", "title": "Clinic in Peyton Manning report disputes role, time of work of al-Jazeera source", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/28/clinic-in-peyton-manning-report-disputes-role-time-of-work-of-al-jazeera-source/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Peyton-Manning-Steelersp1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Peyton-Manning-Steelersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-28T16:08:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:16:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCharles Sly was never an employee of The Guyer Institute,\u201d Guyer said in a statement released Monday.\n\u201cAny medical treatments that my wife received, that\u2019s her business,\u201d Manning told ESPN\u2019s Lisa Salters in a television interview Sunday.\nSince the al-Jazeera report, Manning has vehemently denied taking HGH, has said he\u2019s contemplated suing for defamation, and has denied knowing or ever meeting Sly.\nThe al-Jazeera report alleges he worked at the institute in 2011, when Manning was a patient at the clinic during his rehabilitation from the neck surgeries.\nDr. Dale Guyer released two statements since the publication of the al-Jazeera report, disputing its claims of Sly\u2019s time of work and corroborating the dates provided by Fleischer."}
