What exacerbates this trend is the fact that many payers are cutting the prices they pay for certain inpatient services.\n\nCollectively, these two developments mean less inpatient revenue for many hospitals and that often translates into reduced budgets for the clinical laboratories.\n\nBut that is not the whole story concerning inpatient revenue. Spurred by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other market developments, payers now want to shift reimbursement away from fee-for-service to new models of reimbursement. This includes capitation or bundled payment models.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why hospital use rates are declining in many areas of the nation, noted a report published by healthcareaffairs.org. One factor appears to be a correlation between the level and pace of the regional market\u2019s shift toward value-based medicine\u2014particularly through establishment of accountable-care organizations (ACOs)\u2014and the level and pace of declines in hospital inpatient utilization.\n\nDecline in Hospital Utilization Spells Rise in Primary Care Visits\n\nMilliman, an actuarial firm with claims data for about half of the nation\u2019s commercial insurers, predicted that inpatient admissions per 1,000 patients will decline through 2021 in all markets. This will be true whether care is \u201cloosely,\u201d \u201cmoderately,\u201d or \u201cwell\u201d managed.\n\nMore specifically, Milliman projects that inpatient admissions per 1,000 will drop from 103 in 2012 to 88 by 2021. Milliman based its analysis on a 2011 multi-state study of declining inpatient utilization that was done by Kaufman, Hall & Associates, Inc..\n\nStatistics from the Medicare program provide additional evidence that inpatient volumes are declining. In its \u201cReport to the Congress on Medicare Payment Policy\u2013March 2012,\u201d MedPac wrote: \u201cThe shift away from the inpatient setting is reflected in declining inpatient occupancy rates and a decline in the share of beneficiaries using inpatient services. From 2004 to 2010, the overall hospital bed occupancy rate declined 2 percentage points, from approximately 68% to 66%. In addition, the share of Medicare FFS beneficiaries using inpatient hospital services declined 2 percentage points, from 22% to 20% from 2006 to 2010. Similarly, from 2006 to 2010, the number of Medicare inpatient bed days per beneficiary declined from 1.9 in 2006 to 1.7 bed days per beneficiary in 2010.\u201d\n\nThese statistics are interpreted by some healthcare experts as confirming that the end of the hospital-centric care model is approaching. As that happens, the role of hospitals in care delivery systems will shift from solely acute care diagnostic and treatment activities toward delivering value-based quality care\u2014doing the right thing for the patient at the right time, stressed the healthcareaffairs.org report. This will require eliminating unnecessary clinical and testing activities, as well as educating patients and family members about preventive health activities and incentivizing physician participation in value-based care.\n\nMoreover, the success of hospitals in the value-care arena will require a strong, organized physician platform, along with exceptional communication and health information technology (HIT) infrastructure and capabilities.\n\nCertainly there are some hospitals and some regions of the nation where inpatient volumes remain constant or may even be increasing. But it is important for clinical laboratory administrators to understand the national trends. The statistics presented above explain why so many hospitals and health systems are cutting costs and shrinking the budgets for clinical service lines, including their medical laboratories.\n\n\u2014by Patricia Kirk\n\nRelated Information:\n\nDecline in Utilization Rates Signals A Change In The Inpatient Business Model\n\nMayo Clinic\u2019s cure for an ailing medical system\n\nMedPac: Report to the Congress on Medicare Payment Policy\u2013March 2012\n\nWhile ACO Care Coordination Holds Promise for Improving Quality and Lowering Healthcare Costs, It\u2019s Still a \u2018Work in Progress\u2019\n\nRanking of Nation\u2019s 15 Biggest Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) Shows Fast Growth of this Model of Integrated Clinical Care\n\nWhile ACO Care Coordination Holds Promise for Improving Quality and Lowering Healthcare Costs, It\u2019s Still a \u2018Work in Progress\u2019", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, affordable care act, aca, accountable care organization, aco, bundled payment, free-for-payment, capitated payment, american hospital association, aha, value-based  medicine, mayo clinic, john noseworthy, hospital utilization, cnn money, healthaffairs.org, center for medicare & medicaid, cms, medicare shared savings program, integrated care. coordinated care, hospital centric model, population-centric model, healthcare, milliman, primary care, optum labs, unitedhealth group  ,aca,accountable care organization,aco,affordable care act,aha,american hospital association,bundled payment,capitated payment,center for medicare & medicaid,clinical laboratory,cms,cnn money,free-for-payment,healthaffairs.org,healthcare,hospital centric model,hospital utilization,integrated care. coordinated care,john noseworthy,mayo clinic,medical laboratory,medicare shared savings program,milliman,optum labs,population-centric model,primary care,unitedhealth group,value-based medicine,coding, billing, and collections,compliance, legal, and malpractice,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology", "description": "With implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and establishment of accountable-care organizations, payers are rapidly changing reimbursement from fee-for-service to capitated or bundled payment.
