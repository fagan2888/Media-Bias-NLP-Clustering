His cordiality didn't last long.\n\nIn a series of more classically Trumpian tweets on Wednesday morning, Trump accused Cruz of using underhanded and fraudulent tactics to win in Iowa, and he called for Cruz's results to be nullified or a new election to be held.\n\nBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nTed Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nDuring primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nMany people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nThe Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz.
