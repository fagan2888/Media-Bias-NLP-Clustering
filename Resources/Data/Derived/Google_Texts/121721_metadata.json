They recovered a quantity of controlled substances, drug paraphernalia, weapons, cash and other items.\n\nNext, task force members began a search for subjects in the community that had outstanding warrants. They also knocked on doors and talked with community members about illegal drug activities in the area.\n\nChief of Police William Mertig of the Red Cliff Police Department said he could not provide details about the items taken. He also advised that the names of the suspects will not be released at this time, pending the filing of criminal charges.\n\n\u201cOur department would like to thank the community and the other agencies involved in this operation for all their support,\u201d Chief Mertig said. \u201cI also really want to stress how important the NADGI group is, and what they\u2019ve done to help Native communities here in Wisconsin. It\u2019s critical that they stay active and stay funded.\n\n\u201cTribal law enforcement is often considered lesser by state and federal counterparts,\u201d he continued. \u201cWith NADGI, with the training and resources we\u2019re allowed to get \u2014 it makes us equal or better. It\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nChief Mertig stressed that since the formation of NADGI, tribal law enforcement has made significant gains in its fight against illegal drugs and the problems associated with them. He noted that NADGI has built a strong working relationship with partners at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nIn addition, he acknowledged the role of the Red Cliff Tribal Council for its strong support of the Red Cliff Police Department\u2019s efforts to make the community safer.\n\nThe Red Cliff Indian Reservation, located on the shores of Lake Superior in Bayfield County, Wisconsin, is home to the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. Just offshore are the Apostle Islands and the spiritual center of the Ojibwe Nation, 12-mile-long Madeline Island.\n\nRELATED: Explore the Apostle Islands by Land, Boat or on Foot", "article_metadata": {"description": "A month-long investigation into illegal drug activity on the Red Cliff Indian Reservation in northwest Wisconsin led to the arrest of five suspects.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/27/red-cliff-war-drugs-goes-door-door-155523", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/red_cliff_map.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Red Cliff War on Drugs Goes Door-to-Door"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-27T14:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Red Cliff War on Drugs Goes Door-to-Door"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/27/red-cliff-war-drugs-goes-door-door-155523", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Red Cliff Indian Reservation, Drug Bust, War on Drugs, Red Cliff Police Department, Native American Drug and Gang Initiative, NADGI, Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation, Bayfield County Sheriff\u2019s Department, William Mertig", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Red Cliff War on Drugs Goes Door-to-Door"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2639\"", "article_summary": "According to a statement from the Red Cliff Police Department, task force members executed two search warrants after months of investigation in the Red Cliff community.\nThe Red Cliff Indian Reservation, located on the shores of Lake Superior in Bayfield County, Wisconsin, is home to the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.\nIn addition, he acknowledged the role of the Red Cliff Tribal Council for its strong support of the Red Cliff Police Department\u2019s efforts to make the community safer.\nChief of Police William Mertig of the Red Cliff Police Department said he could not provide details about the items taken.\nEarlier this week, local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies concluded a month-long investigation into illegal drug activity on the Red Cliff Indian Reservation in northwest Wisconsin with the arrest of five suspects."}
