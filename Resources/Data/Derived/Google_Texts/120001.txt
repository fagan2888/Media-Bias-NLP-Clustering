The message I try to leave is there’s nothing they can’t do or no one they can’t be.

WOOLWICH TWP. — Kingsway High School’s U.S. Government class had a visitor Tuesday that gave them a first-hand account of what the country’s government actually does.

U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-2 of Ventnor, stopped by the high school for more than an hour of interaction with the students, who ranged from freshmen to seniors in the government class, as well as American History classes.

He discussed his past and his job and took questions from the students on topics that ranged from his opinions on Gov. Chris Christie and the Affordable Care Act to Syria and homeland security.

“It’s very motivational and inspirational for me to see the level of intelligence and questions from this age group,” he said. “The message I try to leave is there’s nothing they can’t do or no one they can’t be.”

LoBiondo was invited by two senior students, Ryan Sharp and Austin Schober, who participate on the congressman’s Youth Advisory Council. They spend one day a month meeting with him and other students from throughout the congressman’s district and wanted to bring that experience to their fellow classmates.

“It’s important for this age group to understand how our country works and how it’s going to affect them,” Sharp said.

“I just want them to be interested and listen as much as they can,” Schober added.

For the past week, the students in Kristian Ward’s class have been preparing for LoBiondo’s visit, discussing what members of the House of Representatives do, researching the congressman himself and preparing questions for the visit.

“The congressman has a great story and it’s important for them to see the people in Washington are just like us,” Ward said.
