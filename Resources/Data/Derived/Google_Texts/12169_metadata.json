No action, though, has been taken on the measure, which has 115 co-sponsors.\n\nThe letter was sent to the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Business groups are calling on congressional leaders to repeal a health care reform law provision that will impose a hefty federal excise tax on high cost health care plans.Under that Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provision, a 40% excise tax will be imposed, starting in 2018, on group...", "title": "Business groups call for repeal of Cadillac tax - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150626/NEWS03/150629877", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20150626/NEWS03/150629877/AR/0/health-care-reform-cadillac-tax.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Business groups are calling on congressional leaders to repeal a health care reform law provision that will impose a hefty federal excise tax on high cost health care plans.Under that Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provision, a 40% excise tax will be imposed, starting in 2018, on group...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Business groups call for repeal of Cadillac tax - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "Business groups are calling on congressional leaders to repeal a health care reform law provision that will impose a hefty federal excise tax on high cost health care plans.\nIn addition, the 40% tax will be \u201ccomplicated to calculate and administer,\u201d the groups said.\n2050, to repeal the tax was earlier introduced in the House of Representatives.\nUnder that Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provision, a 40% excise tax will be imposed, starting in 2018, on group health care plan premiums exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.\nThe letter was sent to the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees."}
