(WCBI) \u2013 \u2013 Lowndes County Coroner, Greg Merchant, has confirmed that the victim is Brandon Michael Gordon, 25, of Columbus. According to Interim Police Chief, Fred Shelton, police believe the young man was shot around Florence Street, then fled to Beech Street where he was found behind a home. Gorden called 911 and police tried pinging his phone to find his location in an attempt to save his life.\n\n\u201cWe received the 911 call about 1:40 p.m. concerning the person that had been shot laying in the backyard at that address. Upon arrival, we located a young man that had been shot. He was calling the ambulance, he was transported to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead,\u201d said Interim Chief Shelton.\n\nA resident of the home, Alexis Rice, was in the house with her brother when police started to put crime scene tape around their yard.\n\n\u201cI was in my room just watching a couple of videos on YouTube, and then I just heard doors slamming, and I\u2019m thinking like what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s my brother or something, that\u2019s why I ran into the living room to see what was going on,\u201d said Alexis Rice.\n\nShe had no idea what was going on because she never heard or saw anything until cops arrived.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m in shock because it happened like in the back of my yard,\u201d said Alexis Rice.\n\nOfficers are trying to determine if or why a dispute happened, and what the motive for the shooting may be.\n\nThey are actively pursuing a lead to arrest a person of interest, but have not released a name.\n\nInterim Police Chief, Fred Shelton says the Columbus Police Department will not stop until they solve this case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on top of this. We\u2019re making sure this doesn\u2019t happen. If anybody has any information concerning this case, do give us a call,\u201d said Interim Police Chief Fred Shelton.\n\nLowndes County Coroner, Greg Merchant, wouldn\u2019t say how many times the victim was shot, and police say they are still unsure if the victim and shooter knew each other.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WCBI.com", "description": "Lowndes County Coroner, Greg Merchant, has confirmed that the victim is Brandon Michael Gordon, 25, of Columbus.", "title": "Victim Identified In Columbus Homicide, Pursuing A Lead On A Person of Interest - WCBI.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.wcbi.com/local-news/victim-identified-in-columbus-homicide-pursuing-a-lead-on-a-person-of-interest/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lowndes County Coroner, Greg Merchant, has confirmed that the victim is Brandon Michael Gordon, 25, of Columbus.", "card": "summary", "title": "Victim Identified In Columbus Homicide, Pursuing A Lead On A Person of Interest - WCBI.com"}, "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2016-01-03T23:35:11-05:00"}, "google-site-verification": "7Zuo2E5GtpbSPvuY_4DO6OZh8poFOfJZWqHFQZCtRKU", "verify-v1": "7Zuo2E5GtpbSPvuY_4DO6OZh8poFOfJZWqHFQZCtRKU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He was calling the ambulance, he was transported to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead,\u201d said Interim Chief Shelton.\nIf anybody has any information concerning this case, do give us a call,\u201d said Interim Police Chief Fred Shelton.\nInterim Police Chief, Fred Shelton says the Columbus Police Department will not stop until they solve this case.\nThey are actively pursuing a lead to arrest a person of interest, but have not released a name.\n(WCBI) \u2013 \u2013 Lowndes County Coroner, Greg Merchant, has confirmed that the victim is Brandon Michael Gordon, 25, of Columbus."}
