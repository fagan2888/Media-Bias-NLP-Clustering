You know Democrats are in full panic mode when they break ranks with President Obama and vow to vote with Republicans on legislation proposed by the GOP to fix Obamacare.

That is exactly what is happening as top Democrats are now urging Obama to “fix” healthcare by Friday or they will vote with the House GOP on proposed legislation that “would allow insurance companies the option of continuing all existing health plans for a year,” the Washington Post reported.

U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s surprise announcement Tuesday that she will join fellow Democrats and cosponsor the “Keeping the Affordable Care Act Promise Act” showed yet another Democratic voice – including former President Bill Clinton’s – calling on Obama to fix healthcare and stand behind his promises to Americans that they can keep their plans if they like them.

Fox News’ Megyn Kelly reported on the breaking developments about the Democrats deadline for the president to make good on his promises Tuesday night.
