Dear Action Line: Our church got calls from a yellow pages outfit on the "oral contract" we had with them. This was the first we heard of this company or its ads. We are a small church and hung up. What's the story on this Online Public Yellow Pages? Â—- S.L., Tulsa.

Online Public Yellow Pages is just one of dozens of "bogus yellow pages directories" operating out of Canada. It was brought down by the FTC and Canadian "Project COLT," launched in 1998 to combat telemarketing crime. The 12 generated 13,000 consumer complaints, bilking $14 million from small businesses and churches in the U.S.

"Hiding behind borders to scam churches and small businesses is a tactic we've seen before," said Jessica Rich, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. "Scammers need to know that we have great relationships with our law enforcement partners in Canada and, as this case shows, we can and will work together to protect our consumers."

Court papers filed by the FTC say the defendants operated from Montreal using corporate shells and mail drops in the U.S. in Cheyenne, Wyo.; Las Vegas; Champlain, N.Y.; Wilmington, Del.; Newark, Del., and Alburgh, Vt., to hide their actual locations.

They made phone calls pretending to verify contact information to update or confirm existing directory listings. In many cases, they said they were calling about cancellation requests, asking to verify the organization's information to confirm cancellations. Defendants had no prior relationships with consumer victims.

The bills defendants sent averaged $500 and had "walking fingers" imagery. Some consumers paid, thinking someone in their organization had ordered these listings. Other consumers paid after the defendants used partially recorded phone conversations with consumers who had verified their contact information to convince them that they had a binding oral contract with the defendants, according to the FTC's complaint.

Consumers who ignored bills or refused to pay received collection calls and dunning notices, often with added interest charges, late fees and legal fees, as well as threats of collection agency referral, credit rating damage and legal action, the FTC alleged. To make consumers believe third-party debt collectors were involved, defendants created two bogus debt collection companies: CC Recovery and M&A Recovery, which also made threats. Defendants' threats convinced many to pay the bills, FTC alleges.

FTC's complaint alleges defendants violated the FTC Act by misrepresenting they had a pre-existing business relationship with consumers, that consumers had agreed to buy directory listings and that consumers owed them money.

The defendants are Mohamad Khaled Kaddoura, Derek Cessford and Aaron Kirby. The nine companies they ran are Modern Technology Inc., Strategic Advertisement Ltd., Dynamic Ad Corp., Wisetak Inc., Internet Solutions LLC, CessTech Inc., SEO Online LLC; CC Recovery Corporation and M&A Recovery Inc.

Their operations were shuttered by the U.S. District Court in Chicago and their assets frozen. FTC awaits a permanent injunction and an order "to return victims' money."
