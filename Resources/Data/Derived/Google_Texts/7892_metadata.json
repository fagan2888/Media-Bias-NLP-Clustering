But now researchers say that it\u2019s not just genetic material or what a mother eats during pregnancy that controls how a baby turns out: babies born to unhealthy parents are \u201cpre-programmed,\u201d in a way, to have a greater risk of poor health.\n\nIn other words, a baby\u2019s health relies on parental health long before conception. \u201cThe reality is, the child doesn\u2019t quite start from scratch \u2014 they already carry over a legacy of factors from their parents\u2019 experiences that can shape development in the fetus and after birth,\u201d said Professor Sarah Robertson, author of the study and director of the University of Adelaide\u2019s Robinson Research Institute, in a press release. \u201cDepending on the situation, we can give our children a burden before they\u2019ve even started life.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s not always the case that \u201ca child represented a new beginning, with a fresh start,\u201d where parental health doesn\u2019t matter, Robertson says.\n\nThe study, which was completed at the University of Adelaide and published in Science, said that pre-conception environmental factors have more of an effect on a child\u2019s future health than previously believed. Both eggs and sperm store environmental factors, which impact the child just as much as genes. \u201cMany things we do in the lead up to conceiving is having an impact on the future development of the child \u2014 from the age of the parents, to poor diet, obesity, smoking and many other factors, all of which influence environmental signals transmitted into the embryo,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nResearch has shown that smoking, obesity, drugs, alcohol, a diet lacking in nutrition, lack of exercise, and age all can affect the development and growth of a baby in the womb. Studies have also discovered that a mother's stress could be passed down to her child. Now, the environmental factors of both parents' health has proven to be just as important in determing a child's future health.\n\nThese environmental factors (or essentially parents' poor health) can contribute to disorders like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as anxiety and metabolic diseases in the child. And the role of the father is much more important than once believed. \u201cThis really is a new frontier for reproductive and developmental research,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt\u2019s only been in the last 10 years that the science community has been seriously discussing these issues, and only in the last five years that we\u2019ve begun to understand the mechanisms of how this is happening.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the researchers conclude that adjusting how you live your life just months before conception could help ensure your baby has a higher chance of being healthy.\n\nSource: Robertson S, Robker R, Lane M.
