It has taken on enormous importance because only 13 states and the District of Columbia operate their own exchange, or marketplace. Three more states established marketplaces, but rely on the federal HealthCare.gov online market. The remaining 34 states declined to establish a marketplace, leaving the job to the federal government, an option provided by the law.\n\nThe challengers argue that the four words mean that no one in these 34 states should get assistance.\n\nThe Obama administration, which points to other parts of the law that make clear subsidies are meant to be available everywhere, has been providing aid in all 50 states for the last two years.\n\nToday, an estimated 6.3 million people have subsidized health insurance in states that did not \u201cestablish\u201d their own marketplaces.\n\nHere are three ways the justices may answer the question posed in King vs. Burwell and the potential impact of what they decide:\n\nPlain text\n\nLawyers are fond of claiming the words of a complex law can have only one meaning. In this case, both the conservative challengers and the administration lawyers insist the plain text of the law supports their view.\n\nMichael Carvin, the lawyer for the challengers, relies on the words \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d This is \u201cextraordinarily straightforward,\u201d he said. \u201cAny English speaker would immediately understand\u201d that no subsidies are allowed in states without their own marketplaces.\n\nSuch an argument may resonate with the court\u2019s conservatives. \u201cOur job is to follow the text even if doing so will supposedly undercut a basic objective of the statute,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a June 15 bankruptcy decision. Justice Antonin Scalia said during the oral argument the court would not \u201ctwist the words as necessary\u201d for the law to make sense.\n\nTed Cruz Mark Wilson / Getty Images Sen.

Donald Verrilli pointed to other passages that say subsidies \u201cshall be allowed\u201d for any \u201capplicable taxpayer\u201d who qualifies based on his or her income.\n\nThe law also gives states \u201cflexibility\u201d to establish a marketplace, or \u201cexchange.\u201d If a state chose not to, federal officials shall \u201cestablish and operate such exchange within the state,\u201d the law states.\n\nVerrilli argued this text plainly means a federally run marketplace serves as a state marketplace, so all eligible taxpayers may receive subsidies.\n\nDefer to government\n\nThe high court has often decided that a complex regulatory law can be read in more than one way.\n\nIn such cases, the justices have often deferred to the federal agency that administers the law, so long as its interpretation fits reasonably with the words of the law. This reasoning is known as \u201cChevron deference,\u201d in reference to a 1984 case in which the court backed federal regulators\u2019 interpretation of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThis is a fallback argument for the Obama administration lawyers. In 2012, the Treasury Department decided that while law was not entirely clear, the tax subsidies for health insurance should be available through any marketplace.\n\nLast year, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals also used this reasoning to support the government in the current legal challenge. Because the law itself was \u201cambiguous,\u201d the government\u2019s reasonable interpretation should prevail, the judges said.\n\nStates' rights\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy and Chief Justice John G. Roberts may be swayed to the government\u2019s side because of the potentially disastrous impact on the states.\n\nIn the past, the high court has said states must be given \u201cclear notice\u201d when Congress imposes new laws and requirements.\n\nThe healthcare law did not clearly tell state officials that their failure to establish their own marketplace would deprive their residents of insurance subsidies. Lawyers for 22 states raised this argument in a friend-of-the-court brief and argued it would be unfair and unconstitutional to punish their residents.\n\nKennedy took note of that claim. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument,\u201d he warned the lawyer for the challengers during the oral argument in March.\n\nThe impact of the court\u2019s decision will vary depending upon which argument they embrace.\n\nA plain-text ruling that invalidates the subsidies in 34 states would have the most dramatic impact, stripping aid from more than 6 million people and likely throwing insurance markets in these states into chaos.\n\nInsurance companies warn they will raise premiums dramatically, as only sick consumers are likely to maintain coverage without government assistance.\n\nAnd with a bulging population of uninsured people, hospitals and other medical providers are expected to be swamped with patients who cannot pay their bills.\n\nAnother possibility, raised by Justice Samuel A. Alito during the oral argument, would be to declare the subsidies illegal in states without an exchange, but delay the effectiveness of the decision until the end of the year. This could avoid a sudden disruption and give state and federal officials time to devise a \u201cfix.\u201d\n\nBut few people believe congressional Republicans, who still demand repeal of the law, and the president, could reach an agreement to restore the subsidies in states that don\u2019t operate their own marketplaces.\n\nAnd while some states may move to establish their own marketplaces to maintain aid, many GOP state leaders, particularly in the South, remain deeply hostile to the health law and are unlikely to act.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Legal arguments that could sway Supreme Court on Affordable Care Act", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The Supreme Court will decide a seemingly simple question this month in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act : Does the law limit subsidies for low- and moderate-income consumers to insurance purchased through an exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d", "title": "Legal arguments that could sway Supreme Court on Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-supreme-court-health-law-decision-20150617-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5581e0bf/turbine/la-na-supreme-court-health-law-decision-20150617", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Supreme Court, healthcare, Obama", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83806320", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-17", "Description": "The Supreme Court will decide a seemingly simple question this month in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act: Does the law limit subsidies for low- and moderate-income consumers to insurance purchased through an exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d   The phrase at issue is found in a section...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Supreme Court, healthcare, Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4368\"", "article_summary": "Verrilli argued this text plainly means a federally run marketplace serves as a state marketplace, so all eligible taxpayers may receive subsidies.\nLast year, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals also used this reasoning to support the government in the current legal challenge.\nJustice Antonin Scalia said during the oral argument the court would not \u201ctwist the words as necessary\u201d for the law to make sense.\nThis reasoning is known as \u201cChevron deference,\u201d in reference to a 1984 case in which the court backed federal regulators\u2019 interpretation of the Clean Air Act.\nThe remaining 34 states declined to establish a marketplace, leaving the job to the federal government, an option provided by the law."}
