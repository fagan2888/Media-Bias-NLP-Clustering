But why is she making it? Because, as a political science professor with a focus on race, she\u2019s qualified to interpret these things and just thought you should know? Or is it an obvious, weak attempt to distance the president from Obamacare, which is wreaking havoc on the lives of millions of Americans who are losing their health care?\n\nWhat I found most disturbing and what I wish to focus on is Perry\u2019s evil attempt to gin up hate against \u201cwealthy white men\u201d who she claims created the term Obamacare to demean and undermine a black president.\n\nDue to the Obama administration playing the race card to win every argument and silence opposition, America is polarized along racial lines. Perry\u2019s false accusation is like throwing gasoline on the flames of national racial tensions, as irresponsible and cruel as screaming fire in a crowded auditorium.\n\nPerry\u2019s specific term, \u201cwealthy white men,\u201d was insidiously strategic. Low-info blacks in my family along with blacks across America will believe Perry\u2019s nonsense to be the gospel truth. With the wave of black flashmob violence and the rising incidents of the racially motivated knockout game, the last thing we need as a nation is another black TV celeb promoting a racially-charged false narrative.\n\nDemocrats and liberals like Perry have been promoting the same irresponsible, divisive and racist false narrative for decades. They claim that all evil in the world is the fault of racist, greedy, sexist and evil wealthy white men usually identified as conservative Republicans.\n\nPerry\u2019s rant is simply the latest blow to the chin of America\u2019s white males by a liberal. Flash back to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd\u2019s 2009 article titled, \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Last Stand,\u201d which excoriated white men. And this at the same time as commentators are predicting their disappearance.\n\nObama and company\u2019s reelection strategy was centered around a shock-and-awe media blitz branding the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney as an evil super-wealthy racist white guy.\n\nWe get it. As long as political correctness is the unwritten law of the land, it is open season for trashing and targeting the American rich white male for destruction. It\u2019s even deemed morally correct and patriotic.\n\nWho is out there giving rich white men props for their many positive contributions to society? Where are their advocates? I am sure with me being an American black man, liberals think it unconscionable that I would suggest such a thing. It would elevate me to \u201csuper\u201d Uncle Tom status.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Lloyd Marcus", "description": "No, Obamacare isn't like the n-word.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Sunday, MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry made the accusation that the word Obamacare is similar to using the n-word.
