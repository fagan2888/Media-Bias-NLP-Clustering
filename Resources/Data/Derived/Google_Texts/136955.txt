Reason TV was on the campus of the University of New Hampshire for last night’s Democratic presidential debate. Before and during the televised dust-up between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, we caught up with supporters of both would-be nominees, who held dueling rallies outside the debate hall.

Hillary’s supporters were largely motivated by her professionalism and confirmed status as a woman, but seemed amenable to voting for Bernie if he were the nominee. On the other hand, Bernie backers were moved by the Vermont senator’s self-described revolution, and for the most part, offered only tepid support for a possible Clinton candidacy.

About 2.50 minutes.
