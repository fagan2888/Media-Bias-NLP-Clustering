Bush, Media Criticism, military service, Truth, News\n\nBob Woodward and Carl Bernstein weren\u2019t just journalistic heroes in the normal sense. Their work on Watergate redefined the journalistic world they inhabited, making them more like heroes in the classic mythical sense, as culture-founding figures, whose creation the rest of us merely live inside of. Everyone wanted to be the next Woodward and Bernstein.\n\nThat stature was underscored by the stars who brought them to the screen \u2014 Robert Redford as Woodward, Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Four decades later, Redford has returned, in a sense to close out that era (a la his earlier role in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\u201c). Redford plays Dan Rather in a new film, \u201cTruth,\u201d about the September 8, 2004 \u201c60 Minutes II\u201d report on George W. Bush\u2019s dodgy record in the Texas Air National Guard, which effectively ended Rather\u2019s career at CBS, after he and producer Mary Mapes were unable to prove the authenticity of six memos which played a central role in their report. The connection was duly noted by author and activist Glenn W. Smith at Huffington Post:\n\nBy casting Redford as Rather, the filmmakers hinted at their intentions. Redford, of course, played Bob Woodward in \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the superb 1976 film about Watergate and the Golden Era of Independent Journalism. Now Redford appears as Rather in a film about the death of that Golden Era. The juxtaposition is startling. On one side we have the courageous, muscular leadership of the Washington Post\u2019s editor, Ben Bradlee, during Watergate. On the other there are the media moguls of Viacom and CBS during the Bush/National Guard affair.\n\nAs Smith quickly goes on to point out, Woodward and Bernstein could well have suffered Rather\u2019s fate, because they, too, went too far, on an occasion that figured crucially in the film, as well as in real life. They reported that a federal grand jury had been told that Bob Haldeman controlled Nixon\u2019s campaign slush fund \u2014 which he did, but the grand jury didn\u2019t ask who controlled it. That was just the opening Nixon had been hoping for to derail the Post\u2019s reporting, but Ben Bradlee stuck to his guns. As Smith quotes from \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201c:\n\nBradlee said he had never seen anything like this before. Skeptical but shaken, he said that the problem was no longer just journalistic. He mentioned something about the state and the future of the country.\n\nNaturally, the movie embellished it (See \u201cHollywood Reporter\u201d clip here):\n\nNothing\u2019s riding on this except the, uh, First Amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press and maybe the future of the country. Not that any of that matters, but if you guys f\u2026 up again, I\u2019m going to get mad. Good night.\n\nThe parallel here should be underscored. Rather\u2019s career with CBS was ended because he built his story on apparently fraudulent memos \u2014 their actual status remains undetermined \u2014 from Lt. Colonel. Jerry B. Killian. The most notable one, labeled \u201cCYA\u201d for \u201ccover your ass,\u201d claimed Killian was being pressured from above to give Bush undeserved better marks in his yearly evaluation. However, shortly after the original airing, Killian\u2019s secretary, Marian Carr Knox, placed the memos\u2019 status in an almost exact parallel to Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s false reporting of an underlying true fact. \u201cI didn\u2019t type them,\u201d Knox said in a broadcast interview, \u201cHowever, the information in those is correct.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s point here is simple:\n\nEven if the documents could be criticized (falsely, it turns out), we can draw a close parallel with Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s story on Haldeman: the story about Bush abandoning his service in the Air National Guard was also true.\n\nIndeed, the gaps in Bush\u2019s service record were undeniable. They were reported, but virtually ignored four years earlier, in the 2000 election cycle, when the media was monomaniacally focused on their self-fabricated narrative of Gore being the untrustworthy one who told tall tales about his past.\n\nOn May 23, 2000, Boston Globe reporter Walter V. Robinson reported finding a \u201cone-year gap in Bush\u2019s Guard duty,\u201d saying that \u201c22 months after finishing his training, and with two years left on his six-year commitment, Bush gave up flying \u2014 for good.\u201d Beyond a momentary flurry, there wasn\u2019t much other corporate media interest in that cycle, though Martin Heldt published a detailed analysis of Bush\u2019s guard records at the Online Journal in September 2000. Fast forward to the morning of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report, and Robinson wrote another story \u201cBush fell short on duty at Guard,\u201d with \u201cRecords show pledges unmet,\u201d as the subhead. The framing had shifted from Bush\u2019s attendance gap, to Bush violating his sworn duty \u2014 and getting away with it:\n\nBush fell well short of meeting his military obligation, a Globe reexamination of the records shows: Twice during his Guard service \u2014 first when he joined in May 1968, and again before he transferred out of his unit in mid-1973 to attend Harvard Business School \u2014 Bush signed documents pledging to meet training commitments or face a punitive call-up to active duty. He didn\u2019t meet the commitments, or face the punishment, the records show. The 1973 document has been overlooked in news media accounts. The 1968 document has received scant notice.\n\nThe Globe\u2019s analysis was supported by two other independent analysts. The first, retired Army Colonel Gerald A. Lechliter, wrote a highly detailed 32-page analysis, which the New York Times put on its website, but never seriously built upon in its reporting, or its editorial page. Lechliter was also interviewed by the Globe.\n\nThe second was a civilian analyst, Paul Lukasiak, whose website the AWOL Project, [Sept 2004 web.archive version] had attracted considerable attention online, and was discussed at length by Eric Boehlert here at Salon the day after the 60 Minutes report. Both Lechliter and Lukasiak placed the Bush documents in the framework of contemporary military rules, regulations, policies and procedures, which were absolutely crucial for understanding what was really going on, and not being easily spun by Bush apologists. All three of these analyses reached similar conclusions, without any reliance on the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d memos. I summarized the broad outlines of these misadventures in a story three weeks later:\n\nBush\u2019s problems began in late Spring on 1972, when he first tried to transfer to a non-flying unit \u2014 a back door way of breaking his signed service agreement approved by his Texas superiors, but rejected at the federal level. He then failed to take a mandatory flight physical and was suspended from flying, stopped attending drills for at least six months, and was not observed by his superior officers for a full year. (He never took another physical again, and was, apparently, never disciplined for it.) A hurried spate of training unlawfully packed into a brief two-month period was then followed by his discharge from the Texas Air National Guard (TXANG), but he never fulfilled his obligation to finish his service at a unit in Massachusetts when he returned to New England to get an MBA at Harvard Business School.\n\nIn the context of this larger story, the memos were clearly important for \u201c60 Minutes\u201d as a scoop, but they were hardly essential for disproving Bush\u2019s claims that he had met his military obligations, or that his honorable discharge closed the book on the story.. The documentary record alone already disproved these claims conclusively. As the Globe reported:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The CBS report at the heart of a new film might been false.
