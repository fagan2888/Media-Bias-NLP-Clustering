Most people probably assume that when they aren't competing, Olympians spend the rest of their waking time practicing, working out and consuming protein shakes.

But it turns out the members of Team USA have hobbies like any other red-blooded American—assuming that red-blooded American is incredibly sporty. The Journal combed through the online profiles of 170 U.S. Olympians and compiled the most commonly listed hobbies. Most of the results were what you would expect of an athlete, with activities such as biking, hiking and soccer recording high levels of popularity. Of the 10 most common hobbies, only reading, fishing and golfing can be described as leisurely activity.

On the more extreme side, skier Erik Fisher cliff jumps, and snowboarder Nick Baumgartner participates in demolition derbies—presumably because the Olympics are just not dangerous enough.

There are also a few oddballs. Curler Debbie McCormick likes to watch "The Price Is Right" in her down time. Snowboarder Karly Shorr plays the ukulele, and figure skater Ashley Wagner plays laser tag. Snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington? Her main interest off the mountain is collecting fridge magnets.
