Now The Enclave at McKay Shores has less than a third of its 110 sites left \u2013 now opening a final 40 lots, but with five already spoken for.\n\nPrices on those vanishing opportunities start at just over $500,000. \u201cThis is a chance to have new home features with Toll Brothers\u2019 elegance and quality, and a Broomfield city-and-county address,\u201d says Heather Gray \u2013 veteran sales rep with over ten years\u2019 experience on Toll Brothers\u2019 luxurious designs.\n\n\u201cThese buyers are people who have either lived in Broomfield for years, or come from Westminster, Thornton and Brighton,\u201d Gray adds, showing off her 3-bedroom-plus-study \u2018Bellvue\u2019 model, off W. 136th between Zuni and Huron. \u201cThey\u2019re all focused on the city of Broomfield and very much want to be inside it.\u201d\n\nTurning up the heat on that buyer is the dearth of new homes available inside Broomfield \u2013 particularly for this location with its easy access to new grocery shopping, dining, and schools like Legacy High, rated 8-for-10 stars at GreatSchools.org; and either Meridian or Coyote Ridge Elementary, each 9-for-10 stars.\n\n\u201cGetting to buy new in Broomfield is a huge motivator,\u201d Gray adds. \u201cResale homes typically need lots of work, and when you figure in how well our homes comp out against older homes of this large size, people tell us that going with Toll Brothers was their only choice.\u201d\n\nBut in today\u2019s low-inventory market between Denver and Boulder, making that leap takes some planning, Gray says. \u201cIf you want to be part of this new release of sites in The Enclave at McKay Shores, you need to be looking at our site map and talking with us now.\u201d\n\nGray does have one home that can deliver right away; the only for-sale home close to completion now. It\u2019s a 3-bedroom ranch, 2,155 square feet, with a gourmet kitchen, on an oversized site, at $511,995. \u201cIf we were starting it now with the full landscape and all of the upgrades we\u2019ve included, it would be in the $560s, so this is an exceptional opportunity,\u201d she adds. Toll Brothers also offers numbers of main-floor master suite designs that she says are popular with families with teens and \u2018tweens.\n\nThree-car garages are an option \u2013 and Gray has four new sites that\u2019ll take a daylight walkout basement with deck. You\u2019ll see Toll Brothers\u2019 standard features \u2014 fireplace, granite tops in both kitchen and master bath, crown-molding, choices of hardwood cabinets \u2013 along with good commuter access to Interlocken or downtown, and close shopping at King Soopers and dining at Orchard Town Center.\n\nYou can also tour Toll Brothers\u2019 homes on larger sites at The Preserve at McKay Shores from the $600s. Both neighborhoods have access into open space around McKay Lake and a community pool. To reach either, take W. 136th west from I-25, past Huron to Quivas and turn north just before a roundabout.\n\nThe Enclave at McKay Shores, Toll Brothers\u2019 fast-selling luxury homes near McKay Lake, single-family homes with trails; wide-open family/entertaining areas, 3-car garage option, ranch and main-floor master suite plans, Adams 5-Star Schools. 13628 Pecos Loop, Broomfield; from I-25 take 136th Ave. west 1 mi., past Huron, to Quivas St., then north just before the roundabout.\n\nFrom $501,995\n\nToday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\n303-452-5173\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him atmark@samuelsonassoc.com.
