Maybe this time, she wishes, other drivers won\u2019t stare or snap pictures.\n\nMaybe today someone won\u2019t ask her whether she\u2019s wearing a mask or say they love her stage makeup. Maybe today she\u2019ll be able to wave to a child without him crying.\n\nOr maybe she won\u2019t go outside today.\n\nOutside, she shoves in earbuds and ducks her head. At home, like the Phantom inside his opera house, she doesn\u2019t get those glances or feel that hurt.\n\nA vicious attack during a robbery in 2006 left Somerset\u2019s nose with sinking pits where cartilage had disintegrated. Surgeries and a lingering infection further flattened her nose.\n\nInstead of a full nose, a flat, gray, scarred nub blemished the middle of the 44-year-old Jacksonville woman\u2019s face.\n\nShe\u2019s had about six surgeries in the last year to re-create her lost cartilage.\n\nUnlike the plastic surgeries seen in movies or reality TV shows, the ones where surgeons try to create awe-inspiring noses, Somerset just wants a nose that won\u2019t be a magnet for stares.\n\n\u201cThat would be lovely \u2014 to look myself in the mirror and see myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen myself in seven years.\u201d\n\nEverything about Somerset\u2019s life changed in the years after her attack.\n\nShe lost one career but found another. She lost a marriage but found another relationship.\n\nDespite financial difficulties and painful surgical reconstructions, she senses her struggles are only a season of her life, and spring is just around the corner.\n\n\u2018A REALLY GOOD FEELING THIS TIME\u2019\n\nSomerset adjusts her makeup case to make more room in her hospital bag. Milk thistle vitamins, check. Listerine mouthwash, check. Antidepressants, check.\n\nDays away from her May 14 surgery, she\u2019d soon leave the operating room with a bulging spot between her eyes. It wouldn\u2019t be a finished nose, but it would have potential \u2014 like the foundation of a house.\n\n\u201cI have a really good feeling this time. I\u2019m not scared at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI can start over and have a life again.\u201d\n\nHer May surgery at UF Health in Gainesville removed cartilage from her ribs to create a new bridge to the existing nub of her nose. Another surgery in July will work on the bridge, and later treatments will remove the fuzzy black hair on the tip of her nose from skin grafts.\n\nEven in hospitals, people glance and wonder: What happened to her?\n\nSomerset\u2019s nose collapsed after it was broken three times within three weeks during the winter of 2006.\n\nThe first two times were accidents \u2014 a tub of cherry blossom lotion falling from a closet, her husband\u2019s elbow flailing in his sleep.\n\nAn armed robber soccer-kicked her nose for the third and final break.\n\nIt was 9:30 on a December night. Somerset loaded ham, turkey and mashed potatoes for Christmas dinner into her car at the Publix at 2033 Riverside Ave., her car parked in a bustling shopping plaza bordering $1,200-a-month apartments and shops selling $4 lattes.\n\nA man strolled up to her car and calmly said he needed to take her Marilyn Monroe vintage purse.\n\nWhat? She laughed. A joke, she thought. This guy is weird. You\u2019re taking what?\n\nShe didn\u2019t see the gun in his hand, didn\u2019t see he was serious.\n\nHis arm then was through her purse strap but she was grabbing the strap and pulling and she was begging to keep her shop keys and please just give me my keys and he was slamming her to the pavement.\n\nShe remembers moments in glimpses. Her grip tight on the purse. Sharp pain in her face, the gun-on-bone pain of pistol whipping.\n\nA kick to the stomach. A kick to the face. The sound of running steps.\n\nHe never fired the gun he held, but her assailant did more damage than she realized.\n\nSomerset went home instead of to the hospital \u2014 she\u2019d canceled her health insurance weeks before to cut the overhead of her struggling vintage clothing business.\n\nThe next morning, she saw blood. It wasn\u2019t from her nose.\n\nSomerset doesn\u2019t mention it when most people ask about her attack, but the fact of the matter is she was seven weeks pregnant.\n\nShe said the gore and pain and physical loss that followed pales in comparison to what she endured the moment she realized she miscarried.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had a few miscarriages, so I knew what they looked like,\u201d Somerset said. \u201cI\u2019d wanted a child for nine years. I still think about it every day, but it\u2019s not all day, every day.\u201d\n\nSoon after, she blew her puffy nose, and a gruesome cocktail of blood, cartilage and bone fragments came out and landed in her bathroom sink.\n\nShe grabbed ice packs and sat in her room. For weeks, she was dazed and depressed. She\u2019s not sure why she didn\u2019t go to a doctor then, except that she was too focused on her growing isolation to remember to get help for her nose.\n\nThe cartilage supporting the majority of her nose was gone, degraded by the repeated blows. It would keep collapsing, and the only way to have a nose again was to get reconstructive surgery.\n\nIn 2007, a friend recommended a plastic surgeon. He didn\u2019t work out, but it started a process of several years to find a doctor to take her case.\n\nWhen Somerset began her reconstructions in fall of 2013, her plastic surgeon initially took a piece of bone from her hip to create a new bridge, but that became incurably infected just after New Years.\n\nSomerset decided to start reconstruction again from scratch, beginning with a surgery May 14.\n\nShe wrings her hands together, like she\u2019s trying to massage a stubborn knot, as she relives the last eight years.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t like talking about the attack. It happened, yes. But she doesn\u2019t want to waste emotion on remembering, on worrying about anything except what time to get to the hospital, what preoperative preparations to finish and what bills will be waiting when she comes home.\n\nTalking about her attack could remind people to be aware of their safety, she said, so it\u2019s worth it.\n\nThe infection that stole her last bone graft also stole her appetite for many months. It\u2019s tough to eat when you\u2019re smelling decay every minute, she said.\n\nHer weight once bordered on 130 pounds. Now at 112 pounds, her legs jut out of her flowing, knee-length skirt like a stick figure drawing.\n\nCurly hair frames her face. Golden locks, accented with a few whispers of gray, stream past her shoulders. When she smiles, her body relaxes a bit.\n\nSomerset crosses her bony legs and grasps her bony knee with her bony hands. She leans forward and turns her right arm, showing the tattoo on her forearm: a skull with a pink bow.\n\nThat\u2019s how she felt for the past few years, she said, like an empty skeleton. After her nose is rebuilt, she plans to get a new tattoo of a butterfly coming out of a cocoon. But not until her transformation is complete.\n\nHer battle to feel normal is far from over. These surgeries will be her turning point, she said.\n\nThey have to be.\n\nCENTER OF ATTENTION\n\nIf first impressions are the opening act of any relationship, then the nose is the main character.\n\nSmack dab in the center of one\u2019s face, there\u2019s no getting around it. The nose is vastly practical \u2014 for breathing, smelling and catching dust that would woosh into the lungs \u2014 but that\u2019s not entirely why people value it.\n\nCouples rub noses between kisses. Fathers pretend to steal children\u2019s noses. New mothers look at their babies and cry, \u201cShe has her daddy\u2019s nose.\u201d\n\nNervous interviewers even focus on the nose when looking someone in the eyes is too intimidating.\n\nIt\u2019s the safe zone between the examining eyes and the critical mouth.\n\nUF Health plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Leyngold, Somerset\u2019s doctor, said he\u2019s seen patients come in for nose jobs who have chunks of their noses missing from cancer removal or whose noses have been crushed by a car accident.\n\nMore simply believe their nose is too big, too small, too left, too wide, too imperfect to live with anymore.\n\nThey\u2019re hardly in the minority. A March report by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery showed nose jobs were the fifth most popular plastic surgery procedure nationwide in 2013, with about 147,000 performed. Liposuction was first.\n\nThe idea that a perfect nose begets a perfect life is plastered across American pop culture.\n\nModels pose for cover shoots with their new noses, and shows like \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d put the procedure on the home screen. Even in traditional tales, witches have crooked noses, misers have big schnozzes and princesses have slender, button-like noses.\n\nFrom \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star Vienna Girardi gushing to US Weekly about her \u201cMr. Potato Head nose\u201d to a 13-year-old girl telling ABC News how she got a nose job to stop her peers from bullying her, the little handful of skin, cartilage and bone in the middle of the face can cause so much heartache.\n\nSome Leyngold sees are purely functional and helped the patient breathe easier, but some nasal surgeries are to fix physical deformities that can have as much, or more, of an impact on a person\u2019s life, he said.\n\n\u201cThe majority of cosmetic patients are people who are self-conscious about a deformity they have that may cause them a problem at work or a problem at home that keeps them from living a full, normal life,\u201d Leyngold said.\n\nAcross the Internet, people plead with strangers for donations for nasal reconstruction. There\u2019s the father whose nose was all but reduced to a hole and a scar due to cancer and is saving money for a prosthetic implant. There\u2019s a toddler whose nose is consumed by a golfball-size lesion and needs surgery to grow up without it being constantly puffy and red. There\u2019s the teen who is tired of being called \u201cbig nose\u201d but can\u2019t afford a nose job.\n\nSomerset told Leyngold she \u201cfelt like an outcast.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me anytime she would be out, folks would point fingers at her and make fun of her,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anybody would be devastated if that happened to them all the time.\u201d\n\nA NEW FRIEND\n\nSomerset thought no one else knew how she felt. Then, she met a short, plump man with a disarming smile.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t drive himself to doctor\u2019s appointments or speak without mumbling, but when Scotty Gaston looked at Somerset\u2019s face, he just smiled.\n\nSomerset and Gaston, a 49-year-old man with Down syndrome, became fast friends when she took him on as a client two years ago. She became a special needs care provider and life coach in 2010, now an independent contractor for Jacksonville-based Jmax Support Services, after her small business crumbled in the recession.\n\nOne spring afternoon, Gaston looked for the perfect green marker to form the letters \u201cOZ,\u201d one that was bright but not too neon. He settled on a shamrock green.\n\nOnce he was satisfied, he handed the picture to Somerset, pointing to the spots he wants her to trim off with safety scissors. She smiled and obliged, gingerly holding the printer paper as if it were a precious Rembrandt.\n\n\u201cBe careful using scissors, all right?\u201d she reminded Gaston.\n\nBeing a caregiver is a far cry from her first career as a small-business owner. Instead of managing inventory and stocking shelves, she tracks Gaston\u2019s diet and chaperones him on outings.\n\nRather than hunt down the most exclusive vintage shoes or handbags, she searches for lost markers between couch cushions. She\u2019s not a business partner anymore, but she is a video game partner. She\u2019s Gaston\u2019s careful shaver, caring ear and companion.\n\n\u201cShe takes me out on dates and takes me to IHOP,\u201d Gaston said.\n\nSomerset got her start in the vintage clothing industry as an apprentice at a downtown Jacksonville store in her late 20s. After five years, she\u2019d saved enough money and worked up the contacts to start her own store.\n\nShe opened Time Warp Vintage Clothing on Park Street in 2000, stocking the shelves with bell bottoms and 1950s prom dresses.\n\nFor a girl who\u2019d collected decoupage box purses since she was 10, it was a dream career.\n\nShe and her husband held on to the business through the start of the recession, but competition ran them out in 2008.\n\nIn the vintage world, October is the big month for sales because shoppers pour in looking for the most realistic Halloween costumes. When big-box Halloween stores came into town \u2014 with $20 ready-to-wear costumes \u2014 Somerset couldn\u2019t compete.\n\n\u201cIt was the biggest, best dream I could\u2019ve asked for. It was my whole world,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter living that dream for eight years, Somerset found herself back on the job market. Getting a job wasn\u2019t easy with her ever-deteriorating nose.\n\nWaitressing and bartending jobs didn\u2019t call. Clothing boutiques didn\u2019t respond.\n\nThey never said why, but she saw it in their eyes. If managers hired her and put her in a storefront, she might scare away customers.\n\n\u201cBartenders and servers, you have to be cute,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to be cute.\u201d\n\nShe searched for about two years before finding an opening as a special needs at-home coach. She took on several clients, visiting them to help them work on skills like hygiene and completing chores.\n\nShe was worried her face would frighten them, like kids in \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d hiding from Quasimodo.\n\n\u201cI want you to be prepared,\u201d she told Gaston\u2019s family. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t bother us, and it never has,\u201d said Gaston\u2019s mom, Doris Bramlett.\n\nWhen Gaston talks with Somerset, he looks her in the face and smiles. He gives her a three-second kiss on the cheek when she walks through the door. When she leaves, he walks her to her car and watches while she puts on her seatbelt, just to be sure.\n\nHe knows what it\u2019s like to be shoved aside because you don\u2019t fit others\u2019 definition of \u201cnormal.\u201d Gaston\u2019s extra chromosome makes his body a bit stouter, his forehead a bit wider and his mind slower to process ideas but quicker to feel joy and love.\n\nHe knows what it feels like to be told he\u2019s worthless because of a characteristic he has no control over.\n\n\u201cThey see me for who I am,\u201d Somerset said of her clients.\n\nSometimes, she thinks about her store. She remembers the sense of purpose she felt when she worked there. Now, she has a new calling.\n\n\u201cLosing my dream was the worst thing that could\u2019ve happened to me. And the best thing,\u201d Somerset said. \u201cBecause I have been truly humbled. If that would\u2019ve never happened, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to meet my special adult clients who have brightened my heart.\u201d\n\nNO INSURANCE, NO BENEFITS\n\nSomerset\u2019s July surgery is being scheduled. She\u2019s working on the itinerary and knows the pre- and post-operation routine.\n\nThe problem now will come during the months after she drives back to her Westside home. Somerset had a donation fund set up for her about six months ago. A friend held a benefit in her honor in February and raised enough money to get her through her surgeries.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what she thought.\n\nThe $4,000 of donations covered her cost of living during the first half-dozen surgeries, but now that Somerset has to start her reconstruction over, she\u2019s back at the starting block but out of money.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have health insurance. Since she\u2019s an independent contractor with her company, she doesn\u2019t get health benefits. She tried signing up for Affordable Care Act insurance, but she hasn\u2019t completed the process yet. Her surgeries are covered through financial aid by UF Health, but it does not cover medicines, primary care physician or other living costs.\n\nSomerset started a GoFundMe.com account, hoping to get money to pay for her new nose. She worked full time before she began reconstruction in 2013, but once those began she cut down to 10 hours a week at $10 an hour.\n\n\u201cI literally have $10 to my name. What little I have is going in my tank,\u201d she said. \u201cI scraped change out of the car today to get myself some coffee.\u201d\n\nAfter her May surgery, her doctor told her, she won\u2019t be able to work for a year. She stretched past donations as far as possible, but they dried up the second week of May.\n\nHer new donation site on GoFundMe.com has raised about $400 as of mid-May, enough to pay for a tank of gas, some medicine and one doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\n\u201cI have to depend on other people\u2019s kindness, and it\u2019s so daunting,\u201d Somerset said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have anything coming, it\u2019s daunting.\u201d\n\nWHAT WAS REALLY LOST\n\nThe police report from the day Somerset was attacked states the only items of value taken were her purse and her checkbook.\n\nThe assailant in that grocery store parking lot stole much more. As bad as her nose is, her miscarriage burns in her mind.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know what holding onto her purse would cost her. It wasn\u2019t her keys she wanted \u2014 not at all.\n\nShe\u2019d grasped for a tiny shamrock key chain, her favorite treasure her dad gave her before he died.\n\nHe picked it up decades ago, coming home from serving in the National Guard during the Vietnam War. A shamrock seemed fitting \u2014 a little memento to remember how lucky he was to be coming home alive.\n\nSomerset carried it on her key ring for almost a decade. She carried it when she went to her father\u2019s funeral in the late 1990s. She carried it when she opened the doors to Time Warp. She carried it when her marriage of 20 years fell into a passionless routine \u2014 like roommates, not lovers, she said.\n\nSomerset got herself a new key ring. She had that one with her when she met another man two years ago, her now-boyfriend.\n\nHe talks her through stress, walks with her through stores to deflect stares and worries about her while she\u2019s in surgery.\n\nHe tells her she\u2019s beautiful, just the way she is.\n\nTo donate, go to Wendy Somerset\u2019s donation page, or visit her website.\n\nMeredith Rutland: (904) 359-4161", "article_metadata": {"description": "Red lights make Wendy Somerset\u2019s stomach turn.
