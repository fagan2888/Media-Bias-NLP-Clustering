UNC Hospitals was scored at 7.375; WakeMed received a score of 8.025.\n\nAll scores above 7 fall below the 25th percentile.\n\n\u201cMedicare is comparing all hospitals across the country, but it isn\u2019t making any adjustments or consideration for how sick the patients are to begin with. So if one hospital takes more sicker patients than another, it\u2019s reasonable to think that there may be, in the aggregate, more infections. But that may not have anything to do with the quality of care that\u2019s provided in the hospital.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Brian Goldstein, executive vice president and chief operating officer at UNC Hospitals on why its 801-bed facility ranks higher than most in hospital-acquired conditions.\n\nGoldstein says the scores are self-reported and submitted to Medicare by UNC Hospitals, and rankings are calculated solely through assessments of Medicare billing, and monitoring hospitals for infections.\n\nHospitals were notified of their scores in April, allowing for administration to review their rankings before the final scores and penalties are released in the fall and administered in the 2015 fiscal year.\n\nThe scoring system has no minimum passing grade, leaving hospitals that do not receive a performance requirement score less than 7 with definite penalizations, and a 1 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements.\n\nThe program does not recognize any patient care documentation or factors outside of their final tally of infections, such as how sick the patients are upon admittance, or the socioeconomic backgrounds of hospital patients.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five percent of hospitals are going to get penalized through this program, no matter how much they improve,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThe actual scoring is based on how the hospital compares to itself from a baseline period of 2006 or 2007. That\u2019s how Medicare chose to score this so, let\u2019s say, you\u2019re a hospital that wasn\u2019t doing so well in 2006 and 2007, but now you\u2019re doing better. You\u2019re going to get a better score. Now, let\u2019s say you were already doing well (at that time) and you didn\u2019t improve as much and your infection rates might even be lower than the other hospital but you\u2019re still going to get a worse score in this program.\u201d\n\nGoldstein compares this system to a teacher \u201cgrading on a curve\u201d, and announcing on the first day of school that 25 percent of students will automatically fail, no matter how well they do throughout the course \u2013 just because that is class policy.\n\nThe penalties provided by the Affordable Care Act have been a controversial hot topic in the hospital industry, as many of the largest and more research-based hospitals treat the sickest patients, putting them at a higher risk of infections and other common complications.\n\nGoldstein told WCHL the Association of American Medical Colleges recently wrote to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to alter their scoring system for a more holistic reflection of the quality of a hospital\u2019s care.\n\nWith final scores soon to be released, Goldstein says he believes it\u2019s important for the Medicare system to be reformed, but also for hospitals across the nation to keep their focus on the health and safety of their patients.\n\n\u201cWe could go a lot deeper and wider in discussing all of the efforts we make everyday to aggressively find and fix problems that could lead to safety issues and quality. That all needs to continue, but all we\u2019re asking for is for these programs that tie back to dollars to be based on a fair assessment of the data that all hospitals provide.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated", "article_metadata": {"description": "UNC Hospitals may have to pay millions in Medicare penalties for a high number of patient infections and complications, according to a provision of the new health care law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Chapelboro.com", "description": "UNC Hospitals may have to pay millions in Medicare penalties for a high number of patient infections and complications, according to a provision of the new health care law.", "title": "UNC Hospitals Face Medicare Penalties", "url": "http://chapelboro.com/news/health/unc-hospitals-face-medicare-penalties", "image": {"width": 1685, "identifier": "http://chapelboro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image.jpg", "height": 1123}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UNC Hospitals may have to pay millions in Medicare penalties for a high number of patient infections and complications, according to a provision of the new health care law.", "title": "UNC Hospitals Face Medicare Penalties", "image": "http://chapelboro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image.jpg?w=640", "creator": "@WCHLChapelboro", "site": "@WCHLChapelboro", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 164694420385656}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-22T20:09:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-24T10:46:54+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1cc9\"", "article_summary": "UNC Hospitals Face Medicare PenaltiesUNC Hospitals may have to pay millions in Medicare penalties for a high number of patient infections and complications, according to a provision of the new health care law.\nPreliminary scores show 16 N.C. hospitals are currently at risk of penalties, including two of the largest in the Triangle: UNC Hospitals and WakeMed in Raleigh.\nGoldstein says the scores are self-reported and submitted to Medicare by UNC Hospitals, and rankings are calculated solely through assessments of Medicare billing, and monitoring hospitals for infections.\nMedicare authorities score on a ten-point scale, with the worst of the infections and health complications of hospitals ranking higher.\nUNC Hospitals was scored at 7.375; WakeMed received a score of 8.025."}
