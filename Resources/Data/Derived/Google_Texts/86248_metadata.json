Bowen Loftin to ask why the university\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t constitute \u201ca breach of contract since [the students\u2019] offer letters stated fully funded health insurance.\u201d\n\nChancellor Loftin did not appear to respond to Bolton\u2019s question.\n\nMike Horton, a PhD. student in contemporary American fiction, tweeted that \u201cThe obvious response is for [Missouri] grad students to unionize.\u201d\n\nEven politicians got in on the action.Missouri State Representative Kip Kendrick (D-45) tweeted that he is \u201c[t]rying to get answers and figure out what the heck is going on.\u201d Rep. Kendrick later tweeted that many of his \u201cfriends [and] constituents are affected\u201d by the university\u2019s decision.\n\nClayton Coffman, a PhD. student in the Plant, Insect, and Microbial Science program, told Campus Reform that [m]any students, and their families, depend on the health insurance MU was subsidizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the graduate students I know were promised health coverage when they were given their offers to attend here,\u201d Coffman continued.\n\nMoreover, Coffman said, this is just the latest roadblock the university has placed in the way of graduate students.\n\n\u201cRecently MU dissolved the graduate school, replacing it with an administrative unit not able to represent graduate student needs.\u201d Earlier in the school year, Coffman said, the university pulled tuition waivers from \u201cmany graduate students who don't have \u2018full-time\u2019 appointments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're systematically making it more and more difficult to go to graduate school here, even though graduate students perform the vast majority of the research which comes out of this campus.\u201d\n\nCoffman aired his frustration on Twitter, tweeting a warning to incoming graduate students.\n\n.@bowtieger Welcome to MU new grad students! Remember that health insurance we promised you?
