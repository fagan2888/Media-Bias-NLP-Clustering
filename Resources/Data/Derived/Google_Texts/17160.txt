Worthing, SD

A Poker Run for the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society is getting help from a national performer.

Paws for a Cause finishes at Otis Bar in Worthing. A concert starts at seven at the bar, and the entertainment is Scott Helmer. In 2008, he lost all his money after the market crashed. He decided to focus his energy to performing concerts benefiting non-profit organizations.

"As soon as I put the word out about the tour with the goal to raise one million for Wounded Warriors, I got contacted by all sorts of different charities all across America. Historic theaters as well because they're non-profits and they need to fundraise. They said, 'Hey when you're done with this tour will you help us out or will you mix us in the tour,' and I say you know what, let's make it for charities all over America," Helmer said.

His current tour has raised more than $326,000. It wraps up in December. His next goal is to break the world record for live concerts in different cities over 24 hours.
