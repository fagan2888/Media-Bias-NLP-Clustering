As a result, even though he\u2019s probably as, or more, important to contemporary pop than the Fab Four, his music is nowhere near as covered. Still, you don\u2019t get that famous without prompting tributes. Here are some of the best and/or entertaining and/or bizarre of them.\n\nCleopatra, \u201cI Want You Back\u201d\n\nThis 1969 number by the Motown hit factory was the Jackson 5\u2019s first major hit, and it is much beloved and covered. I like the way KT Tunstall reimagines the song as percussive acoustic indie folk pop, but her earnest vocals are maybe a little hard to take. So I\u2019ve opted for girl group Cleopatra\u2019s hip hop girl group version. The young MJ is inimitable, but Cleo Higgins does about as well as anyone could in channeling his particular brand of dynamite when she sends those \u201cooo \u2014oooh!\u201ds up toward the stratosphere.\n\nGloria Gaynor, \u201cNever Can Say Goodbye\u201d\n\nThis massively successful early Jackson 5 hit from 1971 became an almost-as-massively-successful disco crossover smash when Gaynor recorded it three years later. The video above has some truly stupendous sparkly seventies Vegas-by-way-of-Planet-Cleavage attire, though the song is cut off, alas. You can hear the full version here.\n\nMarvin Gaye, \u201cI Wanna Be Where You Are\u201d\n\nOne of Jackson\u2019s early solo hits, the song was penned by Arthur Ross (Diana\u2019s brother) and Leon Ware. Gaye covered it on the Ware-produced 1976 album \u201cI Want You,\u201d and it\u2019s one of the few cover versions that legitimately seems to surpass the original. The sophisticated, layered backing and Gaye\u2019s slippery vocals have a sensual adult suggestiveness that Jackson wasn\u2019t quite up to at that point in his career, if ever. No matter; he had other strengths.\n\nMobb Deep, \u201cApostle\u2019s Warning\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019d imagine, hip hop loves Michael Jackson. XXL has an amazing list of 55 Jackson samples, which you can fall into for the rest of the weekend if you\u2019re so inclined. This track by Mobb Deep lifts Jackson\u2019s cover of the Stylistics\u2019 1972 hit, turning the original\u2019s ambivalent que sera sera world-weariness into a distorted, bleakly ominous groove.\n\nJuan Luis Guerra, \u201cDame\u201d\n\nThe insinuatingly irresisitible shimmy of \u201cDon\u2019t Stop \u2018Til You Get Enough\u201d is translated into the frantically irresistible shimmy of merengue. It works surprisingly well, from the imitation (in Spanish) of MJ\u2019s breathy intro to the unexpected fleet-fingered classic rock guitar solo.\n\nDe La Soul, \u201cBreakadawn\u201d\n\nDe La takes MJ\u2019s pop and blows it up. The intro of the mellow \u201cI Can\u2019t Help It\u201d turns into a smooth soul bubble on loop. \u201cI am the man-ner of the family cuz the pants fit\u201d is a nod to those funky forefathers and perhaps a promise to be weird enough not to follow Jackson or Stevie Wonder (who wrote the song) up the charts.\n\nQuincy Jones, Brandy, Heavy D & the Boyz, \u201cRock With You\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s collaborator Quincy Jones redid this track from \u201cOff the Wall\u201d in 1995. It\u2019s a nice synopsis of MJ\u2019s influence, with Brandy\u2019s smooth vocals showing \u201990s R&B\u2019s debt to the master and Heavy D rapping over a beat that seems to have been devised in anticipation that someone like Heavy D would do just that.\n\nRihanna, \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Stop the Music\u201d\n\nOf all the divas of the early 2000s, Rihanna was not necessarily the one I would have picked for superstardom. Still, you\u2019ve got to admire the canniness; if you want a hit, you can\u2019t do better than rejiggering \u201cYou Wanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019.\u201d Rihanna\u2019s StarGate-produced version rubs off some of those jagged, tightly wound James Brown edges, and her vocals have none of Jackson\u2019s mercurial dexterity \u2014 but even a somewhat bowdlerized MJ is still going to tear up the radio.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From soul royalty to pop divas and indie rockers, everyone loves the King of Pop.
