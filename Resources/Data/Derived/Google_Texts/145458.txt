With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, Tri-State charities and civic organizations lent a helping hand to families in need Saturday.

The Prince Hall Masons built on its tradition of service Saturday in Bond Hill.

Laverne Gates was in attendance Saturday and said the event really helped her and her daughter in a time of need.

“They're really helping me and my daughter out this year,” Gates said. “I'm a single parent and I appreciate having a Thanksgiving meal this year.”

The Prince Hall Masons prepared boxes full of the necessities for a Thanksgiving meal.

“There are folks who used to be here giving who this year may need to receive. We want to fill that gap,” Prince Hall Mason Frank Bowen Jr. said.

The Masons were joined by community partners in an event that has grown over its 13 years in operation.

“By providing meals for families definitely fits into our mission of taking care of our community,” Conference of Minority Transportation Officials representative Shawntay Rucker said.

“We know there are a lot of needy families this time of year who are struggling so we reach back and say, ‘Here let us make your holidays a little bit better.’ That's really what it’s about, serving leadership,” Frisch's Restaurants representative Lamonte Taylor said.

Organizers said the food drive has grown from a single donor collecting can goods in his basement to now including many community partners from Aldi’s to Frisch’s and hundreds of volunteers.
