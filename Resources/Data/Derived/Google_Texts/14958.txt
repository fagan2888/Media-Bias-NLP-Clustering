A one-vehicle accident has left a Baker man with serious injuries.

Florida Highway Patrol officials say 29-year-old Joseph Hardwick was driving south on State Road 189 near Samford Road around 1 a.m. Saturday morning when he ran off the road onto the west shoulder.

He struck a mailbox, then a water pipe and a tree before the vehicle overturned onto the left side.

Hardwick was trapped inside the vehicle and is in serious condition at Sacred Heart Hospital.

FHP officials say the accident was alcohol related.
