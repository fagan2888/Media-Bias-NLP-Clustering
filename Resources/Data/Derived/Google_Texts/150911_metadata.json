Instead, it charged her $550 in self-pay rates.\n\nAnderson assumed if she filed an insurance claim it would be even less. Instead, she now owed the hospital more than twice as much. She was charged more because she had insurance.\n\n\u201cWhat am I paying premiums for? I don't feel like I'm being protected,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nHer policy is with Health First Health Plans. The new bill was $1,150 because the hospital was out of network.\n\n\u201cI could have negotiated better rates for myself for free,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nAnderson filed two appeals with Health First, arguing she should not be penalized for having insurance. Both appeals were denied.\n\nThen, the ER doctor billed Anderson another $1,000. He was also out of network for her plan. His in-network rate was $138.\n\n\"Even if you supposedly have a good plan, it doesn't mean anything,\" said Anderson.\n\nConsumer groups said many out-of-network rates are inflated way beyond cost so people with insurance pay more for treatment on top of higher premiums.\n\n\u201cObviously in that type of situation the consumer may have zero ability to call around and find in-network providers and save money,\u201d said Chuck Bell with Consumers Union.\n\nHealth First Health Plans told Action9 many high deductible plans were designed for the Affordable Care Act and are better for catastrophic or significant needs. But it's investigating why Anderson would be charged more than someone without any insurance.\n\n\u201cThat night I was much better off without insurance,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nOnce she filed the insurance claim, the hospital would not allow Anderson to pay the far cheaper, self-pay rates.\n\nOut-of-network surprise bills are common with most insurance plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Melbourne mother can't believe the bill she got after rushing her daughter to the emergency room, saying she was billed twice as much because she had insurance.", "author": "EndPlay", "og": {"site_name": "WFTV", "description": "A Melbourne mother can't believe the bill she got after rushing her daughter to the emergency room, saying she was billed twice as much because she had insurance.", "title": "Action 9 investigates how having health insurance can cost you...", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/action-9-investigates-how-having-health-insurance-/107192771", "image": {"width": 160, "altText": "Action 9 _1498587", "title": "Action 9 _1498587", "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2015/06/22/Action9_427374_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "height": 90}, "locale": "en_US", "video": {"height": 0, "width": 0, "thumbnailUrl": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2016/02/21/Action%209%20investigates%20how%20having%20health%20insurance%20can%20cost_8472442_1456061084399_2152072_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "content-type": "video", "title": "Action 9 investigates how having health insurance can cost you more at the ER"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Melbourne mother can't believe the bill she got after rushing her daughter to the emergency room, saying she was billed twice as much because she had insurance.", "title": "Action 9 investigates how having health insurance can cost you...", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/action-9-investigates-how-having-health-insurance-/107192771", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2015/06/22/Action9_427374_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@WFTV", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Action9,Action 9, StoryKeywords", "article": {"section": "Local", "tag": "action9, action 9", "published_time": "2014-09-29T19:32:58+0000", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T19:32:58+0000"}, "news_keywords": "Action 9 investigates how having health insurance can cost you more at the ER", "content_id": 107192771, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "Her policy is with Health First Health Plans.\nAnderson filed two appeals with Health First, arguing she should not be penalized for having insurance.\nHealth First Health Plans told Action9 many high deductible plans were designed for the Affordable Care Act and are better for catastrophic or significant needs.\nOut-of-network surprise bills are common with most insurance plans.\nOnce she filed the insurance claim, the hospital would not allow Anderson to pay the far cheaper, self-pay rates."}
