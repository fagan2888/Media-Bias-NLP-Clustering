Fox News’ resident “doctor” Keith Ablow blames co-ed sports and the gender equality movement for perpetuating a culture that tells people like Florida State University quarterback De’Andre Johnson that it’s okay to hit women.

Just this week, a bar surveillance video surfaced showing the quarterback punching a female student in the face after she “provoked” him.

The Fox News “A-Team” member said that the surveillance video made a compelling case for how men not hitting women is an “antiquated notion” today.

Doubling down on the issue of co-ed sports, Ablow said he wasn’t at all surprised that someone who belongs to a culture in which women can compete against men in wrestling matches, would then apply this same aggression when in the setting of a bar.

“If you’re saying that it’s just fine to flip a girl onto her back in a wrestling match, and pin her to the ground and take some joy in that — well then I guess if you’re in a bar and she slaps you, you punch her in the face,” Ablow said. Adding: “Not in Ablow’s world, because you’d never be wrestling her to begin with.”
