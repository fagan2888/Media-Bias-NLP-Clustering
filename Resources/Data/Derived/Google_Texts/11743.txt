The job of president of the United States is so complex that the learning curve never ends, even when the occupant of the Oval Office has been awarded a second four-year contract.

Each president has to learn certain basics all over again for himself, as though he were born in a vacuum. No matter how bold, broad and overarching a president’s vision may be, a failure of details can sink the whole enterprise.

Jimmy Carter made a daring decision back in 1980 to launch Operation Eagle Claw, a helicopter-borne operation similar to the recent raid on Osama bin Laden’s hiding place, to rescue the American hostages in Iran. Had it succeeded, Carter might well have been re-elected to a second term. Instead, somebody forgot that when sand gets into aircraft engines, they have a tendency to seize up. Eight Americans died in the operation, and nobody was rescued. Carter shouldered the blame, and was branded a loser.

Now we have the Obamacare rollout fiasco, and once again, there’s no question that the man at the top should be held responsible.

Nobody died as a result of this screw-up, though, and you can bet that behind the scenes, the sharpest geek minds in Silicon Valley have been drafted to straighten things out, pronto.

My guess is that a few months from now, the rollout mess will be a footnote. It’s to be expected in today’s toxic political atmosphere that opponents of the ACA will exploit the glitches to question the validity of the program as a whole, but that’s only a short-lived cocaine rush.
