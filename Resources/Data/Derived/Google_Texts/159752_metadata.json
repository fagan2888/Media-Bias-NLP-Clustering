The union wants to maintain its current benefits \u2014 including health care coverage at no cost to workers, pensions, and guaranteed 40-hour workweeks.\n\nRising health care costs due to provisions in the Affordable Care Act could put those benefits in jeopardy, the union says.\n\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle to reaching settlements in Vegas is the new costs imposed on our health plan by Obamacare,\u201d Donald \u201cD\u201d Taylor, president of Unite Here, the parent union of CU Local 226, told BuzzFeed in a statement. \u201cEven though the president and Congress promised we could keep our health plan, the reality is, unless the law is fixed, that won\u2019t be true.\u201d\n\nOn March 20, workers will have the opportunity to decide whether or not they would want to walk off the job at several hotels, including the Stratosphere, the Riviera, and the Plaza.\n\nThe vote wouldn\u2019t necessarily start a strike. A successful vote would merely give the union the right to authorize a strike. But once a motion to strike passed with a simple majority, workers could walk off the job at any time.\n\nUnion leaders have long voiced concern over the health care law\u2019s effect on their Taft-Hartley plans, which are collectively bargained plans maintained by multiple employers and a labor union. Under the Affordable Care Act, Taft-Hartley plan recipients (like the members of CU 226) are not eligible for tax subsidies. That makes some union employees more expensive for employers who provide health care, making employers less agreeable when it comes time to foot the bill.\n\nTaylor has been outspoken about his displeasure with President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law for some time, going as far as meeting with one of his top critics, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, earlier this year. This is a far cry from how most union leaders have handled their Obamacare grievances \u2014 often toeing the line between admitting the law needs changes and actually criticizing the administration.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just order people to do stuff,\u201d Taylor told the Washington Post in January. \u201cIf their health plan gets wrecked, why would they then go campaign for the folks responsible for wrecking their health care?\u201d\n\nIn response to the contract situation, CU Local 226 has already worked out a deal with MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, which covers another 35,000 workers. The deal includes free health care coverage for all workers, as well as other provisions the unions say protect workers. Similar health care plans at other non-union hotels cost between $300 and $400 a month, according to internal union documents.\n\nCU Local 226 represents approximately 55,000 workers overall.\n\nYvanna Cancela, political director for CU Local 226, said with rising health care costs due to Obamacare, employers have started to say they can no longer afford to pay for their health care. In some situations, companies have asked workers to also pay into an HMO.\n\nAccording to Cancela, negotiations are ongoing, and some are further ahead than others. A deal was struck as recently as early Wednesday morning with the Tropicana Hotel, in which workers will keep their benefits, including free health care and a pension.\n\nBut the March 20 vote still looms.\n\n\u201cI think members will make a decision based on where they\u2019re at in negotiations, and considering how negotiations are going, I think workers will likely give the union authority to call for a strike,\u201d Cancela said.\n\nThe last time a similar strike happened was in 1991, when workers from five different unions walked off the job for six years, four months, and 10 days before the dispute was worked out.\n\n\u201cHopefully we reach a settlement and never get to that point,\u201d Cancela said.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3057602, "userid": 327482}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "\"The biggest hurdle to reaching settlements in Vegas is the new costs imposed on our health plan by Obamacare,\" Unite Here President Donald...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
