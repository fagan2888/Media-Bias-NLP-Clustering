Also, investor and reality-TV host Marcus Lemonis owns a bakery that supplied cupcakes to Crumbs.\n\nNe-Yo arrives at the Brit Awards in London on Feb. 20, 2013. European Pressphoto Agency/Facundo Arrizabalaga\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Ne-Yo is a gambling man (he\u2019s from Vegas after all), but we\u2019d bet the singer-songwriter is pretty mad at his manager, Kevin Foster. According to Courthouse News (h/t New York Daily News), Ne-Yo has accused Mr. Foster of conning him and is now suing him for $8 million. Included in the $8 million Ne-Yo is seeking is $3.5 million Mr. Foster allegedly deceptively put into sports-drink company OXYwater in 2012. In 2013, OXYwater filed for bankruptcy with in millions in debt. Ne-Yo claimed that unknown to him, Mr. Foster was president of the company, whose founders later were indicted for wire fraud and tax crimes related to the company.\n\nNe-Yo, real name Shaffer Smith, is accusing Mr. Foster of fraud, securities violations, negligence and other charges. Mr. Foster couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. A phone number for his firm, which Mr. Foster established after leaving an accounting firm that managed Ne-Yo\u2019s money, was out of service.\n\nMarcus Lemonis (right), the CEO of an RV and camping company, during a scene from The Profit, his CNBC business-makeover show. Heidi Gutman/CNBC\n\nThe investor, the baker, the cupcake maker: CNBC\u2019s Marcus Lemonis, who sought to rescue cupcake shop Crumbs from bankruptcy and criticized on air the very product he was looking save, owns a bakery that supplied the cupcakes for many of Crumbs\u2019 stores. And as Bankruptcy Beat reported, it\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t previously called attention to. Unlike other cupcake chains, Crumbs gets its confections from third-party vendors like Mr. Lemonis\u2019s bakery, Little Miss Muffin. Prior to the company\u2019s abrupt shutdown, Mr. Lemonis cut off service because the company allegedly stopped paying its bills. A Crumbs spokeswoman contested the assertion, noting the cupcake chain didn\u2019t fall behind on bakery payments.\n\nJackie Marcello places labels on 16mm film leader at Kodak\u2019s Rochester, N.Y., film production plant. Nick Brandreth for The Wall Street Journal\n\nEastman Kodak is long out of bankruptcy, but the company\u2019s movie film business is a shadow of its former self. But if a group of studios has its way, though, the company might be able to keep the business alive, The Wall Street Journal reported. Talks between Kodak and the group of studios are expected to yield an arrangement in which the group will buy a certain amount of film for the next few years despite that most movies and TV shows are shot digitally. That\u2019ll help keep the company\u2019s Rochester, N.Y., film production plant in business, according to Chief Executive Jeff Clarke. The studios in talks with Kodak include Warner Bros. Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures.\n\n(And just for fun: The New York Post has a timeline of \u201cReal Housewives of New Jersey\u201d star Teresa Giudice\u2019s journey from housewife to court life, and Forbes looks at how \u201cangry wives\u201d push up the sale process of major sports teams.)\n\nWrite to Melanie Cohen at melanie.cohen@wsj.com.
