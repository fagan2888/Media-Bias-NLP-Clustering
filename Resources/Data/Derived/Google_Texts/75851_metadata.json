I mean, this shouldn\u2019t be a shocker, but people who have no firearms training didn\u2019t survive the firearms training simulator located at Prince George's County Police Department in Maryland. Another non-surprise is that police officers did well; though some might add that concealed carry holders spend more time at the range than police officers. Regardless, the Washington Post reported on how determining life and death situations\u2013and when to use deadly force\u2013is difficult; something that any gun owner, or person with common sense, would already know:\n\n[A] new study from researchers at Mount St. Mary's University sheds some light on why people don't use guns in self-defense very often. As it turns out, knowing when and how to apply lethal force in a potentially life-or-death situation is really difficult. The study was commissioned by the National Gun Victims Action Council, an advocacy group devoted to enacting \"sensible gun laws\" that \"find common ground between legal gun owners and non-gun owners that minimizes gun violence in our culture.\" The study found that proper training and education are key to successfully using a firearm in self-defense: \"carrying a gun in public does not provide self-defense unless the carrier is properly trained and maintains their skill level,\" the authors wrote in a statement. They recruited 77 volunteers with varying levels of firearm experience and training, and had each of them participate in simulations of three different scenarios using the firearms training simulator at the Prince George's County Police Department in Maryland. The first scenario involved a carjacking, the second an armed robbery in a convenience store, and the third a case of suspected larceny. They found that, perhaps unsurprisingly, people without firearms training performed poorly in the scenarios. They didn't take cover. They didn't attempt to issue commands to their assailants. Their trigger fingers were either too itchy -- they shot innocent bystanders or unarmed people, or not itchy enough -- they didn't shoot armed assailants until they were already being shot at.\n\nFirst, the National Gun Victims Action Council (NGVAC) is a pro-gun control group, who seem to be driving home that \u201cpolice know what to do, average Joe don\u2019t\u201d narrative when it comes to firearms and self-defense. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s also axiomatic. If you\u2019re not trained to do \u201cx,\u201d you\u2019re probably going to suck at it\u2013and with firearms; that\u2019s especially the case. In fact, without proper safety, it\u2019s downright irresponsible that could get yourself or other around you injured, even killed. As an avid shooter, my first step was to take a safety course from a NRA-certified instructor. It lasted a few hours, but it taught me basic safety, and what to look out for (squib loads, hang fire, etc.) and what to do if such malfunctions occur when I\u2019m at the range.\n\nRegarding self-defense, like the examples in the video, of course, people with zero experience in anything firearms-related aren\u2019t going to fare well. Also, the Post noted that the sample size is also very small, so one shouldn\u2019t cite this piece in future debates about gun control. So, yes, we can agree that folks with zero training will probably die. Yet, the premises of the NGVAC, such fighting the \u201cepidemic of gun violence\u201d and \u201cwhy gun violence is a direct consequence of current gun laws,\u201d are still painfully wrong. The country is safer, violent crime\u2019s downward trend continues, and gun-related homicides are down 39 percent between 1993-2011, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nIf firearms safety and training is what NGVAC is trying to promote, they should work with an organization that does this pretty successfully, and respects the Second Amendment as well. It\u2019s called the National Rifle Association.\n\nLast Note: Yet, there seem to be times when you know that using deadly force is the only way out of a dangerous situation. Even pastors of churches know this.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Well ... yeah..05/26/2016 19:56:38PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Well ... yeah.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Spoiler Alert: People With No Firearms Training Get Killed In Self-Defense Simulator", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/02/spoiler-alert-people-with-no-firearms-training-get-killed-in-selfdefense-simulator-n2031884", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/362/377a0fb0-d5f3-4a83-ba98-d7fb3f2f1bdc.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Well ... yeah.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Spoiler Alert: People With No Firearms Training Get Killed In Self-Defense Simulator", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/02/spoiler-alert-people-with-no-firearms-training-get-killed-in-selfdefense-simulator-n2031884", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/362/377a0fb0-d5f3-4a83-ba98-d7fb3f2f1bdc.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Spoiler Alert: People With No Firearms Training Get Killed In Self-Defense Simulator , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "I mean, this shouldn\u2019t be a shocker, but people who have no firearms training didn\u2019t survive the firearms training simulator located at Prince George's County Police Department in Maryland.\nThey found that, perhaps unsurprisingly, people without firearms training performed poorly in the scenarios.\nYet, the premises of the NGVAC, such fighting the \u201cepidemic of gun violence\u201d and \u201cwhy gun violence is a direct consequence of current gun laws,\u201d are still painfully wrong.\nThey recruited 77 volunteers with varying levels of firearm experience and training, and had each of them participate in simulations of three different scenarios using the firearms training simulator at the Prince George's County Police Department in Maryland.\nIf firearms safety and training is what NGVAC is trying to promote, they should work with an organization that does this pretty successfully, and respects the Second Amendment as well."}
