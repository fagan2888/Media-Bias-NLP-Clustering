Newton City Schools are bracing for the impact of common core. Dr. Virginia Young, superintendent for the Newton Municipal School District, says teachers and administrators are focused on understanding everything they need to know about common core. Newton schools have earned an overall D-rating for 2014. Although it is considered a low rating, Dr. Young says the schools have continued to show improvement.

"We're really proud of what we were able to accomplish," Dr. Young said. "Our middle school, which had been an "F" is now a "D". They had been an "F" for several years. Our high school is a "C" and our elementary school with the waiver is still a "C". So as a district we had two schools to improve outright and then one school to remain at a "C" level."

The school district does have a nearly 70 percent four-year graduation rate for 2014 and a only a 7 percent dropout rate.
