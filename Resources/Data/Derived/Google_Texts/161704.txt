A portion of U.S. 285 is under construction this week to improve a section of the highway that has been plagued with accidents.

Crews are installing tensioned cable rail barriers near mile marker 231 at Elk Creek Road, commonly known as Shaffer’s Crossing.

The barriers are being installed “to help eliminate potentially fatal crashes from vehicles crossing over the median into oncoming traffic,” the Colorado Department of Transportation said in a project announcement.

In March, two people were killed when the motorcycle they were riding was hit by a car traveling in the wrong direction.

The now $683,000 project is expected to be completed in October and also includes a wider median, the installation of gutters, rumble strips and new striping.

Work hours will be 7 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Friday except on holidays and the Friday before Labor Day. The highway will be down to one northbound lane, as the “climbing lane” will be closed for the duration of the project and speed limits will be reduced. One lane will be open in each direction, but CDOT advises motorists to expect delays of up to 15 minutes.

Questions about the project are directed to CDOT’s public information team at 720-770-1770 or via e-mail at us285@publicinforteam.com.
