Gender is constructed.\n\nThis is one of many such programs, developed by the family violence sector and education leaders, that aim to set people on a course to better gender relations in life. The message is that gender, unlike body parts, is a product of the culture in which it operates and of the messages that this culture gives out about how men and women should act.\n\nBy targeting schoolchildren organisers hope to reduce the leading preventable contributor to death, disability and illness in Victorian women - domestic violence. The approach is grounded in evidence that the more gender equitable a society, the less prevalent is domestic violence.\n\nThe curriculum being taught at Moorabbin was put together by the STU teachers in conjunction with Debbie Ollis, a senior lecturer at Deakin University who developed the program for the Department of Education.\n\nKate Cooper, who has worked at the Southern Teaching Unit for almost a decade, says the program started taking shape five years ago when teachers saw how some students were behaving.\n\n\u2018\u2018We noticed at recess, lunchtime and in class discussion, boys were dominating girls and being quite aggressive, and girls were using their sexuality to get boys to do things for them,\u2019\u2019 Ms Cooper says.\n\nThey also noticed language. \u2018\u2018Boys would call their mums \u2018bitch\u2019 and \u2018ho\u2019 and were saying things like, \u2018Get me that, bitch!\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n\nThey noticed that many boys were using pornography as sex education and girls talked about being pressured into doing things they\u2019d seen in porn. Several disclosed they had been sexually abused or raped.\n\nThe teachers realised traditional sex education wasn\u2019t dealing with issues confronting students.\n\nDr Ollis, who has been working in the field for more than two decades, says her curriculum does not simply teach students about explicit sexism, but helps them understand gender more broadly as something that restricts both women and men.\n\nIt is about getting students to recognise powerful cultural messages telling them how men and women are supposed to behave, she says. In particular, it is about getting them to see the power imbalance within those messages - with men being taught to be dominant and women submissive - and encouraging students themselves to challenge those stereotypes.\n\nSince the subject\u2019s introduction at the Southern Teaching Unit, Ms Cooper says, teachers have witnessed a turnaround in student behaviour.\n\n\u2018\u2018At recess, I\u2019ve heard them pick each other up and say, \u2018Don\u2019t talk to her like that\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t say that! That\u2019s sexist!\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Parents are \u2018\u2018blown away\u2019\u2019 by the results, she adds. \u2018\u2018They are really amazed at language the kids are using and what they\u2019re pointing out while watching TV.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe school\u2019s teachers are also seeing changes. \u2018\u2018Our kids become more inclusive and less judgmental. They are a tighter group after the program and we get rid of a lot of bullying that happens.\u2019\u2019\n\nMs Cooper thinks such programs should be mandatory. Teachers from the Southern Teaching Unit have travelled around Melbourne with Dr Ollis to deliver shortened training to a handful of mainstream schools.\n\n\n\nThe material involves concepts that may not have been spoken about before - oral sex, pleasure, pornography, sexual abuse - and some schools find it challenging.\n\nBut, she says, the experience of students is the same in every class they\u2019ve visited: students are watching pornography, using sexist language and exhibiting the kind of behaviour that these programs target.\n\nDr Ollis says for respectful relationships training to tackle violence against women, the government needs to back it, make it part of the schools\u2019 curriculum and offer the necessary funding.\n\nFor their final class exercise of the day, the students watch a slide show of advertisements, including one from a five-metre high billboard on Chapel Street, South Yarra, recently promoting American Apparel\u2019s new store. It\u2019s of a woman with her legs wide apart with the accompanying text \u2018Now Open\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018These ads are incredible!\u2019\u2019 one student protests to his friend.\n\nAt the end of class the students are asked to reflect. A blond-haired boy calls out excitedly. \u2018\u2018I just noticed in Manga cartoons the men come in different sizes and the women are all the same size. Now I see that\u2019s sexist and it kind of ruined it for me.\u2019\u2019\n\nNext to him, his friend raises his hand: \u2018\u2018I was playing Grand Theft Auto and now I see that the violence in it is really confronting.\u2019\u2019\n\nMs Cooper asks the group another question. \u2018\u2018What\u2019s it called when they make it look like it\u2019s normal to have that sort of violence in real life?\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Normalise,\u2019\u2019 the tall boy shoots back.\n\nDr Ollis\u2019 program is also being trialed at two mainstream schools, and she expects it to be available online to others later this year.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Education", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "An innovative gender-education program for students at risk of expulsion is teaching a new language.", "title": "Sex and sexism provide a lesson in the language of change", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/sex-and-sexism-provide-a-lesson-in-the-language-of-change-20140602-zrv4q.html", "image": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/z/r/v/2/n/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zrv4q.png/1401683121694.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/z/r/v/2/n/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zrv4q.png/1401683121694.jpg"}, "title": "Sex and sexism provide a lesson in the language of change", "description": "An innovative gender-education program for students at risk of expulsion is teaching a new language.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theage"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "An innovative gender-education program for students at risk of expulsion is teaching a new perspective."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9452\"", "article_summary": "Graduation of the Southern Teaching Unit.\n\u2018\u2018And what is gender?\u2019\u2019Graduation of the Southern Teaching Unit.\nIt\u2019s another pivotal moment in the gender-education program at the Southern Teaching Unit, a small school in Moorabbin in Melbourne\u2019s south.\nSince the subject\u2019s introduction at the Southern Teaching Unit, Ms Cooper says, teachers have witnessed a turnaround in student behaviour.\nTeachers from the Southern Teaching Unit have travelled around Melbourne with Dr Ollis to deliver shortened training to a handful of mainstream schools."}
