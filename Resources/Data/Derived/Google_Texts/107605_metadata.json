Yes, Commonwealth\u2019s study is deeply flawed, but so is American health care, which is inefficient, bureaucratic, unaccountable, inconvenient, of questionable quality, and far too expensive. But even Commonwealth doesn\u2019t argue that the European systems are a whole lot better. It points out that some countries are better than others in some aspects, but worse than others in other qualities, and that \u201cin most instances (even) the top-ranked country is performing at less than an \u2018ideal\u2019 level.\u201d\n\nIn fact, these systems are not as starkly different as is commonly portrayed. Nearly all are a mix of public and private coverage, and in many cases, significant out-of-pocket costs. As the chart from OECD below shows, the United States has one of the lowest rates of OOP spending in the world, as a percentage of total spending. And, while only half of our spending is through public programs, even Canada\u2019s much vaunted \u201csingle payer\u201d system includes 27% private spending. The one big exception for the United States is total cost. Commonwealth places excessive emphasis on costs to bring down the American ranking. In virtually every instance of the U.S. ranking below other countries it is due to the cost of care. For instance, in questions of access to care it reports on the number of people who \u2013\n\n\u201cHad medical problems but did not visit the doctor because of cost in the past year.\n\nin the past year. \u201cDid not get recommended test, treatment, or follow up because of cost in the past year.\n\nin the past year. \u201cDid not fill a prescription of skipped doses because of cost in the past year.\u201d (Bolding mine) Note that it is unconcerned about access denied or delayed for other reasons such as availability of services. One might think that having access to a needed service, even if it costs you something, is far better than not having access at all. But that is not how Commonwealth sees things. It is also unconcerned about how the service is paid outside of direct out-of-pocket spending.\n\nYes, I may have a substantial copayment in getting a needed treatment, but how much more in taxes would I have to pay to avoid that out-of-pocket expense? Is it more efficient to pay taxes to a government agency, which then pays the provider for the service, or to skip the administrative burden and pay the provider directly? Passing the money through Washington before it goes to the provider means paying many additional people to handle the money.\n\nSurely this cannot be very efficient. Still, American health care is indeed far too expensive \u2014 we already know that. But we also know that the United States is a very big, messy, and extremely diverse country. We have four times the population of the next biggest country examined (Germany) and 30 times the landmass, and while Germany\u2019s population is homogeneous (93% are ethnically European), America includes very large proportions of Latinos, Asians, African Americans, and new immigrants. There are costs involved with managing all this that none of the other comparison nations are subject to.\n\nThe Commonwealth analysis of \u201cEffective Care\u201d deals solely with prevention and chronic care management. It has nothing at all to say about acute care services, where the U.S. excels. Even its measures of prevention all amount to just talk, not actual results. It includes things like whether \u201cthe doctor or other clinical staff talked with (the) patient about a healthy diet and healthy eating\u201d and whether \u201cpatients receive reminders for preventive care.\u201d Remarkably, the Commonwealth report states, \u201cThe widespread and effective use of health information technology (HIT) in the U.K. plays a large role in the country\u2019s high score on the chronic care management indicators\u2026.\u201d Is this the same U.K. that just wasted $12 billion on a HIT system that did not work and was completely discarded?\n\nThe section on \u201cCoordinated Care\u201d isn\u2019t bad, though it places an inordinate amount of emphasis on whether the patient had a regular doctor when the variation between countries is small (from 100% in the Netherlands to 91% in the U.S.) and it notes that only 57% of Americans have had the same doctor for five years or more. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising given the mobility of Americans and our unique tendency to move frequently. It is hardly a problem with the health care system. The section on \u201cEfficiency\u201d is almost entirely cost related. It says, \u201cTo measure efficiency, this report examines total national expenditures on health as a percent of gross domestic product as well as the percentage spent on health administration and insurance.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure this is particularly good measure of efficiency, but we\u2019ve already stipulated that the American system includes a great deal of waste and is not very efficient. It is the section on \u201cEquity\u201d that is the most problematic. The report cites the Institute of Medicine definition of equity as \u201cproviding care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.\u201d\n\nBut then it looks solely at comparisons based on income. Granted this is much easier to measure than the other factors, and that some of the other factors are dubious to begin with. Location, for instance \u2013obviously someone living close to the great research hospitals in Boston or Baltimore will have access to higher quality care than a farmer in North Dakota. But even in comparing income groups (those with above average or below average incomes), the report is simply not very good, relying completely on patient surveys rather than actual results. One example is the question of whether the patient received \u201cunnecessary duplication of medial tests in the past two years.\u201d\n\nHow is the patient to know whether the test was necessary or not? And, if the patient did not receive a necessary test at all, she would answer \u201cno\u201d to this question and Commonwealth would consider that good. Still, thanks to our horrible Medicaid programs, it is true that lower income people get much worse health care than the rest of us. But I doubt if Commonwealth will join me in calling for replacing Medicaid with coverage more like what the rest of us get.\n\nNow, Commonwealth does confess that there are problems with its report, though not until you get to page 27, where it says:\n\nAny international comparison of health care is subject to inherent weaknesses, such as the absence of medical record clinical information or timely health outcomes data. The measures, methods, and data used in this analysis are far from perfect. Different measures, moreover, are given equal weight in the rankings and are not weighted based on independent evidence of what patients value most highly.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 07:02:20 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Commonwealth Fund has come out with the latest iteration of its ongoing campaign to inform our political leaders that American health care sucks.", "title": "The Commonwealth Fund: American Health Care Is Awful", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commonwealth-fund.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-23T08:14:33+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/06/23/the-commonwealth-fund-american-health-care-is-awful/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The Commonwealth Fund has come out with the latest iteration of its ongoing campaign to inform our political leaders that American health care sucks.", "title": "The Commonwealth Fund: American Health Care Is Awful", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commonwealth-fund.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Avik Roy,Commonwealth Fund,David Hogberg,Philip Klein", "published_time": "2014-06-23T07:02:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-23T08:14:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Commonwealth Fund has come out with the latest iteration of its ongoing campaign to inform our political leaders that American health care sucks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dd6\"", "article_summary": "Yes, Commonwealth\u2019s study is deeply flawed, but so is American health care, which is inefficient, bureaucratic, unaccountable, inconvenient, of questionable quality, and far too expensive.\nStill, American health care is indeed far too expensive \u2014 we already know that.\nStill, thanks to our horrible Medicaid programs, it is true that lower income people get much worse health care than the rest of us.\nThe Commonwealth Fund has come out with the latest iteration of its ongoing campaign to inform our political leaders (not so much the public) that the American health care system sucks.\nIt is hardly a problem with the health care system."}
