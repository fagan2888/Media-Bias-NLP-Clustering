By the time fire crews arrived, heavy smoke and flames were billowing out of the apartment.\n\nSubstantial damage had already been done before Carmen Tinney even woke up.\n\n\"I heard popping I thought it was out, so I went to the door and all I see was black coming in from my door,\" says Tinney.\n\nIn a moment of panic, Tinney says she immediately grabbed her grandson from her second story apartment.\n\n\"When I ran out the door the flames overwhelmed me so of course I was on my knees, had my baby underneath me, made it to the stairs and got to safety,\" she says.\n\nTinney was one of four injured in the fire. She was taken to the hospital for 2nd and 3rd degree burns.\n\n\"The heat of the flames was so hot it just burnt my skin.\"\n\nTwo others tenants were treated for smoke inhalation, another refused service.\n\nCrews say it's too early to tell what caused the fire, but thankfully everyone made it out.\n\n\"It's very scary because the top of the roof was on fire and I was just trying to make it to the stairs to get out,\" adds Tinney.\n\nDozens of people watched as Tinney ran down the stairs with her grandson.\n\n\"The fire started getting real bad by the time she got to the ground,\" says Chuck Fritze.\n\nAfter crews put out the flames, Tinney's apartment was completely charred, and everything is destroyed. She didn't even have shoes, before the Red Cross showed up to help. But in a time of sadness, Tinney says there is great joy, 9-month-old baby Alejandro is safe.\n\n\"Very sad but it's replaceable, I have my life, I have my grandson's life, I'm thankful for that, I thank God for that.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "In a moment of panic, Carmen Tinney says she immediately grabbed her grandson from her second story apartment that was engulfed in flames.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "In a moment of panic, Carmen Tinney says she immediately grabbed her grandson from her second story apartment that was engulfed in flames.", "title": "Grandmother saves baby from Wichita apartment fire", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Grandmother-saves-baby-from-fire--296394861.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DD1/C61/DD1C611ED2CD425580AA18A08CC08582", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FD0/F68/FD0F68ADD88541128990929ECFFC17C9.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "In a moment of panic, Carmen Tinney says she immediately grabbed her grandson from her second story apartment that was engulfed in flames.", "title": "Grandmother saves baby from Wichita apartment fire", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Grandmother-saves-baby-from-fire--296394861.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/walker+fire+web.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Grandmother saves baby from Wichita apartment fire", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Grandmother saves baby from Wichita"}, "article_summary": "By the time fire crews arrived, heavy smoke and flames were billowing out of the apartment.\nDozens of people watched as Tinney ran down the stairs with her grandson.\nBut in a time of sadness, Tinney says there is great joy, 9-month-old baby Alejandro is safe.\nAfter crews put out the flames, Tinney's apartment was completely charred, and everything is destroyed.\nIt happened Sunday around 1:30 p.m. at a complex near Harry and Seneca in southwest Wichita."}
