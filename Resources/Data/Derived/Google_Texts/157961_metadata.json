If it's determined he was drinking, Couch's probation could be revoked and he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.\n\nBut, says Dallas attorney Nicole Knox, \"The state would have to prove that this was him in the video and it was taken at a time and occurred at a time that was during his probation instead of before it.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department has declined to say whether Tonya Couch is facing any charges.\n\nThere was no immediate comment Monday night from the U.S. Marshals Service, which had issued a wanted poster promising a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to Couch's whereabouts and capture.\n\nIn June 2013, at age 16, Ethan Couch was driving drunk and speeding on a dark two-lane road south of Fort Worth when he crashed into a disabled SUV off to the side, killing four people and injuring several others, including passengers in Couch's pickup truck.\n\nCouch pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury. Because of his age, he wasn't certified as an adult for trial and a judge sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years' probation and a stint in a rehabilitation center.\n\nDuring the sentencing phase of his trial, Couch's attorneys relied on a defense expert who argued that Couch's wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility - a condition the expert termed \"affluenza.\" The condition is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association, and its invocation drew widespread ridicule.\n\nAnderson, the sheriff, was among those critical of the judge's decision not to incarcerate Couch. The sheriff said that the teen has never expressed remorse for his actions and that his case sparked more outrage than any Anderson has encountered in his law enforcement career.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Authorities said a Texas teenager serving probation for killing four people in a drunken-driving wreck after invoking an \"affluenza\" defense was in custody in Mexico.", "author": "CBS News", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/30844654/affluenza-texas-teen-mother-in-custody-in-mexico", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9542862_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Authorities said a Texas teenager serving probation for killing four people in a drunken-driving wreck after invoking an \"affluenza\" defense was in custody in Mexico.", "title": "'Affluenza' Texas Teen, Mother In Custody In Mexico"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9542862_G.jpg", "description": "Authorities said a Texas teenager serving probation for killing four people in a drunken-driving wreck after invoking an \"affluenza\" defense was in custody in Mexico.", "card": "summary", "title": "'Affluenza' Texas Teen, Mother In Custody In Mexico"}, "wnreadableurl": "affluenza-texas-teen-mother-in-custody-in-mexico", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/12/29", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "article_summary": "A spokesman for the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department has declined to say whether Tonya Couch is facing any charges.\nIf it's determined he was drinking, Couch's probation could be revoked and he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.\nThe public affairs department of the prosecutors' office in Mexico's Jalisco state said 18-year-old Ethan Couch and his mother, Tonya Couch, 48, were detained in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta around 6:00 p.m. Monday.\nAuthorities began searching for the pair after Ethan Couch failed to keep a mandatory appointment with his probation officer on Dec. 10.\nDuring the sentencing phase of his trial, Couch's attorneys relied on a defense expert who argued that Couch's wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility - a condition the expert termed \"affluenza.\""}
