H.I.G.-backed Onyx Looks Overseas for Two Targets

The transaction for Martin Jorgensen's Net Trans continues the private equity firms aggressive stance in buying foreign tech companies

Onyx Payments, an H.I.G. Capital portfolio company, has inked two cross-border deals.

The Dallas-based company has acquired Net Trans Services and Worldwide Payment Systems. Terms of each deal remain undisclosed, but H.I.G. typically invests $10 million to $30 million of equity into companies with revenue ranging from $20 million to $100 million across multiple industries. The financial sponsor has about $15 billion in capital under management.

The transaction continues H.I.G.'s aggressive stance in buying foreign tech companies. In September, HIG made a deal through its Brazilian affiliate and picked up two Brazilian digital media companies  Grupo NZN and Click Jogos. Before that, HIG closed the sale of Capstone Logistics to the Jordan Co. The Miami-based private equity firm also recently sold American Hardwood Industries to Baillie Lumber.

The payments sector has seen a flurry of M&A activity for several years.
