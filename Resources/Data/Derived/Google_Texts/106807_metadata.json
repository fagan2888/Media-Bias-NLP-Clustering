Her diligence, discipline and hardcore work ethics have created a new culture for doing business within the county.\n\nIn her 2009 election for Cook County Board President, Preckwinkle ran a non-stop campaign focusing on the penny surcharge tax increase proposed and passed by former President Todd Stroger. The unpopular move immediately reminded Cook County taxpayers of the woes of another tax increase.\n\nPreckwinkle won the Board President seat, becoming the second African-American woman to hold the position (behind Bobbie Steele, who was appointed for four months after then-President John Stroger suffered a stroke) and the first female public official elected to the office.\n\nAccording to the Civic Federation, Preckwinkle was met with a $285 million budget deficit, a health system on life support, and a broken criminal justice system that was considered one of the worse in the country.\n\nShe rolled back Stroger\u2019s one-penny tax increase to many taxpayers\u2019 satisfaction, but it\u2019s been a small band-aid for a bigger budget wound. Now, the county\u2019s fiscal year 2015 forecast is for a $168.9 million budget deficit.\n\nThe former history teacher went into action executing one of the biggest overhauls in Cook County history. It involved job layoffs, consolidating positions, instituting mandatory employee furloughs and streamlining an ongoing history of patronage hiring.\n\nMaking Justice More Equitable\n\nOne of her biggest challenges has been the county\u2019s criminal justice system, where close to 89 percent of African-American and Hispanic inmates occupy Cook County jails.\n\n\u201cThe jails in this country are at the intersection of \u2018racism\u2019 and \u2018poverty\u2019. They are full of Black and Brown and poor people,\u201d Preckwinkle, not one to mince words, told the Chicago Defender in a recent sit-down interview.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made criminal justice reform one of the hallmarks of my administration. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working on since I walked in the door. Usually, I talk about it in kind of a macro sense. We live in a country that has five percent of the world\u2019s population, but 25 percent of the people in jail or prison in the entire world.\u201d\n\nShe began to make aggressive moves in bringing this to the forefront of her administration. \u201cWe worked with the actors in the criminal justice arena from March 2011 to August 2013. Everybody agreed that we had too many people accused of non-violent crimes awaiting the disposition of cases in jail \u2013 everybody agreed to this,\u201d Preckwinkle said. \u201cYet, in August of 2013, we were still at 10,000 people in jail despite that commitment from everyone.\u201d\n\nThe lack of movement prompted Preckwinkle to write to the Supreme Court requesting assistance with the dysfunctional system in place.\n\nPreckwinkle admitted, \u201cThe court was not happy with me, but two months later, they brought all the actors to the table to talk about what\u2019s happening in our criminal justice system. We\u2019ve been meeting on a regular basis since November 2013.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two years now. The jail population is now down to 8,200 on a daily basis and that is because fewer people accused of non-violent crimes are in our jail. That\u2019s about an 18 percent reduction and we\u2019re working together with all of the actors in the criminal justice arena to try to get support from the MacArthur Foundation. We\u2019re part of their initiative.\u201d\n\n(Cook County is in the running out of 20 communities applying to receive up to $2 million for up to two years from MacArthur in helping to reduce the number of people in the jails.)\n\nAbout The State\u2019s Attorney\n\nPreckwinkle doesn\u2019t make any bones over her disappointment in working with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez, noting that it has become a difficult task working with Alvarez\u2019s office to put in place criminal justice reform initiatives.\n\n\u201cRegarding policing in the City of Chicago in our neighborhoods, there is a profound racism that continues to plague us. This means that our jails are filled with people of color,\u201d Preckwinkle said.\n\n\u201cIn our efforts to try to reform the criminal justice system, we\u2019ve had to fight the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office all along. She\u2019s resisted our efforts to try to have more reasonable bonds for people so that ordinary people can pay them.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference of African-American community leaders and public officials including the Black Aldermanic Caucus, Preckwinkle publicly endorsed her former chief of staff, Kim Foxx, in the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney race against Alvarez in the March 2016 primary.\n\n\u201cKim has an intimate knowledge of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, having served there for 12 years and then four years before that in the Public Guardian\u2019s office,\u201d Preckwinkle said. \u201cAs a result of her experience in the State Attorney\u2019s office, we focused on the juvenile justice initiative around adult transfers \u2013 transferring juveniles out of the juvenile justice system into the adult system. That legislation we passed goes into effect in January. It\u2019s due to (Kim\u2019s) knowledge and insight that we\u2019re able to be successful at that.\u201d\n\nImprovement In Healthcare\n\nIn addition to criminal justice, the state of healthcare in the county is of crucial importance to Preckwinkle.\n\n\u201cCook County taxpayers contributed $121 million to the healthcare system to cover the costs of the operations. When I entered office in 2010, over $400 million was being paid to the healthcare system,\u201d Preckwinkle says. \u201cThat has substantially declined due to efficiencies in our healthcare system and the influx of federal dollars through the Affordable Care Act program.\u201d\n\nShe noted that for the first time in the county\u2019s history, in 2014, the healthcare system served more insured people than uninsured people.\n\n\u201cWe have 170,000 people in our Cook County Care program. We ramped it up, and as a result, the composition of our patient population in our hospital and clinics changed,\u201d Preckwinkle explained. \u201cPrior to 2014, about 70 percent were uninsured and 30 percent were insured. Now it\u2019s 70 percent insured and 30 percent uninsured. So it\u2019s flipped because people have access to the Medicaid expansion program.\u201d\n\nMaking The Hard Decisions\n\nAlthough she enters 2016 with a new county budget passed, the challenges of what\u2019s going on in Springfield, a $6.5 billion unfunded pension, and decades of budget mismanagement from previous administrations have pegged Preckwinkle as the \u201ccleaner\u201d \u2013 she identifies the problem, assassinates the target, and cleans up without a trace.\n\n\u201cThe city is in terrible financial shape because there was unwillingness to address the tough financial issues over decades. The same is true of the state. Those of us in executive offices now have to make these really difficult decisions. This is the result of long-standing unwillingness, denial, inattention and inactivity,\u201d Preckwinkle says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the members of the Board of Commissioners that recognize this difficult task. Now, we\u2019re just playing catch up. We had to increase the sales tax because that was the only way we were going to get the resources to address our pension crisis. As a steward for county government, I have to meet our obligations and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions.\u201d\n\nPreckwinkle has a long-standing relationship within the Hyde Park/Kenwood community and often has been criticized for giving preferential treatment to constituents and businesses that have supported her throughout the years.\n\nShe has also had her alliance with the Black community questioned. Although a great deal of votes have come from this area, Preckwinkle believes that working with the communities outside the Hyde Park community in her former ward is the primary reason for her success in public service.\n\n\u201cI spent most of my 19 years as alderman working to rebuild communities outside of Hyde Park and Kenwood. I came to Chicago when I was 18; I was elected when I was 43,\u201d she says. \u201cI worked very hard to rebuild those neighborhoods, so when you\u2019re alderman, you\u2019re sort of like a mayor of a small town. People hold you responsible for the safety of the streets, the quality of the schools, even the shopping environments.\u201d\n\nWith a tough job ahead of her and the majority of the Board of Cook Commissioners in support, Preckwinkle takes it one day at a time. \u201cI feel blessed to have the job that I have,\u201d she says. \u201cThe county touches people through public health and public safety. I feel that I\u2019m the right person in the right place, and that\u2019s affirming and satisfying.\u201d\n\nOutside of her job, one of the secret joys for this grandmother of three is spending time with her grandkids on weekends, as well as antique shopping and soaking in the beauty of the area\u2019s museums and zoos.\n\nFollow Mary L.
