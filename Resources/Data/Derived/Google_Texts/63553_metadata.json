Women living in poverty are less likely to receive consistent medical care before and during pregnancy, which can lead to complications during childbirth.\n\nDr. Sonia Hassan the associate dean for maternal, perinatal and child health at Wayne State University School of Medicine. She is working on a campaign to help more women in Detroit get the care they need.\n\n\"The most important thing is health before pregnancy, so cutting down the risk of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, those things are extremely important for any population,\" said Dr. Hassan. \"But there is certainly a higher rate in African Americans.\"\n\nAbout 42 percent of the city lives under the poverty line, more than any other major American city.\n\nDr. Gregory Goyert heads the maternal fetal medicine division at the Henry Ford Health Care System. He is hoping that Obamacare can be a part of the solution.\n\n\"I\u2019m very optimistic that the Affordable Health Care Act is going to benefit our entire population but specifically it\u2019s going to benefit our women, and our children and obstetric care,\" he said.\n\nGoyert says that in order to fight this, women need to become healthy before they get pregnant.\n\nYou can learn more about the campaign at Make Your Date.\n\n\u2013 Reem Nasr, Michigan Radio Newsroom", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "In Detroit, the number of women dying from pregnancy-related causes is three times the national average.
