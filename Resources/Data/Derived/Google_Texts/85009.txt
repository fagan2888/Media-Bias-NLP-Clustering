MADISON (WKOW) -- Rate filings submitted to the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI) show the cost of individual health insurance plans to be offered to Wisconsin residents on the Affordable Care Act's federal exchange will increase by an average of three percent in 2015.12 companies that offered plans for 2014 have submitted their rates for next year, with two showing their average rate will decrease.Medica Health Plans of Wisconsin shows the biggest decrease, with rates for their plans dropping by an average of 17 percent. Molina Healthcare of Wisconsin will see their plans decrease by 11 percent.Nine companies are showing an increase in rates, with Dean Health Plan Inc. coming in with the biggest rate hike at 13.1 percent. WPS issued two rate filings for its Arise Health plans, with increases of 10.9 percent and 9.7 percent respectively. The other companies showing a rate increase for 2015 are Compcare Health Services Insurance Corporation (9.2 percent), Security Health Plan (8.9 percent), Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative (7.2 percent), Unity Health Plans (4.4 percent), MercyCare HMO Inc. (4 percent), Gundersen Health Plan, Inc. (3 percent) and Health Tradition Health Plan (1.8 percent).The rate filings are all listed on an OCI database which can be accessed here Insurance industry experts say huge rate increases in 2014 likely played a part in more stable numbers this year."Everyone last year, it was almost like a dartboard," said Diane Wilkinson, Vice-President of Sales for M3 Insurance Solutions. "They didn't know necessarily how to price it, they didn't know how much of the high-risk they were gonna get and things like that.""I think in general, there just wasn't a lot of information out there," said Tim Stumm, who runs the insurance trade newsletter Wisconsin Health News.But fast forward one year later and insurance executives seem to have a better idea on what to expect in 2015."Shortly after the open enrollment period for year one ended, they had to file their rates for 2015. So, they knew how many enrollees they had and they knew who those enrollees were," said Stumm.And with consumers having a better feel for how the Affordable Care Act is working, the number of insurance carriers participating is also up by 25 percent nationwide."As people get used to it and it becomes the norm to buy on the exchange, I believe carriers will probably react to that and make themselves available," said Wilkinson.But just because prices have stabilized for now, experts warn that isn't a guarantee the trend will continue in the coming years."I just think this is going to have to play out over the next couple of years to see where we end up again," said Wilkinson.Wisconsin Deputy Insurance Commissioner Dan Schwartzer advises that consumers should view the new numbers with extreme caution, because they represent an average of every policy sold on the exchange to people of every age. Schwartzer tells 27 News that even though the overall average for one company may show a rate decrease for 2015, there are still some customers of that same company who will see their premium rate increase by double digits.Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin filed a report, but determining a rate change for them is not applicable because the plans that will be offered in 2015 are different from those offered in 2014, according to Schwartzer.There is no current filing for Physicians Plus, Inc. listed, but the company does plan to offer insurance plans on the exchange in 2015 as it did for this year.Two other companies, All Savers Insurance Company and Managed Health Services Insurance Corporation, will offer plans on the exchange in Wisconsin for the first time in 2015.
