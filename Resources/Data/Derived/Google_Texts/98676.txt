PartnerTech has a long history of partnering with medical device manufacturers and we’re looking forward to growing our business even further with this additional certification

The MedTech industry is gearing up for new growth and PartnerTech Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of PartnerTech AB of Sweden, is prepared to facilitate the manufacturing expansion in the U.S. having recently achieved additional ISO Certification.

All signs point to growth in the MedTech industry with an uptick in employment and the likelihood of a repeal of the excise tax originally levied to fund the Affordable Care Act. The industry is anticipating annual growth of 9.3% and PartnerTech Inc. is prepared to answer the call for additional manufacturing resources with the recent addition of ISO 13485 certification to previously held ISO 14001 and 9001.

Medical device manufacturers in the U.S. are cautiously hopeful that the 2.3% excise tax on revenues will be repealed due to new GOP gains and bi-partisan support from Democrats. The tax, projected to bring in $29 billion over 10 years, was considered a financial pillar of the Affordable Care Act but has been blamed for stifling medical innovation as R & D budgets were cut in response to the tax. A repeal of the tax is favorable to both the U.S. and the global MedTech industry with regard to optimized distribution channels.

PartnerTech Inc., located in Atlanta, Georgia, presents the opportunity for manufacture of multiple products in their single facility now with the addition of ISO 13485. Product developers in the Medical Device industry acquire the advantage of manufacturing resources available to scale with demand. In addition, access to leading edge manufacturing expertise in the U.S. provides a distinct distribution advantage. Gary Bruce, President and Managing Director of PartnerTech, NA stated “PartnerTech has a long history of partnering with medical device manufacturers and we’re looking forward to growing our business even further with this additional certification.”
