Despite his poor prognosis, his family continued to care for him, not knowing their son could hear them and was aware of all that was happening around him. Now, he has written a book about that experience.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn Ghost Boy: My Escape from a Life Locked Inside My Own Body, Pistorius tells the story of how, in the late 1980\u2019s in South Africa, he began to deteriorate from a mysterious illness, though doctors suspected he had developed cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Ultimately, he fell into a coma, and though doctors told his parents to take him home from the hospital and keep him comfortable until he died, Pistorius\u2019s mind was far from dead. Yet, he tells National Public Radio (NPR) he knew everyone around him believed he could not hear them and that he was unaware of his surroundings.\n\nIn his book, Martin Pistorius relates what it was like to be \u201clocked\u201d in his body, unable to communicate with his family and others, yet aware of all that was going on around him. His father, Rodney, bathed and dressed him each day, drove him to the special care center, and woke himself every two hours at night to turn his son\u2019s body over so he would not develop bed sores.\n\nAnd Martin Pistorius continued to live.\n\n\u201cEveryone was so used to me not being there they didn\u2019t notice when I began to be present again,\u201d he said, noting that he started to regain awareness of everything, \u201cjust like any normal person,\u201d about two years into his vegetative state. Still, his body was unable to move.\n\n\u201cThe stark reality hit me that I was going to spend the rest of my life like that \u2013 totally alone,\u201d Pistorius says, recalling his overwhelming negative thoughts.\n\n\u201cNo one will ever show me tenderness. No one will ever love me,\u201d he thought, coming to the conclusion that he was \u201cdoomed.\u201d\n\nPistorius says he strategized that the only way to survive in that state was to turn off his thoughts.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really think about anything,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou simply exist. It\u2019s a very dark place to find yourself because, in a sense, you are allowing yourself to vanish.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Pistorius discovered there were some events occurring around him that he could not ignore. For example, at the day care center, he often spent hours in front of the TV watching repeats of children\u2019s shows.\n\n\u201cI cannot even express to you how much I hated Barney,\u201d he now states.\n\nAt yet another time, Pistorius remembers hearing Whitney Houston sing \u201cThe Greatest Love of All\u201d on the radio while an attendant at the day care center was wiping drool from his face. He says he heard Houston sing, \u201cNo matter what they take from me, they can\u2019t take away my dignity!\u201d\n\n\u201cI sat there and thought, \u2018You want to bet?\u2019\u201d while listening to those words.\n\nFinally, however, Pistorius states he had \u201chad enough\u201d of cutting off his thoughts. Motivated by his desire to know when Barney would end, but never seated near a clock in the special care center, he trained himself to tell time by watching the shadows of the sun, an experience that helped him feel in control of his life. He was gradually able to reframe other thoughts and consider things in relation to other things.\n\nA particularly difficult experience, he relates, was when his mother, not knowing he was aware of what she was saying, said to him, \u201cI hope you die.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rest of the world felt so far away when she said those words,\u201d Pistorius remembers. Still in his uncommunicative state, he struggled with his mother\u2019s words, but eventually developed empathy enough to understand why a mother \u2013 his mother \u2013 would speak them.\n\n\u201cAs time passed, I gradually learned to understand my mother\u2019s desperation,\u201d he now says. \u201cEvery time she looked at me, she could see only a cruel parody of the once-healthy child she had loved so much.\u201d\n\nJoan Pistorius now says of her statement to her son, \u201cI know that\u2019s a horrible thing to say. I just wanted some sort of relief.\u201d\n\nMaking the decision to re-engage his thoughts helped Pistorius feel better emotionally and, subsequently, his body began to change, as well.\n\nWhen he was 26, it became known that Pistorius was able to identify objects with his eyes. Subsequently, his mother resigned from her job and worked with her son for two years, teaching him how to use a computer.\n\nEventually, Pistorius got an office job, but he left it to go to college to study computer science. He then started a web company and wrote his book. Now, he is learning to drive.\n\n\u201cMartin achieves everything he wants to do,\u201d his mother says.\n\nAt 39, Pistorius is married and living in Harlow, England. He uses a computer keyboard to choose words to communicate with others. Though he never regained his speech, he is able to operate a wheelchair.\n\nRecalling his fears of eternal loneliness for so many years, Pistorius says the very best thing in his life is his wife, Joanna, who shares that what drew her to her husband is his humor and honesty about what it means to be human.\n\nThe entire interview with Martin Pistorius can be heard at NPR.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Martin Pistorius was 12 years old, he fell into a coma for 12 years.
