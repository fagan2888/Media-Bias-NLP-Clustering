Eighty-six percent of healthcare and life services professionals expect mergers and acquisitions to increase in the industry, with capital needs and economies of scale as two major reasons for the consolidation.\n\nThe healthcare industry is seeing \"significant implications of the ACA take hold,\" Angela Humphreys, a member of Bass, Berry & Sims and healthcare transactions attorney, told Brian Ahier, director of standards and government affairs at Medicity, in a LinkedIn post.\n\n\"Reforms like these are pushing providers to do more, better, for less--which in turn drives them to consolidate to become stronger in this new healthcare climate,\" she said.\n\nSome of the pressures from the ACA--such as finding ways to run more efficiently, coping with shifts in reimbursement policies and replacing depleting inpatient revenues--lead to hospital consolidation.\n\nIn addition, 20 percent of the report's respondents said that physician groups will be a top area of consolidation over the next year. Mergers can serve as a good avenue for groups trying to upgrade their business models, the report said.\n\nThe report's respondents also identified the need for IT support capabilities as a major driver for consolidations in the future.\n\nTechnology in the healthcare industry is continually changing the way things are done, and with those changes come more regulations. One way healthcare providers can keep in line with new rules--such as the HITECH Act and Office of the National Coordinator of Health IT's 10-year interoperability plan--is through acquisitions.\n\nAnd many healthcare providers have a long way to go when it comes to implementing interoperability, which means more acquisitions are likely.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report\n\n- read Brian Ahier's post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNew agreements on the M&A front as trend toward consolidation continues\n\nHFMA: Financial need no longer driving hospital M&As\n\nCombining cultures a challenge during mergers, hospital CIOs say\n\nDo healthcare systems truly integrate after a physician practice acquisition?\n\nPwC: Hospital deals down, value up in first quarter\n\nAre hospital mergers destined to fail?\n\nSt. Luke's vs. St. Alphonsus: Battle of health systems centers on market share, quality of care\n\nJoy Pritts: Industry knowledge of HITECH security measures 'disappointing'\n\nONC unveils 10-year plan for healthcare interoperability\n\nState of health IT interoperability: An upward climb", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consolidation\u00a0among hospitals and health IT companies will grow this year in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, according to a new\u00a0survey report\u00a0by Bass, Berry & Sims, published in association with Mergermarket.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Consolidation\u00a0among hospitals and health IT companies will grow this year in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, according to a new\u00a0survey report\u00a0by Bass, Berry & Sims, published in association with Mergermarket.", "title": "Healthcare consolidation on the rise", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/healthcare-consolidation-rise/2014-07-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Health Information Technology,health it,healthcare industry,Healthcare providers,hospital consolidation,M&A,mergers and acquisitions", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Information Technology"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1082\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare organizations are the subsectors most likely to see an increase in acquisitions and mergers in 2014-2015, the report, \"Healthcare & Life Sciences M&A Outlook,\" finds.\nTechnology in the healthcare industry is continually changing the way things are done, and with those changes come more regulations.\nThe healthcare industry is seeing \"significant implications of the ACA take hold,\" Angela Humphreys, a member of Bass, Berry & Sims and healthcare transactions attorney, told Brian Ahier, director of standards and government affairs at Medicity, in a LinkedIn post.\nSome of the pressures from the ACA--such as finding ways to run more efficiently, coping with shifts in reimbursement policies and replacing depleting inpatient revenues--lead to hospital consolidation.\nAnd many healthcare providers have a long way to go when it comes to implementing interoperability, which means more acquisitions are likely."}
