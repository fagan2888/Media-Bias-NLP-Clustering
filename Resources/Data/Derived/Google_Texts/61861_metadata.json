But an outpatient total joint replacement program without a coordinated home care component is doomed to failure. These patients demand consistent monitoring, in-home nursing and physical therapy in the days and weeks that follow surgery, care that same-day discharges and non-clinician caregivers can't guarantee. Here's what you need to know about this sometimes overlooked aspect of total joint surgery.\n\nWhy home recovery makes sense\n\nDischarging total joint patients within hours of their surgeries and, by association, having them start their recoveries at home, offers advantages on both economical and clinical fronts.\n\nOne of the chief aims of the Affordable Care Act \u0097 and of Medicare's recently proposed Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement payment model, slated to take effect in select markets in January \u0097 is promoting high-quality health care while reducing the costs of that care. One cost-effective tactic that frequently delivers value is shortening the lengths of hospital stays, when possible.\n\nA hospital stay can cost roughly $2,500 to $3,500 per day, and sometimes insurers dictate a hospital stay, but if not, every day earlier that you can safely discharge a patient saves a substantial sum of money. Certainly you could refer patients to a skilled nursing facility, which is a comparative bargain at about $414 per day, but an adequate home recovery model can cost about $62 per day.\n\nHome recovery also carries benefits for patient outcomes. Studies show that the longer a patient stays in the hospital, the higher the risk of surgical site infection, so speedy discharge and at-home care might actually reduce the risk of post-op complications as well as hospital readmissions.\n\nIt's providing them with an encouraging shot of motivation, too. It stands to reason that outpatient total joints programs are seeing such great results because patients aren't staying in the hospital, they're resting comfortably at home. After the rigors of surgery, that's where patients want to be. By bringing the therapy to the patient, there is a higher level of compliance and carry-over of the treatment sessions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Home recovery and rehab for total joint patients.
