We even have a word for them: supermodels.\n\nTo a great extent, we can thank Eileen Ford for making all those models so super.\n\nFord, who died on July 9 at age 92 in Morristown, N.J., in 1947 cofounded \u2013 with her late husband Jerry \u2013 Ford Models, the agency that became the top provider of modeling talent in the world and turned modeling into what the New York Times calls \u201ca serious business\u201d with seven-figure contracts. As the agency\u2019s chief talent scout, she discovered and groomed many, if not most, of the world\u2019s most famous models, among them Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs, Naomi Campbell and Elle Macpherson. Many of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u2013 including Jane Fonda to Kim Basinger, to name just two \u2013 eventually made the leap from the runway to even greater fame in Hollywood. She even discovered future multimedia domestic diva Martha Stewart, who modeled for Ford to pay her way through college.\n\n>> Photos: Famous People We\u2019ve Lost in 2014\n\nBut Ford\u2019s selections \u2013 in particular, her preference for the fresh-faced, healthy \u201cgirl next door\u201d look \u2013 helped to set the world\u2019s standard of beauty. \u201cI create a look and I create a style,\u201d she once said. \u201cAmerican girls mean a great deal to me. I help them understand how they can look better.\u201d\n\nHere are some facts about Ford and her career:\n\nFord herself briefly modeled during summer breaks from Barnard College, from which she graduated in 1943 with a degree in psychology. She started out working as a photographer\u2019s assistant and as a stylist and reporter for a fashion publication, and then got her start in the business end of modeling by informally working as an agent for several friends who were models.\n\nThe Ford agency found success quickly, largely because of Eileen Ford\u2019s acumen for spotting young women with potential and teaching them grooming, etiquette and style. But she also became known for enforcing high ethical standards, and for protecting her models from bad contracts and lecherous clients. She and her husband also negotiated deals in which models were paid according to how their photographs were used, rather than by the hour \u2013 an arrangement that revolutionized the industry and made many top models wealthy.\n\nFord famously set curfews for her youngest models and even had them live in her home so that she could keep an eye on them, according to her Los Angeles Times obituary. She once reportedly told a model who\u2019d been out late with a her boyfriend: \u201cIf you want to model, fine. If you want to fool around, that\u2019s fine, too. But you can\u2019t do both, so make up your mind, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nFord, who could be stinging in her rejections, wasn\u2019t always right. She reportedly turned down Grace Kelly and Marisa Berenson, who later became movie stars.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nEarly in her agency\u2019s history, Ford\u2019s standard contract with clients prohibited them from asking its models to pose in bathtubs, promote deodorants, or show \u201cexcessive amounts of bosom.\u201d The latter rule eventually was relaxed, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWhile some models bristled under Ford\u2019s rigid control, others appreciated it. \u201cShe is imperious, difficult, demanding and fierce, a vengeful fire breather,\u201d former Ford model Stephanie Cook once said. \u201cAnd yet, she loves as fiercely as she hates \u2026 because she is the best at what she does.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Ford became embroiled in a bitter rivalry with new competitors such as Wilhelmina Cooper and John Casablancas, in what became known as the \u201cModel Wars.\u201d She once reportedly sent Casablancas a Bible with the passages about Judas Iscariot highlighted.\n\nFord and her husband retired in 1995 and appointed their daughter Katie to head the agency. Jerry Ford died in 2008.\n\nA biography of Ford by Robert Lacey is scheduled for publication in 2015.\n\nHere\u2019s a short documentary about Ford.\n\nPhoto: National Institute of Health\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "The beautiful women who display designers\u2019 new fashions on the runway and grace magazine covers are more than just celebrities \u2013 they\u2019re brand names in their own right. \u00a0We even have a word for them: supermodels.
