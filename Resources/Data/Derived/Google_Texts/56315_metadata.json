This loan allows you to regularly draw on a credit line by paying interest rates only for the first 10 years \u2013 at which point you start repaying the principal in addition to interest, typically for the next 15 years.\n\nAbout $13 billion of new HELOCs and home-equity loans were issued in the first quarter of this year, up 8 percent from a year earlier and the most for that time frame since 2009, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.\n\n\u201cHELOCs are an alternative for consumers to tap into the equity of their homes and gain access to cash if or when they need it,\u201d says Doug Lebda, CEO of Lending Tree, an online lender. \u201cFor those with a good credit profile, rates are lower than with other forms of lending, whether that\u2019s personal loans, auto loans or credit cards.\n\nSome people also use HELOCs to repay student loans or for one-time large expenses. \u201cOur clients were able to secure $50,000 HELOCs at interest rates below 4 percent,\u201d says Matt Rinkey, president of Illumination Wealth Management. They took the proceeds and paid off student loans, which carried interest rates of more than 6 percent, saving $1,400 per year in interest.\n\nAmy Ellis, vice president at Private Bank of Buckhead in Atlanta, tells of an empty-nester couple who moved out of their big house and downsized to a condo. \u201cThey needed cash to sell and cash to close on their new property and did not want to have to liquidate their retirement funds and pay a penalty,\u201d she says. The couple owned a second home at a lake resort \u2013 and took a HELOC on that property.\n\nAn Insurance Policy \u2013 with Big Caveats\n\nHELOCs can be a great tool in financial planning \u2013 but can also lead to trouble. In the early 2000s, people could borrow up to 100 percent of their home\u2019s value, but many homeowners became over-extended when the value of their homes began plummeting.\n\n\u201cThis is not an ideal product for someone who lacks self-control,\u201d says Bijan Golkar, a certified financial planner with FPC Investment Advisory. \u201cThink of it more as an insurance policy.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Prices Stabilize, Home Buyers Have an Incentive to Buy\n\nSome actually see trouble on the horizon because of the way HELOCs work. When they reset to fixed-amount loans after 10 years, they become fully amortized 15-year loans \u2013 and the payment amount goes up substantially, catching many borrowers off guard. For example, a $100,000 HELOC at 4 percent would cost $333.33 in interest; but once that loan hits the 10-year mark, the payment high-jumps to $739.69 per month.\n\n\u201cThis could crush a household\u2019s budget,\u201d says Golkar. \u201cIf they can\u2019t make the new payment, people are forced to refinance or even sell their home.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Taylor, co-founder and managing partner at Digital Risk, notes that according to Equifax, when a reset occurs, the serious delinquency rate \u2013 when the loan is 90 days or more past due and nears default \u2013 jumps from 3 percent before reset to 5.6 percent afterward. \u201cThat is a big deal and makes bankers worry,\u201d says Taylor.\n\nIn fact, Wells Fargo recently announced it is cutting back on its interest-only HELOCs and now only offers HELOCs to customers with at least $1 million in savings and other liquid assets, citing concerns that some borrowers may have difficulties repaying their loans.\n\nThese are more sober times, which should help lenders and consumers alike. We\u2019re still far from the peak of the $113 billion worth of HELOCs that were issued during the third quarter of 2006, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nToday, HELOCs are usually offered \u201cto good-to-excellent credit quality borrowers with deeper equity positions, and lenders require full documentation and appraisals,\u201d says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a mortgage information provider. \u201cLenders will also not allow borrowers to leverage much past 80 to 85 percent of the value of their home.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Home equity lines of credit, popular in the early 2000s and often cited as a main cause of the subprime mortgage crisis, are in vogue again as home values are on the rise and interest rates remain low.", "title": "The Hidden Risk of Home Equity Loans", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/09/Hidden-Risk-Home-Equity-Loans", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10192012_housingup_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/09/Hidden-Risk-Home-Equity-Loans", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10192012_housingup_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Home equity lines of credit, popular in the early 2000s and often cited as a main cause of the subprime mortgage crisis, are in vogue again as home values are on the rise and interest rates remain low.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ef3\"", "article_summary": "Philip Mandel would be in a very tight spot if it weren\u2019t for his home equity line of credit (HELOC).\n\u201cFor those with a good credit profile, rates are lower than with other forms of lending, whether that\u2019s personal loans, auto loans or credit cards.\nThey took the proceeds and paid off student loans, which carried interest rates of more than 6 percent, saving $1,400 per year in interest.\nIn the early 2000s, people could borrow up to 100 percent of their home\u2019s value, but many homeowners became over-extended when the value of their homes began plummeting.\n\u201cOur clients were able to secure $50,000 HELOCs at interest rates below 4 percent,\u201d says Matt Rinkey, president of Illumination Wealth Management."}
