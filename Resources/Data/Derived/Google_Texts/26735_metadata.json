(This remains Republican doctrine, and Rubio has a keen eye for locating the most popular stance within his party.) Rather, the interesting thing is that Rubio sees no need to hide his bellicosity behind feigned sophistication. He is a loud and proud neanderthal, appealing to the most primitive, fearful elements of the conservative brain, or brain-stem.\n\nIn his recent foreign-policy speech, he attached his foreign-policy doctrine to a comically over-the-top action movie: \u201cOn our strategy on global jihadists and terrorists, I refer them to the movie Taken. Have you seen the movie Taken? Liam Neeson, he had a line, and this is what our strategy should be: \u2018We will look for you, we will find you, and we will kill you.'\u201d Even that message now appears too subtle, and Rubio today announces his new theme:\n\n\u201cThe world has never been more dangerous than it is today,\u201d argues Rubio. He is possibly preparing a campaign theme that can work in a favorable economy. All the things Republicans claimed would happen as a result of Obama\u2019s economic policies \u2014 Obamacare collapsing, workers shunted into part-time jobs, taxes and regulations strangling growth \u2014 have failed to materialize, but there are still scary people at large in the world.\n\nTo be sure, Rubio\u2019s claim that the world \u201chas never been more dangerous than it is today\u201d is not just wrong but insanely wrong. How about when a massive communist empire threatened us with nuclear annihilation? Or when Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan launched a war of extermination? Or when the Mongols amassed the largest land conquest in human history and left behind smoking ruins and pyramids of skulls?\n\nAs Stephen Pinker has argued, the world has in fact grown comprehensively safer in nearly every respect. This is true whether safety is defined in humanitarian or geopolitical terms. Disease and starvation, the main killers of humanity, are in retreat. Far more people live in democratic states, and fewer in autocratic ones. Armed conflict has declined precipitously:\n\nOf course, most Americans, who are quite safe, have little awareness of aggregate measures of safety. There are still frightening figures committing barbaric acts on their television screens, in Iraq and elsewhere. Rubio\u2019s argument \u2014 to the extent he has any analytic basis for his platform, which is questionable \u2014 is that Americans must regard these threats with a terror so comprehensive it blots out all other considerations. You may not be thrilled with a candidate who promises to repeal the security of Obamacare and eliminate all taxes on amassed wealth, but you have no choice, because \u201cnothing matters.\u201d He is the candidate who will ask over and over again, \u201cIs it safe?\u201d\n\nRubio has replaced the Liam Neeson doctrine with the Laurence Olivier doctrine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Candidate decides foreign policy based on Liam Neeson quotes was too complex, dumbs it down more.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Candidate decides foreign policy based on Liam Neeson quotes was too complex, dumbs it down more.", "title": "Morbid Marco Rubio Asks America, \u2018Is It Safe?\u2019", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/morbid-marco-rubio-asks-america-is-it-safe.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/18/18-marco-rubio-is-it-safe.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Candidate decides foreign policy based on Liam Neeson quotes was too complex, dumbs it down more.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/18/18-marco-rubio-is-it-safe.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Morbid Marco Rubio Asks America \u2018Is It Safe?\u2019", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, marco rubio, campaign 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,marco rubio,campaign 2016", "published_time": "2015-05-18T15:55:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, marco rubio, campaign 2016", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c01\"", "article_summary": "'\u201d Even that message now appears too subtle, and Rubio today announces his new theme:\u201cThe world has never been more dangerous than it is today,\u201d argues Rubio.\n(This remains Republican doctrine, and Rubio has a keen eye for locating the most popular stance within his party.)\nThe interesting thing about Marco Rubio\u2019s emerging foreign-policy profile is not his commitment to mindlessly bellicose neoconservatism.\nRather, the interesting thing is that Rubio sees no need to hide his bellicosity behind feigned sophistication.\nIn his recent foreign-policy speech, he attached his foreign-policy doctrine to a comically over-the-top action movie: \u201cOn our strategy on global jihadists and terrorists, I refer them to the movie Taken."}
