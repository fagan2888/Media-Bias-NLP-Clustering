Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the House Rules Committee, introduced a resolution to recognize \u201cmagic\u201d as one of America\u2019s \u201cnational treasure(s),\u201d backed by a 711-word paean urging all to \u201csupport and protect\u201d the storied craft\u2014which needs to be \u201cunderstood and promulgated,\u201d especially given that, according to Sessions, it \u201crequires only the capacity to dream.\u201d Sessions made no link of magic to resolving other congressional business (such as, for instance, ending the string of 64 consecutive failed votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act).\n\nLeading Economic Indicators\n\nPeople With Too Much Money: Residents on London\u2019s swankiest street (Kensington Palace Gardens), stymied in efforts to build upward on their relatively small lots, instead plan elaborate \u201cbasements\u201d\u2014extending as far as five stories down, with elevators, swimming pools, gyms, climbing walls, and one even with a \u201cFerris wheel\u201d for dialing up the resident\u2019s daily choice among his several cars. However, embassies are located on the street and have challenged the construction chaos as offending their sovereignty under international law. Recent restrictions limit the basements to one story down, but billionaire entrepreneur Jon Hunt\u2019s five stories are grandfathered in (though his \u201cFerris wheel\u201d appears to have been shelved).\n\nNew World Order\n\nMystery fiction has always been a popular genre, but now, readers who prefer that their crimes be solved by cats have several series of brilliant felines to choose from. As The Wall Street Journal reported in February, the major controversy swirling at \u201ccat fiction\u201d conventions is whether the clever kitties should advance the plot by speaking. \u201cWe all talk to our pets,\u201d noted one best- selling author, \u201cand most of us imagine the other side of the dialogue.\u201d (Among the sets boasting more than a million copies are the \u201cJoe Greys,\u201d the \u201cKlepto Cats,\u201d the \u201cCat Shout for Joy\u201d suite, and the recently concluded, 29-volume run of \u201cCat Who\u201d books, e.g., \u201cThe Cat Who Could Read Backwards.\u201d)\n\n\u204c The Glasgow, Scotland, company Osdin Shield announced recently that it had designed for potential sale (for those relaxing, yet secure evenings) a fashionable yet bullet-proof sofa and upholstered chairs sturdy enough to protect against 9mm handguns, shotguns and AK47s\u2014with special marketing to hotels, embassies and government buildings.\n\n\u204c In February, British marketing company Havas Helia tapped the \u201cmillennial\u201d generation\u2019s obsessions with craft beer and data-driven knowledge, announcing the development of 0101\u2014a brew created, it said, by social media messages. The company, \u201cfinding\u201d that the generation appeared \u201coptimistic,\u201d analyzed \u201cthousands\u201d of the generation\u2019s messages against 24 human emotions, which it translated to 38 particular emotional states, which were fed into the IBM Watson computer, which selected 10 existing beers, whose recipes were then cribbed to create 0101 (a \u201ccream ale\u201d with honey and two specific kinds of hops, tasting of \u201coptimism, love, imagination, and gentle overtones of excitement\u201d).\n\nLeast Competent Government\n\nFollowing a simplistic hack at the Internal Revenue Service that permitted several thousand tax returns to be illegally accessed and refunds commandeered, the agency created an equally porous \u201cfix\u201d merely copied from failed security elsewhere on the IRS website. According to a March Washington Post report, the fix admirably added one level of security (a personal PIN), but nonetheless allowed anyone to change another\u2019s PIN using publicly available information. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told the Post that \u201conly a handful\u201d of taxpayers were victimized by the faulty fix (but later defined \u201chandful\u201d as \u201cfewer than 200\u201d).\n\nThanks This Week to the News of the Weird Board Editorial Advisors.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://planetjh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/160330NewsoftheWeird.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 526300947519080}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fcb\"", "article_summary": "However, embassies are located on the street and have challenged the construction chaos as offending their sovereignty under international law.\nThanks This Week to the News of the Weird Board Editorial Advisors.\nAs The Wall Street Journal reported in February, the major controversy swirling at \u201ccat fiction\u201d conventions is whether the clever kitties should advance the plot by speaking.\nRecent restrictions limit the basements to one story down, but billionaire entrepreneur Jon Hunt\u2019s five stories are grandfathered in (though his \u201cFerris wheel\u201d appears to have been shelved).\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen told the Post that \u201conly a handful\u201d of taxpayers were victimized by the faulty fix (but later defined \u201chandful\u201d as \u201cfewer than 200\u201d)."}
