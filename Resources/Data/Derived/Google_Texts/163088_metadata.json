There\u2019s no better reminder of that fact than House and Senate elections, where some campaigns are willing to pull out any and all stops in order to secure a win.\n\nThese midterms haven\u2019t disappointed. In a year where arrests, nasty accusations, personal attacks, and misleading advertisements have all been perpetrated in the name of politics, here are the top five nastiest campaigns.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMississippi Senate Republican Primary: Sen.(R) vs. state Sen. Chris McDaniel (R)\n\nMcDaniel\u2019s challenge to Cochran became the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of primary season for conservative and Tea Party Groups. With the help of Democratic crossover voters, Cochran survived the runoff by less than 8,000 votes, which caused McDaniel to launch a series of failed legal challenges with accusations of voter fraud.\n\nBut the run-up to the election proved as controversial as the conclusion. Four McDaniel supporters were arrested in connection with allegedly sneaking into the nursing home room of Cochran\u2019s infirm wife to take pictures of her. One of the supporters later committed suicide.\n\nThe campaigns and their allies filled the airwaves with brutal ads. The Now or Never PAC attacked Cochran with an ad that included a quote from the senator joking that he enjoyed \u201cdoing all sorts of indecent things with animals\u201d while growing up. And a Cochran ad slammed McDaniel for using vulgar language and making jokes about a woman\u2019s breasts on his radio show.\n\nCA-52: Carl DeMaio (R) vs. Rep. Scott Peters (D)\n\nDeMaio\u2019s campaign has been at the center of serious sexual harassment allegations by a former aide, who the campaign claims broke into its headquarters after he was fired and stole sensitive material. The aide levied a slew of allegations against DeMaio ranging from the crude to disturbing and appeared on CNN to discuss those claims. Prosecutors told the AP that they will not file charges.\n\nDeMaio has blamed Peters for pushing the accusations and claimed that he\u2019s been targeted because of his sexual orientation. In an interview with The Hill, Peters said that he\u2019s letting the voters draw their own conclusions. During a recent debate, Peters confirmed that his campaign received materials that were most likely stolen from the campaign. The campaign says it immediately forwarded it to the police, but DeMaio chided Peters for not previously telling him about that incident and he walked off the set without shaking Peters\u2019 hand.\n\nNE-2: Rep. Lee Terry (R) vs. state Sen. Brad Ashford (D)\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee hasn\u2019t pulled any punches in Nebraska, painting the airwaves with controversial attack ads slamming Ashford as weak on crime. The first alleged that Ashford failed to strengthen the state\u2019s sentencing laws after a criminal left jail early and killed four people. That ad was panned as \u201cracist\u201d by former RNC chairman Michael Steele and drew the ire of national Democrats. In an odd twist, that convicted murderer recently yelled his support for Terry during a court appearance. Another ad bashed Ashford\u2019s plan to remove low-risk sexual offenders from the public registry.\n\nIn response, Ashford and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have both repeatedly hit Terry over comments he made surrounding the 2013 government shutdown. Terry previously told a reporter that he needed to keep the salary he made while Congress was closed in order to pay for his son\u2019s college and his \u201cnice house.\u201d In a sea of grim hopes for Democrats, this is one Republicans fear they could lose on Election Day.\n\nIA-SEN: State Sen. Joni Ernst (R) vs. Rep. Bill Braley (D)\n\nAny race that opens with an ad about castrating hogs is bound to get exciting \u2014and the Iowa Senate race certainly hasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\nThe Braley campaign used a baby bird to accuse Ernst of not saying a \u201cpeep\u201d while in the state Senate. But he\u2019s been dogged by birds of his own, as Ernst claimed in a debate that Braley \u201cthreatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto [his] property.\u201d While the website PolitiFact didn\u2019t find evidence of a legal threat, it did confirm a disagreement between Braley and his neighbor over the chickens. That\u2019s been enough for the Ernst campaign and her allies to slam him for being out of touch and unnecessarily hostile towards his neighbors.\n\nKY-SEN: Sen. Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellOvernight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Trump outlines \u2018America First\u2019 energy plan Senators hope for deal soon on mental health bill MORE (R) vs. Ken. Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D)\n\nThere\u2019s been no love lost between Grimes and McConnell, the Senate minority leader who is in the fight for his political life. The two have exchanged a slew of personal attacks over family history, their Kentucky-chops, and who is a stronger supporter of Kentucky\u2019s coal economy.\n\nMuch of the election\u2019s unpleasantries have stemmed from that last issue, as the two candidates engage in an \u201canything you can do, I can do better\u201d war over who\u2019s best for coal. The Washington Post\u2019s fact checker, Glenn Kessler, slammed Grimes over an ad that claimed McConnell received $600,000 from \u201cenemies of coal,\u201d calling the charge \u201clikely the worst ad of a nasty campaign year.\u201d Fact-checkers have taken issue with some of McConnell\u2019s ads as well, and he received criticism for a tense radio interview on a popular Kentucky sports show. The show\u2019s host later called McConnell \u201cneedlessly angry and combative.\u201d\n\nGrimes's campaign has filed suit to prevent McConnell's campaign from distributing a mailer it says is intended to suppress voter turnout.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Politics isn\u2019t just business \u2014 it can get personal.", "description": "Politics isn\u2019t just business \u2014 it can get personal.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Politics isn\u2019t just business \u2014 it can get personal.", "title": "Top five nastiest campaigns", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/222538-top-five-nastiest-campaigns", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/222538-top-five-nastiest-campaigns", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-01T08:12-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ben Kamisar", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Mitch McConnell, Thad Cochran,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-01T08:12:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/222538-top-five-nastiest-campaigns", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Politics isn\u2019t just business \u2014 it can get personal.", "card": "summary", "title": "Top five nastiest campaigns"}, "dcterms.title": "Top five nastiest campaigns"}, "article_summary": "In a year where arrests, nasty accusations, personal attacks, and misleading advertisements have all been perpetrated in the name of politics, here are the top five nastiest campaigns.\nThe Braley campaign used a baby bird to accuse Ernst of not saying a \u201cpeep\u201d while in the state Senate.\nADVERTISEMENTMississippi Senate Republican Primary: Sen.(R) vs. state Sen.
