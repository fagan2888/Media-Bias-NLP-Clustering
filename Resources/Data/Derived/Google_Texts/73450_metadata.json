Blood tests can show whether a person has high levels of blood glucose, which can be a sign of diabetes as well as pre-diabetes. During 2013 and 2014, the authors performed HbA1c testing on dried blood samples from gingival crevicular blood, and compared them with \u201cgold-standard\u201d HbA1c tests with dried finger-stick blood samples from NYC dental clinic patients. The GCB testing provided results nearly as accurate as ones obtained by finger stick blood (FSB).\n\n\u201cIn light of findings from the study, the dental visit could be a useful opportunity to conduct diabetes screening among at-risk, undiagnosed patients \u2014 an important first step in identifying those who need further testing to determine their diabetes status,\u201d Dr. Shiela Strauss, lead author of the study, said in the press release.\n\nSome 8 million of the 29 million Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed, the authors state, and most diabetics have poor glycemic control. They argue that because many Americans are more likely to visit a dentist every year rather than a primary care physician, it might make more sense to provide diabetes screenings at dental providers \u2014 and it could help diagnose many people who would otherwise go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cOur study has considerable public health significance because we identify the value and importance of capitalizing on an opportunity at the dental visit (a) to screen at-risk, but as yet undiagnosed patients for diabetes (especially those 45 years or older) and (b) to monitor glycemic control in those already diagnosed so as to enable them to maintain their health to the greatest extent possible,\u201d Strauss said in the press release.\n\nFor diabetes patients, keeping normal blood glucose levels \u201ccan be a lifesaver,\u201d the American Diabetes Association states. Maintaining lower glucose levels can lengthen a diabetic\u2019s life. In order to do so, the ADA suggests you pay attention to your diet and exercise, measure blood glucose levels often, and stay on top of your insulin schedule.\n\nSource: Strauss S, Rosedale M, Pesce M, Rindskopf D, Kaur N, Juterbock C. \u201cThe Potential for Glycemic Control Monitoring and Screening for Diabetes at Dental Visits Using Oral Blood.\u201d American Journal of Public Health, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diabetes diagnosis, oral blood diabetes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Going to your regular teeth cleaning may soon also provide people with a chance to see if they\u2019re at risk of developing diabetes, according to a new study.", "title": "A Set Of Bleeding Gums To Diagnose Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bleeding-gums-may-reveal-diabetes-how-oral-blood-signals-unhealthy-blood-glucose-323794", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/27/dentist.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Going to your regular teeth cleaning may soon also provide people with a chance to see if they\u2019re at risk of developing diabetes, according to a new study.", "title": "A Set Of Bleeding Gums To Diagnose Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bleeding-gums-may-reveal-diabetes-how-oral-blood-signals-unhealthy-blood-glucose-323794", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/27/dentist.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/27/dentist.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-02-27T12:09:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T12:09:35-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Going to your regular teeth cleaning may soon also provide people with a chance to see if they\u2019re at risk of developing diabetes, according to a new study."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd75\"", "article_summary": "For diabetes patients, keeping normal blood glucose levels \u201ccan be a lifesaver,\u201d the American Diabetes Association states.\nIn order to do so, the ADA suggests you pay attention to your diet and exercise, measure blood glucose levels often, and stay on top of your insulin schedule.\nBlood tests can show whether a person has high levels of blood glucose, which can be a sign of diabetes as well as pre-diabetes.\nMaintaining lower glucose levels can lengthen a diabetic\u2019s life.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, the authors performed HbA1c testing on dried blood samples from gingival crevicular blood, and compared them with \u201cgold-standard\u201d HbA1c tests with dried finger-stick blood samples from NYC dental clinic patients."}
