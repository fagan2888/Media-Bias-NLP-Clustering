It was adapted by Gleason Bauer and Square Product\u2019s artistic director, Emily K. Harrison.\n\nAs director and scenic designer, Bauer has created a set that evokes the detritus of disaster, the hording aesthetic of many a shotgun shack backyard as well as the tools of theater\u2019s trade.\n\nMake no mistake, \u201cSlab\u201d not only addresses the toll of natural disaster on memory but also takes on the possibility of theater, be it found in carnival sideshows, a psychic\u2019s tent or at a strip joint.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing about the theater is that it never begins,\u201d states the Narrator, played by actress Hadley Mays, wearing a black stove-pipe hat and black hoop skirt.\n\nAnd like many a bemused carnival barker or vaudevillian emcee, she surveys a world enticing and dark, a little chaotic.\n\nOnce Tiger is introduced, the narrative pathway gets vaguely clearer. Placards the Narrator totes across the stage help orient us to the play\u2019s episodic rhythms: \u201cTiger Gets Her Name,\u201d \u201cTiger and the Glass-Eyed Doll,\u201d and \u201cTiger Hears a Who,\u201d to name a few.\n\nThe actors give compellingly physical turns. Harrison has a dancer\u2019s sense of space and flesh. A good thing, perhaps, since Tiger was once a stripper.\n\nMark Collins commands as the Preacher. Standing on a pier sermonizing to dead pelicans, he moves with a minister\u2019s pent-up, then explosive, energy. Cage Sebastian Pierre brings a sly ease that is seductive or playful or both to the part of Tiger\u2019s man, Champ. Lauren Dennis and Paige Larson add to the mix, playing Harriet and Mother/Barbara Walters respectively.\n\nVideo designer Christina Battle, lighting designer Jess Buttery and sound designers Janet Feder and Paul Fowler each contributed texture to this dense, poetic work.\n\nWhen last we saw Square Product, the Boulder-based outfit had joined forces with Denver\u2019s Buntport Theater Company to recount the story (stories, really) of Texas bankrobber Peggy Jo Tallas in \u201cPeggy Jo and the Desolate Nothing.\u201d\n\nFour years in the making, \u201cSlab\u201d is more ambitious and far more inscrutable. As it matures in performance some of its points \u2014 elegiac and ecstactic \u2014 are sure to sharpen.\n\nEarly in \u201cSlab,\u201d psychic Madam Surget tells a seeking Harriet \u201cThis is how card reading was taught in the old days. By a poetry of disarray.\u201d For the moment, that is not a bad description of this demanding, haunting production.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\n\u201cSLAB.\u201d Drama. 3 stars.
