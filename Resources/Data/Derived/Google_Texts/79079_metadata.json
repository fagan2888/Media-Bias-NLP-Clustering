But he said he could be helpful in some parts of some states.\u201d\n\nOf the 53 Democratic senators, it\u2019s the nearly two dozen facing re-election this year who are causing jitters for Obama and the party. With control of the Senate at stake, many of those Democrats are actively seeking ways to distance themselves from a president who is deeply unpopular in their home states.\n\nWith prospects for capturing the House this year in doubt, Democrats have intensified their focus on the Senate, where their tenuous majority will be toppled in November if they lose more than five seats \u2013 out of 21 they are defending. Although Obama has had to rein in aspirations for ambitious second-term legislation due to Republican control of the House, his final years in office would be even more constrained were Democrats to lose the Senate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the head of his party. Of course it\u2019s on his mind. But it is far from the only thing on his mind,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. \u201cWhat is principally on his mind is the opportunity available to us and available to him to advance an agenda that expands opportunity and rewards hard work.\u201d\n\nSensitive to the fact that many of Democrats\u2019 toughest races this year are in conservative-leaning states that voted against Obama in 2012, the White House and Democratic leadership so far have given wide latitude to Democrats who have publicized their disagreements with Obama. But the criticism also serves as a nagging reminder that Obama\u2019s ability to aid fellow Democrats this year is limited.\n\n\u201cI want him up in Alaska so I can show him where his policies haven\u2019t worked,\u201d Sen. Mark Begich said ahead of the meeting. \u201cI\u2019ll drag him up there to show him what he needs to be doing. I don\u2019t need him campaigning for me.\u201d\n\nThe Alaska Democrat\u2019s re-election race is one of the toughest for Democrats this year.\n\nObama was also joined at the issues conference by former President Bill Clinton.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
