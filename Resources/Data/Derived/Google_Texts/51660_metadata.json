In 2012, we saw utilization start to change health care trends for prescription drugs and professional procedures. Preliminary evidence suggests this may be indicative of a larger shift in care as people search for lower cost care alternatives.\u201d\n\nSeveral medications came off patent during the past couple years and as a result became available as generic drugs, noted Carolina-Nicole Herrera, the institute's director of research. The shift to generics may also be due to people on high-deductible insurance plans selecting cheaper medications. Herrera also cited some cardiovascular drugs that recently came off patent.\n\n\"It also means many more people are at least purchasing their medications,\" Herrera told USA Today, suggesting that people are actually taking the medications being prescribed by a doctor, instead of delaying treatment because of costs. \"That could mean long-term costs might be less.\"\n\nThe HCCI director added that some of the spending increase is a result of more people gaining access to care. Herrera said the increase in preventive health care visits and the use of generic drugs point to lower overall costs.\n\nIn an interview with Forbes, Herrera said the cost of inpatient care, largely in hospitals, has decreased due to more procedures being done in clinics, health centers and other outpatient facilities.\n\n\u201cPeople are trying to avoid going to hospitals because that is where we see our sickest patients,\u201d she told Forbes. \u201c(Hospitals are) where care is most expensive. We are seeing a rise in visits to primary care providers.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is designed to encourage patients to use primary care providers as well as wellness services in lieu of hospitals.\n\nSome observers have noted changes in the private sector that could account for the slowed rate of healthcare spending. For example, some employers have increase plan deductibles, co-payments and other forms of co-insurance \u2013 forcing patient to spend more out-of-pocket.\n\nThe HCCI report also found a widening gap between women\u2019s and men\u2019s healthcare expenses. Although women traditionally spend more on healthcare than men, they saw a 4.2 percent increase from 2011 to 2012 \u2013 compared to a 3.7 percent increase for men.\n\nThe report also noted that healthcare spending from young adults grew the fastest \u2013 with a 5.4 percent increase for young adults between 19 and 25 compared to a 2.5 percent increase for adults 55 to 64.", "article_metadata": {"author": "redOrbit", "og": {"site_name": "Redorbit", "description": "A new study showed that out-of-pocket healthcare expenses rose more rapidly than total expenditures per person in 2012.", "title": "Out-Of-Pocket Healthcare Spending On The Rise - Redorbit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.redorbit.com/media/uploads/2013/09/healthcare-and-money_TS_121277693_092413.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-04T10:12:37+00:00", "url": "http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1112956089/out-of-pocket-healthcare-spending-on-the-rise-092413/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Redorbit", "description": "A new study showed that out-of-pocket healthcare expenses rose more rapidly than total expenditures per person in 2012.", "title": "Out-Of-Pocket Healthcare Spending On The Rise - Redorbit", "image": {"src": "http://www.redorbit.com/media/uploads/2013/09/healthcare-and-money_TS_121277693_092413.jpg"}, "creator": "@redorbit", "site": "@redorbit", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedOrbitDotCom", "section": "Featured", "published_time": "2013-09-24T11:22:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-04T10:12:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "H0n_gqVTbBRtIV06tup3EkFqf1YrUgQZpMjsayDdsUg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7f8\"", "article_summary": "Out-Of-Pocket Healthcare Spending On The Riseby Brett Smith for redOrbit.com - Your Universe OnlineBrett Smith for redOrbit.com - Your Universe OnlineIf out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare seem like they are cutting into your wallet more than ever, it\u2019s probably because they are.\nSome observers have noted changes in the private sector that could account for the slowed rate of healthcare spending.\nThe HCCI director added that some of the spending increase is a result of more people gaining access to care.\nThe HCCI report also found a widening gap between women\u2019s and men\u2019s healthcare expenses.\n\u201cIn prior years, rising health care prices drove up spending."}
