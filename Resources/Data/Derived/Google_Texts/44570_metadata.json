Banich still owns Colorado\u2019s big-school state meet mark in the shot put (66 feet, 3\u00bc inches in 1982).\n\nWith the 12-pound shot put, he recorded 68-2\u00bd at the prestigious Golden West meet in Sacramento, Calif., and his 56-3\u00bc effort with the 16-pound shot in a preseason meet at the Air Force Academy set a national record. He also went 202-1 in the discus. His marks were passed by Buena Vista\u2019s Mason Finley, but it took 27 years.\n\nJeff Wasinger, who led Arvada track for three decades, had an earlier taste of Banich, who broke his junior high discus mark.\n\n\u201cIn a seventh-grade PE class,\u201d Wasinger said.\n\nAlso an avid track-club participant and an all-state goalie in soccer, Banich, a three-time prep All-American, eventually grew to 6-4, 230. But he was a lot thinner in high school and not necessarily that strong.\n\n\u201cHe could only bench press 185 pounds,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cHe was all about technique.\u201d\n\nBanich went to UCLA, where he\u2019s still among career leaders. By 1987, Banich was a member of the Bruins\u2019 NCAA outdoor championship team. The All-American finished second in the shot put and fourth in the discus.\n\n\u201cThere just wasn\u2019t anything he couldn\u2019t do,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cYou could have taken him in any sport, whether he was the soccer goalie, in track \u2026 he could have been a good golfer, good in skiing \u2026 he could have done any of them. Not a lot of kids have that kind of natural ability. He was so cerebral. He could visualize a lot of things.\u201d\n\nBanich recently taught at his alma mater before joining Arvada West this year.\n\nHe\u2019s gone, not forgotten.\n\n\u201cJim meant to the city of Arvada what John Elway meant to Denver. That\u2019s how powerfully I think of him,\u201d Wasinger said.\n\nNeil H.
