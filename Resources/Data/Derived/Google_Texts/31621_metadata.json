Along with synchronized excavators and a review of the latest earth-moving equipment, the parades also provided entertainment.\n\nSome of the entertaining was provided by Ken Gerber, a Caterpillar employee from 1955 to 1990 who played both Toby the Clown and Alexander Botts, the erstwhile tractor salesman, a character made famous by Joe E. Brown in the 1936 film, \u201cEarthworm Tractors.\u201d\n\nAs for Dr. Dirt, that was Bill Nelan, who, as a Caterpillar employee, earned the nickname by directing big-machine traffic behind the scenes at the power parades.\n\nGerber, 82, and Nelan, 76, traded stories at the visitors center in front of images from parades held in 1964, 1973, 1978, 1988 and 2000.\n\nNelan\u2019s son, Mark, 55, who attended several of the parades, still recalls Gerber\u2019s performances.\n\n\u201cHe was really funny,\u201d said the younger Nelan.\n\nGerber and others who participated in the programs also were really busy. The power parade schedule called for multiple shows \u2014 as many as 28 one-hour shows usually held during August \u2014 that involved hundreds of Caterpillar employees, said Ed Smith, Caterpillar\u2019s global brand manager who organized the last power parade in 2000.\n\nAs many as 100,000 people would attend shows during the course of the month, with the last four parades held at Caterpillar\u2019s demonstration facility in Edwards, said center manager Kathryn Spitznagle.\n\n\u201cThe parades helped forge a connection between the employees and the company. It was a chance to show what workers had done as well as demonstrate new products to employees,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than two dozen artifacts from past parades are on display along with photographs and videos in an exhibit that will be on display through Oct. 2, said Spitznagle, who spoke of her own memories of participating in a power parade as a Caterpillar employee \u2014 selling cotton candy to visitors.\n\nGerber, who serves as a docent at the center, offered more power-parade background.\n\n\u201cFred Dooley, a past manager of the Edwards facility, served as narrator for a number of shows. He had a voice that sounded like John Wayne\u2019s,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRon Little, a Caterpillar employee who had been the football coach at Limestone (Community) High School, was the first Toby the Clown.\u201d\n\nThen it was Gerber\u2019s turn to play the clown.\n\n\u201cI figured I did 61 shows at Toby and 72 as Botts,\u201d he said.\n\nSteve Tarter is Journal Star business editor.
