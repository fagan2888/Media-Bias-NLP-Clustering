Deep in the heart of Texas, they\u2019ve found a new anti-gay hero.\n\nOne Ted Cruz has emerged as the most stridently homophobic of the GOP\u2019s 2016 contenders. Of course, it\u2019s not as if his positions on LGBT issues are all that different from any other likely GOP contender. But the Scott Walkers and Jeb Bushes of the party prefer to keep quiet about their conservative social views, lest they alienate swing voters. (Although it\u2019s worth noting that Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who came out for marriage equality after learning his son is gay, is reportedly considering a bid. He would lose.) Cruz, by contrast, is out and proud with his anti-gay views, and by repeatedly inserting himself into anti-gay firestorms, he\u2019s showing every sign that bigoted demagoguery will be central to a Cruz 2016 campaign.\n\nThe most consequential moment of Cruz\u2019s nascent Senate career is, no doubt, the government shutdown he triggered last year over Obamacare. But he has also introduced among the most odious pieces of anti-gay legislation since the Defense of Marriage Act. Earlier this year, Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee introduced a bill that would preserve the rights of states to ban marriage equality and to refuse recognition of same-sex unions performed in other states. Because the bill would have sanctioned a patchwork of state laws on marriage equality and jeopardized same-sex couples\u2019 rights as they traveled from state to state, LGBT advocates nicknamed the legislation the \u201c\u2019You\u2019re Not Married Anymore\u2019 Bill.\u201d\n\nThat bill stood approximately as much chance of becoming law as legislation making Che Guevara\u2019s birthday a national holiday. Beyond introducing hopeless bills, however, Cruz has served up no shortage of bombastic anti-gay rhetoric. Cruz was among the first GOP politicians to rush to the defense of Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson after he made crude anti-gay remarks in an interview with GQ magazine. Commenting on the controversy, Cruz wrote on his Facebook page, \u201cThe reason that so many Americans love Duck Dynasty is because it represents the America usually ignored or mocked by liberal elites: a family that loves and cares for each other, believes in God, and speaks openly about their faith.\u201d\n\nThose liberal elites, at it again \u2013 deigning to mock a down-home reality show star for speaking openly about his faith by equating gay people with terrorists and goat fuckers.\n\nMore recently, we saw Cruz going ballistic in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last week to let stand a series of lower court rulings in favor of marriage equality. Calling the decision \u201ctragic and indefensible\u201d and \u201cjudicial activism at its worst,\u201d Cruz vowed to introduce a constitutional amendment \u201cto prevent the federal government or the courts from attacking or striking down state marriage laws.\u201d It\u2019s precisely the kind of debate the GOP, increasingly out of step with public opinion on LGBT equality, wants to avoid. But Cruz is determined to have it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Tea Party hero lashes out at marriage equality and Houston's gay mayor.
