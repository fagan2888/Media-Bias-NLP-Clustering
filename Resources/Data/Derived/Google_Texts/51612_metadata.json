They already face a time crunch and a broader battle over the annual appropriations bills.\n\nDemocrats have blocked Senate action on those, arguing that spending shouldn\u2019t be capped at the levels mandated in the the Budget Control Act, Public Law 112-25.\n\nUsing reconciliation as the vehicle would force a Senate vote on the Planned Parenthood issue, which so far Democrats have blocked. The leaders could combine Planned Parenthood provisions with language repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act into a package that, under reconciliation procedures, would require only a simple majority of members.\n\nThe combination of the Obamacare and Planned Parenthood provisions would be attractive to many rank-and-file Republicans. Passage would be all but guaranteed -- as would a veto by President Barack Obama.\n\nVideos Outcry\n\nThe clamor for defunding Planned Parenthood grew after the release of videos purporting to show the organization\u2019s doctors discussing harvesting fetal tissue for research, with activists posing as representatives of a medical research company.\n\nThe House and Senate aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that using reconciliation to deal with Planned Parenthood was still an option being studied. No decision is likely until after members discuss it next month, they said.\n\nBecause there isn\u2019t enough time to deal with both reconciliation and the stopgap spending bill in September, leaders might offer a public statement committing to using reconciliation to defund Planned Parenthood this year, one aide said. If rank-and-file Republicans accept such an assurance, the leaders would be able to focus on other aspects of their negotiations with the White House.\n\nMedicaid Reimbursements\n\nPlanned Parenthood denies that the organization is illegally selling fetal tissue for a profit, saying it provides such tissue at the cost of harvesting and delivering it. The group has said the majority of its funding -- $528 million in 2013 -- comes from Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nSupporters of Planned Parenthood argue that abortions constitute only a small percentage of its activities and that the organization and its affiliates are a major provider of women\u2019s health services, including contraception and breast cancer screening, for indigent women.\n\nOne possible option would be to repeal the Obamacare mandates that individuals purchase health insurance, either with government-subsidized exchanges, or on the private market. Some of the savings could be used to increase government assistance to community health centers, public hospitals and other certified providers to replace Planned Parenthood\u2019s role as a provider of women\u2019s health services, one aide said.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the individual mandate would produce net savings of $282 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a 2012 presentation to the Rand Corp.\n\nBloomberg Philanthropies provides financial support for Planned Parenthood.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "James Rowley", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/planned-parenthood-restrictions-could-be-kept-off-funding-bill", "title": "Planned Parenthood Ban Could Be Kept Off U.S. Funding Bill", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "description": "Republican leaders in Congress are considering a pledge to hold a separate vote on defunding Planned Parenthood as a way to keep the issue from derailing legislation to keep the government running, said congressional aides with knowledge of the discussions."}, "parsely-author": "James Rowley", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Democrats,Congress,Planned Parenthood", "news_keywords": "Democrats,Congress,Planned Parenthood", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/planned-parenthood-restrictions-could-be-kept-off-funding-bill", "parsely-title": "Planned Parenthood Ban Could Be Kept Off U.S. Funding Bill", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-27T17:31:42.786Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Republican leaders in Congress are considering a pledge to hold a separate vote on defunding Planned Parenthood as a way to keep the issue from derailing legislation to keep the government running, said congressional aides with knowledge of the discussions.", "parsely-tags": "Democrats,Congress,Planned Parenthood,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-08-27T17:31:42.786Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/planned-parenthood-restrictions-could-be-kept-off-funding-bill", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Republican leaders in Congress are considering a pledge to hold a separate vote on defunding Planned Parenthood as a way to keep the issue from derailing legislation to keep the government running, said congressional aides with knowledge of the discussions.", "title": "Planned Parenthood Ban Could Be Kept Off U.S. Funding Bill"}, "fb": {"status": "Republican leaders in Congress are considering a pledge to hold a separate vote on defunding Planned Parenthood as a way to keep the issue from derailing legislation to keep the government running, said congressional aides with knowledge of the discussions."}, "parsely-post-id": "NTR02PSYF01U01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7e5\"", "article_summary": "Using reconciliation as the vehicle would force a Senate vote on the Planned Parenthood issue, which so far Democrats have blocked.\nThe combination of the Obamacare and Planned Parenthood provisions would be attractive to many rank-and-file Republicans.\nIn private discussions, the leaders are looking at using reconciliation procedures to let a Planned Parenthood bill come up for a filibuster-proof Senate vote, the aides said.\nThe House and Senate aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that using reconciliation to deal with Planned Parenthood was still an option being studied.\nSome Republican presidential candidates, including Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, have demanded that legislation to fund federal agencies after Sept. 30 include a provision barring abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood from receiving federal money."}
