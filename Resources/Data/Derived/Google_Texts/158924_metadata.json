Where we rank:\n\nDeaths related to opioid pharmaceuticals by California county, age-adjusted (per 100,000), 2009-13:\n\nRank County Rate\n\n1 Plumas 23.8\n\n2 Lake 22.5\n\n3 Lassen 17.4\n\n4 Humboldt 13.7\n\n5 Shasta 11.9\n\n14 Butte 6.4\n\n23 Sacramento 4.2\n\nSource: California Department of Public Health\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJust before Christmas, sobering statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention drove home the pervasiveness\u2014and toll\u2014of prescription-drug addiction.\n\nDrawing national headlines such as \u201cDrug overdose deaths reach all-time high\u201d (as trumpeted by CNN), the CDC revealed that 47,055 Americans died from drug overdoses the previous year. That represented a jump of 14 percent from 2013 and the highest total since at least 1970.\n\nIn the majority of those deaths (61 percent of cases), opioids, which include many painkillers, were involved. It doesn\u2019t take much, says local pharmacy owner Janet Balbutin. \u201cBill Clinton was on TV with [CNN\u2019s Dr. Sanjay] Gupta pleading to all the providers because he had lost a friend who had just one beer and one OxyContin and didn\u2019t wake up in the morning.\u201dAnd yet, she added, \u201cthe impact on the [hospital] ERs around the country has been so great because of these drugs.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has attempted to stem the stream of prescription opioids by tightening regulation of the prescriptions themselves.\n\nPhysicians face greater scrutiny when prescribing these medications, and pharmacists must follow additional procedures when dispensing them. \u201cThere has been a clampdown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Bishop of Argyll Medical Group in Chico. \u201cBut there has also been a change in clinical practice. It\u2019s now considered less acceptable to prescribe high doses of narcotics over a long period of time, so there is pressure from government, from insurers, from pharmacists to cut down on the prescribing.\u201d\n\nBoth physicians and pharmacists have safeguards\u2014including a bit of technology befitting the Oval Office\u2014to secure their information exchange. Indeed, high-tech security plays a major part in overdose death prevention, and Butte County is on the leading edge.\n\nUntil recently, the DEA did not allow physicians to send electronic prescriptions for certain controlled medications, even as federal government\u2014through the Affordable Care Act\u2014pushed medical offices and hospitals to digitize. Moreover, the DEA reclassified that list of controlled drugs (known as Schedule II) to include lower-concentrated opioids such as Norco.\n\nThe American Medical Association balked at the contradiction of paper prescriptions in a paperless age, so the DEA approved technology called two-factor authentication, which physicians in certain areas, including Chico, have given a trial run. It goes nationwide this year.\n\nTwo-factor identification means the doctor not only has to provide a log-in and password to access a prescription, but also must possess a special electronic device that generates a random number recognized by his or her computer as authentic. The device resembles a USB flash drive.\n\nThe prescription then gets transmitted to the pharmacy.\n\nBishop appreciates the added layer of security at his practice, describing it as \u201calmost a military level of technology\u201d like the president\u2019s missile-launch encoder, \u201calthough I think the biggest safeguard is not being able to phone [opioid prescriptions] in. When I came to this country in 1996 [from Scotland], I was astonished that you could telephone in an order for a Schedule II narcotic.\u201d\n\nPeople still try, though. Balbutin says her pharmacies get bogus prescription calls regularly, though mostly for drugs on lower tiers of the DEA\u2019s control list.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cfine balance\u201d for Bishop and other physicians who prescribe pain medication.\n\n\u201cDoctors feel like we\u2019ve been put in a very difficult situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to relieve pain, but if we use too many narcotics, we can be punished \u2026. I do refer to pain management specialists if the patient\u2019s needs are more than I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\n\nPunishment can mean losing a medical license. The California Medical Board reports it has stripped the licenses of three doctors in Butte County for overprescribing.\n\nBishop said the goal is to ensure that \u201cmainstream physicians\u201d have controls in place, such as seeing patients regularly and monitoring their medications. A state database known as CURES (Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System) helps doctors and pharmacists check on patients\u2019 prescriptions to make sure they haven\u2019t gotten the same script from another doctor, thereby \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d and having a large amount of pills on hand.\n\nBalbutin has been a pharmacist since 1968 and operates the family-owned Chico Pharmacy, Chico Medical Supply & Ostomy and Paradise Drug and Medical Supply. She recalls the era before the recent federal efforts, when \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d and the ready ability to pay for painkillers led one customer to bring an order for 2,300 pills.\n\n\u201cNo way you could take that much in a month,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they were able to get a prescription, and Medi-Cal was paying for it, or they paid cash. Now we can\u2019t let them pay cash like that without a whole bunch of hoops; we can\u2019t even dispense that much anymore. Three years ago, we were [able to].\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an all-out effort by the DEA to reduce all this fraud, waste, abuse.\u201d\n\nThen, of course, come the people who attempt to steal opioids. Two nights before Christmas Eve, a man held up the pharmacy counter at the Walgreens on East Avenue for a \u201cbig bottle\u201d of oxycodone, not cash. Balbutin said her drugstores have been broken into 15 times since 1993\u2014most recently in December, prompting her to install bars on the glass doors and windows.\n\nNeither she nor Bishop attribute these crimes to tighter controls, even if the rules have made it tougher for pills to hit the black market.\n\nNor is this an isolated issue. According to CDC statistics from 2014, California had the highest number of overdose deaths with 4,500; however, when adjusting for population size, the states with the highest rates were West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio.\n\nDeaths from natural opiates (e.g., morphine and codeine) increased 10 percent from 2013, synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl) 80 percent.\n\nIn that context, the added scrutiny of pharmacists and physicians is particularly significant.\n\n\u201cIt is a nuisance,\u201d Balbutin said, \u201cbut it\u2019s necessary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Evan Tuchinsky.
