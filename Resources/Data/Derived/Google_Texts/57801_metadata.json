But he warns parents about being too overprotective.\n\n\u201cWe want to enable children to have relatively normal lives and not make them feel like they\u2019re different or unable to participate in activities around the holidays,\" Ledford said.\n\nThe Teal Pumpkin project doesn\u2019t discourage handing out candy, but encourages non-edible items as another option.\n\n\u201cIt is a night for kids to have fun and nobody wants to end up in the emergency room,\u201d VanHorn said.\n\nAnd, she added, \u201cNobody wants to take away from other kids eating candy and peanuts, too. It\u2019s about everyone having a great time.\u201d\n\nLook for participating households or add yours:\n\nIdeas for Non-Food Treats", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Halloween can be a nightmare for parents of children with food allergies.
