A Topeka man is accused of attempted murder after allegedly firing from a moving vehicle at drivers in southern Jackson Co. Wednesday evening.

Cory Huff allegedly fired at vehicles that were heading north on US Hwy 75 near the 94th Street intersection, along the Jackson and Shawnee Co. border, around 5:00 p.m., according to Jackson Co. Sheriff Tim Morse.

The 51 year-old was captured in northern Shawnee Co. later that evening with the help of the Shawnee Co. Sheriff's Office, added Morse.

He is being held in the Jackson Co. Jail.

Sheriff Morse did not say why Huff was allegedly firing at other cars.
