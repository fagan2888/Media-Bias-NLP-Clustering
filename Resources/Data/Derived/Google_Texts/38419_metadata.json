He proposed sending cadres of \u201celite fighters who would be well-paid, well-trained to defeat terrorists all over the world.\u201d\n\nWho would constitute that proposed mercenary army of 25,000? Where would they come from?\n\nRelated: How ISIS Terrorists Forced Obama Out of Retirement\n\nThe idea of outsourcing such a force appealed to a Vietnam vet who knew that I had taught in a medium security prison in Connecticut and in a maximum security prison in New York State. He figures that prison inmates could be recruited to form teams of \u201cexpendables\u201d (detachments replicating \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d) who would be grateful for a strings attached get-of-jail card:\n\n\u201cSend our killers over there to kill their killers.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome again,\u201d I replied as his words began to drop onto the Tetris board of my mind; his words dropped into place like the Tetriminos, forming sentences that shaped his Bill O\u2019Reilly-inspired game plan:\n\n\u201cAll those guys on death row, all those lifers with no chance of parole, all those in for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon--put them on a transport to Syria or Iraq or Yemen; point them in the direction of ISIS, then arm them and let \u2019em do what\u2019s in their nature. Exploit their talents.\u201d\n\nWarming to the idea, he continued: \u201cArm Syrian rebels? Who the h*** are they. Can\u2019t begin to know their loyalties. They\u2019re as likely to turn the weapons on us. That money should go to our own bad guys \u2013 with incentive payments.\n\nRelated: The New Terror Group Khorasan Is Plotting a 9/11 Attack\n\nWell, he got me to thinking. He got me to go back to notes I took in several of those in-prison classes in which inmate-students were encouraged to prepare talking points they would deliver to military recruiters, parole boards, and members of Congress; reasoned pitches to those who might be disposed to authorizing moral waivers. Here are some of the statements I took down from those inmate presentations:\n\nFor a second chance, I am willing to pay with my life.\n\nThat was from an eight-year Army vet \u2013 who was at risk of becoming a prison vet. During his August 1986 - July 1994 tour of duty, he was a supply clerk and record-keeper for a unit armorer group; he kept track M16 rifles, M60 machine guns, grenade launchers, and 9-millimeter pistols. He was in charge of caring for and dispensing nuclear-biological-chemical masks, suits, and gear. He also served as a driver for his company commander and was trained as an instructor for the employment of claymore mines.\n\nAll that training and expertise are going to waste, as he bides his time doing a \u201cbid\u201d in prison.\n\nYes, he got into drugs and dealing. Yes, he made bad decisions. But his service record, he claims, is clear. Does he pay his debt to society by being inactive? Does he rehabilitate himself by being inert? Shouldn\u2019t there be a kind of \u201cdebt service\u201d he can discharge by being useful?\n\nThere are, of course, serious challenges to overcome.\n\nRelated: Why We Won\u2019t Have Enough Money to Fight ISIS\n\nThe price tag: The cost of the program would look to state prisons \u2013 most of which are extremely overcrowded and, for budgetary reasons, would be pleased to be relieved of housing, feeding, medicating, and caring for hundreds of inmates; maybe a few thousand. The state savings, combined with investment from the Department of Defense for training, housing and other expenses, could theoretically work.\n\nThe trust factor: Given that a single Minnesota mosque seems to have been an indoctrination center for converts to Islamic jihadism, our prisons (with thousands of Muslim adherents) might well be prime territory for recruitment to jihad.\n\nThe Army\u2019s screening is not flawless: The jihadist rants and writings of Nidal Malik Hasan didn\u2019t prevent him from attaining the rank of major, or from fatally shooting 13 and injuring 30 others at Fort Hood.\n\nThe recent beheading in Oklahoma City was done by a jihadi-wannabe who converted to Islam while in prison.\n\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)\n\nSince even a privately-funded mercenary operation would have to rely on U. S. intelligence and coordination, declining to consider Muslim applicants wouldn\u2019t be right and wouldn\u2019t fly with the DOJ civil rights division.\n\nAs to selecting among the thousands of volunteers, there are terrorism experts within the Department of Homeland Security who could make the call.\n\nThe incarcerated vet \u2013 the convicted felon who has done some time in the armed services \u2013 may be \u201ca last resort\u201d for military recruiters. Given the opportunity, some of these vets are willing to live, and die, with that relegation.\n\nRaising an army, by lowering some standards?\n\nIn hand-scrawled notes for a Communications course \u201cspeech,\u201d the inmate described above claimed that he had heard that the military was slackening its age and weight requirements, was seeking out high-school dropouts, was finding uses for people whose aptitude-test-scores were below formerly required levels, and was even accepting those with medical problems that had been disqualifiers.\n\nRelated: Why the War Against ISIS Could Be Doomed to Fail\n\nIf the military needs fresh bodies \u2013 is desperate for \u201cfront-line meat\u201d \u2013 he is inclined. To those who find it morally repugnant or just plain risky to recruit from prison populations, he offered what could, these days, equate to a coalition of the willing:\n\nWhere does anyone who doesn\u2019t choose to serve, or have their family members serve, get to disqualify me because I made prisonable mistakes. Everybody\u2019s got some bad in their past. Why shouldn\u2019t I get the chance to fight for my country? I would step up when so many others won\u2019t or can\u2019t.\n\nThe military can handle its own. An ex-con would be no different from any other recruit. He\u2019d have to shape up or ship out.\n\nGuys like me are the best insurance against an involuntary draft.\n\nTo critics of moral waivers, another inmate \u2013 a three-year vet from the 1980s (infantry, small-arms specialist, Delta Company, Fort Hood, Texas) \u2013 argues that \u201ccons\u201d could do the dirty work and \u201cthe knucklehead stuff.\u201d He thinks in terms of future job-applications \u2013 of having a Department of Defense ID number to offset his Department of Corrections number:\n\nIt would give us a chance to come back with something reputable on our resumes.\n\nMy old unit is making its way to Afghanistan. I wish I could be with them.\n\nStill another Army vet, also in prison, explained:\n\nGoing back in the Army wouldn\u2019t wipe out my criminal history but it would give something my kids that I can\u2019t give them in prison. Here\n\nI have nothing to offer them. I wouldn\u2019t be fighting for the Obama Administration or the Bush Administration, or any political party,\n\nI\u2019d be fighting for a new life. I\u2019d do my best to come back alive, but if I didn\u2019t \u2013 well, there\u2019d be death, I mean, life insurance.\n\nI\u2019d go today.\n\n\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If the country needs boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria to fight ISIS, the state prisons could provide a willing volunteer army.", "title": "Need Boots on the Ground to Fight ISIS?
