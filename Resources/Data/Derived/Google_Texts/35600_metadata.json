However, the name of the business entity it used to purchase the land, Harbour Island Residential LLC, seems suggestive.\n\nForge Capital Partners is a real estate investment company that owns shopping centers around Florida and the Southeast, sometimes investing with Tampa-based DeBartolo Development. Forge Capital and DeBartolo also were among a group that bought the old Trump Tower Tampa site along the Hillsborough River in downtown Tampa two years ago.\n\nA deed recorded in Hillsborough County on Dec. 18 shows that Forge Capital\u2019s entity, Harbour Island Residential, bought a little less than an acre on Harbour Island for about $2.9 million. The land is just east of The Plaza Harbour Island condominium. The seller was an entity called Knights Harbour LLC, which is controlled by Tampa\u2019s Sierra family.\n\nSome Harbour Island residents have been watching for signs of development on the property, a bit nervous that any major project there would bring more traffic to the area. Their curiosity was piqued last month when a real estate broker for the Eshenbaugh Land Co. said an unnamed apartment developer had a contract on the land. The developer was planning a 22-story building with about 230 apartment units.\n\nAt that height, it would be a bit taller than the luxury Plaza condo tower next door.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear this week if Forge Capital Partners is the apartment developer mentioned by the real estate broker or if it has other plans for the property. While Forge Capital couldn\u2019t be reached, a member of the Sierra family that sold the land, Sebring Sierra, declined comment.\n\nGail Bernucca, president of The Plaza\u2019s condo association board, said she\u2019s not sure what say her condo board will have in the property\u2019s development, if any.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if it were a park,\u201d Bernucca said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t stop city hall. It\u2019s the market that will decide what\u2019s going to go there.\u201d\n\nIf Forge Capital does, in fact, plan an apartment building there it would be another in a line of luxury apartment projects in or around downtown Tampa. Luxury apartments under construction or planned for the downtown area include the Residences at the Riverwalk near the Straz Center, The Martin on Meridian Avenue, SkyHouse Channelside in the Channel District and Circle Bayshore on Bayshore Boulevard.\n\nmsasso@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7865\n\nTwitter: @msasso", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 17:18:18 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 A Tampa investment firm has purchased one of the last pieces of vacant land on Harbour Island, a parcel that developers have been eyeing for an apartment tower.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A Tampa investment firm has purchased one of the last pieces of vacant land on Harbour Island, a parcel that developers have been eyeing for an apartment tower.", "title": "Potential Harbour Island apartment land acquired by Tampa investor", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/business/potential-harbour-island-apartment-land-acquired-by-tampa-investor-20131224/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2013-12-25T14:47:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Potential Harbour Island apartment land acquired by Tampa investor"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-24T17:18:18Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-25T14:47:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "forge capital partners,harbour island residential"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf45\"", "article_summary": "However, the name of the business entity it used to purchase the land, Harbour Island Residential LLC, seems suggestive.\nA deed recorded in Hillsborough County on Dec. 18 shows that Forge Capital\u2019s entity, Harbour Island Residential, bought a little less than an acre on Harbour Island for about $2.9 million.\nTAMPA \u2014 A Tampa investment firm has purchased one of the last pieces of vacant land on Harbour Island, a parcel that developers have been eyeing for an apartment tower.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear what Forge Capital Partners plans to do with the land, because its executives couldn\u2019t be reached for comment in recent days.\nThe land is just east of The Plaza Harbour Island condominium."}
