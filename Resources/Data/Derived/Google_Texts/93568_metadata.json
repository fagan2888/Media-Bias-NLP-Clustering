(Tony Gentile/POOL via Associated Press)\n\nA danger for all of us in the column business is that we\u2019ll look for political meaning in Pope Francis\u2019s big speeches and ignore what he does while he\u2019s here.\n\nYes, his words will matter, and Francis will have an enormous impact both on American politics and on politics inside a divided American Catholic Church.\n\nProgressives will highlight everything the pope says about climate change, immigration, social justice and capitalism. Conservatives will grab on to every statement he makes against abortion. Both sides will look for how he describes \u201creligious liberty.\u201d Will he talk about the fight over contraception coverage in the Affordable Care Act (as conservatives hope), or will he concentrate on the persecution of religious minorities, including Christians, around the globe?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how progressives don\u2019t come out ahead, simply because the pope has radically reordered the priorities of the church. He is not fighting culture wars. He is fighting against them. This, in part, is what accounts for his broad popularity among former Catholics, Americans of other faiths and even secularists and atheists.\n\nSomeone speaking in Spanish \u2014 the language of most of the pope\u2019s coming addresses \u2014 about justice, poverty, a warming planet and the imperative of welcoming immigrants would not have gotten a warm reception at the Republicans\u2019 presidential debate last week.\n\nFrancis\u2019s searing words about the injustices that capitalism leaves in its wake have led many conservatives to denounce him as a Marxist. One imagines more uncomfortable moments for those who don\u2019t like anyone to point out imperfections of the market system.\n\nBut seeing Francis only as a player in our political fights is misleading. To begin with, he is \u2014 both spiritually and politically \u2014 far more radical than most Americans, including most liberals.\n\nWhile he has been quite specific on some political questions (the climate and immigration especially), what characterizes his mission is an effort to turn our notions of who counts and who has the strongest claim on our attention upside down.\n\nIn this sense, the conservatives are (but only partly) on to something when they talk about the pope and Marxism. The scholar Lewis Feuer once observed that the great achievement of Karl Marx was to put the working class at the center of history. Marx encouraged a bottom-up view in a world that tended to look at history from the standpoint of the victor, the wealthy and the powerful. One effect of Marxism\u2019s decline: The top-down perspective is resurgent.\n\nBut Marx\u2019s view could be seen as a secularized (and, in the eyes of many Christians, distorted) version of a Christian message that was directed from the outset to outcasts and the poor. Thus, as important as hearing Francis\u2019s words will be paying close attention to whom he chooses to visit while he\u2019s here. In his value system, the last really are first.\n\nIn a moving New York Times piece about one of the pope\u2019s planned stops in New York, columnist Jim Dwyer described the invitation list: \u201ccarwashers . . . Hudson Valley farmworkers, day-laborers, immigrant mothers, and teenagers and children who have crossed the border without their parents.\u201d In Philadelphia, Francis will visit the city\u2019s largest jail. In Washington, he will bless the needy who get help from Catholic Charities. His ministry will be right out of what the Catholic Mass says of Jesus: \u201cTo the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation, to prisoners freedom, and to those in sorrow joy.\u201d\n\nFrancis will be calling everyone (liberals no less than others) out of complacency. It seemed providential that the readings at Catholic Masses leading up to the pope\u2019s visit included these words from the letter of James: \u201cBe doers of the word and not hearers only,\u201d and \u201cfaith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\u201d\n\nPope Francis's tenure as leader of the Roman Catholic Church has included several notable announcements on everything from abortion to homosexuality. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)\n\nIf Francis inspires widespread Catholic guilt about our individual and collective failures to pay attention to those whom he\u2019s lifting up \u2014 well, isn\u2019t that part of his job description?\n\nLeaders of the church may feel some guilt, too, if he echoes what he once said during a trip to Brazil: \u201cAre we still a church capable of warming hearts?\u201d he asked. And he did not need a focus group to issue a call for \u201ca church which realizes that the reasons why people leave also contain reasons why they can eventually return.\u201d\n\nMy friend Father Tom Reese has observed that Francis \u201cpreaches the Gospel, not the catechism.\u201d That the Gospel is radical will take many people aback \u2014 and challenging our assumptions is what Francis is here to do.\n\nRead more from E.J.
