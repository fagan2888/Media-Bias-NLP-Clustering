An Asian elephant got into the Halloween spirit Saturday at the Denver Zoo.

Bodhi, a 10-year-old male, stomped a 400-pound pumpkin to a flat, pulpy mess.

The pumpkin, donated by hobbyist Brian Deevy, was no ordinary gourd. Zookeepers had stuffed it with plums, sweet potatoes, bananas, kiwis and some peanut butter and jelly, according to a zoo news release.

The traditional “Squish the Squash” show was held at the Toyota Elephant Passage’s McGrath Family Amphitheater.
