PAUL, Minn. \u2014 After a 7-2 rout of Boston University on Saturday in the West Regional semifinals of the NCAA hockey tournament, the Denver Pioneers are one win from advancing to the Frozen Four for the first time since their national champ- ionships in 2004 and 2005.\n\nJunior defenseman Will Butcher scored two goals, forwards Troy Terry, Quentin Shore and Danton Heinen each contributed three assists and goalie Tanner Jaillet made 19 saves for DU at the Xcel Energy Center.\n\nThe Pioneers (24-9-6) will meet No. 4 regional seed Ferris State (20-14-6) on Sunday at 3 p.m. MDT in the West championship game, with the winner going to Tampa, Fla., for the April 7-9 Frozen Four.\n\nThe Western Collegiate Hockey Association\u2019s Bulldogs, from Big Rapids, Mich., knocked off top-seeded St. Cloud State 5-4 in overtime in the first semifinal game Saturday.\n\nIn front of a sparse crowd for the second half of the one-ticket doubleheader \u2014 perhaps 1,500 were in the seats at the Minnesota Wild\u2019s arena \u2014 the Pioneers took a 4-0 lead in the first 23 minutes against BU and coasted.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that was shocking,\u201d Butcher, a 2013 Avalanche draft choice, said of the decisiveness of the score. \u201cI know our team\u2019s really good and when we play like that, we can score that many goals and put that many pucks in the net. That\u2019s just how we play with our pressure game, and our forwards were all over them tonight. When our forwards are going like that, our whole team is going.\u201d\n\nOne of the two DU players from Minnesota \u2014 defenseman Blake Hillman, who hails from Elk River \u2014 opened the scoring at 13:49 of the first period, knocking the rebound of Evan Janssen\u2019s shot past Terriers goalie Sean Maguire.\n\n\u201cThe first five to 10 minutes, I thought BU was the better team,\u201d said DU coach Jim Montgomery. \u201cI thought we were playing nervous. . . We started managing the puck well and we started playing our game. From then on, I thought offensively it was probably one of our best nights finishing odd-man rushes and I thought the power play (2 for 4) was excellent.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneers\u2019 Pacific Rim Line forechecked relentlessly in producing the goal that made it 2-0, and Heinen\u2019s pass set up Dylan Gambrell\u2019s crafty move and backhander for his 16th score of the season at 17:40.\n\nButcher put DU ahead 3-0 in the first minute of the second period, moving from the left point to his right and beating Maguire with a wrist shot.\n\n\u201cI thought Butchy\u2019s goal was a huge momentum swing,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cIt kind of put a knife in them for a little while and allowed us to keep our momentum and play fast.\u201d\n\nWhen Matt Marcinew\u2019s shot from the slot gave the Pioneers four goals in only 12 shots, BU coach David Quinn yanked Maguire and sent out Connor LaCouvee. Janssen, Butcher and Trevor Moore added goals the rest of the way in the laugher. Jaillet lost his shutout when Danny O\u2019Regan scored for the Terriers with 7:15 left and Mike Moran scored a consolation goal for the Terriers in the final seconds.\n\nBecause Ferris State won, that in theory made the Pioneers\u2019 road to the Frozen Four easier. St. Cloud State was 3-0 against DU this season, winning 5-2 and 6-2 in Denver in December and 4-2 in the semifinals of the NCHC\u2019s Frozen Faceoff in Minneapolis on March 18. The Pioneers have been a different team, though, since the start of the calendar year, and one of their early season losses was to BU, 5-4 in overtime, on Halloween. DU is 17-2-4 in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe had puck luck tonight,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cAnd when you get puck luck, you can beat a team that\u2019s been ranked No. 9 in the country, like BU has. But that being said. I think a big part of what we try and do every year here is trying to be peaking at the end of the year. I think throughout the three years I\u2019ve been here, our team has progressively gotten better each month, and it\u2019s after the month of December this year.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver hockey crushes Boston University in NCAA semifinals, on brink of Frozen Four berth", "title": "Denver hockey crushes Boston University in NCAA semifinals, on brink of Frozen Four berth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/denver-hockey-crushes-boston-university-in-ncaa-semifinals-on-brink-of-frozen-four-berth/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T19:16:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T19:16:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe first five to 10 minutes, I thought BU was the better team,\u201d said DU coach Jim Montgomery.\nBecause Ferris State won, that in theory made the Pioneers\u2019 road to the Frozen Four easier.\nThat\u2019s just how we play with our pressure game, and our forwards were all over them tonight.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that was shocking,\u201d Butcher, a 2013 Avalanche draft choice, said of the decisiveness of the score.\nThe Western Collegiate Hockey Association\u2019s Bulldogs, from Big Rapids, Mich., knocked off top-seeded St."}
