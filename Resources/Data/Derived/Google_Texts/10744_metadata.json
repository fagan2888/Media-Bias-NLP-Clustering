Kemp Hannon (R-Garden City), the state Department of Health now says its benchmark plan, Oxford EPO, will include coverage of the repair and replacement of prosthetics beginning next January.\n\nThe ability to replace prosthetics is not only important because they wear and age, or because patient needs shift, but also because amputees should benefit from continued improvements in technology.\n\nThe state Department of Health says the change will cover the cost of repair and replacement due to \"normal wear and tear\" or if a device is outgrown. Hannon said he hopes to clarify details including, for instance, whether a woman will be covered if she needs multiple prosthetics as her body changes during a pregnancy. We'd like to see a benchmark plan that sets a uniform standard with broad coverage based on what physicians, not insurers, think is medically necessary.\n\nBecause insurance coverage changes year to year, state lawmakers should make prosthetic coverage based on a doctor's determination permanent.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "sailthru.author": "THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "description": "The ability to replace prosthetics.", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.9608207.1415747670!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "The ability to replace prosthetics.", "title": "Editorial: Odd rule for amputees changed", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/promising-change-for-people-who-need-artificial-limbs-1.10488912", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.9608207.1415747670!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ability to replace prosthetics.", "title": "Editorial: Odd rule for amputees changed", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.9608207.1415747670!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "Tue, 02 Jun 2015 13:08:00 -0400", "sailthru.title": "Editorial: Odd rule for amputees changed", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "prosthetics, New York, healthcare", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "prosthetics, New York, healthcare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "New York State's benchmark insurance policy under the Affordable Care Act originally had an odd clause in its coverage for artificial limbs, allowing for only \"one external prosthesis per limb per lifetime.\"\nBecause insurance coverage changes year to year, state lawmakers should make prosthetic coverage based on a doctor's determination permanent.\nThe state Department of Health says the change will cover the cost of repair and replacement due to \"normal wear and tear\" or if a device is outgrown.\nWe'd like to see a benchmark plan that sets a uniform standard with broad coverage based on what physicians, not insurers, think is medically necessary.\nHannon said he hopes to clarify details including, for instance, whether a woman will be covered if she needs multiple prosthetics as her body changes during a pregnancy."}
