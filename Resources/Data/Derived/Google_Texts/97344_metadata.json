This is to be considered as tantamount to a written order and all who contravene it will be held accountable in the Dar al-Qa\u1e0da [IS judiciary] with attendant consequence.\u201d\n\nWhile ISIS works on new ways to oppress people and affect their daily lives, one so-called Muslim scholar even claimed that the rise in Caesarean operations in the Middle East is part of a plot against Muslim mothers.\n\nSheikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen ruled that Muslim mothers shouldn\u2019t need any pain relief when giving birth.\n\n\u201cI would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us, which is that many obstetricians, male and female, in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means, which is known as a Caesarean. I am afraid that this may be a plot against the Muslims, because the more births take place in this manner, the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman, and she becomes unable to get pregnant.\u201d\n\nWhile ISIS has tried to build a workable health service in Syria, its rules and regulations make it nearly impossible for trained medical professionals to work properly and deliver high-quality healthcare.\n\n[Image credit: IBTimes.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to new reports from the Middle East, ISIS is clamping down on what it calls \"un-Islamic\" Caesarean sections within the Caliphate, which they have", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "According to new reports from the Middle East, ISIS is clamping down on what it calls \u201cun-Islamic\u201d Caesarean sections within the Caliphate, which they have", "title": "ISIS Reportedly Stopping \u2018Un-Islamic\u2019 Caesarean Section Births In Caliphate", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1959670/isis-reportedly-stopping-un-islamic-caesarean-section-births-in-caliphate/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/muslim-e1427459433775-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-27T08:45:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T13:04:56+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/muslim-e1427459433775-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-03-27T08:45:21+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "caesarean section,isis,isis caesarean section,islam,islamic law,sheikh muhammad ibn saalih,syria,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/muslim-e1427459433775-670x409.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "According to new reports from the Middle East, ISIS is clamping down on what it calls \u201cun-Islamic\u201d Caesarean sections within the Caliphate, which they have"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12c1\"", "article_summary": "According to new reports from the Middle East, ISIS is clamping down on what it calls \u201cun-Islamic\u201d Caesarean sections within the Caliphate, which they have deemed as \u201cWestern\u201d and not healthy for women.\nIf the doctors fail to charge this sum, they will be subject to punishment at the hands of the relevant ISIS authority.\nSheikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen ruled that Muslim mothers shouldn\u2019t need any pain relief when giving birth.\nIn order to impose its will, something that ISIS does with an iron fist, Syrian doctors have been ordered to charge 15,000 Syrian pounds for the procedure in order to encourage women to give birth naturally.\n[Image credit: IBTimes.com]"}
