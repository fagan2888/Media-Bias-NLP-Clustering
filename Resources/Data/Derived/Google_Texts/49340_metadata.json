United States didn\u2019t garner as many headlines as rulings legalizing gay marriage or upholding the Affordable Care Act\u2014but former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is arguing the case bolsters his motion to dismiss one of the criminal counts against him.\n\nMr. Silver\u2019s attorneys Steven Molo and Joel Cohen filed a letter with Judge Valerie Caproni last week, pointing out that a Supreme Court decision that found the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2014a \u201cthree-strikes\u201d type legislation that ups sentencing for repeat offenders\u2014was \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d\n\nIn a motion to dismiss a superseding indictment against Mr. Silver, his attorneys made the same argument about the law behind one of the seven charges leveled against him: \u201cmonetary transactions involving crime proceedings.\u201d\n\nMr. Silver is accused of presenting as legitimate outside income from law firms what U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara alleges was actually millions of dollars of kickbacks and bribes gained through his official position in Albany, using his influence to steer real estate developers to a law firm that paid him for referrals and to trade research funds for asbestos patient referrals.\n\nIn the case of Johnson v. United States, the high court found that the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s inclusion of any felony that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d was too vague\u2014and that the law didn\u2019t have to be vague in every single application for it to be void.\n\n\u201cIn Johnson, the Court held that this provision was unconstitutionally vague. The Court specifically rejected the argument\u2014also made by the Government here\u2014that \u2018a statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague in all its applications,'\u201d Mr. Silver\u2019s attorneys wrote.\n\nIn his motion to dismiss, Mr. Silver\u2019s lawyers argued that the federal charge of \u201cmonetary transactions involving crime proceedings,\u201d which essentially means Mr. Silver is accused of profiting off illegal activities, did not meet certain legal standards\u2014including being clear enough that \u201cordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\u201d and that the law is written \u201cin a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Jillian Jorgensen", "sailthru.author": "Jillian Jorgensen", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gettyimages-461973852.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gettyimages-461973852.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Albany, joel cohen, johnson v. united states, Preet Bharara, Sheldon Silver, Southern District of New York, steven molo, Supreme Court, Valerie Caproni, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "sheldon silver, johnson v. united states, supreme court, steven molo, joel cohen, preet bharara, southern district of new york, albany, corruption,", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gettyimages-461973852.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "sheldon silver, johnson v. united states, supreme court, steven molo, joel cohen, preet bharara, southern district of new york, albany, corruption,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Sheldon Silver Cites Supreme Court Decision in Asking Judge to Toss Charge", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "jill-jorgensen", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gettyimages-461973852.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is arguing a recent Supreme Court decision backs his move to dismiss one of the charges against him.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/jillianjorgensen-1-e1411581421359.jpg?quality=80&w=117", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "Jill_Jorgensen", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-07-06T15:57:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T15:12:30+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/jill-jorgensen"}, "sailthru.description": "Former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is arguing a recent Supreme Court decisions backs his motion to dismiss one of the charges against him for being too vague.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is arguing a recent Supreme Court decisions backs his motion to dismiss one of the charges against him for being too vague.", "title": "Sheldon Silver Cites Supreme Court Decision in Asking Judge to Toss Charge", "url": "http://observer.com/2015/07/sheldon-silver-cites-supreme-court-decision-in-asking-judge-to-toss-charge/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gettyimages-461973852.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 759}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Jill Jorgensen is the Senior Politics Editor for the New York Observer. follow her on twitter: @Jill_Jorgensen", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-06 11:57:20", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gettyimages-461973852.jpg?quality=80"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd491\"", "article_summary": "The Court specifically rejected the argument\u2014also made by the Government here\u2014that \u2018a statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague in all its applications,'\u201d Mr. Silver\u2019s attorneys wrote.\n\u201cIn Johnson, the Court held that this provision was unconstitutionally vague.\nIn a week of major Supreme Court decisions, Johnson v.
