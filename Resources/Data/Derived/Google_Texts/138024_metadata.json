The neurosurgeon-turned-pundit has declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination for the presidency, and the race for the Oval Office has officially kicked off.\n\nCarson has long been expected to run for the presidency, as the neurosurgeon and conservative political star has spent the last long while talking about the sort of broad ideas that typify presidential runs. ABC News reports that Carson will introduce himself to the American electorate this weekend in the form of a nearly 40-minute-long ad entitled \u201cA Breath of Fresh Air: A New Prescription for America.\u201d\n\nThe video will be aimed at increasing Carson\u2019s visibility. A relative political neophyte, Carson lacks the name recognition of many of his presumptive rivals in the quest for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nCarson\u2019s introductory ad will air in 22 states and in Washington, D.C. It will include information on Carson\u2019s life and family, with a heavy focus on Carson\u2019s journey from childhood poverty in Detroit to his role as the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins.\n\nCarson will have a tough road ahead of him, even with the actual primary season still more than a year away. Carson will likely spend the next several months building the campaign infrastructure necessary to make a sustained run at the nomination for the highest office in the land. The introductory video will be just the first stage in that effort, with the hard work of cementing alliances, corralling donors, and hammering out a platform still to come.\n\nCarson will likely draw on his experience as a physician as a major differentiator in the campaign, as he has already spent some time railing against President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. As an alternative, Carson proposes a system of private health care savings plans and a flat tax, though these positions will no doubt need fleshing out in order to gain traction in a national race.\n\nThere is also the question of just how impactful Carson\u2019s anti-Obamacare stance will be in early 2016, when the Republican primaries kick off. Assuming Republican efforts to repeal the law before then prove unsuccessful, Obamacare will have been in effect for several years by that point and the ACA\u2019s provisions are increasingly popular among voters, even if the name \u201cObamacare\u201d itself is not.\n\nObamacare was an important issue among the voters that went to the polls for the midterm election, with 47 percent of respondents to an AP exit poll saying that the health care law went too far. Fully 48 percent, though, said that the law was just right or didn\u2019t go far enough, signaling that the law has solid support, even in the highly partisan midterm electorate.\n\nWhen it comes to the general electorate, the law is more popular and Carson will likely have a difficult time convincing voters that his proposed retooling of the healthcare economy is the right way to go.\n\nOutside of healthcare, it becomes unclear just what a Ben Carson presidential run would look like. The flat tax is an old standard among some branches of the Republican party, so it will be hard for Carson to differentiate himself from what looks likely to be a crowded field. The economy remains the top issue among American voters and Carson has no bonafides that point to any expertise in that arena.\n\nDitto on foreign policy, where Carson has exactly zero feathers in his cap. In truth, Carson has virtually no baked-in talking points for a Carson 2016 run aside from his take on healthcare \u2014 which, again, may not be an issue in 2016.\n\nNone of this is even getting into the truths of a run at the presidency. No one has seen Ben Carson the politician at work yet. Republicans often chide President Obama for his supposed inexperience before he assumed office. Obama, though, at least had some experience as a state legislator and as a senator. President Ben Carson would have neither of these and his opponents for the Republican nomination will likely seize on that inexperience as an indication of his unreadiness.\n\nCarson has tried to head off such criticisms already, acknowledging that he hasn\u2019t spent a lot of time in government. Carson says he plans to compensate for his relative inexperience by bringing the right people together around him.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time in government. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t make sure that you have people around you who have spent that time,\u201d Carson told Bill O\u2019Reilly earlier this year. \u201cI think the thing that is actually more important is wisdom and understanding and knowing how to use facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I conducted some very complex operations, including things that hadn\u2019t been done before, it required pulling people together,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSome of them knew a lot of things that I didn\u2019t know about different areas. But being able to coordinate those things and merge them into something that is successful, that\u2019s what we are going to need to do.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, Carson can still enjoy his status as the only officially declared candidate for president in the Republican party. He\u2019s in the lead among declared candidates \u2014 and that\u2019s got to count for something.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the dust just beginning to settle from the 2014 midterm elections, conservative darling Ben Carson is already looking toward 2016.
