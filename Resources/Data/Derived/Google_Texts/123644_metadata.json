The series features essays adapted from and drawing on an upcoming volume, Meeting the Needs of Older Adults with Serious Illness: Challenges and Opportunities in the Age of Health Care Reform, in which clinicians, researchers and policy leaders address 16 key areas where real-world policy options to improve access to quality palliative care could have a substantial role in improving value.\n\nTwo unremitting forces are shaping changes in the U.S. health care system: (1) the graying of America or \u201csilver tsunami,\u201d in which 10,000 individuals are now turning age 65 each day and (2) the cost trends associated with caring for seniors and those with multiple chronic and often life-limiting conditions. Health care experts have identified palliative care and managed care as essential ways to address the special needs of an aging population and for providing care that can lower the rate of national health expenditures.\n\nThe complex set of clinical demands of this growing wave of Medicare members includes multimorbidity, frailty as well as functional and cognitive decline. To effectively and cost-efficiently manage the needs of this population, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) as well as other risk assuming entities must address the quality and cost of the most expensive segment of this group of seniors.\n\nOther risk bearing organizations may include integrated delivery systems (IDSs), independent practice associations (IPAs), management services organizations (MSOs), and, more recently, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).\n\nThe medical management challenges of this group of seniors are compounded for dual eligibles, i.e., those with both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. Duals have a higher prevalence of medical literacy issues, co-morbid psychiatric and behavioral health problems, substance abuse, social and economic resource limitations, and dementia.\n\nThe Evolving Collaboration of Health Plans and Palliative Care\n\nThere is a fascinating thirty-year history of efforts to demonstrate the inherent synergies of MCOs and palliative care that have driven their conjoint destinies. The first documented palliative care program in a specialized MCO, called a PACE model (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), was developed in the On Lok Senior Health Services in San Francisco. As important, this and later collaborations, as noted below, have shown that effective palliative care interventions such as can reduce MCO costs and secure a foundation for palliative care program funding.\n\nIn 1983, research began to show the value and potential savings resulting from palliative care in an MCO. The On Lok PACE was able to achieve hospital utilization rates 30 percent lower than the general Medicare population by using elements of palliative care in its intensive care management approach.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, an important monograph was published by the National Task Force on End-of-Life Care in Managed Care. It codified twelve recommendations for improving and promoting palliative care within MCOs, including improved access, accountability for quality, and the study of reimbursement alternatives. This document was emblematic of the national recognition being given to MCOs as a vehicle to promote palliative care.\n\nIn 2002, a pivotal research paper was published by Brumley at Kaiser Permanente on the value of a community-based palliative care program that integrated curative and comfort care. A follow-up two years later reported persistence of cost savings and patient satisfaction among their total enrollment of 558 individuals. They documented a 45 percent decrease in cost compared with standard care. Noteworthy in this study was the ability of Permanente Medical Group to flex the standard benefits to incorporate all the key elements of a quality palliative care program within their pre-defined capitated budget.\n\nVNSNY SPARK: An MCO-Palliative Care Program for A Medicare and HIV Special Needs Population\n\nThe Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY) is a 120 year old home health agency and the largest nonprofit certified home health agency in the U.S. that is serving special needs populations (a Medicaid HIV/AIDs special needs plan, a partial capitation plan for nursing home eligibles living at home, a Medicare dual eligible special needs plan, and a Medicare Advantage plan for non-duals).\n\nIn 2010 through its professional corporation, Esprit\u00a9, the agency created a palliative care management model. A clinical team of nurse practitioners (NPs) and licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs), along with medical consultants and hospice team members, formed a palliative care team within Esprit called SPARK\u00a9.\n\nAn agreement between VNSNY\u2019s CHOICE Medicare Program and SPARK began in April 2010, with the following aims:\n\nUnderstanding the goals of care for the sickest 3-5 percent of the Medicare members and how to improve their quality of life\n\nProviding appropriate resources to address those with psychosocial, chronic behavioral, and substance use issues\n\nReducing futile care and hospitalizations that were not consistent with member and families\u2019 wishes\n\nImproving member satisfaction, quality of life indicators, and completion rates of advance directives\n\nDeveloping program support for the SPARK team that would be financially self-sustaining by demonstrating reduced overall costs compared to expected costs for this very high risk cohort\n\nBetter diagnostic coding of illness to provide more accurate Medicare plan risk scores and reimbursement\n\nCollecting data to document Medicare Quality Star measures such as those related to the Care of Older Adults\n\nAfter over two and a half years, SPARK outcomes have been favorable. Including SPARK\u2019s monthly, all inclusive case rate, the net savings were over $250 per member per month to VNSNY CHOICE Medicare.\n\nRemaining Challenges: Difficulty Proving Savings to Skeptics\n\nWhile Esprit reported benefits that met the health plan\u2019s goals, there were important issues raised by research and administrative staff about how real the savings were. What role did regression to the mean have in showing reduced hospitalizations and cost avoidance? Could using patients as their own control to demonstrate program effectiveness be misleading? Is the model scalable, that is, will the case rate be attractive to other MCOs if they are not guaranteed savings?\n\nThese concerns suggest that the usual methodologies to evaluate the impact of health program models on utilization and cost may be more difficult to apply to palliative care. The high death rates, limited period of enrollment to death, and difficulty finding \u201cmatched controls\u201d to determine actual to expected costs make it challenging to fully allay skeptics\u2019 methodological and actuarial concerns.\n\nNonetheless, if the savings in acute admissions and emergency department visits persist, the model should prove to be one that adds to the growing body of evidence that case rate payments can both cover the cost of a high quality, inter-professional team of palliative care clinicians and create net savings for the health plan.\n\nDemonstrating return on investment (ROI) is the Holy Grail for program survival. By comparing actual to expected costs, using Medicare\u2019s predictive model (the hierarchical condition category or HCC model), can allow researchers to determine case mix adjusted costs and admission rates. This approach should allow actuarial confirmation of the initial trends observed.\n\nFurther Extensions of the Case Rate Model for Community Based Palliative Care Programs\n\nThe VNSNY SPARK case rate model is one of the first to be developed outside of a Kaiser-style integrated health system. A monthly case rate, tiered by case complexity and intensity of need, would seem to be a more acceptable and manageable reimbursement strategy to support community-based palliative care.\n\nThis model should also be applicable to Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), as defined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Although such ACOs are not MCOs, the term \u201caccountable care organization\u201d has been adopted by some health plans to describe a capitated or partial risk sharing arrangement with a large group or IPA. ACOs are evolving to assume more financial risk and therefore have incentives to effectively manage the quality and cost of care, including the use of palliative care to successfully manage their sickest and most costly 3 to 5 percent of seniors.\n\nThe Triple Win\n\nAs with MCOs and other risk bearing entities, ACOs will need to evaluate if paying for effective community-based palliative care programs is a wise investment that can reduce preventable admissions and generate more savings than would occur otherwise.\n\nFurther research will be needed to demonstrate a \u201cthe triple win\u201d from more extensive availability of community-based palliative care. The benefits should accrue to particularly sick seniors from palliative care\u2019s member-centric approach, to risk-managing organization with an increased net savings, and to community-based palliative care programs that use ACOs and MCOs as sources of sustainable funding.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/04/02/the-manifest-destinies-of-managed-care-and-palliative-care/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "The Manifest Destinies Of Managed Care And Palliative Care"}, "description": "The Manifest Destinies Of Managed Care And Palliative Care | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde049\"", "article_summary": "As important, this and later collaborations, as noted below, have shown that effective palliative care interventions such as can reduce MCO costs and secure a foundation for palliative care program funding.\nHealth care experts have identified palliative care and managed care as essential ways to address the special needs of an aging population and for providing care that can lower the rate of national health expenditures.\nIn 2002, a pivotal research paper was published by Brumley at Kaiser Permanente on the value of a community-based palliative care program that integrated curative and comfort care.\nFurther research will be needed to demonstrate a \u201cthe triple win\u201d from more extensive availability of community-based palliative care.\nRichard Bernstein and Karol DiBelloApril 2, 2014Editor\u2019s Note: This post is the sixth in a periodic Health Affairs Blog series on palliative care, health policy, and health reform."}
