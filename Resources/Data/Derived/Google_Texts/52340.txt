In response to all this, OB-GYN Jessica Kiley felt it was necessary to remind readers of Pacific Standard that there are many positive side effects (in addition to the main effect: contraception!) that women experience with the most controversial (which just happen to be the most female-controlled, in a remarkable coincidence) forms of contraception: lighter or nonexistent periods, reduced menstrual pain, reduced acne, and lower rates of ovarian and endometrial cancer. Of course, the contraceptive effects are great, too, as she emphasizes. Women who have effective contraception have healthier babies, because they choose when to get pregnant. They experience better life outcomes, too: "Birth control allows women to achieve education and career goals, benefiting their families and society."

What Kiley fails to mention, however, is what I, a long-term pill user, can assure you is a wonderful side effect of this kind of contraception: It is great for your sex life. If you're in a monogamous and tested relationship, it means you can have sex whenever or wherever, without having to go hunting around for your condoms. If you're still playing the field, it makes sex with a condom more fun and more relaxed, since you're much less worried about what to do if the condom breaks. Easy access to emergency contraception has got to be a major worry-reducer for condom users, too.
