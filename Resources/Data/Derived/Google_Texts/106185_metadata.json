On issues from foreign policy and anti-terrorism to health care and the economy, voters across the country gave Obama a failing grade. For the issue of greatest concern and urgency to most voters \u2013 the sputtering U.S. economy \u2013 55 percent of Americans said they disapprove of his performance, while only 40 percent approve.\n\nRelated: Devastating New Poll Shows Americans Believe Obama Can No Longer Lead the Country\n\n\n\nObama also received mixed grades for his character, according to the Quinnipiac survey, with voters evenly divided \u2013 48 percent to 48 percent \u2013 over whether he is honest and trustworthy. The survey questioned 1,446 registered voters nationwide.\n\nSome Democrats appear to be suffering from buyer\u2019s remorse for having backed Obama\u2019s reelection in 2012 over GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Ten percent of Democrats surveyed said the country would be better off with Romney in the White House, compared with 74 percent of Democrats who said the country would be worse off and 9 percent who said it would be about the same.\n\nObama narrowly defeated Romney in the popular vote by a margin of 50.4 percent to 48.1 percent. In the Quinnipiac survey, 45 percent of respondents said the nation in general would be better off with Romney as president, 38 percent said it would be worse off, and 10 percent said it would be about the same. Among Republicans, 84 percent said the country would be better off with Romney, while independents agreed with that, 47 percent to 33 percent.\n\nRomney, after months in the political wilderness, has been enjoying a resurgence in popularity among establishment Republicans and those with business interests, with some urging him to make a third bid for the presidency in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to head the Democratic ticket. Last March, 34 percent of Republicans said in a Washington Post-ABC News poll that they could definitely back Romney in the 2016 GOP primary. Many view him as standing tall above the current crop of GOP presidential aspirants in terms of fundraising firepower and leadership skills.\n\n\n\nRelated: How About This 2016 Matchup? Clinton vs. Romney\n\nOn Meet the Press last month, Romney said, \u201cI\u2019m not running, and talk of a draft is kind of silly.\u201d But during a GOP summit he hosted in Park City, Utah, to help political leaders and conservative thinkers devise a winning strategy for the 2016 presidential campaign, he appeared to enjoy the renewed attention he\u2019s been getting.\n\n\u201cThe more Romney insists he\u2019s not interested, the more people become intrigued at the prospect of him running,\u201d Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post wrote recently.\n\nWith two-and-a-half years left in Obama\u2019s second term, it may be too soon to assess the president\u2019s place in history. Yet 33 percent of the nearly 1,500 voters interviewed by Quinnipiac said Obama is the worst president since World War II, putting him just ahead of former Republican President George W. Bush, dubbed the worst president by 28 percent of interviewees.\n\nRepublican Ronald Reagan was rated the best president of that era by 35 percent of those surveyed, followed by Democrats Bill Clinton (18 percent favorable judgment) and John F. Kennedy (15 percent). \u201cOver the span of 69 years of American history and 12 presidencies, President Barack Obama finds himself with President George W. Bush at the bottom of the popularity barrel,\u201d Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Falling Ratings Hurt Dems in Midterms\n\nThe survey comes after a steady drumbeat of controversy and bad news for the president. Obama has struggled to deal with deteriorating conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan and has become so estranged from congressional Republicans that House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has vowed to take him to court for allegedly violating his sworn constitutional duty to enforce laws.\n\nWhile Obama has issued fewer executive orders than any other president in the past five decades, Republicans say he\u2019s repeatedly engaged in overreach to skirt Congress\u2019s legislative authority. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that Obama violated the Constitution in making some recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. Earlier this week, the High Court ruled against a provision of the Affordable Care Act that would have required \u201cclosely held\u201d companies to provide contraception coverage to workers when it was contrary to company executive\u2019s religious beliefs.\n\nObama has also been sharply criticized for freeing Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a possible deserter, in return for the release of five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The Obama administration has been buffeted by scandals and controversies, including the near-disastrous rollout of Obamacare last fall, allegations of IRS wrongdoing, and lengthy waitlists at VA medical centers that may have contributed to the deaths of dozens of veterans.\n\nObama\u2019s approval rating actually inched up from his all-time low of 38 percent in December 2013, said Quinnipiac. But his grades for specific issues and challenges are bleak: a 40-percent approval rating for health care; 37 percent for foreign policy; and 44 percent for combating terrorism. Only on the environment does Obama get a positive rating \u2013 of 50 percent.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll\u2019s release coincided with a poll by Zogby Analytics, showing Obama\u2019s approval rating dropping 3percentage points, to 44 percent, while disapproval went up 4 points from last month, to 54 percent. \u201cWe see a president in full salvage mode,\u201d said veteran pollster and analyst John Zogby. \u201cHe is not only racing for his legacy but for his relevancy.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A third of all Americans believe that President Obama is \u201cthe worst\u201d chief executive since World War II \u2013 and more than half say that the administration is not competent to run the government, according to a new Quinnipiac University national poll that may have offered one of the most stinging voter assessments of the beleaguered president yet.", "title": "Obama Worst President Since World War II: Poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/02/Obama-Worst-President-World-War-II-Poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12042013_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/02/Obama-Worst-President-World-War-II-Poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12042013_Obama.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A third of all Americans believe that President Obama is \u201cthe worst\u201d chief executive since World War II \u2013 and more than half say that the administration is not competent to run the government, according to a new Quinnipiac University national poll that may have offered one of the most stinging voter assessments of the beleaguered president yet.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dca\"", "article_summary": "Yet 33 percent of the nearly 1,500 voters interviewed by Quinnipiac said Obama is the worst president since World War II, putting him just ahead of former Republican President George W.
