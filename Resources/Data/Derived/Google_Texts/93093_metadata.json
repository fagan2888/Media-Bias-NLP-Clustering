While one-third expect improvement, two-thirds anticipate either a worsening or no difference at all.\n\n\u201cIt will hurt everybody in the long run,\u201d said Cat Ping, 55, of Indianapolis in a follow-up interview. Ms. Ping, who does not have insurance, added: \u201cI don\u2019t care how they spin it, Obamacare is not affordable. It\u2019s wrecking our total economy.\u201d\n\nOn the whole, uninsured Americans expect to be personally affected by the Affordable Care Act more so than all adults nationwide. Among all adults, nearly half think the law will not affect them at all, while among uninsured adults, just over one-quarter say that. And while a nearly 4 in 10 plurality of uninsured Americans think the health care law will hurt them personally, they are twice as likely as the general public to say the law will help them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for universal health care, and this is a steppingstone in the right direction, \u201c said Don Sears, 58, of Syracuse, N.Y. Mr. Sears, who has had health insurance on and off throughout the years, is currently unemployed and does not have insurance. He is looking forward to that changing, he said, because \u201cwith Obamacare I will be able to get health care\u201d that is affordable.\n\nThe New York Times/CBS News poll was conducted among 1,000 adults nationwide by telephone on Dec. 5-8, 2013, and among 702 uninsured adults between Dec. 4-15. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points among the general population and plus or minus five percentage points among the uninsured sample.
