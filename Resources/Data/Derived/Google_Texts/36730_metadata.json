The Arkansas-based country singer has released a song, \u201cPissed Off Rednecks Like Me,\u201d that has quickly gone viral via social media \u2014 for better or worse.\n\nThe song airs many of Jones\u2019 frustrations with the way things are in America right now: \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to tell my children when and where to pray / We ain\u2019t that far gone, we\u2019re still standing on / The land of the free and the home of the brave,\u201d he sings at the beginning of the tune.\n\nJones goes on to rail against immigration, Obamacare and welfare, ending each verse with the line, \u201cThis is coming from real America, son / Pissed off rednecks like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Mrs. Jones is gone to the gym, I thought I\u2019d do a little songwriting,\u201d Jones wrote on Facebook when originally sharing the song. \u201cIf it offends ya\u2026.middle finger!!!!\u201d\n\nPlenty may agree with Jones\u2019 sentiments, but his label, Render Records, has found themselves fielding some angry feedback.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate and respect those views and opinions. That\u2019s what is great about our country, the ability and freedom to agree and more importantly disagree with subject matters such as these,\u201d Render Label Group President Steve Freeman writes on Facebook. \u201cOur job as a record label is to make our artists\u2019 music available and to promote it, not to agree or disagree with the art or its content politically or otherwise. We as a label believe in letting our artists say what\u2019s in their hearts and on their minds. We are all individuals and we will never completely agree on these types of subjects, but I encourage everyone to be respectful of others opinions as their right to express them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPissed Off Rednecks Like Me,\u201d which was recorded on Jones\u2019 iPhone, may be part of an upcoming album, which was recorded at Reba McEntire\u2018s Starstruck Studios and includes a song by James Otto.\n\n\u201cPissed Off Rednecks Like Me\u201d is available for download on iTunes.\n\nListen to Jamie Jones, \u201cPissed Off Rednecks Like Me\u201d:\n\nNEXT: Top 10 Censored Songs in Country Music", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://theboot.com/files/2015/03/jamie-jones-pissed-off-rednecks-song.jpg", "sailthru.author": "gayle-thompson", "description": "Jamie Jones released Pissed Off Rednecks Like Me, airing many of his grievances about what is going on in America.", "og": {"site_name": "The Boot", "description": "Jamie Jones released Pissed Off Rednecks Like Me, airing many of his grievances about what is going on in America.", "title": "Jamie Jones Goes Viral With 'Pissed Off Rednecks Like Me'", "url": "http://theboot.com/jamie-jones-pissed-off-rednecks-like-me/", "image": "http://theboot.com/files/2015/03/jamie-jones-pissed-off-rednecks-song.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thebootdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-05 12:00:58", "sailthru.title": "Jamie Jones Goes Viral With \u2018Pissed Off Rednecks Like Me\u2019 [LISTEN]", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-theboot, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, jamie-jones, country-news, songs", "fb": {"admins": 59877105906, "app_id": 151086041747752}, "keywords": "jamie jones country, jamie jones music, jamie jones pissed off rednecks like me, pissed off rednecks song", "sailthru.description": "Jamie Jones released Pissed Off Rednecks Like Me, airing many of his grievances about what is going on in America.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://theboot.com/files/2015/03/jamie-jones-pissed-off-rednecks-song.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1db\"", "article_summary": "Listen to Jamie Jones, \u201cPissed Off Rednecks Like Me\u201d:NEXT: Top 10 Censored Songs in Country Music\nThe Arkansas-based country singer has released a song, \u201cPissed Off Rednecks Like Me,\u201d that has quickly gone viral via social media \u2014 for better or worse.\n!\u201dPlenty may agree with Jones\u2019 sentiments, but his label, Render Records, has found themselves fielding some angry feedback.\nRender Label GroupJamie Jones might not be a household name, but that\u2019s about to change.\n\u201cPissed Off Rednecks Like Me\u201d is available for download on iTunes."}
