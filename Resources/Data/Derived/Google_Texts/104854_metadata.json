Yet these alternatives still can\u2019t salvage the rule, which will cost $26 million to implement and then $24 million each year in ongoing costs.\n\nThe proposed alternatives focus on reducing the regulation\u2019s costs but fail to address the real underlying problem \u2013 the rule is unlikely to produce any benefits. The FDA\u2019s own analysis struggled to justify the rule and ultimately failed to do so. But instead of admitting that the regulation will not work, the FDA is proceeding with a wasteful effort.\n\nThe rule, mandated by the Affordable Care Act, explains that lack of self-control contributes to obesity; people struggle to control their urges to eat unhealthy snacks or to limit their portions. The FDA\u2019s solution to the problem: require vending machines to display caloric information for each vending item. Of course, this information is already available on the item\u2019s nutritional label. But, as the FDA argues, the nutritional labels are not clearly visible in the vending machine and consumers will not see them until after the sale.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nNow imagine that you have never tried any of the candies sold at a vending machine. The first time you buy that candy, you would not know its caloric content. But once you have it in hand, you can easily look at the label. The next time you buy that candy from a vending machine, you should already know what\u2019s on the label. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s more likely because you aren\u2019t interested than it is that the caloric information needs to be displayed more prominently.\n\nIn fact, FDA\u2019s own analysis does not blame lack of caloric information for increasing obesity. It clearly points to lack of self-control on the part of consumers as the culprit behind unhealthy eating habits. FDA makes no effort to tie its calorie display prescription to the underlying problem it identifies. Nor does it explain how displaying the same information in another venue would help consumers control their desires for unhealthy snacks. It does not even state what exactly it expect consumers to do \u2013 choose a healthier snack or forgo vending machine purchases altogether.\n\nUltimately, the FDA could easily dispel any conflicting views over the rule\u2019s effectiveness by testing it. It would be relatively easy for the agency to set up a few vending machines with caloric information clearly displayed to see if the rule impacts consumer behavior. The agency could measure this impact to decide if the rules benefits, if any, justify its substantial costs. Instead, the agency simply noted the lack of real life data and refused to adequately estimate the rule\u2019s benefits.\n\nWhile the FDA\u2019s predicament is understandable, it is inexcusable. Since Congress mandated the rule through the Affordable Care Act, the FDA has no choice but to comply. But it is also the agency\u2019s job to use its expertise to advise lawmakers. If the mandated rule is unlikely to achieve its goals, the agency should clearly state so in its analysis and not waste society\u2019s resources on yet another ineffective regulation that won\u2019t do anything to curb obesity.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "title": "FDA Wasting Millions on Vending Machine Rule That Won\u2019t Stop Obesity", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Displaying nutrition labels on vending machines won't make us healthier.", "title": "Vending Machine Regulations Aren't Worth the Price", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2014/03/10/fda-wasting-millions-on-vending-machine-rule-that-wont-stop-obesity", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7d/83eed8f48de16bd2624bb21b6922f7/31113vending machine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Displaying nutrition labels on vending machines won't make us healthier.", "card": "summary", "title": "FDA Wasting Millions on Vending Machine Rule That Won\u2019t Stop Obesity"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Sherzod Abdukadirov,Affordable Care Act,FDA,obesity,weight loss,Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Displaying nutrition labels on vending machines won't make us healthier."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08ff\"", "article_summary": "The next time you buy that candy from a vending machine, you should already know what\u2019s on the label.\nNow imagine that you have never tried any of the candies sold at a vending machine.\nThe FDA\u2019s solution to the problem: require vending machines to display caloric information for each vending item.\nIt does not even state what exactly it expect consumers to do \u2013 choose a healthier snack or forgo vending machine purchases altogether.\nBut, as the FDA argues, the nutritional labels are not clearly visible in the vending machine and consumers will not see them until after the sale."}
