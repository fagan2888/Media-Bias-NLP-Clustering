Corp. Code \u00a7 17350 (repealed). The California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act adds a forth casus dissolutionis: the passage of 90 consecutive days during which the LLC has no members (except on the death of a natural person who is the sole member of a LLC, the status of the member, including a membership interest, may pass to the heirs, successors, and assigns of the member by will or applicable law). Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 17707.01. Dissolution pursuant to either of these statutes might characterized as de jure.\n\nCB Richard Ellis, Inc. v. Terra Nostra Consultants, Cal. Ct. of Appeal Case No. G049803 (Oct. 7, 2014), the plaintiff had obtained an arbitral award against an LLC for commissions due under a listing agreement. The LLC had no assets because it had distributed the sales proceeds before the award was issued. The plaintiff therefore pursued an action under former Corporations Code Section 17355 which authorizes actions against members of a dissolved LLC to the extent of distributions of LLC assets upon dissolution. (The Court applied the former Beverly-Killea Act because the dispute arose before the effective date of the RULLCA, but noted that current Section 17707.07(a)(1) \u201cis nearly identical\u201d to Section 17355.) The question, therefore, became whether dissolution was limited to the occurrence of one of the events specified in former Section 17355.\n\nWhile acknowledging that it is \u201cunclear\u201d whether the legislature intended former Section 17350 to preclude a determination that an LLC dissolved prior to the occurrence of any of the three events specified in the statute, the court found that the plain language of the statute did not preclude that possibility. The Court then interpreted the statute in accordance with its understanding of the statute\u2019s purpose \u2013 \u201cto prevent the unjust enrichment of members of limited liability companies, when such members have received assets the dissolved company needs to pay creditors.\u201d The Court further noted that if suits against members were limited to only cases of de jure dissolution, then LLCs and their members could avoid the force of Section 17355 by the \u201csimple expedient of transferring assets out of the company the day before voting to dissolve\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Under the former Beverly-Killea Limited Liability Company Act, a limited liability company was dissolved upon the first to occur of any of the following three events:", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Under the former Beverly-Killea Limited Liability Company Act, a limited liability company was dissolved upon the first to occur of any of the following three events:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe occurrence of an even", "title": "California Court Of Appeal Embraces De Facto LLC Dissolution", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/california-court-appeal-embraces-de-facto-llc-dissolution", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/Keith%20Paul%20Bishop_14.jpg?itok=rYO79FpT", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Government, Corporation, Limited liability Comany, Beverly-Killea Act, LLC, California", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Government, Corporation, Limited liability Comany, Beverly-Killea Act, LLC, California"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca647\"", "article_summary": "The plaintiff therefore pursued an action under former Corporations Code Section 17355 which authorizes actions against members of a dissolved LLC to the extent of distributions of LLC assets upon dissolution.\nThe question, therefore, became whether dissolution was limited to the occurrence of one of the events specified in former Section 17355.\nThe LLC had no assets because it had distributed the sales proceeds before the award was issued.\nG049803 (Oct. 7, 2014), the plaintiff had obtained an arbitral award against an LLC for commissions due under a listing agreement.\nDissolution pursuant to either of these statutes might characterized as de jure."}
