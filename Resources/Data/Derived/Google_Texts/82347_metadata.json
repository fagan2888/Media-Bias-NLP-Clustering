They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither side had confirmed it publicly.\n\nKeeping Bosh addresses one of the Miami\u2019s top priorities after getting the news earlier in the day that James was leaving the Heat and returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty of work for Heat President Pat Riley to do, however. But first, he and the team lauded what James meant to them over the last four seasons.\n\n\u201cWhile I am disappointed by LeBron\u2019s decision to leave Miami, no one can fault another person for wanting to return home,\u201d Riley said in a statement Friday night. \u201cThe last four years have been an incredible run for South Florida, Heat fans, our organization and for all of the players who were a part of it. LeBron is a fantastic leader, athlete, teammate and person, and we are all sorry to see him go.\u201d\n\nNext up for the Heat: More than likely, it\u2019s a deal with Dwyane Wade, who has spent all 11 of his NBA seasons in Miami. Wade and Miami were negotiating a new contract Friday, a move that was expected from the very moment that the 2006 NBA Finals MVP opted out of a deal that would have paid him about $42 million over the next two seasons.\n\n\u201cI know where I\u2019m going,\u201d Wade told The AP on Thursday, one day before James let the world that he was going elsewhere.\n\nWhile Miami is working to get a Wade deal finalized, it\u2019s unclear when Bosh will actually sign his contract \u2014 though that won\u2019t hold up the Heat from making other moves. He\u2019s expected to be in Ghana until next week, which creates a logistical challenge.\n\nBosh is an All-Star who averaged 16.2 points on 52 percent shooting last season, and now figures to potentially get many more shots in the Heat offensive scheme. For his career, Bosh has averaged 19.2 points in 11 NBA seasons.\n\nThis much is certain: There\u2019s no shortage of openings on the Heat roster.\n\nMiami has agreed to deals with Josh McRoberts and Danny Granger, which should get finalized once the Heat figure how to allocate their spending now that James is gone. Guard Norris Cole was the only holdover from last season with a guaranteed contract, while young center Justin Hamilton has a partially guaranteed deal and point guard Shabazz Napier came to the Heat on draft night.\n\nWade and Udonis Haslem, who also opted out with hopes it would help the team keep James, will almost certainly be back, and the team thinks highly of James Ennis, who played overseas last season. But that means a ton of slots in the locker room at AmericanAirlines Arena that is currently being renovated \u2014 a fitting metaphor if there ever was one \u2014 will be available between now and training camp.\n\nRiley said the Heat mantra that he, managing general partner Micky Arison and coach Erik Spoelstra have cultivated will not be changing.\n\n\u201cOver the last 19 years, since Micky and I teamed together, the Miami Heat has always been a championship organization,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve won multiple championships and competed for many others. Micky, Erik and I remain committed to doing whatever it takes to win and compete for championships for many years to come. We\u2019ve proven that we can do it and we\u2019ll do it again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Keeping Bosh addresses one of the Miami's top priorities after getting the news earlier in the day that James was leaving the Heat and returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers.", "Author": "Tim Reynolds", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Keeping Bosh addresses one of the Miami\u2019s top priorities after getting the news earlier in the day that James was leaving the Heat and returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers.", "title": "Chris Bosh stays with Heat on max deal as LeBron leaves", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/12/chris-bosh-stays-heat-max-deal-lebron-leaves/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/12/heat-bosh-basketball_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/12/heat-bosh-basketball_lanc.jpg", "title": "Chris Bosh stays with Heat on max deal as LeBron leaves", "description": "Keeping Bosh addresses one of the Miami's top priorities after getting the news earlier in the day that James was leaving the Heat and returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Miami Heat, Miami, Chris Bosh, James Ennis"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde86d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOver the last 19 years, since Micky and I teamed together, the Miami Heat has always been a championship organization,\u201d Riley said.\nWhile Miami is working to get a Wade deal finalized, it\u2019s unclear when Bosh will actually sign his contract \u2014 though that won\u2019t hold up the Heat from making other moves.\nChris Bosh said countless times in recent weeks that he did not want to leave Miami.\nRiley said the Heat mantra that he, managing general partner Micky Arison and coach Erik Spoelstra have cultivated will not be changing.\nThere\u2019s still plenty of work for Heat President Pat Riley to do, however."}
