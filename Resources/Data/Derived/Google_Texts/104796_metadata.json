This followed two significant acquisitions earlier in the year.\n\nSuch a flurry of activity is unusual in New Jersey. This year's total already is more than the amount of law firm acquisitions from the past two years combined.\n\nIn fact, it already is above the total from each of at least the past eight years.\n\nBut if you ask David Garber, the head of a company that works with law firms that are actively looking to make moves, this type of activity may become the norm.\n\nGarber, president of Princeton Legal Search Group, attested to certain shifts in the industry that have made acquiring practices and partners more common than bringing fresh attorneys up the ranks.\n\n\u201c(Attorneys would) spend a lot of time proving themselves before becoming a partner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happens less and less that way now. Growth for law firms increasingly is a result of lateral acquisitions.\u201d\n\nProcuring attorneys that are already heavily specialized experts \u2014 instead of spending time and resources trying to create them \u2014 is one of the most obvious drivers for these acquisitions.\n\nComprehensive changes such as the Affordable Care Act have generated entirely new areas of legal expertise virtually overnight. In the same way, future shifts \u2014 such as to the state's environmental regulatory scheme \u2014 could just as quickly alter demand for specialized lawyers.\n\nTwo recent acquisitions by Newark-based McCarter & English, one of the state's largest firms, reflect an industry-wide effort to stay a step ahead of developing legal spaces.\n\nThe largest \u2014 and, thus far, the year's most sizable acquisition in the state \u2014was its October partnership with the 17-lawyer SorinRand of East Brunswick. The other was in February, when it absorbed the 14-lawyer Miller, Balis & O'Neil of Washington D.C.\n\nThe tech-focused SorinRand and the energy law firm Miller, Balis &O'Neil were folded into the 122 lateral partners McCarter & English has integrated in the past seven years.\n\nOf those, 27 have been in intellectual property, 27 in corporate law and 15 in energy-related areas.\n\nHoward Kailes, an M&A attorney who heads McCarter & English's corporate practice group, said those areas have been the predominant targets for its acquisitions.\n\n\u201cThose are going to be the three engines of the firm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we're not even close to being sated (in those areas).\n\n\u201cThere's so many opportunities out there. It's unfortunate that no law firm can do everything.\u201d\n\nKailes feels industry shifts are one cause of the rise of acquisitions, but maybe not the biggest one.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to ignore \u2014 if I can speculate \u2014 the rebound of economic activity in the state and how that's reflected in the increased pace of law firm transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nGarber said talks are ongoing about acquisitions just as large as McCarter's purchase of SorinRand, but he wasn't willing to offer a prediction as to when they may occur.\n\nWhat he did forecast was more New Jersey law firms targeting others in the state, which he believes will be more prevalent than firms looking past Garden State borders.\n\nThis year's only other out-of-state acquisition (besides McCarter's) belonged to Norris McLaughlin & Marcus of Bridgewater, a firm that on Oct. 20 grew its New York office by purchasing the boutique-sized Deutsch, Metz & Deutsch.\n\nTwo firms that already have a New York footprint, Javerbaum Wurgaft Hicks Kahn Wikstrom & Sinins in Springfield and Fein Such Kahn & Shepard in Parsippany, looked to other areas of the Garden State for their respective acquisitions.\n\nJaverbaum Wurgaft Hicks Kahn Wikstrom & Sinins established a nursing home law practice under its name in South Jersey by acquiring the Saul Gruber Law Office in Mount Laurel. The two-attorney firm was the smallest to be acquired this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the union of Fein Such Kahn & Shepard and Levitan & Frieland gave the former firm a presence in Florham Park.\n\nThe only other acquisition in the state to be revealed this year was done by Scarinci Hollenbeck in Lyndhurst.\n\nIt wouldn't exactly be anomalous for New Jersey to have a record number of law firm combinations, considering the country as a whole is on pace for some of its best years in recent memory. Nationwide, the amount of law firm acquisitions went from 39 in 2010 to 88 in 2013.\n\nGarber thinks more are on the way.\n\n\u201cI can't give names, but there's a lot of interest and potential activity in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see another announcement or two before the year's end.\u201d\n\nE-mail to: brettj@njbiz.com\n\nFinding a fit\n\nLaw firms, with all the complexities that come with their operations, are something of a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nBecause of that, pieces of other legal practices don\u2019t always make for a great fit.\n\nFor example, a law firm has to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest going into potential acquisitions or mergers. That\u2019s something that often is problematic to this particular sector, David Garber said.\n\n\u201cIf one firm has a financial institutions practice in which they\u2019re representing big banks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the other firm on the other side of the merger is averse to banks in clients or litigation \u2014 that could present a real problem.\n\n\u201cIf firm A is representing Bank of America and firm B is consistently suing Bank of America, those two parties simply can\u2019t work together.\u201d\n\nAnother part of the puzzle is differences in cultures. A so-called Wall Street firm\u2019s austerity wouldn\u2019t necessarily pair well with a small-town law firm that tends toward levity.\n\n\u201cLaw firms can be very different from one another,\u201d Garber said. \u201cAt the outset, there\u2019s a sort of get-to-know-you period to figure out whether you approach practice and develop clients in the same ways.\n\n\u201cSometimes the answer to that is a resounding no.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "There was a four-week span in the fall in which New Jersey saw law firm acquisitions at the rate of one each week.
