Photo courtesy of Pixabary, public domain\n\nSwiping right to find a match on popular dating app Tinder may lead to more than just love \u2014 you might wind up literally giving your heart away. For the next two weeks, swiping right on certain photos will encourage Tinder users to register as an organ donor. Through a new partnership with Tinder, the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK aims to encourage more young people to join their organ donor campaign and will use Tinder to gain access to them.\n\nBy the end of 2014, approximately 50 million people used the app every month, making an average of 12 million matches each day. But the matches took a collective one billion swipes a day to achieve, exposing users to hundreds of people at a time, which is the level of exposure the NHS wants to tap into. They\u2019ll do so thanks to an agreement with Tinder\u2019s high profile users, including Olympic gold medalist Jade Jones, actress Gemma Oaten, and TV reality star Jamie Laing, who will feature an organ logo to garner attention to the importance of donations.\n\nHigh-profile Tinder users have volunteered to lend their profiles to the NHS in hopes of gaining organ donors.

But after the number of donated organs fell for the first time in 11 years, the NHS announced a public call for everyone in the UK to discuss organ donation in July 2015. The decrease meant 224 fewer people received an organ transplant between the years 2014 and 2015. America isn\u2019t too far off. According to the Department of Health & Human Services, an average of 22 people die every day waiting for transplants they need but can\u2019t have because of the shortage of donated organs. The UK\u2019s creative approach to reaching a younger population may be adapted to other regions in the world if they prove to be effective.\n\n\"Educating and encouraging people to sign up for organ donation \u2014 that\u2019s what our partnership with Tinder is all about,\" the Director of Organ Donation and Transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant, Sally Johnson, said. \"Joining the register takes only a couple of minutes \u2014 about the same amount of time as a few swipes on Tinder.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dating, apps, organ, donations, how, nhs, plans, use, tinder, search, donors", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tinder will no longer be just a dating app for love and lust, but also a way to search for organ donors.", "title": "Tinder Health Care: Swipe Right To Donate Your Organs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dating-apps-organ-donations-how-nhs-plans-use-tinder-search-donors-365252", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/14/tinder-organs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tinder will no longer be just a dating app for love and lust, but also a way to search for organ donors.", "title": "Tinder Health Care: Swipe Right To Donate Your Organs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dating-apps-organ-donations-how-nhs-plans-use-tinder-search-donors-365252", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/14/tinder-organs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/14/tinder-organs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-12-14T17:51:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-14T17:51:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Tinder will no longer be just a dating app for love and lust, but also a way to search for organ donors."}, "article_summary": "High-profile Tinder users have volunteered to lend their profiles to the NHS in hopes of gaining organ donors.\nFor the next two weeks, swiping right on certain photos will encourage Tinder users to register as an organ donor.\nTinder users may be encouraged to sign up as an organ donor if they swipe right on certain profiles.\nThe decrease meant 224 fewer people received an organ transplant between the years 2014 and 2015.\nThrough a new partnership with Tinder, the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK aims to encourage more young people to join their organ donor campaign and will use Tinder to gain access to them."}
