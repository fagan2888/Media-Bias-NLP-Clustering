Absolutely. Do I detest that? Absolutely,\u201d Carson told Breitbart News. \u201cAs president, I wouldn\u2019t deal with them either. Obviously, if that is in fact true, I think that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTrump \u2013 when booed by the audience during an exchange with Bush during Saturday\u2019s debate \u2013 suggested the audience is filled with donors and special interests that support establishment-backed candidates, such as former governor Jeb Bush.\n\nTrump made the same charge during a campaign rally Sunday afternoon at Plymouth State University.\n\n\u201cThe room was loaded up \u2026 all the rich donors and special interests and the lobbyists got all the tickets,\u201d Trump told the supporters at his rally. He personally knows most of the big, wealthy donors because he was one of them in the past, he said, adding that angry faces were looking at him, thinking, \u201cHow could you do this to us?\u201d\n\nA source from the RNC told Breitbart News that 75 attendees were RNC donors. The various candidates, the state party, plus St. Anselm, ABC, IJ Review, WMUR and Google all got ticket allocations for the 1,000-person room.\n\nTrump said the donors should have donate money to veterans instead of sending their cash to Bush\u2019s campaign.\n\nTrump used the drug companies as an example of special interests in politics. He said the head of Johnson & Johnson is one of Bush\u2019s top fundraisers.\n\n\u201cI blame the RNC for this,\u201d Trump said about filling audience with donors. \u201cI\u2019m the one that brought all the action,\u201d he added, referencing that he only receives 20 tickets to give to people for the debates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a self-funder. I\u2019m putting up my own money,\u201d he reminded his supporters. \u201cI\u2019m $40 million maybe $50 million under budget, isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my friends,\u201d not the donors, he told his audience. \u201cSelf-funding is a big deal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE --- Ben Carson: \u2018Problematic\u2019 Donors Fill Debate Audience", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "EXCLUSIVE --- Ben Carson: \u2018Problematic\u2019 Donors Fill Debate Audience", "title": "EXCLUSIVE - Ben Carson: \u2018Problematic\u2019 Donors Fill Debate Audience - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-508803086.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-07T14:23:37-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/07/exclusive-ben-carson-problematic-donors-fill-debate-audience/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE --- Ben Carson: \u2018Problematic\u2019 Donors Fill Debate Audience", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-508803086.jpg", "title": "EXCLUSIVE - Ben Carson: \u2018Problematic\u2019 Donors Fill Debate Audience - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Audience, Donald Trump, donors, Dr. Ben Carson, GOP Debate, Jeb Bush,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-07T12:32:43-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-02-07T14:23:37-07:00", "tag": "Jeb Bush", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m $40 million maybe $50 million under budget, isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re my friends,\u201d not the donors, he told his audience.\n\u201cThe room was loaded up \u2026 all the rich donors and special interests and the lobbyists got all the tickets,\u201d Trump told the supporters at his rally.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMANCHESTER, New Hampshire \u2014 GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson told Breitbart News that it is \u201cproblematic\u201d if establishment donors and special interests fill the audience at GOP debates, as GOP frontrunner Donald Trump suggested during the Saturday debate, and again during his Sunday campaign rally.\n\u201cI blame the RNC for this,\u201d Trump said about filling audience with donors.\nTrump used the drug companies as an example of special interests in politics."}
