Thompson School District will offer 2014 summer food service program in June and July

To make sure students have a healthy lunch even when they are not in school, the Thompson School District will serve breakfast and lunch during much of summer vacation.

The Nutrition Services Department will offer the 2014 summer food service program Monday, June 2, through Friday, Aug. 1, feeding the same meals free of charge to children 18 months to 18 years except for the week of June 30-July 4. Adults will be required to pay $3.50 if they want the meal.

"It's a really good program to help children receive the proper nutrition over the summer, so that they are ... ready to enter those classrooms and be ready to learn in the fall," said Tammie Rempe, director of nutrition services for Thompson School District.

Lunch will be served 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. at five schools this year, down from seven schools last year and two remote sites. The schools include Monroe, Lincoln, Sarah Milner and Winona elementary schools and Bill Reed Middle School.

The breakfast service will be at Lincoln at 7:30-8 a.m. and at Sarah Milner at 8-8:30 a.m., one site fewer than last year.

"The main reason is I don't have labor to go into the other sites. I cannot find labor to cover the school lunch program," Rempe said, attributing the salary level as the main reason. "We are having a very difficult time hiring staff right now."

Seventeen staff members, all regular staff who agreed to work over the summer months, will serve the meals, Rempe said.

The meals are served at schools that qualify for the free and reduced lunch program, but students do not have to qualify individually to receive the meals. Students qualifying for free and reduced lunches increased from 37.3 percent of the school population last year to 38 percent this year.

"A lot of this has to do with the flood," Rempe said, explaining that families impacted by the September 2013 flood automatically qualified for the program.

Last year, the nutrition services department provided 28,313 lunches over 41 days and 29,932 lunches over 40 days the year before.

The daily average last year was 691 lunches and 748 lunches in 2012. The number of breakfasts was 38 in 2013 and 81 in 2012.

"We're looking forward to another successful summer," Rempe said. "The managers love to see lots of smiling children over the summer."
