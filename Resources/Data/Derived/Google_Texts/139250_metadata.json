(This is the inherent underpinning to the Republican policy position, or else it\u2019s just \u201cgo die.\u201d Neither is a public relations winner and that is why they won\u2019t have a real discussion about healthcare other than to demonize Obamacare.)\n\nDeanna Fei wrote, \u201cI take issue with how he reduced my daughter to a \u201cdistressed baby\u201d who cost the company too much money. How he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits. How he exposed the most searing experience of our lives, one that my husband and I still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other, for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting.\u201d\n\nFei pointed out that on the day that Armstrong, who made $12 million dollars last year, blamed her baby for cutting employee benefits, he also gloated about having the best quarterly earnings in years. \u201cFor me and my husband\u2014who have been genuinely grateful for AOL\u2019s benefits, which are actually quite generous\u2014the hardest thing to bear has been the whiff of judgment in Armstrong\u2019s statement, as if we selfishly gobbled up an obscenely large slice of the collective health care pie.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cwhiff of judgment\u201d Fei referred to is the undercurrent in the way Republicans frame the \u201cdebate\u201d on healthcare. There is always the insinuation that anyone who wants healthcare who doesn\u2019t already have it is being greedy and lazy. There is the assumption that people don\u2019t need healthcare and are not entitled to it. And there is the ever present \u201chow dare you assume your health should interfere with corporate profits\u201d condescension.\n\nTo which Fei replied that they had not set about to have a preemie in intensive care, \u201cYes, we had a preemie in intensive care. This was certainly not our intention. While he\u2019s at it, why not call out the women who got cancer? The parents of kids with asthma? These rank among the nation\u2019s most expensive medical conditions. Would anyone dare to single out these people for simply availing themselves of their health benefits?\u201d\n\nArmstrong called Fei\u2019s baby out because the Very Important People who run corporate entities have been allowed to believe that their bottom line is the Most Important Value in the USA.\n\nFei explains that they had no indication that her pregnancy was troubled. It was not a high risk pregnancy. \u201c(W)e experienced exactly the kind of unforeseeable, unpreventable medical crisis that any health plan is supposed to cover. Isn\u2019t that the whole point of health insurance?\u201d\n\nNo, that is the point of health insurance for the entitled. Those who are not a CEO making 12 million dollars a year are not entitled to have catastrophes that insurance helps to pay for. That is the message, because if Tim Armstrong went through this exact same scenario, no one would dare point the finger at his baby as a scapegoat for corporate greed. His baby would have \u201cearned\u201d the health care insurance costs by virtue of being the CEO\u2019s baby.\n\nThe real discussion that we should be having here is how much longer are we going to let business reward sociopathic behavior completely lacking in empathy and even proper public responses. This is not the behavior of someone who deserves $12 million dollars a year, though he did apologize in a letter that reads like a very competent PR person packaged it well for him, including an ode to personal responsibility for his PR failure.\n\nBut Armstrong, like so many CEOs, also blamed Obamacare for reducing 401K benefits. Then he set his sights on a distressed baby \u2014 the perfect scapegoat for corporate greed, apparently.\n\nBoth of these targets are inappropriate, because while Obamacare is a law, it represents access to health insurance for millions who do not have it. When CEOs demonize Obamacare, they are demonizing the people whose lives might be saved by the healthcare access provided by the ACA. This is a grotesque position to be proudly strutting about with, but it is the position of the Republican Party and the top 2% they represent.\n\nIt\u2019s a relentlessly subtle shaming of the people who need healthcare and it is meant to silence them. They are nothing compared to corporate profits. They are easy targets to be blamed for cuts to employee benefits, so that the employees losing benefits blame the distressed baby instead of the real culprit \u2013 corporate greed. This is a micro level of what is also happening on a macro level.\n\nBlaming people for having medical needs is reminiscent of medieval witch hunts.\n\nFei pointed out, \u201cOur daughter has already overcome more setbacks than most of us have endured in the span of our lives. Having her very existence used as a scapegoat for cutting corporate benefits was one indignity too many.\u201d\n\nDeanna Fei laid out the problem with greedy corporate entities seeking to deny healthcare benefits to their employees by scapegoating a baby: It\u2019s her little daughter against Tim Armstrong. That\u2019s the route Republicans are going as they champion this kind of selfishness.\n\nThis is not only bad optics, but more importantly, it brings into high relief the contrast between the values being espoused and it raises the question: Do we think Mrs. Fei\u2019s baby should be blamed for employee benefit cuts? If we do, how do we hold that position while also claiming to be pro-life?\n\nAnd if we do not think her baby should be blamed for cuts to employee benefits, then how can we blame the millions of Americans who did not have access to health insurance prior to Obamacare, sometimes due to a pre-existing condition, for needing health insurance? How can we say to them, hey, you don\u2019t deserve this.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too long ago that Republican audience cheered the death of an uninsured person. That kind of gleeful, careless scapegoating of another person is exactly what those at the top want, and it\u2019s what Tim Armstrong tried to do with Deanna Fei\u2019s baby.\n\nImage: Tim Armstrong/ AP via The Wire", "article_metadata": {"description": "Deanna Fei laid out the problem with greedy corporate entities seeking to deny healthcare benefits to their employees by scapegoating a baby: It's her little daughter against Tim Armstrong.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Deanna Fei laid out the problem with greedy corporate entities seeking to deny healthcare benefits to their employees by scapegoating a baby: It's her little daughter against Tim Armstrong.", "title": "Mother of AOL's 'Distressed Baby' Blasts CEO Tim Armstrong's Corporate Greed", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/02/09/aol-distressed-baby.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tim-armstrong.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-10T09:15:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-02-09T14:06:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-10T09:15:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Isn\u2019t that the whole point of health insurance?\u201dNo, that is the point of health insurance for the entitled.\nDeanna Fei, the mother of the \u201cdistressed baby\u201d that AOL CEO Tim Armstrong blamed for cutting employee benefits, wrote a moving response on Slate this morning, in which she blasted Armstrong for blaming her daughter for corporate greed.\nImage: Tim Armstrong/ AP via The Wire\nBoth of these targets are inappropriate, because while Obamacare is a law, it represents access to health insurance for millions who do not have it.\nHow he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits."}
