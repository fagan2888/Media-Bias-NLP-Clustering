Two teenagers died when a car carrying seven people crashed early Sunday morning.

Cody Hensley, 17, and Stephan Chaney, 17, were pronounced dead at the scene near the intersection of Monte Carlo and Florence drive in Princeton around 4 a.m., police said.

The remaining five passengers, including driver Joshua Bartlett, 19, were taken to the hospital with injuries ranging from minor to critical, police said.

Police said there were only five restraints in the red Mazda hatchback.

“Anytime a life is lost, it is tragic, but it really hits hard when it impacts so many members of our community and it involves the young adults who had

their lives in front of them,” said Princeton Police Chief James Waters in a statement.

The cause of the accident is under investigation.
