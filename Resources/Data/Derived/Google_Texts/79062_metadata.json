The new QNXT Configuration Solution enhances the ability to configure the QNXT platform for new lines of business, new plan designs, and federal and state mandates.\n\nOver the past few months, TriZetto has worked with the Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA) to jointly develop the QNXT Configuration Solution. An independent licensee of the BlueCross and BlueShield Association, HMSA covers more than half of Hawaii\u2019s population and is a longstanding QNXT customer.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate TriZetto\u2019s QNXT Configuration Solution will automate workflow and simplify configuration build processes that are manual today. With this solution, we will greatly reduce keying in configuration data as well as the data-entry errors that can happen as a result,\u201d said HMSA senior manager Marsha Magnussen.\n\n\u201cCertainly, health plans choose TriZetto\u2019s QNXT system because it\u2019s a single-system solution that streamlines enrollment, premium billing, claims processing, customer service and other administrative functions,\u201d said Tom Kearns, senior vice president of consulting services at TriZetto. \u201cBut they also choose this platform because it offers flexibility and scales to address changing business requirements. The QNXT Configuration Solution helps ensure that our customers can scale fast, frequently and with fewer manual touches.\u201d\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act (ACA), HMSA had to modify hundreds of plans to meet federal requirements for preventive screenings and other medical services. The payer also had to stand up more than 30 ACA-compliant gold, silver and bronze plan options for Hawaii\u2019s state benefits Exchange. TriZetto\u2019s new configuration solution should enable HMSA and other healthcare payers to modify current benefit plans and launch new plan designs in hours instead of days, and days instead of weeks.\n\n\u201cWe expect TriZetto\u2019s QNXT Configuration Solution to improve our speed-to-market and flexibility, and we need both to efficiently respond to healthcare reform,\u201d said Linda Katagiri, senior vice president for Member Services at HMSA. \u201cThe number of reform mandates \u2013 today and for the foreseeable future \u2013 makes TriZetto\u2019s solution indispensable for HMSA. With the QNXT Configuration Solution, we will be able to deploy full solutions to test environments and test more thoroughly using Claims Test Pro. We can then move those tested solutions to production, ensuring quality, which ultimately leads to happy customers.\u201d\n\nRead more about TriZetto\u2019s QNXT Configuration Solution and how it can help your healthcare organization respond to the changing healthcare landscape here.\n\nAbout HMSA\n\nCaring for the people of Hawaii is our promise and our privilege.
