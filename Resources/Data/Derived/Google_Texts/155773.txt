A Massachusetts driver was arrested after state police said he drove recklessly while drunk, speeding as fast as 122 miles per hour early Sunday morning.

Troopers monitoring drivers' speed on Interstate 395 in Killingly tried to stop a car originally clocked at 95 miles per hour at 3:45 a.m., state police said. As the driver, Mathew Deyette, of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, led state police on a brief high speed chase, another state trooper conducting a traffic stop at exit 92 on the highway also clocked him going 95 miles an hour, state police said.

The driver also illegally passed multiple vehicles from the right and accelerated even faster, reaching a speed of 122 miles an hour between exits 93 and 94, according to state police.

Troopers stopped him just north of exit 94 at 3:05 a.m. and he cooperated with state police without further incident.

State police charged Deyette with driving while under the influence and reckless driving. He was released from police custody after posting a $500 cash bond.
