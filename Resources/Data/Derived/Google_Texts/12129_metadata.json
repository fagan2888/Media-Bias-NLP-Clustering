After all, Francis\u2019 encyclical Laudato Si\u2019 is an affirmation of the scientific consensus on climate change, and very strong instruction that the world needs to do something about it\u2026 and fast. Most GOP candidates are at least climate change skeptics; some are outright deniers. Most, I suspect, would love to attract generous donations from fossil fuel interests. So, they are having a fit.\n\nThus, the Catholics among them (Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum) are urging the Pope to \u201cstick to theology\u201d and not \u201cscience\u201d (as if one can avoid science where this issue is concerned). But they worry about being seen as less-than-loyal Catholics when they oppose the Pope. They fear that some will see them as \u201ccafeteria\u201d Catholics\u2026 like the (awful!) progressive Catholics who pick and choose the teachings they follow. Ooooh, that hurts! [But, as EJ Dionne, a progressive Catholic columnist for the Post, said not long ago: \u201cWelcome to the cafeteria!\u201d]\n\nIn addition to this encyclical, Francis\u2019 re-affirmation of the theory of evolution not long ago, as well as his brokering of the US opening to Cuba, make him start to look like a Democrat, and not a Republican, at least to the GOP line-up. And they don\u2019t want to run against Francis. Hillary, Bernie, Martin and Lincoln are enough.\n\nOf course, Francis is of neither party; he\u2019s his own person. He\u2019s telling it as he sees it. But his actions sound more Democratic than Republican.\n\nSomehow, this would be humorous to watch\u2026 if the issue weren\u2019t so serious. But, if you think about it, many modern popes have made life easier for Republicans when social issues were at the top of the election agenda, such as abortion, same-sex marriage and access to contraception under Obamacare.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate? Share this great article with them before they're off to college!\n\n\n\nFor the record, Francis re-affirms the traditional church teaching on abortion in this encyclical since he is framing his environmental message as a \u201clife issue.\u201d\n\nBut Francis\u2019 issue emphasis is different. He is pleading for the poor, urging strong action to stem the tide of climate change, and in doing so, is offering a not-so-subtle critique of capitalism, which keeps the poor down and subject to the ravages of the climate.\n\nNone of this is meant to be partisan. It\u2019s Francis\u2019 message as he reads the gospel.\n\nStill, I can hardly wait for his address to Congress. I hope both John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi sit on those chairs behind the podium. It will be wonderful to follow their facial expressions!", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Most GOP candidates are at least climate change skeptics; some are outright deniers.\nA headline in the Washington Post Friday morning said, \u201cA Test of Faith: Pope Francis Puts GOP Hopefuls on the Defensive.\u201d And, well, he might.\nAfter all, Francis\u2019 encyclical Laudato Si\u2019 is an affirmation of the scientific consensus on climate change, and very strong instruction that the world needs to do something about it\u2026 and fast.\nFor the record, Francis re-affirms the traditional church teaching on abortion in this encyclical since he is framing his environmental message as a \u201clife issue.\u201dBut Francis\u2019 issue emphasis is different.\nThey fear that some will see them as \u201ccafeteria\u201d Catholics\u2026 like the (awful!)"}
