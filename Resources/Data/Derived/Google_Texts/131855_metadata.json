In a 75-page decision* issued Thursday, Frank told legislators to reform the Minnesota Sex Offender Program (MSOP) pronto or the court would intervene.\n\nThe MSOP\u2014home to nearly 700 sex offenders\u2014is a court-ordered, post-prison destination of indefinite duration and questionable constitutionality. A suit brought by hundreds of sex offenders claims the program isn\u2019t really about \u201ctreatment\u201d but detaining and punishing offenders who\u2019ve completed their prison terms. As of August 2013, MSOP had only released two offenders ever in its 19-year history.\n\nFrank didn't rule on the merits of their claims, but his decision will allow the constitutional challenge to proceed. He denied the state's motions to dismiss 12 out of 13 claims filed by plaintiffs and called for a panel of court-appointed experts to gather further evidence. \u201cThe time for legislative action is now,\u201d Frank wrote.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton and some lawmakers have, in fact, been trying for legislative action. But their previous efforts to reform MSOP have failed, largely due to Congressional squeamishness.\n\nIn a remarkably obtuse statement, Rep. Tony Cornish (R-Vernon Center) admitted that the MSOP violates offenders\u2019 civil rights...but also that he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cWhy would any legislator touch this issue?\u201d Cornish said to the Star Tribune. \u201cAre you that worried about the civil rights of sex offenders? I admit it, I don\u2019t have the courage to have a sex offender released in my hometown.\u201d\n\nFortunately, personal cowardice isn\u2019t really a sound legal basis for keeping folks locked up indefinitely. It's now up to Minnesota legislators to come up with a path forward or face a federal court ruling that declares the whole business unconstitutional. That could lead to hundreds of sex offenders being released en masse, and something tells me constituents might frown on that a little more than the enactment of a sensible reform policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The rights of Minnesota sex offenders are likely being violated by a \u201cclearly broken\u201d and \u201cdraconian\u201d state treatment program writes U.S. District", "title": "Minnesota Sex-Offender Treatment Program is \u2018Draconian,\u2019 Possibly Illegal, Says Judge", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/21/minnesota-sex-offender-treatment-ruling", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1393007839973.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The rights of Minnesota sex\noffenders are likely being violated by a \u201cclearly broken\u201d and\n\u201cdraconian\u201d state treatment program writes U.S. District Court\nJudge Donovan Frank.
