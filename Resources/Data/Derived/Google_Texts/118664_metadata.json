The UK\u2019s Prime Minister David Cameron is personally supportive, but lost a crucial vote on the issue last week in parliament.\n\nPutin and China are united in their opposition to the use of force.\n\nThe rest, which include Canada, Italy, South Africa and Argentina, are at various points on a spectrum of dismay, even disgust at the gruesome deaths in Syria, but where a reluctance to commit to military action predominates.\n\nOver the past few days, Italy has sent warships to Lebanon, where it has United Nations peacekeeping soldiers stationed, but it\u2019s cagey on the subject of direct military action in Syria.\n\nThe UN has appealed for patience and restraint. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will also attend the summit and, along with UN-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, will press for a diplomatic solution to the Syrian crisis.\n\nEven the Vatican weighed in. Pope Francis sent a letter to Putin urging the world leaders to abandon \u201cthe futile pursuit of a military solution.\u201d\n\nObama is expected to spend a significant portion of his time at the G20 lobbying reluctant allies to get behind his plans for Syria.\n\nThis was not how it was supposed to be.\n\nThe G20 represents two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, nearly 90 percent of global gross domestic product and 80 percent of international global trade.\n\nIt was created in 1999 to restore the world\u2019s economic growth, strengthen its financial system and reform its financial institutions.\n\nIt was never designed to be a proxy UN. But with politics taking precedence over economics, it\u2019s starting to look that way, says Risto E.J. Penttila, president of the Finland Chamber of Commerce, writing in The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe G-20 [has] become the forum where questions of war and peace will be debated and decided,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the deep divisions among the major players, it\u2019s very unlikely that any real progress can be made during the scant two days of the G20.\n\nPutin did say during an interview with Russian television that he did not rule out strikes on Syria if sufficient evidence could be presented that the Assad regime was behind the chemical attacks.\n\nThis, says Steven Pifer, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, DC think tank, is disingenuous in the extreme.\n\n\u201cObama could present a smoking gun with Assad\u2019s prints on it and Putin would not accept it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about evidence, it\u2019s about politics.\u201d\n\nAnd the politics are complicated.\n\nAccording to Pifer, Putin has four major reasons for supporting Assad. First, Russia has very few close allies, and Putin may be reluctant to ditch one. Second, Putin stands squarely behind the principle of non-interference in other countries\u2019 internal affairs, no matter how ugly and abhorrent.\n\nThird is payback for Libya. Putin is still smarting from having voted for a 2011 UN resolution to establish a no-fly zone. The resulting regime change was not something he had envisioned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone wanted to see Obama confront Putin", "title": "The G20 Summit: On red lines and one epic death stare", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Everyone wanted to see Obama confront Putin", "title": "The G20 Summit: On red lines and one epic death stare", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/06/the_g20_summit_on_red_lines_and_one_epic_death_stare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-06-at-11.23.06-AM-2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Everyone wanted to see Obama confront Putin", "title": "The G20 Summit: On red lines and one epic death stare", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-06-at-11.23.06-AM-2.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jean MacKenzie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, economy, g20, GlobalPost, Obama, Putin, Russia, Syria", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd374b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: economy, g20, GlobalPost, Obama, Putin, Russia, Syria, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostBUZZARDS BAY, Mass.\nThis summit, designed to showcase Russia\u2019s status as a world power, is, instead, being overshadowed by the crisis in Syria.\n\u2014 The smiles were in place, the handshakes firm, as Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted his American counterpart in St. Petersburg, site of this week\u2019s G20 summit of the world\u2019s leading economies.\n\u201cThe G-20 [has] become the forum where questions of war and peace will be debated and decided,\u201d he said.\nThe G20 represents two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, nearly 90 percent of global gross domestic product and 80 percent of international global trade."}
