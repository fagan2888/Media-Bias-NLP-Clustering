The report breaks down their number by employment sectors. In total, they account for 54 percent of the 418,000 uninsured Tennesseans who would qualify for TennCare if the state expanded Medicaid, according to the report.\n\n\u201cIt is so important for people and policymakers to understand that the people harmed by the coverage gap are working people,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA. \u201cThey are not people who are looking for handouts, or welfare recipients.\u201d\n\nPollack said he hopes Republican governors and legislatures in the South will make the same decisions as other states controlled by the GOP in regard to Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThere are now eight states that have Republican governors who opposed the Affordable Care Act who decided to expand coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides a sense of hope that this should not break down purely on partisan lines. The states that I am referring to are Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota, Michigan, Ohio, Iowa and New Jersey.\u201d\n\nAnd he said negotiations are under way in Pennsylvania and Indiana about expanding Medicaid there. The federal government will pick up 100 percent of the costs of insuring new people brought onto state Medicaid rolls through 2016. It then phases down to a permanent 90 percent matching rate in 2020.\n\nPollack, who is in Nashville this week for a daylong workshop tied to the 25th anniversary of the Tennessee Health Care Campaign, said another study his organization commissioned determined that 21,900 direct and indirect jobs would be created if Tennessee expanded Medicaid.\n\nAlthough the legislature and Gov. Bill Haslam signed a law limiting the authority of Tennessee\u2019s governor to expand Medicaid, Pollack said he hopes they can be convinced to come up with a plan to keep people from falling through the coverage gaps.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that Gov. Haslam and some of the people he has been working with in the state legislature may be more comfortable after November to put a proposal forward,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cAnd I hope he does.\u201d\n\nReach Tom Wilemon at 615-726-5961 and on Twitter @TomWilemon.\n\nWorking Without Health Coverage\n\nThese employment sectors have the largest number of uninsured workers who would qualify for TennCare if Tennessee expanded its Medicaid program.\n\nFood service: 34,000\n\nConstruction: 31,000\n\nCleaning and maintenance: 26,000\n\nSales: 25,000\n\nTransportation: 22,000\n\nOffice and administrative support: 21,000\n\nProduction: 18,000\n\nPersonal care and support: 11,000\n\n\u2014 Families USA\n\nWho could get coverage if Tennessee expanded TennCare:\n\nOne-person household: Income below $16,105\n\nTwo-person household: Income below $21,707\n\nFamily of three: Income below $27,310\n\nFamily of four: Income below $32,913\n\n\u2014 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/08/08/half-tennesseans-health-coverage-gap-work/13810923/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "They serve food, build houses, clean offices, stand behind cash registers and drive school buses.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "They serve food, build houses, clean offices, stand behind cash registers and drive school buses.", "title": "Half of Tennesseans in health coverage gap work", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/08/08/half-tennesseans-health-coverage-gap-work/13810923/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They serve food, build houses, clean offices, stand behind cash registers and drive school buses.", "title": "Half of Tennesseans in health coverage gap work", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5d1717014f66c22adfaa3cd77e563145882c19da/c=0-75-276-351&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/08/-ronrightcolor.jpg20070427.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tom-WilemonThe-Tennessean/120277341389247?ref=hl"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Bill Haslam", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Bill Haslam", "title": "Half of Tennesseans in health coverage gap work", "author": "Tom Wilemon", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57cc32b0b05345de96c4fb557c2bcb8f78355d0f/c=0-29-276-397/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/08/-ronrightcolor.jpg20070427.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31e7c6b692066bb9b847db4078fc2929e71670fd/c=0-75-276-351/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/08/-ronrightcolor.jpg20070427.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ed9b4d7d0fc92aa78cb64261916b786378908e1/c=0-110-276-317/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/08/-ronrightcolor.jpg20070427.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44d102815a37f5271f30e98aafe5f8f4b49a3a01/c=0-136-276-291&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/08/-ronrightcolor.jpg20070427.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-08T09:00:00-05:00", "shorthed": "54% of uninsured Tennesseans hold jobs", "articleid": 13810923, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/adf240df641fe13e48445defd725618cf2985372/c=0-136-276-291/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/08/-ronrightcolor.jpg20070427.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/298a13ddc7bd4616d79bd80196219b2905a44b27/c=18-0-258-426/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/08/08/-ronrightcolor.jpg20070427.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcba\"", "article_summary": "In total, they account for 54 percent of the 418,000 uninsured Tennesseans who would qualify for TennCare if the state expanded Medicaid, according to the report.\nBuy Photo Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA (Photo: File / The Tennessean )Buy PhotoMore than half of the people who would obtain health coverage if Tennessee expanded Medicaid work jobs, according to a report by Families USA.\nThe federal government will pick up 100 percent of the costs of insuring new people brought onto state Medicaid rolls through 2016.\nWorking Without Health CoverageThese employment sectors have the largest number of uninsured workers who would qualify for TennCare if Tennessee expanded its Medicaid program.\n\u201cIt is so important for people and policymakers to understand that the people harmed by the coverage gap are working people,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA."}
