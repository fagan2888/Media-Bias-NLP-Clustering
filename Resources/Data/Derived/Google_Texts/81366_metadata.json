Below is a transcript edited for length and flow looking ahead to what 2016\u2014and 2017\u2014might hold for him and his members.\n\nQ How do you envision uniting your party, specifically the Freedom Caucus?\n\nA. One of the ways in which I wanted to see if I could be successful at this job was to see if we could unite before the speaker election. We did and I think we all have a very good understanding of each other on what a successful speakership looks like and we don\u2019t want to have a situation where we\u2019re sabotaging ourselves in the middle of a session.\n\n\n\nQ. How long will you be Speaker?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know the answer to that. I clearly didn\u2019t envision doing it in the first place. I know I\u2019ll be speaker until the end of the session. Beyond this session, it just isn\u2019t something that I envisioned so I haven\u2019t given a great deal of thought about that.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nQ. Former Speaker Boehner told me that he thought that by accepting the job, you accepted that you wouldn\u2019t be able to run for president. Is that true?\n\nA. I think the fact that I didn\u2019t run this year tells you that it wasn\u2019t something that I had a burning ambition to do. I have a burning policy ambition, I don\u2019t have a burning political ambition but as far as what this job leads to or doesn\u2019t lead to, if my goal is to become president the United States, I probably wouldn\u2019t have done this.\n\nQ. What do you make of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy?\n\nA. I have a policy of not commenting on these things. I\u2019m not going to weigh in on the presidential elections or handicap or judge the various candidates. I will provide policies, but I\u2019m not going to judge candidates. I\u2019m a neutral observer in this election. So the last thing I want to do is get in to a tit for tat with the various presumptive nominees.\n\nRead More: The Four Biggest Challenges for Speaker Ryan\n\nQ. How do you think you\u2019ll be different as a speaker? Do you think you\u2019ll govern or manage differently?\n\nA. I come to the job as a committee chair, not a leadership person. So it\u2019s not power that I\u2019m looking for, it\u2019s not a consolidation of power that I want. I look at this job from a different perspective from a sort of rank and file policy maker\u2019s perspective, point one. Point two, I don\u2019t want a situation where leadership predetermines the outcome of everything that Congress does and I think that\u2019s one of the mistakes that have been made in the past where leadership tries to control Congress on a daily basis in predetermining outcomes on everything. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way the system was designed to be run and I do believe that Congress would work its will more freely. That means that some bills may come up that just do not pass and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reflection on leadership failure I think that\u2019s letting Congress do its will and opening up the system and letting the members drive the process. So I believe in a more organic bottom-up, committee-driven member driven system.\n\nQ. What legislation do you envision passing?\n\nA. My goal is to make us the party of ideas and to offer the country an alternative plan, innovation and agenda so that the people in this country in 2016 can realize where they\u2019d want to take the country. \u2026 We should show people what our ideas look like in practice so that if we are given the opportunity to lead in 2017 by having Congress and the White House what it is we would do with the responsibility that would have been given to us by the people of this country. That to me is what we have to offer and that\u2019s economic policy, that\u2019s upward mobility, that\u2019s fighting poverty, leading people from welfare to work, balancing the budget, paying off the debt, fixing health care and the entitlements and the tax code, rebuilding the military, the whole laundry list of things.\n\nQ. Boehner told me one of his biggest regrets was not getting immigration done. Do you envision being able to pass something in 2016?\n\nA. No, I don\u2019t think that this is an issue that is ready and I don\u2019t think that this is an issue that we can work with this president on because he\u2019s proven that he wants to go it alone and circumvent Congress.\n\nRead More: John Boehner Gives His Exit Interview\n\nQ. What about tax reform in 2016?\n\nA. Well, I do think that we can probably pursue some limited tax reform on international. I do think that\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been trying to do and something that I believe in advancing. So we\u2019re going to continue working on that but I don\u2019t think that comprehensive tax reform is in the cards with this president.\n\nQ. Do you see an Obamacare replacement in 2016?\n\nA. You\u2019re seeing a massive consolidation of the health care industry denying people choices. It\u2019s a new wave of crony capitalism where business and government are joining together and I do think consumers are getting the short end of the stick, I think families are struggling. You\u2019re seeing less choices and higher premiums and I think that we have an obligation to show the country what a real replacement looks like and that is among the agenda items that I believe we have to roll out this coming year. What form it takes shape, whether it\u2019s a bill that passes the House or not, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s as important as laying the agenda out there, showing what it looks like so if we are given the responsibility to lead in 2017 we have the obligation and the authority to put this agenda into practice.\n\nQ. I remember you once told me that you looked at the Road Map as the first offer in a long negotiation, is this your first offer on all policy?\n\nA. I believe it\u2019s our responsibility to show the country: here\u2019s what we would do if you\u2019d trust us to lead, here\u2019s what it would look like. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s negotiating, I think that\u2019s offering an alternative and if you win then having the obligation to put that alternative into place.\n\nQ. But you\u2019d still have to get those bills through a Senate, likely without a filibuster proof majority, and signed into law by a potential Democratic president?\n\nA. The premise of your question is based on who\u2019s in office. If we win the election in 2016 with a Republican president and we have a Republican House and Senate and we just ran on: here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do if we get elected then we\u2019ll have the moral authority and the obligation and the mandate to put it in place. So I don\u2019t see it as an opening round of negotiations, I see if as offering the country a clear choice.\n\nQ. But there\u2019s like zero chance that you\u2019ll get a filibuster-proof Senate majority?\n\nA. We\u2019re not at that stage yet. First of all we have to offer an agenda and then win and election. Then we\u2019ll see.\n\nRead Next: Paul Ryan\u2019s New Republican Playbook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Speaker opens up about Donald Trump, a potential presidential bid and the future of tax reform, Obamacare and immigration in Congress.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "What he thinks of Trump, immigration and Obamacare.", "title": "Paul Ryan Looks Ahead to 2016", "url": "http://time.com/4150430/paul-ryan-congress-immigration-obamacare-trump/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/paul-ryan1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/paul-ryan1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "description": "What he thinks of Trump, immigration and Obamacare.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Paul Ryan Looks Ahead to 2016"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "paul ryan, speaker paul ryan, paul ryan donald trump, paul ryan tax reform, paul ryan obamacare, 2016 election, congress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Speaker Paul Ryan, Paul Ryan Donald Trump, Paul Ryan tax reform, Paul Ryan Obamacare, 2016 election, Congress"}, "article_summary": "So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s negotiating, I think that\u2019s offering an alternative and if you win then having the obligation to put that alternative into place.\nSo we\u2019re going to continue working on that but I don\u2019t think that comprehensive tax reform is in the cards with this president.\nI do think that\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been trying to do and something that I believe in advancing.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan took time out from visiting his wife\u2019s family in Oklahoma over the holidays to chat with TIME about his speakership.\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way the system was designed to be run and I do believe that Congress would work its will more freely."}
