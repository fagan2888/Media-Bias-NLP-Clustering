Big Deal will be training students to work in the burgeoning New York casino industry as well as the casinos that will be opening in and near NYC in the next several years.\n\nThe three new upstate casinos will hire more than 4,000 new employees and the estimated salary is $20-40/hr.\n\nBig Deal plans on working with the new casinos to assist them in their entry level staffing as well as developing relationships with nearby casinos in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland. Big Deal offers dealing instruction in all casino games including: Blackjack, Spanish 21, Roulette, Baccarat, Craps, Carnival games and poker.\n\nOnce a student has received a Big Deal Dealing Certificate, they are trained to work in any casino in the country, so students can train locally without uprooting their lives.\n\nFor people interested in learning how to play, Big Deal also teaches classes to the general public including how to play Poker, Roulette & Craps, and also a game theory course for Wall Streeters.\n\nAs the only permanent \"Casino\" in the city, Big Deal also hosts exciting Casino Event Nights for corporate and charity events, Holiday parties and even bachelor parties.\n\nNow that NY has joined the rest of the Northeast in opening Las Vegas Style Casinos, a casino school makes sense for the largest city in the country. Thousands of New Yorkers will have the opportunity for an exciting new career. A win win for everyone, said Wendy Rubin, founder of Big Deal.\n\nClasses will start as low as $395 and span from two weeks for the Introductory course, to two months for the Craps course. NY State licensed teachers will guide students towards which games are best suited for their temperament and physical lifestyle.\n\nFor more information please visit BigDealCasinoSchool.net.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Big Deal Casino Academy, on 28th St and 5th Ave, is poised to become the first licensed Casino school in New York state.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/26/new-york-city-casino-school-and-casino-events-venue-set-open-158427", "type": "article", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "New York City Casino School and Casino Events Venue Set to Open"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-12-26T07:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "New York City Casino School and Casino Events Venue Set to Open"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/26/new-york-city-casino-school-and-casino-events-venue-set-open-158427", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "New York City Casino School and Casino Events Venue Set to Open"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9504\"", "article_summary": "The Big Deal Casino Academy, on 28th St and 5th Ave, is poised to become the first licensed Casino school in New York state.\nBig Deal offers dealing instruction in all casino games including: Blackjack, Spanish 21, Roulette, Baccarat, Craps, Carnival games and poker.\nAs the only permanent \"Casino\" in the city, Big Deal also hosts exciting Casino Event Nights for corporate and charity events, Holiday parties and even bachelor parties.\nClasses will start as low as $395 and span from two weeks for the Introductory course, to two months for the Craps course.\nA win win for everyone, said Wendy Rubin, founder of Big Deal."}
