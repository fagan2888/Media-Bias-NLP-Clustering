Boehner's fight for Hill subsidies\n\nWith the federal government nearing shutdown, House Speaker John Boehner stood on the House floor Monday and called on his colleagues to vote for a bill banning a \u201cso-called exemption\u201d that lawmakers and staffers receive for their health insurance.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make sure that every American is treated just like we are?\u201d Boehner asked, seeking to prohibit members of Congress and Capitol Hill aides from getting thousands of dollars in subsidies for their health insurance as they join Obamacare-mandated insurance exchanges.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYet behind-the-scenes, Boehner and his aides worked for months with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), and others, to save these very same, long-standing subsidies, according to documents and e-mails provided to POLITICO. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was also aware of these discussions, the documents show.\n\n( Understanding Obamacare: POLITICO's Guide to the Affordable Care Act)\n\nDuring a five-month period stretching from February to July, Boehner and his aides sought along with Reid\u2019s office to solve what had become a big headache for both of them. They drafted and reviewed a possible legislative fix, as well as continued to push for an administrative one from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nBoehner aides insist there was never any intention to move legislation through the House to correct the problem. McConnell was also opposed to any legislation approach to the controversy, said spokesman Don Stewart.\n\nBoehner and Reid, however, went so far as to ask to meet with President Barack Obama to lobby him personally for help \u2014 using a cover story in order to protect the secrecy of the discussions, according to these documents.\n\n( PHOTOS: D.C. closes up shop)\n\nAlthough the Oval Office session with Obama never came off, a senior Boehner aide spoke directly to White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough about the speaker\u2019s desire to retain the employer contribution for lawmakers and staff.\n\nThe issue of whether lawmakers and staff will continue to receive the employer contribution from the federal government \u2014 estimated at between $5,000 to $12,000 annually \u2014 has become political kryptonite on Capitol Hill. As part of the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers and aides are required to join insurance exchanges that begin operating on Tuesday, the same day the government shut down.\n\n( WATCH: How media covered government shutdown)\n\nOPM initially ruled that lawmakers and staffers couldn\u2019t receive the subsidies once they went into the exchanges. This caused an uproar in Congress, since lawmakers and aides were going to be treated differently than millions of Americans who receive these same subsidies from their employers. Lawmakers and aides argued they weren\u2019t seeking special treatment, but a level playing field with everyone else.\n\nUnder heavy pressure from Hill Democrats, Obama and top White House aides got personally involved in the dispute. OPM then reversed course and issued a regulation saying the subsidies would go on.\n\nBoehner, however, injected the issue into the government-shutdown debate by attaching a measure to end the subsidies to a House GOP funding bill, which Senate Democrats adamantly oppose.\n\nBoehner\u2019s aides vehemently deny that the speaker\u2019s private efforts contradict his public statements on the issue. They insist Democrats were the ones who enacted Obamacare and it is up to them to address the problem. Boehner said the White House should correct the problem though through an administrative solution, stating that no bill to do so could pass Congress.\n\n( WATCH: Rep. Larson's passionate floor speech)\n\n\u201cWe always made it clear that the House would not pass any legislative \u2018fix,\u2019\u201d said Michael Steel, Boehner\u2019s spokesman, on Monday night.\n\n\u201cAs POLITICO has previously reported, Speaker Boehner was aware that Sen. Reid and the White House were discussing this issue. He was always clear, however, that any \u2018fix\u2019 would be a Democratic \u2018fix.\u2019 His \u2018fix\u2019 is repealing\u201d Obamacare.\n\nBut according to several sources in attendance at a mid-July meeting with Reid, Boehner wondered aloud at one point whether he and the Nevada Democrat could quietly slip some language into a bill to end the problem without it receiving any public attention.\n\n( WATCH: Jim VandeHei on shutdown state of play before Obama, Boehner meeting)\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the state legislature, we used to stick things in [bills] and no one would notice,\u201d Boehner said during a private meeting with Reid in July to discuss this issue, the sources said.\n\nBoehner\u2019s aides then told him this would not be possible, so the idea was dropped.\n\nThe speaker and his chief of staff, Mike Sommers \u2014 who was at that July 17 meeting as well \u2014 cannot \u201crecall the Speaker making such a comment,\u201d Boehner\u2019s office said.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Behind the scenes, he and his aides worked for months with Harry Reid.", "title": "Boehner's fight for Hill subsidies", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/john-boehner-hill-obamacare-subsidies-97634.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/29/john_boehner_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare (560),Congress (2816),Harry Reid (1781),Health Insurance (211),John Boehner", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Behind the scenes, he and his aides worked for months with Harry Reid.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Under heavy pressure from Hill Democrats, Obama and top White House aides got personally involved in the dispute.\nBoehner has personally lobbied the president for help in protecting subsidies for Hill staff.\nBoehner aides insist there was never any intention to move legislation through the House to correct the problem.\nHe was always clear, however, that any \u2018fix\u2019 would be a Democratic \u2018fix.\u2019 His \u2018fix\u2019 is repealing\u201d Obamacare.\n\u201cAs POLITICO has previously reported, Speaker Boehner was aware that Sen.
