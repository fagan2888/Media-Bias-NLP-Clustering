Gen. Charles Brown, head of U.S. Air Force Central Command, told reporters during a Pentagon press conference from his headquarters in Qatar. \"We don't want them to strike there because all it's going to do is escalate things.

So the revelation of the deal is bound to set alarm bells ringing on Capitol Hill and on the presidential campaign trail.
