Humana insurance sales agents will be in Boynton Beach on Jan. 24 to help consumers sign up for coverage as part of the company's nationwide "Sign Up Saturday" event.

The insurer is dispatching its sales agents to 225 locations in the 15 states where it offers health insurance that complies with the Affordable Care Act. The company sells Florida policies under the name Humana Health Insurance Company of Florida, Inc.

Sales agents will be inside the Boynton Beach Mall near Macy's from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to help consumers research their options and enroll on site, Humana said in a statement.

The mall is at 801 N. Congress Ave. The current ACA enrollment period runs through Feb. 15. Under what's called the "individual mandate," failure to buy health insurance could result in a penalty.

Humana also runs a guidance center in Broward County, at 7666 Nob Hill Road, Tamarac, where consumers can get information and sign up for health insurance from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Staff members will conduct an informational event and open house — but not enrollments — at that center from 10 a.m. to noon on Jan. 24, a Humana spokesman said.
