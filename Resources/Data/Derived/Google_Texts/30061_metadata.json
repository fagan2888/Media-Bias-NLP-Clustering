Louie Gohmert to challenge Sen. John Cornyn for his U.S. Senate seat in 2014.\n\nSomewhat to Beck\u2019s surprise, Cornyn actually agreed to call in to Beck\u2019s radio program for an interview Monday. Oftentimes, Beck noted, politicians who know they may be challenged tend to find a reason to decline the invitation.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want this to be a hostile interview, so I hope you aren\u2019t approaching it that you are in hostile territory, but I do want it to be a frank conversation,\u201d Beck said at the outset. Shortly thereafter, he asked Cornyn about a comment he made about FreedomWorks being an organization that \u201cuses Republican-on-Republican violence, so to speak, to raise money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I disagreed with the tactic to try to defund Obamacare on the continuing resolution,\u201d Cornyn responded, \u201cnot because I support Obamacare \u2013 my record is clear that I have taken every reasonable opportunity to try to stop it, to repeal it, to block it. But I didn\u2019t think the shutdown, which I thought was an inevitable part of that strategy, was the right tactic to use. And I would classify this as a \u2026 disagreement on tactics among the family. What I think happened \u2026 was Republicans and conservatives got divided, and then we minimized the strength we would otherwise have by being unified.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo \u2013 just a second,\u201d Beck responded. \u201cSo by Ted Cruz standing up \u2026 and John McCain, Lindsey Graham and others going on television repeatedly bashing him, you believe that it was Ted Cruz and FreedomWorks and people like us that were involved in the (Republican-on-Republican) violence?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about the people who raise money by dividing Republicans,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about an honest difference of opinions on tactics, and I\u2019ve tried to make clear the difference between the two.\u201d\n\nCornyn later said that while he may have disagreements with FreedomWorks, he thinks the Tea Party is \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s happened to the conservative movement in recent years.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy simple position is, we need the Tea Party and their enthusiasm and their votes as part of the Republican coalition so we can win the election in 2014\u2026\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI think we need all aspects of the Republican coalition, from libertarians to traditional Republicans to Tea Party to social conservatives, you name it.\u201d\n\nSwitching topics, Beck saluted Cornyn for his bold questioning of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and asked the senator how the U.S. went from a country that \u201cunderstood\u201d small government to \u201cwhere we are today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was the old frog on the stove top, where the heat was turned up incrementally and not all of the sudden, or else the frog would\u2019ve jumped out,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cBut I think the president, in an ironic sort of way, has done us a backhanded favor by demonstrating that his big government scheme \u2014 command and control out of Washington, one-size fits all \u2014 doesn\u2019t work, and Obamacare is exhibit A.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut again,\u201d he added, \u201cthis is part of what I hope has become a restoration movement by folks who affiliate with the Tea Party, and I agree with the principles \u2013 and I think most conservatives do \u2013 that the Tea Party has brought forward, and reminded the traditional Republicans that making deals, bad deals, with the Democrats and liberals has gradually eroded our principles that we all should believe in.\u201d\n\nThe two also discussed topics like the \u201cnuclear option\u201d and the GOP plan to repeal Obamacare, which you can watch in the clip below:\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
