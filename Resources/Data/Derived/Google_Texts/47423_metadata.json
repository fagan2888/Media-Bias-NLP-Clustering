The girl later told a neighbor what had happened.\n\nArvada police began investigating and found the man lived in Ripley, Ohio and that he had previously \u2014 at least eight times \u2014 committed similar offenses against other young girls.\n\nKasarcik was taken into custody in February 2014 by the Brown County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Ohio.
