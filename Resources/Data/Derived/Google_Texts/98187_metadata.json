That remains unclear.\n\nWeiss said he is tentatively scheduled to meet with general manager Jeff Bridich on Tuesday in Denver to discuss this season and the future. Though Weiss has one year remaining on his two-year, $2 million contract, Bridich has been noncommittal about Weiss\u2019 future.\n\nA recent interview on MLB Network radio raised speculation about Bridich\u2019s commitment to Weiss, but Bridich said the interview was misconstrued by some.\n\n\u201cIt is semantics. I think the way I said it was, \u2018Everybody knows that he\u2019s got a year left.\u2019 But what I also said was that we are going to sit down, like any other year, and we are going to review ourselves,\u201d Bridich said last week. \u201cWhat\u2019s gone wrong? What\u2019s gone right? What do we need to work on?\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to focus on that stuff. We are focused on trying to win as many games as (we have left). There is nothing that has changed.\n\n\u201cFor the entire year it hasn\u2019t been on the radar. The only reason it\u2019s being talked about now \u2014 for media, or fans, for whatever \u2014 it\u2019s because we are at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies finished this season 68-94, and Weiss has a 208-278 record in three years at the helm. That .428 winning percentage is the lowest for any Rockies manager.\n\nWeiss reiterated that he wants to return, but said he has received no indication from Bridich or Rockies owner Dick Monfort on whether or not he will be back.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard. \u2026 But I\u2019m signed up, man,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nAsked to assess the ups and downs of the season, Weiss said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve handled it just fine. I will let other people talk about me or evaluate me, or whatever they want to do. I have no regrets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Walt Weiss to meet with Jeff Bridich Tuesday about his Rockies future", "title": "Walt Weiss to meet with Jeff Bridich Tuesday about his Rockies future", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/04/walt-weiss-to-meet-with-jeff-bridich-tuesday-about-his-rockies-future/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_011451_walt-weiss.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_011451_walt-weiss.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-04T13:05:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:25:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfded\"", "article_summary": "Weiss said he is tentatively scheduled to meet with general manager Jeff Bridich on Tuesday in Denver to discuss this season and the future.\nAsked to assess the ups and downs of the season, Weiss said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve handled it just fine.\nThough Weiss has one year remaining on his two-year, $2 million contract, Bridich has been noncommittal about Weiss\u2019 future.\nBut will Weiss return to manage the Rockies in 2016?\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gone wrong?"}
