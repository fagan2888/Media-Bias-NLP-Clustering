Despite all the website problems and the repeated predictions of doom from conservatives, it turned out that Obamacare was working well. Then things stabilized as open enrollment ended. Today, Gallup released new results for the final quarter of 2014, which marked the start of Obamacare's second year of enrollment, and guess what? The ranks of the uninsured are dropping yet again. The percentage of adults without health insurance dropped from 13.4 percent to 12.9 percent:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has accomplished one of its goals: increasing the percentage of Americans who have health insurance coverage. The uninsured rate as measured by Gallup has dropped 4.2 points since the requirement to have health insurance or pay a fine went into effect. It will likely drop further as plans purchased during the current open enrollment period take effect. The Department of Health and Human Services reported that 6.5 million Americans either selected new plans or were automatically re-enrolled into a plan via HealthCare.gov as of Dec. 26, 2014. ....Other signs also point to the uninsured rate falling more after this open enrollment period ends. HHS continues to focus on the financial assistance available to enrollees and increasing the fine for not having health insurance....The uninsured rate could also fall further as more states expand Medicaid.\n\nThe uninsurance rate has dropped the most among blacks, Hispanics, the young, and the poor. It's dropped by only a small amount among the middle classes, since they're mostly insured already by their employers. But even right smack in the middle, uninsurance rates have dropped by three percentage points. Obamacare just keeps on working, and it's working for everyone.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/01/chart-day-obamacare-just-keeps-working-and-working-and-working", "type": "article", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "title": "Chart of the day: Obamacare just keeps working, and working, and working...."}, "twitter": {"creator": "kdrum", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/01/chart-day-obamacare-just-keeps-working-and-working-and-working", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "title": "Chart of the day: Obamacare just keeps working, and working, and working....", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Health+Care", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde162\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare just keeps on working, and it's working for everyone.\nDespite all the website problems and the repeated predictions of doom from conservatives, it turned out that Obamacare was working well.\nIt will likely drop further as plans purchased during the current open enrollment period take effect.\n....Other signs also point to the uninsured rate falling more after this open enrollment period ends.\nThen things stabilized as open enrollment ended."}
