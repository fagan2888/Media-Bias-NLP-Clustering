sometimes we roll into environments where anything can happen!\u201d\n\nACT possesses an array of clinical and behavioral specialists including psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, case workers and substance abuse counselors in addition to a variety of disciplines collaborating to address issues patients experience such as homelessness, hunger, and unemployment.\n\n\u201cOur teams meet four times a week and discuss how to treat and approach different patients,\u201d Nathania Kurtz, a licensed social worker at JMC explained. \u201cSometimes persistence pays off, we\u2019ll go knock on doors every week if that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to help our patients.\u201d\n\nThis program offers intensive services Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. as well as 24 hours a day, seven days a week crisis intervention.\n\nAccording to the New York State Office of Mental Health, 44% of Jacobi\u2019s ACT patients met their treatment goals within the last year and 35% of NCBH\u2019s patients achieved similar results.\n\nACT admission eligibility is determined through a local Single Point of Access process which refers consumers to an ACT team depending on their catchment area.\n\nFor additional information on the ACT Program, contact 311 to be referred to the proper intake service.\n\n\u00a92015 Community News Group", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital\u2019s Assertive Community Treatment Program is an evidence-based treatment model whose experts travel throughout the borough to provide patients with comprehensive services outside of the hospital.", "og": {"site_name": "Bronx Times", "description": "Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital\u2019s Assertive Community Treatment Program is an evidence-based treatment model whose experts travel throughout the borough to provide patients with comprehensive services outside of the hospital.", "title": "ACT Program provides at-home services", "url": "http://www.bxtimes.com/stories/2015/23/23-act-2015-06-05-bx.html", "image": "http://www.bxtimes.com/assets/photos/2015/23/23-act-2015-06-05-bx01_z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bxtimes.com/stories/2015/23/23-act-2015-06-05-bx.html", "image": "http://www.bxtimes.com/assets/photos/2015/23/23-act-2015-06-05-bx01_z.jpg", "description": "Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital\u2019s Assertive Community Treatment Program is an evidence-based treatment model whose experts travel throughout the borough to provide patients with comprehensive services outside of the hospital.", "card": "summary", "title": "ACT Program provides at-home services"}, "robots": "all", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 302605019894237}, "keywords": "mental,health,services,hospital,group,community,program", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "June 7, 2015 / News / Bronx Times / Bronx Times Reporter Evidence-based treatment model provides services and care to the severely mentally ill ACT Program provides at-home services Bronx TimesShare on Twitter Tweet Share on Facebook ShareA team of mobile behavioral health experts are venturing into the Bronx to provide patients with comprehensive services outside of the hospital.\nFor additional information on the ACT Program, contact 311 to be referred to the proper intake service.\nACT admission eligibility is determined through a local Single Point of Access process which refers consumers to an ACT team depending on their catchment area.\nThe ACT Program seeks to prevent such incidences from occurring.\n\u201cThis is not your traditional outpatient service,\u201d Dr. Karen Inghilterra, JMC\u2019s Behavioral Health Outpatient Services director explained."}
