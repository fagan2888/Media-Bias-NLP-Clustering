The gun lobby, which intimidates people, scares people. If you stand with me, we\u2019re gonna do what only one recent president has been able to do, and that is stand up to them. When my husband was able to ban assault weapons. We\u2019re gonna go right back at it.\u201d\n\nFact check: Bill Clinton indeed banned assault weapons as part of his controversial Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. But Obama wouldn\u2019t have even had to think about this issue if it weren\u2019t for the ban\u2019s 2004 sunset, which seems like a concession Bill was readily willing to make, as it helped gather bipartisan support for the bill while setting up subsequent presidents for failure. I am not letting Obama off the hook for his lack of progress, but it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying, and I\u2019m not sure how such a widely loathed figure as a Clinton is any more likely to build the bipartisan coalition she needs to succeed. (And let\u2019s remember how much flip-flopping she, herself, has done on the issue.)\n\nTakeaway: Bill and Barry are human shields for Hillary to hide behind or throw under the bus, depending on what\u2019s convenient at the moment.\n\n[h/t ABC News | Photo: Getty]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Et tu, Hillary?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Et tu, Hillary?", "title": "Hillary Clinton criticizes Barack Obama\u2019s record on gun control", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/287936/hillary-clinton-criticizes-barack-obama-record-gun-control/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2016/04/hillary-guns.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Et tu, Hillary?", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "barack obama,election 2016,hillary clinton,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-18T12:04:15Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T12:04:15Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb47b\"", "article_summary": "The gun lobby, which intimidates people, scares people.\nNow she\u2019s taken a rare pot shot at the president on what\u2019s becoming her signature issue: Gun control.\nWe\u2019re gonna go right back at it.\u201dFact check: Bill Clinton indeed banned assault weapons as part of his controversial Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\nTakeaway: Bill and Barry are human shields for Hillary to hide behind or throw under the bus, depending on what\u2019s convenient at the moment.\n@HillaryClinton: \u201cOnly one recent president has been able to\u201d stand up to the gun lobby https://t.co/Q0sG0xlb2rhttps://t.co/e8jVaU0pr7 \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 17, 2016\u201cBut you know what the most powerful lobby in Washington is?"}
