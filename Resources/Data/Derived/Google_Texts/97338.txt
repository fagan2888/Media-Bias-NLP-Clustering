This deal comes after Sharecare acquired Feingold Technologies

Wellington Management has invested $20 million in Sharecare, a health care technology company founded by Dr. Mehmet Oz and WebMD founder Jeff Arnold.

Sharecare was founded by Oz, who hosts a daily television show called "The Dr. Oz Show" and Arnold, a businessman who used to run HowStuffWorks.com. The company was founded in 2010 in partnership with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios, Sony Pictures Television and Discovery Communications.

Sharecare acquired Feingold Technologies, which aims to help analyze and understand human mindsets and behaviors through voice and text analysis.

Boston-based Wellington is an investment firm that invests in the global equity, fixed income, currency, commodity and alternatives markets. The firm has also invested in Nanigans, an advertising software company, and Birst, an analytics business.
