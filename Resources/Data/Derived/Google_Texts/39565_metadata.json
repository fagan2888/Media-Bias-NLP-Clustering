In return for these concessions to Iran, the U.S. has given and will give Iran billions of dollars more in sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this picture?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe advocated courses of action the United States could take to shift our Iranian policy; including supporting a regime change, ceasing approaching Iran with \u201cappeasement\u201d and \u201cconcessions,\u201d instituting \u201ccrippling new sanctions\u201d and not shying away from the threat of force.\n\nHe called for complete nuclear disarmament in Iran, including mandating on-site checks by officials from Western nations.\n\nCotton said that the current administration is \u201crisking national security\u201d to \u201csecure a presidential legacy:\u201d\n\nOne can only suspect an unspoken entente between the Obama administration and Iran: The U.S. won\u2019t impose new sanctions on Iran and will allow it to develop threshold nuclear capabilities, while Iran won\u2019t assemble a bomb till 2017.\n\nCotton concluded by telling the audience that despite the president\u2019s wishes, only Congress has the constitutional authority to lift sanctions on Iran.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"One can only suspect an unspoken entente between the Obama administration and Iran.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"One can only suspect an unspoken entente between the Obama administration and Iran.\"", "title": "Sen.
