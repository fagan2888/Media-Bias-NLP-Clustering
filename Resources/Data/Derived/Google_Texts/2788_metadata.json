(Who knows, by December it may be shortened to \u201cjoblock.\u201d) It\u2019s not euphonious or edgy, but it does offer insight into the unreality of the Democrats\u2019 predicament.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office issued a politically explosive report this week, finding that Obamacare will reduce the number of hours Americans work by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs. This is different from killing 2.5 million jobs, Obamacare defenders are quick to insist. This will be a shortfall on the supply, not demand, side. In other words, people with health insurance will opt not to work in certain circumstances if they know they won\u2019t lose their coverage.\n\nDemocrats insist this is a boon. Indeed, many are talking about it as an act of liberation (which reminds me of an eleven-year-old headline from the Onion: \u201cIBM Emancipates 8,000 Wage Slaves\u201d).\n\nHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi says the CBO report vindicates Obamacare, because \u201cthis was one of the goals: to give people life, a healthy life, liberty to pursue their happiness. And that liberty is to not be job-locked, but to follow their passion.\u201d Pelosi is particularly invested in this view. She\u2019s been mocked for years now for her repeated claims that Obamacare is an entrepreneurial bill because it would let Americans quit their jobs to, among other things, \u201cwrite poetry.\u201d\n\nI know I\u2019m not alone in thinking that it was totally worth seizing a seventh of the U.S. economy, polarizing Washington, throwing millions of Americans\u2019 lives into turmoil, and forcing millions of others to pay more in premiums and deductibles while spending $1.2 trillion just so we could liberate the Job-Locked Poets! (Whoever seizes that as the name of your new band: You\u2019re welcome.)\n\nNow everyone is taking a bow for freeing Americans from the shackles of employment. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t have job-lock,\u201d Harry Reid declared this week. \u201cWe live in a country where there should be free agency. People can do what they want.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an awkward way of touting a law that compels people to buy insurance even if they don\u2019t want it, during a \u201crecovery\u201d where millions can\u2019t find a job.\n\nStill, it pains me to say Reid has a point. So do other Obamacare supporters when they claim some conservatives are being hypocritical, or at least inconsistent, about the CBO report. Republicans have been arguing for years that the hard linkage between employment and health insurance is a mistake. (It began as an unintended consequence of World War II\u2013era wage freezes.) And Republicans have been offering ways to fix the problem for years. There\u2019s no point in suddenly shouting that \u201cjob-lock\u201d isn\u2019t a problem.\n\nBut there are some things worth shouting. First of all, according to the CBO, not every lost hour of work is the amateur poet\u2019s gain. Yes, Obamacare lets people keep their health insurance even if they quit their jobs to master iambic pentameter. But the law also raises the implicit marginal tax on people looking for work; the more you earn, the fewer subsides you get. Thus, for many people, the costs of taking on more or better work will exceed the gains. So at least some people won\u2019t feel liberated so much as trapped.\n\nAlso, just because Republicans have said that job-lock is a problem doesn\u2019t mean they have to support the Democrats\u2019 solution. I agree with my daughter that she needs a new hobby, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to buy her a team of lions so she can be a lion tamer.\n\nRepresentative Paul Ryan and other opponents of Obamacare have proposed reforms that would have made insurance cheap and portable. Democrats said no because their top priority was never ending the tyranny of job-lockage. Rather, they claimed their top priority was to help some 30 million uninsured Americans.\n\nWhich is why the real CBO story should be: \u201cThat awkward moment when everyone realizes Obamacare was a huge mistake.\u201d The same CBO report projects that by 2024 the number of non-elderly uninsured will be \u2014 drum roll, please \u2014 31 million Americans.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why all of this talk of Democrats as the Job-Lock Liberators is pathetic and hilarious at the same time. Virtually every promise has been broken, every prediction falsified. And now, at a time when millions want work that doesn\u2019t exist, Democrats are claiming victory by trimming the amount of work actually being done.\n\nHopefully voters will look for ways to liberate these Democrats from the curse of job-lock come November.\n\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg is the author of The Tyranny of Clich\u00e9s, now on sale in paperback.
