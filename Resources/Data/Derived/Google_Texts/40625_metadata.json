And conservative voters \u2014 whose strong turnout will be vital in those votes \u2014 could have a hard time warming to a presidential candidate whose positions are sometimes at odds with their core beliefs.\n\nSo GOP candidates will have the platform, to show that theirs is still the party that for more than 40 years has staunchly favored lower taxes, less government and a muscular defense, and which has fiercely opposed abortion.\n\nThe platform can also serve as balm for insiders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, who are holding back their support, waiting to see if Trump adopts firm conservative ideas and unifies the party.\n\n\u201cUsually at this point the nominee has stopped worrying about the base of the party,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. That makes platform-writing almost a rote exercise.\n\nBut Trump ran as an outsider and doesn\u2019t really know most of the party players, and so the platform presents \u201ca real opportunity for the Trump campaign to show what it\u2019s thinking, and to unify conservatives,\u201d Schlapp said.\n\nThe fear isn\u2019t that those conservatives will turn Democratic. The worry is they won\u2019t vote at all, and that could cost Republicans control of the Senate.\n\nTrump has signaled he\u2019ll side with conservatives and back the appointment of conservative judges, lower tax rates, gun rights and a promise to curb or repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut he has also said he favors abortion in cases involving rape, incest or protecting the life of the mother, though the 2012 GOP platform says flatly that \u201cthe unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.\u201d\n\nAnd the most public conflict could involve same-sex marriage. The 2012 platform backed the rights of governments not to recognize same-sex marriage. It also urged a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\n\nTrump has a history of being sympathetic to gay rights, and has stated his opposition to a North Carolina law requiring that transgender people use restrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nThe other possibility for conflict involves immigration. Republican officials have tried for years to project an image of tolerance and inclusion, and made a strong effort to attract Latino voters after 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote.\n\nAlong came Trump, promising to build a huge wall between the United States and Mexico. He ignited a furor during his announcement speech last year when he said of Mexican immigrants, \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs; they\u2019re bringing crime.\u201d\n\nTrump has tried to soften his image somewhat, posing last week eating a taco bowl and tweeting, \u201cHappy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics.\u201d\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t backed down from his eagerness for a wall, but Republican National Committee Chairman Lance Priebus expressed cautious optimism that Trump will continue to reach out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying, and honestly, he\u2019s trying and I will tell you what \u2014 I honestly think he understands that building and unifying and growing the party is the only way we\u2019re going to win,\u201d Priebus told the Politico Playbook breakfast last week, \u201cand I think he gets that.\u201d\n\nChances are savvy insiders will control the platform process, making adoption of any incendiary ideas a longshot. Their mission will be to produce a strong conservative agenda.\n\nAs a result, the outlook for same-sex marriage, and any other attempt to soften the platform\u2019s conservative planks, or insert language insensitive to Mexican-Americans, probably won\u2019t go far.\n\nThe goal remains to have a document that candidates up and down the ballot can cite as the Republican party\u2019s manifesto, regardless of Trump.\n\nRemember, said Schlapp, \u201cthe platform is always a unifying document for conservatives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Party platforms rarely get much attention outside the convention halls, and this year\u2019s Republican version is unlikely to be a road map for a Donald Trump White House.", "author": "By David Lightman - Tribune News Service", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/republican-party-platform-could-be-a-road-map-away/nrJxz/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/2e/93/MY_DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Party platforms rarely get much attention outside the convention halls, and this year\u2019s Republican version is unlikely to be a road map for a Donald Trump White House.", "title": "Republican Party platform could be a road map \u2014 away from Trump"}, "twitter": {"description": "Party platforms rarely get much attention outside the convention halls, and this year\u2019s Republican version is unlikely to be a road map for a Donald Trump White House.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republican Party platform could be a road map \u2014 away from Trump"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/republican-party-platform-could-be-a-road-map-away/nrJxz/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3337320/news/news/national-govt-politics/republican-party-platform-could-be-a-road-map-away/nrJxz/", "keywords": "ohiopoliticsheadlines", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The 2012 platform backed the rights of governments not to recognize same-sex marriage.\nTheir mission will be to produce a strong conservative agenda.\nThe goal remains to have a document that candidates up and down the ballot can cite as the Republican party\u2019s manifesto, regardless of Trump.\nBut Trump ran as an outsider and doesn\u2019t really know most of the party players, and so the platform presents \u201ca real opportunity for the Trump campaign to show what it\u2019s thinking, and to unify conservatives,\u201d Schlapp said.\nAs a result, the outlook for same-sex marriage, and any other attempt to soften the platform\u2019s conservative planks, or insert language insensitive to Mexican-Americans, probably won\u2019t go far."}
