Racers build their own rafts to compete or paddle the river with kayaks and canoes. A festival in front of the restaurant has crafts, water activities and plenty of food for everyone who comes. Owner Rick Lewis says last year's races were a big success, but this year's races have been even better.\n\n\"Absolutely, this is an annual event, we have a great venue down here,\" he says. \"We're going to start doing some more things down here this summer, as well. It's just a perfect place for it under these oak trees. \"\n\nThe festival goes on through the night with live concerts and food. Lewis says they're looking forward to continuing this tradition for many years to come.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Chunky River Raft Race and Festival brings in a huge crowd to the Chunky Shoals Fish Camp.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "The Chunky River Raft Race and Festival brings in a huge crowd to the Chunky Shoals Fish Camp.", "title": "Chunky Shoals Continues Raft Race Tradition", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Chunky-Shoals-Continues-Raft-Race-Tradition-262254251.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/514/DE9/514DE938F1C248AE8056E1BC9EB81123", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4DF/93F/4DF93FCD626945D08E8D775B2BF343F5.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The Chunky River Raft Race and Festival brings in a huge crowd to the Chunky Shoals Fish Camp.", "title": "Chunky Shoals Continues Raft Race Tradition", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Chunky-Shoals-Continues-Raft-Race-Tradition-262254251.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/canoe6.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Chunky Shoals Continues Raft Race Tradition", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Chunky Shoals Continues Raft Race"}, "article_summary": "One of Newton County's most anticipated traditions kicked off today at the Chunky Shoals Fish Camp.\nThe Chunky Shoals Raft Races were a once-popular event that the fish camp's owners have brought back.\nOwner Rick Lewis says last year's races were a big success, but this year's races have been even better.\nA festival in front of the restaurant has crafts, water activities and plenty of food for everyone who comes.\nLewis says they're looking forward to continuing this tradition for many years to come."}
