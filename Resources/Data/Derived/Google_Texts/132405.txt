Sioux Falls, SD

One of the latest additions to a new strip mall in southern Sioux Falls is a women's clothing boutique.

Dirt Road Diamonds Boutique will occupy 1,400 square feet of retail space at Remington Pointe. The shopping center is a Van Buskirk Companies development at the corner of 69th Street and Western Ave.

Dirt Road Diamond owner Kesa Alexander is a SDSU graduate in apparel merchandizing. Alexander has worked in the retail industry for ten years and said it is her dream to own her own clothing store.

Alexander said she got the name "Dirt Road Diamond" from the dirt road she grew up along, on a feedlot in Nebraska.

Alexander plans to open the shop by March 1. Remington Pointe is completely filled up with most stores opening in January and February.
