Indeed, a growing number of GOP governors are acknowledging that the law is here to stay.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act may be the law of the land, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is happy about complying with it. Insurance companies and businesses are still using several tactics to avoid extending adequate coverage to the Americans whom Obamacare is intended to protect. They\u2019re using three main avenues to do so:\n\n1. Offering skimpy plans to workers that don\u2019t cover all their needs.\n\nUnder Obamacare\u2019s insurance mandate, companies with more than 50 full-time employees need to provide them with insurance that meets the law\u2019s standards. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll be subject to a fine. Nonetheless, the companies that have a long history of shifting health costs onto their workers haven\u2019t been quick to change their approach; instead, they\u2019re looking for ways to continue that trend even under the law.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reports, some companies are technically complying with the law\u2019s coverage requirement by offering bare bones health plans that don\u2019t include everything their workers may need. These \u201cskinny\u201d plans cover preventive care but exclude major benefits for costly services like a hospital stay, for example.\n\nUnder Obamacare, the private plans sold through the health law\u2019s marketplaces must include hospital benefits, but employer-sponsored plans provided through large companies are not required to follow that rule \u2014 a quirk that\u2019s controversial among insurance experts, some of whom contend that the law\u2019s drafters didn\u2019t intend to allow that loophole. Consumer advocates are wary of skinny plans, saying that the whole point of health reform is to ensure that workers can afford paying for expensive medical care out of pocket. According to the Wall Street Journal, however, an increasing number of companies are exploring this option for their workers.\n\n2. Making drugs too expensive for sick patients to afford.\n\nUnder the health law, insurers are no longer allowed to deny coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions. But consumer advocates have repeatedly warned that insurance companies are indirectly getting around that by finding ways to avoid covering enough of those patients\u2019 costly medications. This is a particularly big problem for Americans living with HIV and Hepatitis C, who are finding that plans across the country are requiring them to pay a lot of the upfront costs for their monthly prescriptions that can cost several thousand dollars each month.\n\nThat may be a calculated move on the part of insurers who don\u2019t want to enroll sick patients. They may be hoping that if their plan makes HIV drugs too expensive, HIV positive people will have to go somewhere else for coverage. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing policies in place by insurance companies that certainly look like they are intended to make plans look less attractive to patients with HIV,\u201d John Peller, the vice president of policy at AIDS Foundation of Chicago, recently told the National Journal.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new issue; last December, Peller started warning federal health officials that his group was worried about insurers \u201cputting discriminatory plan designs into place to try to deter certain people from enrolling.\u201d But it continues to stoke controversy. Over the past several months, consumer protection groups have filed an increasing number of complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services to correct this issue. And a recent editorial published in the American Journal of Managed Care argued that some prominent insurers are taking it even further and putting generic drugs out of reach, too.\n\n3. Forming narrow networks to discourage sick people from enrolling.\n\nAlong the same lines, insurers can may their plans look less attractive to sick patients by limiting the number of doctors in their network. That can prevent patients with chronic illnesses from being able to see the specialists they need. A recent Associated Press survey of cancer centers, for example, found that many of them are not covered in the majority of plans sold on the health insurance marketplaces.\n\nAlthough Obamacare opponents often suggest that increasingly narrow networks are a direct result of the health reform law, this tactic has been around since the 1990s. Insurance companies say they\u2019re not doing anything to target chronically ill people, pointing out that limiting their networks helps keep premiums down. Still, consumer advocates want the White House to send a strong message that discrimination against sick patients will not be tolerated under the law.\n\nThe Obama administration, which has issued stricter standards for insurers to try to crack down on overly narrow networks, says it will continue to monitor private insurance plans in 2015. \u201cWe are in the early stages of trying to figure out what the problems are, and to what extent they are based on insurance company discrimination, or inherent in the structure of the program,\u201d Timothy Jost, a Washington & Lee University law professor and an expert in health policy, told the Associated Press in August.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Some companies are trying to avoid the patients whom the law is supposed to protect.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Some companies are trying to avoid the patients whom the law is supposed to protect.", "title": "How Insurers Are Trying To Get Around Obamacare And Avoid Covering Sick Patients", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/22/3582886/insurers-avoiding-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some companies are trying to avoid the patients whom the law is supposed to protect.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca-321x214.jpg", "title": "How Insurers Are Trying To Get Around Obamacare And Avoid Covering Sick Patients", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-22T11:32:49+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb56f\"", "article_summary": "Under the health law, insurers are no longer allowed to deny coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.\nThat may be a calculated move on the part of insurers who don\u2019t want to enroll sick patients.\nInsurance companies and businesses are still using several tactics to avoid extending adequate coverage to the Americans whom Obamacare is intended to protect.\nAlong the same lines, insurers can may their plans look less attractive to sick patients by limiting the number of doctors in their network.\nStill, consumer advocates want the White House to send a strong message that discrimination against sick patients will not be tolerated under the law."}
