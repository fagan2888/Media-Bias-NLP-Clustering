Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims.\u201d\n\nRelated: Republicans Avoid Talk of Race, Guns After Charleston Shooting\n\nThat was easier said by the failed 2012 candidate for the White House who has hung up his political spurs than the horde of Republicans jockeying for position to garner the 2016 presidential nomination.\n\nDespite a renewed call by President Obama, civil rights and religious leaders and scores of Democrats to remove the flag in the wake of the mass killings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, some Republican presidential candidates are reluctant to ruffle conservative voters\u2019 feathers before the South Carolina GOP primary next February.\n\nThey may be dodging a non-existent bullet, since no appeal from any corner of the GOP, the White House or anywhere else has any sway with whether that flag flies or not. The Washington Post explained the dilemma this way: \u201cIt seemed, no one \u2014 particularly not South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) \u2014 could do anything about it. This was a matter of law. \u201cIn South Carolina, the governor does not have legal authority to alter the flag,\u201d a Haley spokesman told ABC on Thursday. \u201cOnly the General Assembly can do that.\u201d\n\nFormer Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee was the latest Republican candidate to make the case that it really wasn\u2019t his business to say whether South Carolina officials should keep the odious battle flag waving in front of the state capital in Columbia. During his first bid for the White House back in 2008, Huckabee publicly advised South Carolinians -- in similar language -- to tell outsiders who opposed the flag to go stick it.\n\nRelated: Mike Huckabee: 13 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Him\n\n\u201cI still feel like it\u2019s not an issue for a person running for president,\u201d Huckabee told Chuck Todd, moderator of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, on Sunday. \u201cIf the state government of South Carolina wishes to address an issue in their state, that\u2019s fine. But, Chuck, if you can point me to an article of the Constitution in which a United States president on the way in [comments on] what states use as symbols, then please refresh my memory on that.\u201d\n\nWhen Todd pressed him a little more on the flag issue, the one-time Fox News commentator and author snapped, \u201cFor those of us running for president, everyone is being baited with this question, as if somehow that has anything to do with running for president. And my position is it most certainly does not.\u201d\n\nHuckabee added that with so many other pressing economic and national defense issues, he doubted that the public wants presidential candidates \u201cto weigh in on every little issue in all 50 states.\u201d\n\nWith every major TV network and news organization transfixed on the aftermath of Dylann Roof\u2019s cold-blooded murder Wednesday night of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a highly regarded state senator, and eight of his parishioners at a bible study session, it might be hard to argue that the flag controversy was a \u201clittle issue.\u201d\n\nRelated: Disbelief, defiance in South Carolina town once home to shooting suspect\n\nDot Scott, president of the Charleston Branch of the NAACP said, \u201cThere is no stronger symbol\u201d of racial intolerance and divisiveness \u201cthan the flag flying,\u201d according to The Post. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), a member of the House Democratic leadership, said on Meet the Press that his state continues to flaunt a \u201cflag of rebellion\u201d that fosters a \u201cclimate that allows this kind of thing to happen.\u201d\n\nRoof opened fire with a semi-automatic .45-caliber Glock-model gun and killed the nine victims Wednesday night after showing up at the church unexpectedly and sitting through a bible study class.\n\nBefore the killings, Roof had posted a racist manifesto targeting blacks, Jews and Hispanics on his white-supremacist Website. Among 60 photos that Roof had posted on the site was one showing him holding a Confederate flag and a gun.\n\nBy showing solidarity with Obama and civil rights leaders in calling for the flag to be removed from near the entrance to South Carolina state capital, Romney forced many of the leading Republican presidential candidates to respond as well to the flag issue.\n\nRelated: Can Jeb Bush Unite the GOP\u2019s Establishment and Religious Wings?\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush, who formally announced his candidacy last week, commented, \u201cIn Florida we acted, moving the flag from the state grounds to a museum where it belonged.\u201d\n\nHe said in a statement to the Associated Press that following a period of mourning in South Carolina, \u201cThere will rightly be a discussion among leaders in the state about how South Carolina should move forward, and I\u2019m confident they will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker declined to offer a position, other than to say there would be the need for a \u201cgood healthy debate.\u201d South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham \u2013 one of four GOP senators seeking their party\u2019s nomination, told CNN that he was open to reconsidering the decision to keep the flag in front of the state capital, but added, \u201cIt is part of who we are.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, another GOP presidential candidate, said the last thing the people of South Carolina needed was outsiders telling them what to do.\n\nSouth Carolina was the last state to fly the Confederate battle flag from its Capitol dome. Under a compromise struck in 2000, legislators agreed to move the flag to a 30-foot flagpole elsewhere on the state capitol grounds. Clyburn said today that state lawmakers originally agreed to place the flag behind the Capitol, but then broke the deal by moving it to a prominent spot in the foreground.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said over the weekend that it was time for", "title": "Charleston Shooting Makes Confederate Flag a GOP Issue", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/21/Charleston-Shooting-Makes-Confederate-Flag-GOP-Issue", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06212015_Confederate_Flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/21/Charleston-Shooting-Makes-Confederate-Flag-GOP-Issue", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06212015_Confederate_Flag.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said over the weekend that it was time for", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Washington Post explained the dilemma this way: \u201cIt seemed, no one \u2014 particularly not South Carolina Gov.\n\u201cIn South Carolina, the governor does not have legal authority to alter the flag,\u201d a Haley spokesman told ABC on Thursday.\nSouth Carolina was the last state to fly the Confederate battle flag from its Capitol dome.\n\u201cIf the state government of South Carolina wishes to address an issue in their state, that\u2019s fine.\nAmong 60 photos that Roof had posted on the site was one showing him holding a Confederate flag and a gun."}
