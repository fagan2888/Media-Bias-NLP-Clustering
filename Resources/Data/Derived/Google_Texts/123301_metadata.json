Oct. 10, 2015 (Photo: Brian Bohannon, Special to the C-J)Buy Photo\n\nWhile Booth Days draw thousands to New Albany\u2019s downtown during Harvest Homecoming each year, there\u2019s much more on offer than vendors and fair food.\n\nA car show along the city\u2019s scenic riverfront tied in nicely with this year\u2019s theme of Hot Rod Harvest on Saturday; while a number of children\u2019s activities, including a Big Wheel Race, Baby Crawl, and Children\u2019s Tractor Pull drew families downtown.\n\nThe pedal-powered tractor pull pitted pint-sized competitors against each other as they struggled to pull the weighted sled the farthest.\n\nReaghan Wiles, 10, won her weight division in the event. \u201cShe won two years ago,\u201d said her mother, Leann Davis. \u201cWe come down here every year. It\u2019s nice to see people you\u2019ve not seen in years, and the food.\u201d\n\nA costume contest attracted a number of entries, from toddlers to adults, running the gamut from a tiny Minnie Mouse to a trio of Pink Ladies from the movie \u201cGrease\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe watch 'Grease' a lot,\u201d said Praylie Gresham, 12, in costume as Jan. She said her favorite part of Harvest Homecoming is the costume contest and the rides.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Petite Little Miss, Little Master, Little Miss, and Little Miss Pre-teen pageants were held. Proceeds from the entry fees benefit the Miss Harvest Homecoming Scholarship Pageants.\n\nWhile some of the kid-friendly action took place in the heart of downtown, carnival rides on the city side of the floodwall and a number of activities on the other also drew families toward the river.\n\nThe Carnegie Center for Art & History brought its popular monthly Family Fun Workshop to the waterfront, providing all the supplies to paint miniature pumpkins. The activity took place during Kids\u2019 Day in the Tent in the Sounds Unlimited Productions Party Tent between the floodwall and the river.\n\nWith free admission, balloons, beverages and popcorn, the tent offered a variety of hands-on activities, displays and interaction for kids through sixth grade. Sand art, dog faces created from dog treats, and coloring sheets were just a few of the activities on offer.\n\nSome kids eschewed the delights of the Kids\u2019 Tent for a more traditional children\u2019s activity \u2013 rolling down the grassy floodwall.\n\nAlso near the floodwall a number of percussion instruments were set up by Sound Community, under the direction of Gregory Acker and Hamidou Koivogui. For the fifth year, children were free to experiment with the instruments and play rhythms together.\n\n\u201cIt can go a lot of ways,\u201d Acker said. \u201cSometimes we get a group of kids playing together. The parents love to see their kids playing with others in a noncompetitive way. Some kids don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n\nAlso along the riverfront, the Harvest Homecoming Car Show welcomed any type of stock, classic, show or racecar, antique vehicles, trucks and motorcycles. Scores of vehicles lined the road running between the river and floodwall.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Lomwvd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New Albany's Harvest Homecoming closes out this weekend", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "New Albany's Harvest Homecoming closes out this weekend", "title": "Harvest Homecoming yields crop of fun for all", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/10/10/harvest-homecoming-yields-crop-fun-all/73656488/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Albany's Harvest Homecoming closes out this weekend", "title": "Harvest Homecoming yields crop of fun for all", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/651fe4ca932dfbe2790e16695ac0961c149e9203/c=498-0-2501-2003&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Louisville/Louisville/635800956892548564-Harvest-festivities-151010-BB-00329.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Pink", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Pink", "title": "Harvest Homecoming yields crop of fun for all", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/730767444a7c175fad835bb0baa614e376bfe681/c=749-0-2251-2003/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Louisville/Louisville/635800956892548564-Harvest-festivities-151010-BB-00329.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c9f4216637b824f5a23bd93fa3f264ce29866333/c=498-0-2501-2003/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Louisville/Louisville/635800956892548564-Harvest-festivities-151010-BB-00329.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/74120486e825b0b14281778d92a0176b5b1c951e/c=168-0-2832-2003/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Louisville/Louisville/635800956892548564-Harvest-festivities-151010-BB-00329.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03243c864a4bf32d65b32599345b5f6a6cbf93a7/c=0-312-2993-2003&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Louisville/Louisville/635800956892548564-Harvest-festivities-151010-BB-00329.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-10-10T23:53:21.807000-04:00", "shorthed": "Harvest Homecoming yields crop of fun for all", "articleid": 73656488, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9ce4b0f651ccb848d1005f9d458d30db5ee2f73/c=0-312-2993-2003/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Louisville/Louisville/635800956892548564-Harvest-festivities-151010-BB-00329.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0211d1fe5a58a870f43a2e7d4e998e67cfe337f7/c=769-0-1891-2003/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Louisville/Louisville/635800956892548564-Harvest-festivities-151010-BB-00329.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "harvest homecoming, new albany, indiana, fall festival,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f46\"", "article_summary": "In the afternoon, the Petite Little Miss, Little Master, Little Miss, and Little Miss Pre-teen pageants were held.\nProceeds from the entry fees benefit the Miss Harvest Homecoming Scholarship Pageants.\nBuy Photo The Fiesta Rides as seen from atop the floodwall at the HotRod Harvest-themed 2015 Harvest Homecoming Festival in New Albany, Ind.\n\u201cWe watch 'Grease' a lot,\u201d said Praylie Gresham, 12, in costume as Jan.
