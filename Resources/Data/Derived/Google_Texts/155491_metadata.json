As the article explains, ObamaCare created a little-known agency called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation with the mission of testing \u201cinnovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures.\u201d The law pre-funded the center with $10 billion over a decade, and gave it wide latitude to mandate changes in how Medicare and Medicaid pay providers.\n\nKathleen Sebelius, who ran the Health and Human Services Department when ObamaCare was put together, said this center \u201cis probably the most potentially impactful element of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nFor Sebelius, this is a good thing, for doctors, hospitals and patients, it\u2019s a frightening prospect, particularly since the center is already racking up failures.\n\nJust last month, the center ordered almost 800 hospitals in 67 regions to accept bundled payments for knee and hip replacements. If the total cost of a procedure \u2014 including follow-up physical therapy outside the hospital \u2014 exceeds a certain cap, these hospitals face a penalty. If the bill comes in below the cap, they get a bonus.\n\nBut these bundled payment schemes have a very checkered history, and the new one is likely to force hospitals to scrimp on follow-up treatments, since doing anything more than sending patients home will likely push costs over the cap. An analysis by Avalere Health, for example, found that 60% of hospitals will face penalties this year.\n\nThe center has also been pushing \u201cAccountable Care Organizations,\u201d which is just a new name for HMOs. But the first stab at this \u2014 the Pioneer ACO program \u2014 was a bust. So now the center is pushing \u201cNext Generation ACOs.\u201d Whatever they call them, these ACOs are merely an attempt to force seniors into the kind of HMOs that consumers rejected in the 1990s.\n\nNow, as STAT reports, the center is getting ready to impose price controls on drugs that have to be administered in doctors\u2019 offices \u2014 to treat things like cancer, arthritis or other chronic conditions. Currently, Medicare reimburses doctors for the average cost of these drugs, plus a small markup to cover overhead costs.\n\nThis payment system has worked remarkably well since it went into effect in 2005, balancing patient needs with cost control. But the center wants to clamp down further by forcing doctors to use the cheapest drugs available, even if they aren\u2019t the best treatment. The proposed payment changes set off a firestorm of protests from patient advocacy groups, which called it \u201cmisguided and ill-considered.\u201d\n\nBut given the power wielded by this new bureaucracy, these groups might as well be shouting into a hurricane.\n\nNo matter what happens to the rest of ObamaCare, the grossly misnamed Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation has to go \u2026 before it can do any more harm in the name of \u201creshaping health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Regulations: Here\u2019s a headline that should scare anyone who has been following ObamaCare: \u201cAs time runs out, the Obama administration races to reshape health", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Regulations: Here\u2019s a headline that should scare anyone who has been following ObamaCare: \u201cAs time runs out, the Obama administration races to reshape health care.\u201d Hasn\u2019t it done enough damage res\u2026", "title": "Obama Health Care Regulators Are In A Last-Minute Frenzy To Do More Damage", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/obama-health-care-regulators-are-in-a-last-minute-frenzy-to-do-more-damage/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EDIT5-docs-051116-AP.jpg", "height": 563}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EDIT5-docs-051116-AP.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@IBDeditorials"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "keywords": "obamacare,center for medicare and medicaid innovation,obamacare regulations,medicare part b drugs,accountable care organizations", "date": "2016-05-11 12:24:04:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-11T19:24:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T19:24:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Regulations: Here\u2019s a headline that should scare anyone who has been following ObamaCare: \u201cAs time runs out, the Obama administration races to reshape health care.\u201d Hasn\u2019t it done enough damage reshaping health care already?\nThe story appeared Tuesday on STAT, an online news site produced by Boston Globe Media that focuses on health issues.\nNo matter what happens to the rest of ObamaCare, the grossly misnamed Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation has to go \u2026 before it can do any more harm in the name of \u201creshaping health care.\u201d\nCurrently, Medicare reimburses doctors for the average cost of these drugs, plus a small markup to cover overhead costs.\nThe center has also been pushing \u201cAccountable Care Organizations,\u201d which is just a new name for HMOs."}
