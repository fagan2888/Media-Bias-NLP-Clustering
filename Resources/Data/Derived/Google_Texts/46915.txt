Police in Glendale arrested a man Monday night in connection with a homicide discovered earlier in the day.

Police on Monday called Severiano Almendariz, 55, a person of interest in the death. A search warrant for his home was obtained and investigators soon zeroed in on Almendariz as the primary suspect.

Police said a 40-year-old woman was killed. Officers discovered the killing while responding to reports of a possible homicide at a home on the 1100 block of South Birch Street. The department did not initially release further information in the slaying because of “next of kin issues.”

Almendariz was eventually found hiding in the laundry room of an apartment complex and arrested around 9:45 p.m. Monday without incident.
