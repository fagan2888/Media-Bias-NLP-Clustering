Some people had camped out as early as Thursday afternoon, anxious to get a spot to be seen. Volunteers said about 139 were there before 2:50 a.m., right before they started passing out tickets for screenings.\n\nAfter getting ticket No. 142, Ms. Tyson returned to her car for a nap. By 7:20 a.m., she was back in line preparing to get registered but was bumped up about 17 places because some patients had not returned.\n\nTwo teeth on her left side had been bothering her for about two weeks. She has to eat on the right side, and chewing tough meat is out of the question. Even eating a banana on her 45-minute drive over made her teeth throb with pain.\n\n\u201cGradually, it seems to get worse,\u201d she said.\n\nShe has only 14 teeth left and three of those are broken.\n\n\u201cI have two on the top - that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could get them all pulled and get dentures.\u201d\n\nOnce volunteers starting calling numbers, patients registered under a large tent outside. They then were triaged inside the clinic. The small space was packed with medical volunteers scurrying to see each patient, as virtually every wall was lined with people sitting and waiting.\n\nPatients there to have their eyes checked received services on Friday, but most dental patients would get extractions, root canals and other work done at various locations on Saturday.\n\nAbout 350 medical and nonmedical volunteers helped coordinate the event, which was done in partnership with the Texas Dental Association, Bethesda Health Clinic, Tyler Junior College, Marvin United Church and several local clinics. TJC\u2019s dental hygiene students and dental students from Texas A&M University Baylor College of Dentistry also showed up to help.\n\nAmber Busby, adjunct professor at TJC\u2019s dental assistant program, was among the many volunteers, including two dentists, from the college.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing what they do in the community,\u201d she said of organizers.\n\nJudging by the x-rays she\u2019d seen in the morning, Ms. Busby said most patients who showed up needed extractions and some may have an \u201cactive infection.\u201d\n\nMost of the people at the free clinic every other year are not regular Bethesda patients, but later seek services there. Clinic staff said about half of their dental patients have been referred from the biennial clinic.\n\nBethesda depends on local dentists to provide care each weekday. Saturday clinics also are planned. There, patients can get dental work for about $40. They estimate there were more than 4,000 dental visits last year.\n\nACCESS AND DOLLARS\n\nOne-third of American adults have untreated tooth decay, while one in seven age 35 to 44 has gum disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSince dental care typically hasn\u2019t been seen as a required benefit of health insurance plans and was left out of the Affordable Care Act for adults, those with a lower socioeconomic status may go years without addressing potential problems.\n\nMuch like the medically uninsured showing up in the emergency room when it\u2019s no longer possible to wait, low-income patients with dental problems also seek emergency treatment when disease has advanced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that has to be addressed, because it can impact people\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John English, executive director at Bethesda Health Clinic. \u201cThe problem is dollars and cents.\u201d\n\nGetting the one-time help at a free clinic is critical, but with complex cases, patients may need additional procedures and services, requiring them to return to a dentist office regularly until the problem is resolved. Deep cleaning, to address periodontal disease, could be costly.\n\n\u201cIt could be thousands of dollars without insurance,\u201d Ms. Busby said. \u201cIt could run about $3,000 plus the cost of extractions.\u201d\n\nMs. Tyson is unable to work and is on disability, mostly due to a back injury and circulation problems caused by diabetes. She hasn\u2019t had dental insurance for years. Diabetes and being a 30-year smoker compound her poor oral health.\n\nAfter about six hours, Ms. Tyson was finally seen by dental staff, who took three x-rays. An oral surgeon wanted to get good photos. With the presence of a lesion, coupled with the fact that she\u2019s a smoker, the surgeon recommended she get a biopsy to screen for oral cancer. She said a knot had been on her gums for about two years.\n\n\u201cI hope they do it today,\u201d she said, as she waited for the next instructions.\n\nDentists didn\u2019t perform any procedures on Ms. Tyson Friday, but her dental problems will be addressed at 11 a.m. Saturday at TJC, the appointment given to her by volunteers on her last stop at the clinic.\n\nAlthough tired, she was optimistic when she left just after 10 a.m. Friday - about seven hours after she arrived. Still in pain, she smiled knowing she\u2019d get some help soon.\n\n\u201cI just want it to quit hurting,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "Mary Tyson, 52, of Eustace, made it to Tyler just before 3 a.m. Friday to get help for her painf...", "title": "East Texans line up for hours, some overnight, to get free dental and vision services during clinic - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Health/231820/east-texans-line-up-for-hours-some-overnight-to-get-free-dental-and-vision-services-during-clinic", "image": "http://www.focusinon.me/photos/i-8F9GLmX/0/L/i-8F9GLmX-L.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "She was among the first 207 people who lined up in the Bethesda Health Clinic parking lot.\nClinic staff said about half of their dental patients have been referred from the biennial clinic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that has to be addressed, because it can impact people\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John English, executive director at Bethesda Health Clinic.\nAfter about six hours, Ms. Tyson was finally seen by dental staff, who took three x-rays.\n142, Ms. Tyson returned to her car for a nap."}
