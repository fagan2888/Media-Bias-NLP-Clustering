(Photo by Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nOutside the Oval Office is a small rectangular room with two side-by-side, nondescript wooden desks. In one sits President Obama\u2019s personal secretary. In the other is Brian Mosteller, the man who sweats the small stuff so that the president doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nFew have even heard of Mosteller, but if you look closely at photographs taken inside the White House, you can often glimpse him at the edge of the frame, omnipresent. From his chair, he is the only person in the White House with a direct view of the president at his desk. No one gets in the Oval Office without going past him.\n\nMosteller\u2019s official title is director of Oval Office operations, although a more apt name might be anticipator in chief. When Obama is in Washington, every move the president makes, every person he meets and every meeting he attends has been carefully orchestrated by Mosteller.\n\nHe knows where Obama likes his water glass placed on the table at meetings and whom he\u2019d want to sit beside. He knows how he prefers the height of a lectern. He researches a head of state\u2019s favorite drink so that the president can offer it. He readies Obama\u2019s remarks and sets them, open to the first page, wherever the president will be speaking. He tells Obama when a sock is bunched at his ankle or his shirt is wrinkled, before an interview.\n\nThe president returned to Illinois last week to commemorate nine years since he announced his long-shot bid for the White House, a history-making moment of proportions few could have known then. There remain just a few people who were there in those early days.\n\nUnlike some staffers close to the president who have enjoyed their own moments in the limelight, Mosteller, who first met Obama in Chicago after his famous speech in Springfield, Ill., to start his campaign, has intentionally stayed in the background.\n\nAdmiring colleagues refer to him as an unsung hero of the administration \u2014 the man behind the man, without whom Obama arguably would not have such a universal reputation for cool.\n\nThe low profile suits Mosteller \u2014 he needs to stay focused. The entire West Wing relies on him, and no one more than the president.\n\nMosteller \u201cknows the president very well. He pays attention to everything,\u201d said Valerie Jarrett, the president\u2019s longtime senior adviser. \u201cThe president knows how much Brian cares about him and that it isn\u2019t \u2018I care about you from afar,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m going to ensure the nitty-gritty details of your life from large to small are attended to.\u2019 The president trusts him completely.\u201d\n\nA fascination with logistics\n\nMosteller brings out the president\u2019s speech before the start of a news conference in the East Room of the White House in 2010.

Instead, as a little boy, he would watch, captivated, as President Ronald Reagan would stride up the red carpet to the podium in the East Hall to address the nation. Who is cuing the president as he speaks, he recalls wondering. What work happened behind the scenes to prepare for such an important event?\n\n\u201cIt was something that transcended Akron, Ohio, or my small neighborhood,\u201d he said of his fascination with protocol. The possibility of playing a behind-the-scenes role like that \u201cwas bigger than me and had the ability to affect something bigger than me.\u201d\n\nIn college, Mosteller applied for a summer internship in the Clinton White House. He got a slot working with the advance team and ended up staying for the final two years of the administration.\n\nHe completed his last college credits remotely as he staffed the president and the first lady for domestic and international trips. He loved the exposure to the world, but he didn\u2019t want a career in politics. He turned down a job working on Al Gore\u2019s campaign and moved west to help prepare Salt Lake City for the 2002 Olympics.\n\nAfter several years of doing logistical planning around the world for the Olympics, Mosteller settled down in Chicago in 2007. He bought a home. He was ready to put down roots.\n\nThen he received a phone call that his state\u2019s junior U.S. senator was going to announce his run for president. Obama planned to do two kickoff events. First, he\u2019d speak in Springfield, Ill., where Abraham Lincoln 149 years earlier announced his candidacy. Then he\u2019d come to Chicago.\n\nCould Mosteller help plan the second event?\n\nHe accepted the temporary job, but he made it clear that he had little interest in ever leaving Chicago.\n\nThen he met Obama.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the young politician\u2019s oratory skills that drew Mosteller in, though he was as impressed with those as most of America was back then. It was something intangible that Mosteller now has trouble describing. There was a kindness, an authenticity, he said, that made him want to give up everything to join the shoestring campaign.\n\nBy the 2008 convention, Mosteller had transitioned to the job he has pretty much had ever since: To be Obama\u2019s eyes and ears. To see every event from Obama\u2019s perspective. To be the president\u2019s fiercest advocate.\n\nOn election night 2008, Mosteller waited in the loading dock of the Hyatt Regency hotel in Chicago for the president-elect. He escorted the Obamas to the hotel room where their core campaign team had just watched his decisive victory. And he escorted them back down the elevator to go to Grant Park, where the man just elected would greet more than 200,000 cheering fans.\n\nObama was quiet and reflective that night. Mosteller knew to give him space. He knew when to ask the Time magazine photographer to stop flashing the camera. He helped decide when it was appropriate to put him on the phone with the man he had just beat, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nBut he didn\u2019t quite have everything about the man down pat yet.\n\nOn the elevator ride back down, Mosteller briefed Obama on how the victory speech would go \u2014 an event he\u2019d helped organize.\n\n\u201cAnd then the fireworks are going to go off,\u201d Mosteller began.\n\n\u201cNo fireworks,\u201d Obama said. That would be too ostentatious.\n\nMosteller didn\u2019t flinch, even though at that moment, a freighter from Indiana was waiting in a lake to set them off. He called the crew and told them they could go home.\n\n\u201cI agreed with him,\u201d Mosteller said. \u201cI\u2019m there to make whatever he wants happen. \u2026 There were these enormous pressures descending on this man and this family. I take away the small pressures with which I can contend so he can focus on the more massive.\u201d\n\nMosteller was once compared in a magazine feature to Gary, the bumbling, insecure personal assistant to the president on the HBO series \u201cVeep.\u201d But the unflappable, exacting Mosteller is nothing like that caricature, his colleagues say.\n\nReggie Love, Obama\u2019s body man until 2011, remembers the president asking him once how to pronounce a word. When Love told him, Obama seemed incredulous. \u201cWell, let\u2019s ask Brian,\u201d Love recalls the president saying.\n\n\u201cWhen you see how much time and preparation and work Brian puts in to ensure everything goes off seamlessly, you have no choice but to trust someone like that,\u201d Love said.\n\n\u2018How often does a boss talk about love?\u2019\n\nMosteller, a handsome man, tall and slim with thick, dark hair and light eyes, arrives to his clutterless desk at least an hour before the president every morning, unlocking the door just off the Rose Garden that Obama enters through. He makes sure to fill the monogrammed water bowl for his best bud, Bo, the first dog, who comes to play.\n\nAs they await the president\u2019s arrival, Mosteller and Obama\u2019s personal secretary, Ferial Govashiri, will often turn on music and sing together. (Yes, he does have a lighter side \u2014 of all the celebrities that have passed through the White House, Mosteller, a huge Muppets fan, was most excited to meet Miss Piggy. Maybe even a little star-struck.)\n\nAfter Obama has left for the day, Mosteller is still there to turn off the lights and lock up, as if the Oval Office were a small storefront.\n\nIn between the president\u2019s arrival and departure, Mosteller doesn\u2019t miss a beat.\n\nRecently, Obama joined a cancer research roundtable at the White House. He was meant to give remarks and stay for about 45 minutes. Mosteller was going over the schedule and realized that there was no clear exit time for the president, who couldn\u2019t just walk out in the middle of such an emotionally heavy discussion. So Mosteller massaged the timing so there would be an obvious break for Obama to excuse himself. Anything to keep the president\u2019s day running smoothly.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama, walking on the Colonnade of the White House, is never far from Mosteller. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)\n\nBy this time, so late into Obama\u2019s presidency, Mosteller said there is a comfort that comes from working alongside someone for so many years. He knows his boss\u2019s quirks; he senses his moods.\n\n\u201cThe president takes comfort having someone like Brian around,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cThe president is somebody who doesn\u2019t mind jokingly giving someone a hard time. Brian has the comfort level and the stature to give it back to him \u2014 at least a little bit.\u201d\n\nLike any two co-workers with neighboring offices, Mosteller is the person whom Obama wanders by to chat casually with or vent to during the day. They may joke with each other about a long-winded visitor or Washington\u2019s response to snow. And Mosteller has more freedom than just about anyone to go into the Oval Office unannounced.\n\nOne morning in the middle of a daily briefing in June 2015, Mosteller burst through the door to personally deliver the news that the Supreme Court had upheld a key provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObama raised his right arm in the air, a moment captured for posterity by the White House photographer.\n\nBut there is another, perhaps even more indelible memory for Mosteller \u2014 the morning after, when the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Mosteller, who since got engaged, had been open with the president about his sexual orientation since the early days of the campaign.\n\nAfter the decision was announced, the president walked in through the door to the outer Oval Office, where Mosteller works, and silently put his arm around him.\n\nThe magnitude of the moment \u201cwas unspoken,\u201d Mosteller said.\n\nMosteller was also in the room in 2012 when Obama affirmed his support for gay marriage during an interview with ABC\u2019s Robin Roberts. When Obama finished, he asked Mosteller how he did.\n\nMosteller\u2019s eyes welled with tears, and he wondered whether his closeness with the president had in some small way influenced Obama\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, I couldn\u2019t fathom that I could ever have a partner, and now I was with the president of the United States and, together, we were talking this kind of partnership, and it was not only public but so very normal,\u201d Mosteller said. \u201cHow often does a boss talk about love? Now, how often does a boss contribute to our country\u2019s blessing of your love?\u201d\n\n\n\nMosteller stands in the doorway, holding President Obama\u2019s remarks book before the president delivers a statement regarding the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage in 2015. It was an emotional moment for both of them.

He has witnessed Obama weather the many stresses of the presidency, as he has weathered his own job supporting him. He has watched as the American people have borne economic and other hardships.\n\nThis lesson of resilience will stay with him long after this experience in the White House is over, he said.\n\n\u201cA person can handle anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThat person could be the president of the United States, a bus driver, an unemployed mother of four, a young volunteer, a child with a disability or myself. For the most part, what holds us back is within us. The other parts \u2014 that\u2019s where your community and, in some cases, the government can come in to assist.\u201d\n\nPossessed of this larger perspective, few things can upset him now, Mosteller said. His high-stakes job has shown him that people can surmount life\u2019s challenges and come out better people on the other end.\n\n\u201cIn a way, that sentiment makes the world seem smaller because there\u2019s no place or person or project or adventure that seems too daunting,\u201d he said.\n\nNine years ago, he went with his gut. What comes next is unknown, and he\u2019s fine, even excited, by that.\n\nBut for now, there\u2019s still 10 more months. And Obama needs him.\n\nWant more inspiring news and ideas to improve your life? Sign up for the Saturday Inspired Life newsletter.\n\nLike this story?
