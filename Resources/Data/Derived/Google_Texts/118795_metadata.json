Over the weekend he promoted the work Curtis Young, an up and coming rap artist and Dr. Dre's son.\n\n\"A lot of people stopped walking on Congress and looked up. You can hear the sound of bees buzzing overhead and they look up and they see this big projection the size of w movie theaters of video that we were putting up on the wall,\" said Robert Luscumb, owner of Omnidronez.\n\n\"It's great marketing. And I think that's a great way to advertise. And if they can do it and make money off of it, it's a great deal,\" said Shane Stevenson, a student at the U of A.\n\n\"I mean that's just creative advertising in my thinking,\" said Bob Paulsen, a Tucson resident.\n\nOmnidronez is still in its early phases.
