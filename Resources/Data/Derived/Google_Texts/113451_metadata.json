Tim Murphy, R-Pa., said Tuesday that he has not stepped onto the House floor without a member of Congress asking him what will happen to mental health legislation \u2013 raising the hopes of many that 2015 might be the year for substantial change in the field.\n\nIn a lunch hosted on Capitol Hill by the Treatment Advocacy Center, Murthy elaborated on the Helping Families with Mental Health Crisis Act, which he plans to reintroduce in a few weeks after \u201cpolishing and tinkering.\u201d The bill would increase access to psychiatric beds, allow patients to get medications they need more easily, and create accountability services to make sure care is delivered as it should be, among other measures.\n\n[READ: Obamacare Hasn't Propelled Mental Health Treatment]\n\n\u201cThis bill is the most comprehensive federal mental health legislation in more than half a century,\u201d Doris A. Fuller, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, said in a statement. \u201cIt would improve the lives of at-risk individuals with untreated mental illness dramatically.\u201d\n\nMurphy, a trained psychologist, was honored at the lunch for his activism in mental health.\n\nThe prevalence of mental issues and how it affects the U.S. population is not rare. One in four Americans suffers from a mental health issue such as anxiety or depression, and one in 18 suffers from more serious mental illness such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nOften, calls for reform in mental health legislation surface only during extreme events, such as mass shootings in schools. A recent report from the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that states and the District of Columbia increased funding for mental illness after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, but many decreased it the following year. In 2014 Congress did not pass any bills related to mental illness.\n\nIn part because of this pattern, the public often associates mental illness with violence, but the perception is false, advocates say. Instead, people with a mental illness are more likely to harm themselves, or to be victims of abuse.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to get people\u2019s attention about the issue, Murphy admitted at the event.\n\nStill, the damage to the lives of families and individuals is evident. Murphy points out that people with mental illness are often homeless or in the criminal justice system. \u201cThe stories go on and on with this,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately the solutions aren\u2019t there yet.\u201d\n\nKathy Bruno, a mother whose son has a severe mental illness, spoke at the lunch about her experiences. After reacting to voices, her son was arrested and put into solitary confinement in prison. Only then did he receive the health services she previously had sought for him.\n\n\u201cWhat does he need to do to me in order to get treatment?\u201d she asked at the time, referring to laws that obligate a person to demonstrate they are a danger to themselves or others in order to receive treatment.\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Few Depressed Americans Seek Care]\n\nA portion of Murthy\u2019s bill likely will aim to fix this portion of mental health policy.\n\nPeople with mental issues not only face difficulties with their particular illness, but also are more likely to have co-occurring chronic physical diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and arthritis, show data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also are likely to smoke or to abuse drugs or alcohol to aid in self-medicating difficult symptoms.\n\nMental health advocates say they have been waiting decades for treatment and laws to improve. They point to the Community Mental Health Act as the last piece of legislation that upended the system. It dismantled mental asylums in favor of community mental health centers.\n\nThe problem with the law was that not only was it signed in 1963, but it never truly panned out.\n\n\u201cThe programs were put together with the best of intentions,\u201d Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center and executive director of the Stanley Medical Research Institute, said at the event. \u201cThey were good ideas, just not carried out very well. All we did was empty the hospitals.\u201d\n\nMental health experts accept that a person with mental illness who has adequate medications, services and support, including therapy, can recover \u2013 a term that is understood to mean the treatment and management of lifelong struggles, and is not defined as a cure.\n\nBut not everyone supports all parts of the soon-to-be proposed legislation. Curt Decker, executive director for the National Disability Rights Network, said in an email that the bill as a whole would do more harm than good. As examples he cited the elimination of initiatives such as evidence-based, peer-run services and family supports; the reorganization of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; changes in privacy laws related to mental illness; and the requirement for states to enact involuntary commitment.\n\n\n\n[MORE: 1 in 5 U.S. Adults Dealt With a Mental Illness in 2013]\n\nMental health historically has been the red-headed stepchild of the medical field. The most recent change came with the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care legislation. It mandates that mental health services be comparable to surgical and medical services. Substance abuse and mental health also are now among essential health care services that insurance companies must provide.\n\nBut advocates say much more more still needs to be done. \u201cThe Mental Parity Act has been a help, but really not for people with great mental illness,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nFor instance, a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation last year found that the delay between a first episode of psychosis and the onset of treatment averages 110 weeks.\n\n\u201cEvery day I see patients backed up, waiting for a medical bed,\u201d Dr. Paul Summergrad, president of the American Psychiatric Association, said at the event. \u201cWe would not tolerate this for any other medical condition.\u201d\n\nMental illness received a quick mention in Obama\u2019s State of the Union address last week, but there was little elaboration on whether any substantial change was in the works.\n\nThe issue does appear to be on the administration\u2019s radar for action. In a call with reporters Tuesday that was aimed at enrolling more Americans in health insurance, Dr. Vivek Murthy, newly appointed surgeon general, said he has been doing a listening tour with Americans that includes mental health issues.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "public health", "title": "Mental Health Advocates Rally Behind New Bill", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "2015 may be the year for meaningful mental health legislation.", "title": "Mental Health Advocates Rally Behind New Bill", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/27/mental-health-advocates-rally-behind-new-bill", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/44/28/d29f93d84e1cb43a278a5b81c2d1/150127-murphy-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2015 may be the year for meaningful mental health legislation.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Mental Health Advocates Rally Behind New Bill"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 27, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,mental health,Pulse,legislation,health care reform,health care,public health", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "2015 may be the year for meaningful mental health legislation."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e52\"", "article_summary": "One in four Americans suffers from a mental health issue such as anxiety or depression, and one in 18 suffers from more serious mental illness such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\nSubstance abuse and mental health also are now among essential health care services that insurance companies must provide.\nOften, calls for reform in mental health legislation surface only during extreme events, such as mass shootings in schools.\n\u201cIt would improve the lives of at-risk individuals with untreated mental illness dramatically.\u201dMurphy, a trained psychologist, was honored at the lunch for his activism in mental health.\n[READ: Obamacare Hasn't Propelled Mental Health Treatment]\u201cThis bill is the most comprehensive federal mental health legislation in more than half a century,\u201d Doris A.
