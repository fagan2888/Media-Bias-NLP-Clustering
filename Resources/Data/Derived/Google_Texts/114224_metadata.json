Here's what he has to say about his rivals. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nIt appears to be sinking in with top Republicans that the upcoming GOP debate, featuring star performer Donald Trump, could prove to be a full-blown disaster. Politico has this amusing report:\n\nTrump\u2019s presence at center stage \u2014 his reward if he maintains his lead in the polls \u2014 is likely to transform the first Republican debate into a major media event, bringing big ratings to Fox News, the debate sponsor. By the same token, however, it will likely turn the traditionally policy-focused event into a pageant of personality, which is a potential nightmare for other candidates. \u201cI think you have to assume he\u2019ll be loud and aggressive and do everything he can to stay on offense,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who gave the most commanding debate performances of the 2012 primary cycle, told POLITICO. \u201cTrump is very smart, he has lots of TV experience and is absolutely uninhibited.\u201d Considered almost unthinkable just five weeks ago, Trump\u2019s appearance at center stage is now the most inconvenient of truths for the would-be Republican front-runners. From Milwaukee to Miami, campaign aides are already wrestling with the Trump factor \u2014 strategizing on how to engage with him (if at all) and how to stave off his attacks.\n\nThe Hill adds this amusing tidbit:\n\nRepublican insiders are reconciling themselves to the idea that Donald Trump won\u2019t be exiting the stage anytime soon \u2014 and their main concern now is limiting his damage to their party\u2026it looks virtually certain that he will be included in the first major televised debate, hosted by Fox News on Aug. 6.\n\nFor all the handwringing among Republicans, I think it\u2019s very possible that Trump-palooza might not actually end up mattering that much, if at all, over the long term (provided he doesn\u2019t run as a third-party candidate). On immigration in particular, it\u2019s my view that the GOP\u2019s real problem isn\u2019t Trump, it\u2019s the actual substantive differences between the parties on the issue.\n\n[Column: Donald Trump and the anger of conservatives]\n\nBut the possibility of Trump hijacking the debates raises some interesting short-term questions. Politico\u2019s report notes that the GOP candidates are privately gaming out how, or whether, to confront him directly. Some Republicans expect that Jeb Bush may use the debate to stage a dramatic confrontation with him. Bush \u2014 perhaps more so than any other GOP candidate \u2014 does appear to take seriously the idea that the GOP needs to broaden its demographic appeal beyond core constituencies, and also seems to think it\u2019s possible to do that without compromising his chances of winning the GOP primaries. If so, Bush has a real opportunity to put his theory to the test at the debate.\n\nAnd that raises another question. Matt Lewis argues provocatively that many conservative opinion-makers, such as Rush Limbaugh, are refusing to use their influence to smother Trump\u2019s momentum. Instead, Lewis argues, they are \u201ccozying up to the Donald to leech off his popularity with some of the base\u201d and \u201cboost their ratings,\u201d and in the process, they are letting down the Republican Party. If so, it\u2019ll be particularly interesting to see how these opinion-makers react if, say, Jeb Bush calls out Trump\u2019s ugliness.\n\n************************************************************\n\n* CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS THINK U.S. ECONOMY IS FAIR: A new Washington Post poll asks:\n\nDo you think the U.S. economic system (generally favors the wealthy) or (is fair to most Americans)?\n\nSixty eight percent of Americans say the U.S. economic system favors the wealthy. Even Republicans say the same by 51-41. But conservative Republicans say by 46-44 that it is fair to most Americans.\n\n* AMERICANS SUPPORT RECENT COURT DECISIONS: The Post poll also finds that Americans support the recent Supreme Court decision on gay marriage by 52-44, and narrowly support the ruling upholding Obamacare subsidies by 45-42.\n\nBut in both cases, Republican voters overwhelmingly oppose the decisions \u2014 another sign that GOP resistance to gay marriage and Obamacare may have to continue.\n\n* CLINTON\u2019S NEGATIVES SOARING IN SWING STATES, POLL SAYS: A new Quinnipiac poll finds Hillary Clinton trailing three leading GOP contenders \u2014 Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio \u2014 in Virginia, Iowa, and Colorado, in some cases by sizable margins.\n\nHorse race numbers this early don\u2019t mean much. But Team Clinton might pay close attention to the fact that sizable majorities in all three states say she\u2019s not honest and trustworthy and doesn\u2019t care about their needs and problems.\n\n* OBAMA TO RAMP UP PRESSURE OVER EX-IM BANK: Today President Obama will hold an event with small business people at the White House that is designed to pressure Congress to re-authorize the Export Import Bank, which supports loans to back up foreign purchases of U.S. products.\n\nMitch McConnell may attach Ex-Im reauthorization to a highway bill, but conservative groups are balking, on the grounds that Ex-Im is \u201ccorporate welfare. Obama\u2019s push could exacerbate divisions between Tea Partyers and the business-friendly pragmatic Republicans.\n\n* POLLING IS MIXED ON IRAN DEAL: Yesterday\u2019s Pew poll found a plurality of Americans disapprove of the agreement with Iran. But this week\u2019s Post/ABC poll found a majority supports it, while remaining skeptical it will work. What gives?\n\nIt looks as if it\u2019s all in the questioning. A recent YouGov poll found a plurality backs the deal, and YouGov\u2019s William Jordan points out that the two polls finding support tried to describe the agreement to respondents, while the Pew poll didn\u2019t.\n\n* AND POPE FRANCIS\u2019 RATINGS PLUMMET AMONG CONSERVATIVES: Gallup finds that Pope Francis is viewed favorably by 59 percent of Americans, a drop since 2014. Note this:\n\nPope Francis\u2019 drop in favorability is even starker among Americans who identify as conservative \u2014 45% of whom view him favorably, down sharply from 72% last year. This decline may be attributable to the pope\u2019s denouncing of \u201cthe idolatry of money\u201d and attributing climate change partially to human activity, along with his passionate focus on income inequality \u2014 all issues that are at odds with many conservatives\u2019 beliefs.\n\nHis ratings have dropped among liberals, too, for other reasons, but not by nearly as much.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans brace for a full-blown disaster.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans brace for a full-blown disaster.", "title": "Morning Plum: As Donald Trump prepares to hijack GOP debate, Republicans are already cringing", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/22/morning-plum-as-donald-trump-prepares-to-hijack-gop-debate-republicans-are-already-cringing/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/15/National-Politics/Images/2015-05-17T042738Z_01_JEY955_RTRIDSP_3_USA-POLITICS-REPUBLICANS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/22/morning-plum-as-donald-trump-prepares-to-hijack-gop-debate-republicans-are-already-cringing/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "donald trump, gop debate, obamacare, supreme court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump, gop debate, obamacare, supreme court"}, "article_summary": "[Column: Donald Trump and the anger of conservatives]But the possibility of Trump hijacking the debates raises some interesting short-term questions.\nRepublican presidential candidate and business mogul Donald Trump is on the offense, slamming his 2016 competition \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike.\n(Julie Percha/The Washington Post)It appears to be sinking in with top Republicans that the upcoming GOP debate, featuring star performer Donald Trump, could prove to be a full-blown disaster.\nSixty eight percent of Americans say the U.S. economic system favors the wealthy.\nEven Republicans say the same by 51-41."}
