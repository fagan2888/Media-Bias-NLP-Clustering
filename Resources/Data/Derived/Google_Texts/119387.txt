Two people were injured Sunday after a jet ski crashed into a sailboat at the Cherry Creek Reservoir, according South Metro Fire Rescue.

The crash happened about 4:30 p.m. on the western side of the reservoir, spokeswoman Becky O’Guin said.

“The sailboat was able to make it back to shore despite a pretty substantial gash in the side of the boat,” O’Guin said.

The two people injured were riding on the jet ski, O’Guin said, adding that nobody aboard the sailboat was seriously injured in the crash.

Cherry Creek Park managers are investigating the crash. Officials declined to elaborate on the extent of the injuries sustained in the crash.
