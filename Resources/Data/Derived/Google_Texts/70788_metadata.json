Houses are twice as likely to be attacked at night compared with those in the afternoon. Strikes that took place in the evening, when families are likely to be at home, were particularly deadly.\n\nReports often say that \u201ccompounds\u201d are attacked. The fact is that compounds are a common part of domestic life in Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Members of an extended family often live in several buildings on one plot of land. Between 20 and 50 people usually live in a compound. Attacks can take a large toll on women and children, who often stay inside buildings and thus are invisible to drone operators.\n\nThe drone tactics have caused Pakistani civilians to change their way of life. Previously, when militants would come to a compound, civilians would go about their business. Now if someone likely to be the target of a drone strike camps out at a compound, the civilians leave, returning after the militants leave or are killed. In that case, of course, the civilian\u2019s home is destroyed.\n\n-Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nMost U.S. Drone Strikes In Pakistan Attack Houses (by Alice K.
