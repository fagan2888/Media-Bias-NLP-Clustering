Buckingham residents were breathing a sigh of relief Saturday after a venomous snake was captured — one day after it escaped from a home.

A team of Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission officers wrangled the Asian monocled cobra behind a home near Stratton Road and Kitty Hawk Drive.

While the uneasiness is over for neighbors, many are upset with the snake's owner because he didn't immediately report the five-foot-long snake missing.

"I was livid. I have four kids, and you don't want to them to come outside. I don't know what's going to happen," Amy Redford said while the snake was still missing.

"He has a permit to have the snake. He doesn't have a permit to let it go," said Nancy Hicks.

FWC officers credit neighbors for calling in potential sightings.

"After we actually caught it is when the reality set that we just snagged this cobra, a possibly deadly snake," said FWC Lt. David Barrett.

Redford thinks the snake's owner should be punished. "I think he should go to jail for it. I think he should be fined very highly. I mean there's people's lives at stake."

The cobra is being held by FWC in a secure enclosure until the investigation is complete.

FWC said the owner does have a valid permit to keep the snake — and 16 others he has inside his home.

The owner declined requests for comment.

This isn't the first time a missing snake in Florida has captured attention.

A king cobra went missing from an Orlando home in September. It was the subject of a massive search for nearly a month before it was found alive and well under a dryer inside a woman's home.

That snake was returned to its owner.
