This audience is composed of individuals with skepticism that they\u2019ll never end up as rich as their parents or the people they see on Instagram, who want some kind of insurance that they\u2019ll be able to keep buying iPhones and brand name sneakers, even at entry level jobs. People disguise this sentiment with phrases like, \u201cleveling the playing field\u201d and reducing the income gap. Really, they want to be able to maintain the lifestyle of a doctor while being a high school teacher.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that this sense of entitlement is surging in the midst of an increasingly materialistic society. Keeping up with life is getting a lot more expensive. It also doesn\u2019t help that becoming extremely wealthy doesn\u2019t just happen to middle-aged people anymore. Now our generation has Youtube stars and the Jenner family to compare themselves to.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to work 30 hours a week to spend it on things like healthcare and school. They want those things taken care of, preferably by someone else.\n\nSanders often throws around phrases such as \u201cfree college\u201d and \u201cfree healthcare,\u201d which seems appealing but it\u2019s important to recognize that nothing is actually free. If the money isn\u2019t coming out of your pocket, it\u2019s coming out of someone else\u2019s. The government doesn\u2019t just magically pay for these programs. The only way to pay for these programs is to raise taxes, particularly taxes on the one percent and upper middle class, which Sanders has explicitly said he plans to do.\n\nA lot of people, particularly young people, think this is freaking sweet but then again, we\u2019re inclined to see only the receiving end of this deal.\n\nNow it\u2019s absolutely true that tuition prices are out of control and we pay heavily for healthcare. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that we should just stop paying for it altogether. The lack of accountability for our own welfare is a total cop-out.\n\nThis is capitalist America, not socialist Denmark. We have the unique feature of being a melting pot nation. This country operates on an entirely different set of values \u2014 a very diverse set of values. We can\u2019t come together as a nation and say \u201cwe want everyone to go to college\u201d because that\u2019s not necessarily an accurate depiction of our population. We have a lot of people who really don\u2019t want to go to college or take on some sort of apprenticeship.\n\nAs far as healthcare goes, individuals need to take at least some personal responsibility for their health. Granted, the government should absolutely ensure that healthcare is affordable for people but we\u2019ve already done that with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSanders presenting the possibility of this American utopia where we get free education and healthcare limits the discussion to a gut reaction, whether or not we want to help people. Now, no one wants to see fellow Americans without healthcare or with limited opportunities but we need to have thoughtful discussions about whether \u201cfree\u201d is the best way to go about addressing these issues.\n\nSanders plays on the \u201cstick-it-to-the-man\u201d attitude that encompasses our youth to promote this revolution of free stuff. His battle cries that demand the dismantling of corporate dragons echo our generations\u2019 incessant obsession with the Illuminati and \u201cthe system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a compelling story- the youth rises up and defeats the evil One Percenters. However, it\u2019s important to assess our reality for what it is and not blindly accept a sensationalized storyline.\n\nIncome inequality is real. The rich are no doubt getting richer. But most people aren\u2019t just born rich. Even if they are, it takes a lot of work to keep it that way. The top earners already pay a disproportionate amount of income tax, which largely goes to programs that do not benefit them. It\u2019s important to at least attempt to distribute some of the wealth that pools toward the top, but the wealthy shouldn\u2019t hold the burden of paying for the entirety of the population\u2019s welfare including education. This is America, not Nicaragua. We already have unemployment benefits, EBT and now we have national affordable healthcare.\n\nFor all the millennials out there swept up in the ideas Bernie Sanders and conspiracy documentaries have sold you that America is some poorly working machine because it\u2019s not giving things out for free, think again. There is no reason for us to think that we\u2019re entitled to higher education or healthcare. It\u2019s not as romantic of a notion as a political revolution, but in the end, this is still 2016 America. We are a capitalist nation and if that doesn\u2019t work for you, move to Sweden.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Corsair", "description": "Point/Counter-Point: To see the other side of this argument, read \u201cBernie Sanders is the good kind of radical\u201d,\u00a0here.
