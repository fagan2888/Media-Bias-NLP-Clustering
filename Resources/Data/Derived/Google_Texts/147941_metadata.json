The stage at the moment belongs to the pretenders, Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rick Santorum, Chris Christie and Donald Whatzisname among the Republicans.\n\n\n\nThe stage is cable television. With its omnivorous need for 24-hour material \u2013 the more sensational the better \u2013 cable can't get enough of the fact-free outrage an American political campaign can deliver, which in this \"phony war\" season means Whatzisname and Christie.\n\nDemocrats have their own pretender in Sanders but he talks only issues \u2013 non-stop. And you can't have that on cable; it's box office poison. Accordingly, Sanders is a bigger deal in print than on the boob tube.\n\n\n\nSo, should we take this \"phony war\" seriously? As a measure of who'll win the nomination ... probably not. As a measure of what turns on the base vote of each party ... you bet.\n\n\n\nThe sorry fact is that each party's base vote includes far-out fringe factions. What they preach to appease the base \u2013 both sides \u2013 is politely labeled \"populism,\" a semi-idealistic appeal to the hard-pressed common man.\n\nSounds good in the abstract. Many ordinary Americans are indeed hard-pressed. But actually this kind politics is pure pandering to the blind rage that afflicts an often ill-informed and alienated public. We deserve better.\n\nThe fashion of the moment is to lay the extremist charge primarily on the GOP \u2013 and, in truth, the Republican version of extremism is more an incitement to violence. In Texas these whackos, with an assist from the Republican governor, have even spread the idea that Washington is planning to invade. They're talking up the need for armed resistance.\n\nBut Democrats have their outliers, too, and the seemingly benevolent Bernie Sanders is one of them.\n\nSanders is mad as hell and not going to take anything less than an honest-to-God, left wing government in Washington that doesn't pussy-foot around the need for radical reform. He's Elizabeth Warren on testosterone.\n\nTake the big banks. He'd break 'em up. Health care? He's for a single-payer system, presumably along Canadian or European models, no half-way measure like ObamaCare. Social Security? He'd increase it. And taxes? He'd raise 'em, especially on Wall Street and the rich.\n\nAdmittedly, it rankles that none of Wall Street's six-for-five guys (street term for loan sharks when I was a kid) who brought us the Great Recession of 2008 have ever spent a day in the slammer. Even when paying penny-ante financial penalties they escaped admitting guilt.\n\nBut breaking them up the Wall Street bank would compound the problem.\n\nBig banks are needed if U.S. business is to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized economy. Sure, they get a keep-our-of-jail card in the bargain and that's a bummer, but look at it as a cost of doing business in a globalized economy.\n\nThe rest of Bernie's program is no better. A single payer health program, higher social security payments and big tax increases \u2013 however meritorious someday \u2013 would sky-rocket government costs today and hamstring our current recovery. (Besides, isn't that how the Greek saga started?)\n\n\n\nRepublicans have than their own share of zanies. Rand Paul wants to back away from foreign entanglements and obligations, admittedly a popular theme. But that brings new risks, including diminished clout with allies we need and a form of American isolation.\n\nBut no Republican idea is as nutty as Ted Cruz's U.S. Supreme Court proposal. He'd end life tenure for justices and choose them by election rather than presidential appointment. It's an unparalleled recipe for chaos.\n\nPicture would-be justices mooching campaign cash from big law firms and corporations with pending court cases. And you think election campaigns are corrupt now.\n\nCan any of these loonies win? Probably not the nomination but perhaps one of two of the early states, notably odd-ball Iowa, where right-wing evangelical Christians dominate GOP caucuses and lefty liberals the Democratic ones.\n\n\n\nBut the nomination struggle is a long one and the serious contenders tend to prevail. The current \"phony war\" campaign phase won't last. Bet on it.\n\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @StarLedger and find us on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2016-presidential-election, chris-christie, hillary-clinton, john-farmer, national-news, rand-paul, opinion", "title": "During 'phony war' of primaries, pretenders pander to far-out fringes of Democratic, Republican parties | Farmer", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"During \\u0027phony war\\u0027 of primaries, pretenders pander to far-out fringes of Democratic, Republican parties | Farmer\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/07/during_phony_war_of_primaries_pretenders_pander_to.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/new_jersey_opinion/photo/18294728-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16479955\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-11T12:01:32Z\", \"author\": \"John Farmer | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"2016-presidential-election\",\"@politics\",\"chris-christie\",\"hillary-clinton\",\"john-farmer\",\"national-news\",\"rand-paul\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/new_jersey_opinion/photo/18294728-standard.jpg", "description": "World War II began with Hitler's invasion of Poland but the real war \u2013 Germany against France and Britain \u2013 was suspended for months while the belligerents exchanged hostile rhetoric but not much serious ordnance.
