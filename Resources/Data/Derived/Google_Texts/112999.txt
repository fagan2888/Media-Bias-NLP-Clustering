With Halloween behind us, the holiday season is fast approaching and the Bay County Sheriff's Office is ready for their Project 25 toy drive.

Sunday in Panama City, it was the 14th annual Project 25 Car Show.

The event was hosted by the American Muscle Car Club of Panama City.

Dozens of cars and hundreds of toys and donations were accepted.

Officials from the Bay County Sheriff's Office say more than $17,000 in cash and toy donations at today's car show.

"These people are great they have raised over $75,000 in the last 14 years and thousands and thousands of toys," explained Becky Johns, Coordinator of Project 25.

"It's all about the kids , it is not about us, it's not about the cars," said Sammy Allen, the President of the American Muscle Car Club of Panama City. "We don't kill ourselves on this today, it's all about having fun."

Johns says the Sheriff's Office will accept any donations all the way to Christmas Day, if you want to donate to Project 25, you are encouraged to contact the Bay County Sheriff's Office at 850-747-4700.
