(AP) - Regional health system Avera Health announced Thursday that it plans to buy the Dakotacare health insurance company, creating what it said would be the second-largest health insurer in South Dakota.\n\nThe two Sioux Falls-based companies said customers wouldn\u2019t experience any change in service or access to hospitals, pharmacies or doctors. Avera said the deal allows it to expand its insurance to cover not only its facilities, but to offer choice-base plans, which allow patients to choose any heath care provider in the state.\n\nNo purchase price was disclosed, but the companies said the deal was expected to be finalized Nov. 30. Here are some details about the deal:\n\nSTATE\u2019S SECOND LARGEST HEALTH INSURER\n\nAvera, which owns 32 hospital and more than 200 clinics in a five-state region, has been in the insurance industry though its insurance arm, Avera Health Plans, since 1999. Dakotacare, created by doctors in 1986, is the health care plan of the South Dakota Medical Association.\n\nTogether, the companies will serve nearly 200,000 members, marking the state\u2019s second largest health insurance company behind Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Dakota, according to Avera.\n\nAvera plans to operate Avera Health Plans and Dakotacare as separate organizations, allowing it to offer South Dakota residents a variety of options and price points, said Rob Bates, senior vice president of Avera Health.\n\nKevin Bjordahl, Dakotacare\u2019s board chairman, added: \u201cFor Dakotacare subscribers, nothing will change.\u201d\n\nSouth Dakota Department of Labor Secretary Marcia Hultman, whose agency oversees the Division of Insurance, said she doesn\u2019t anticipate any great impacts to health insurance competition.\n\n\u201cAvera has indicated it is committed to maintaining the Dakotacare brand, its network and agent relationships,\u201d she said.\n\nHEALTH CARE ACT CHALLENGES\n\nDakotacare began discussions with Avera after its board realized it would be beneficial to partner with a larger health care system, especially after the federal health care law took effect.\n\nThe company announced in October that it could no longer afford to offer individual polices through the federal health insurance marketplace. Bjordahl said there have been instances in which people have walked into a hospital, signed up for insurance and used services for a major disease, and then stopped paying their premiums after being discharged.\n\n\u201cThese challenges of the Affordable Care Act have made it necessary to partner with somebody bigger,\u201d Bjordahl said.\n\nCOMPANY CHANGES?\n\nBates said there were no immediate plans for staffing changes within the two insurers, which each employ about 120 people. But he said Avera will look for efficiencies, saying: \u201cWe probably don\u2019t need two of everything.\u201d\n\nBates said he doesn\u2019t know how that may affect future staffing, but he said Avera is a large, diverse system that would have sufficient opportunities for anyone affected by structural changes.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dirk Lammers on Twitter at http://twitter.com/ddlammers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Regional health system Avera Health announced Thursday that it plans to buy the Dakotacare health insurance company, creating what it said would be the second-largest health insurer in South Dakota.", "Author": "DIRK LAMMERS", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/19/avera-health-buying-the-dakotacare-health-insuranc/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Regional health system Avera Health announced Thursday that it plans to buy the Dakotacare health insurance company, creating what it said would be the second-largest health insurer in South Dakota.", "title": "Avera Health buying the Dakotacare health insurance company"}, "twitter": {"title": "Avera Health buying the Dakotacare health insurance company", "description": "Regional health system Avera Health announced Thursday that it plans to buy the Dakotacare health insurance company, creating what it said would be the second-largest health insurer in South Dakota.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "(AP) - Regional health system Avera Health announced Thursday that it plans to buy the Dakotacare health insurance company, creating what it said would be the second-largest health insurer in South Dakota.\nHEALTH CARE ACT CHALLENGESDakotacare began discussions with Avera after its board realized it would be beneficial to partner with a larger health care system, especially after the federal health care law took effect.\nAvera plans to operate Avera Health Plans and Dakotacare as separate organizations, allowing it to offer South Dakota residents a variety of options and price points, said Rob Bates, senior vice president of Avera Health.\nThe company announced in October that it could no longer afford to offer individual polices through the federal health insurance marketplace.\nHere are some details about the deal:STATE\u2019S SECOND LARGEST HEALTH INSURERAvera, which owns 32 hospital and more than 200 clinics in a five-state region, has been in the insurance industry though its insurance arm, Avera Health Plans, since 1999."}
