Terms were not disclosed.\n\nOwner and CEO Bill Auchmoody said Partnership\u2019s growth in recent years made the timing right for a sale. He said the deal with CorTech, ranked the seventh fastest-growing U.S. staffing firm in 2015 by Staffing Industry Analysts, will add resources that will broaden Partnership\u2019s reach and assist with the company\u2019s regulatory compliance.\n\n\u201cIt was a point in time where you either join forces and get gobbled up so that you\u2019ve got the resources at hand, or you\u2019ve got to do a lot of reinvestment in the company so that you can stay compliant with the Affordable Care Act or whatever legislation is going on,\u201d Auchmoody said.\n\n\u201cIt just seemed to make more sense to me to align with a company that already had those pieces in place.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2007, Partnership focuses primarily on light industrial job placements and also provides clerical and call center staffing. Local clients include the Vitamin Shoppe distribution center in Ashland, print services company Cenveo and cold storage business Lineage Logistics.\n\nAuchmoody said Partnership employs between 250 and 300 workers weekly and places about 1,000 workers annually. Operations are overseen by an in-house staff of seven, all of whom will stay on as part of the acquisition. Auchmoody will stay on as a regional vice president for CorTech.\n\nThe firm will continue under the banner: Partnership Staffing \u2013 A CorTech Company. Operations will continue at Partnership\u2019s 3,500-square-foot office at 2211 Dickens Road.\n\nWhile customers will see little change in operations, Auchmoody said CorTech will bring valuable resources to Partnership, such as access to more job boards, exposure to more job seekers, in-house legal counsel, a human resources team, and invoicing from in-house, rather than using a third-party vendor.\n\n\u201cThe real advantage of joining forces with somebody as big as CorTech is we\u2019ll get access to the Affordable Care Act team that can help us navigate how to distribute our health insurance benefits to the 1,000 people that we\u2019ll employ during the course of a year,\u201d he said.\n\nAuchmoody said his company saw about 25 percent growth last year and remains among Richmond\u2019s largest private employers. In 2013 \u2013 the most recent year it was listed \u2013 it placed 12th on Richmond BizSense\u2019s ranking of privately held companies based on full-time local employees.\n\nThe Partnership deal is the latest in an effort by CorTech to add up to $110 million in sales through acquisitions by the end of 2016. In recent months, the firm has made similar acquisitions in Wisconsin, Wyoming and California, bringing its total field offices to 13.\n\nKathy Greco, a senior vice president with CorTech International, said the company had been looking to enter the Richmond market for some time and found a good fit with Partnership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great market,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had clients that have asked us in the past if we had a presence there.\u201d\n\nThe transaction was brokered by locally based Transact Capital, which also advised the recent merger of two other local staffing firms: Lawyer\u2019s Staffing and Accent Professional Recruiting. Managing Director Patrick Morin represented Transact Capital as financial adviser in both deals.\n\nMorin said Partnership attracted interest from across the country, as well as some international inquiries. He said those companies remain keen on entering the Richmond market.\n\n\u201cRichmond has been this little quiet town for so long that I think everybody is starting to realize what a great place not only Virginia is for business but Richmond is for business,\u201d Morin said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Richmond BizSense", "description": "A Henrico staffing business has been swept up in an Atlanta company\u2019s expansion plan, adding to its in-house resources and winning the backing of one of the country\u2019s largest staffing f\u2026", "title": "Expanding Ga. staffing company acquires local firm", "url": "http://richmondbizsense.com/2016/01/06/expanding-ga-staffing-company-acquires-local-firm/", "image": {"width": 880, "identifier": "http://richmondbizsense.com/images/Bill-Auchmoody-Patnership-staffing-ftd.jpg", "height": 485}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-06T11:04:45-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T23:38:14-07:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://richmondbizsense.com/images/Bill-Auchmoody-Patnership-staffing-ftd.jpg?w=640", "site": "@rvabizsense", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A Henrico staffing business has been swept up in an Atlanta company's expansion plan, adding to its in-house resources and winning the backing of one of the"}, "article_summary": "Expanding Ga. staffing company acquires local firm Jonathan SpiersAnother local staffing firm is going to work for a larger company \u2013 this time for a recruiter who came calling from out of town.\nThe firm will continue under the banner: Partnership Staffing \u2013 A CorTech Company.\nPartnership Staffing, an 8-year-old company based in Henrico, has been purchased by Atlanta-based CorTech LLC, a national staffing and recruiting firm that has been on an acquisition streak lately.\nHe said the deal with CorTech, ranked the seventh fastest-growing U.S. staffing firm in 2015 by Staffing Industry Analysts, will add resources that will broaden Partnership\u2019s reach and assist with the company\u2019s regulatory compliance.\nLocal clients include the Vitamin Shoppe distribution center in Ashland, print services company Cenveo and cold storage business Lineage Logistics."}
