Firefighters from across the state participated in a memorial stair climb to honor the fallen firefighters in New York City during 9/11.

The departments climbed up 20 flights of stairs in the downtown Wichita skyscraper called the Epic Center; this did that five and a half times to represent the the flights of stairs in the twin towers.

According to the Wichita 9/11 Memorial Stair Climb event director, over 45 firefighting agencies participated in the event on Saturday.

Each firefighter was climbing the stairs for a New York City firefighter that died in the towers collapse.

"When you are climbing for the firefighter that died in 9/11, when you are in the stairwells and you see those pictures, we have all 343 firefighters who died pictures' in the stairwells and pictures kids drew to encourage firefighters, you feel like you were there that day. You start to understand what they were thinking, not knowing if they were going to make it or not and going up into an unknown situation," said Tatyana Pyzhov, the Wichita 9/11 Memorial Stair Climb Event Director

There was a piece of the World Trade Center's structure that was brought in that each firefighter touched to remember the day and honor the fallen.

"It's just a brotherhood of fire departments, we hang together and support the others," said one of the firefighters climbing the stairs.
