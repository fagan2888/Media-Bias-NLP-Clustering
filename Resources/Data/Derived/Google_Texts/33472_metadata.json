Looking over his catalogued relationship history, you can see how there\u2019s a point up to which it made perfect sense that all of DiCaprio\u2019s partners were in their early 20s (and blond, and supermodels, but OK)\u2014he was of a similar age, and a handsome young man in Hollywood, and life is only so short, after all. But then DiCaprio ages out of his early 30s, but the women stay the same age, and it just keeps going, and going, until Slate notices and writes a piece about it. But as weird as it feels, from the outside, this is Hollywood\u2014where, over the course of a few years, 1990-born Jennifer Lawrence played opposite romantic leads Bradley Cooper (1975), Christian Bale (1974), and \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez (1977).\n\nIn the \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d sketch, Schumer (34) runs into Tina Fey (45), Patricia Arquette (47), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (54). The three are celebrating Louis-Dreyus\u2019 \u201clast fuckable day,\u201d the day where the entertainment industry no longer deems a woman fit for romantic interest opposite a man. As the three older women patiently explain to Schumer, there is no equivalent for men, even when they\u2019re \u201clike a hundred, and only white spiders coming out.\u201d But unsaid in the sketch is that while the women are talking about Hollywood as a whole, they are specifically talking about film, in opposition to television, the medium they\u2019re currently on.\n\nArquette, who had just won an Academy Award for \u201cBoyhood\u201d and devoted her onstage speech to sexism in Hollywood\u2014after an Oscar campaign where an insider speaking to the Hollywood Reporter confessed to voting for her because she pledged not to have plastic surgery for the 12 years the movie was filming\u2014spent the years between 2005 and 2011 paying the bills with \u201cMedium,\u201d an NBC drama where she played a psychic. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has just been in a handful of films, but has won six Emmys over 20 years for her television roles, and currently is the lead on one of HBO\u2019s most acclaimed comedies. And though Tina Fey has become a film actress on other people\u2019s projects, with lightweight comedies like \u201cSisters,\u201d \u201cBaby Mama\u201d and \u201cDate Night,\u201d she is in charge on television, as a writer and showrunner\u2014first with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201c30 Rock,\u201d and now with \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d There is a difference between the \u201crules\u201d for women in film and women in TV.\n\nThis year\u2019s Golden Globes\u2014our annual chance to look at both television and film accolades side by side\u2014put that on incredible display. We know that one of the reasons television has drawn very talented mid-career actresses is because they were able to find employment there, when they couldn\u2019t in film. What is perhaps more surprising is that nearly a decade after the mid-aughts, when film actresses like Arquette, Kyra Sedgwick, Helen Mirren and more found a place on television after aging out of Hollywood\u2019s romantic-lead standards, the age gap between Hollywood\u2019s men and women in film\u2014and between women in film and women in television\u2014is still astonishingly wide.\n\nAnd this brings me back to Leonardo DiCaprio. Nowhere is this age disparity more apparent, this year, than in the most prestigious category of the Golden Globes\u2014motion picture, drama. The median age of the nominees for best actor is 41, with DiCaprio, who is nominated for \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d The median age for the best actress nominees? Twenty-seven, with Alicia Vikander, for \u201cThe Danish Girl.\u201d Saoirse Ronan is just 20; Brie Larson is 26. The next oldest is Rooney Mara, at 30. Cate Blanchett has proven to be a rare gem of a performer, both with her on-screen work like \u201cCarol\u201d and her off-screen glamour. But her greatest feat yet might be making it to the best actress nominees this year at the apparent ripe old age of 46.\n\nMedian ages for 2016 Golden Globes nominees, by category:\n\nFILM\n\nBest actress, motion picture, drama: 27, Alicia Vikander\n\nBest actor, motion picture, drama: 41, Leonardo DiCaprio\n\nBest actress, motion picture, comedy: 34, Amy Schumer\n\nBest actor, motion picture, comedy: 48, Mark Ruffalo\n\nSupporting actor, motion picture: 53, Jennifer Jason leigh\n\nSupporting actor, motion picture: 43, Idris Elba", "article_metadata": {"description": "The median age of nominees in all but one of TV\u2019s actress categories this year is over 40\u2014not so at the movies", "title": "Doing the Golden Globes math: Maybe there\u2019s no \u201clast f**kable day\u201d for TV actresses \u2014\u00a0but film is a different story", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The median age of nominees in all but one of TV\u2019s actress categories this year is over 40\u2014not so at the movies", "title": "Doing the Golden Globes math: Maybe there\u2019s no \u201clast f**kable day\u201d for TV actresses \u2014\u00a0but film is a different story", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/11/doing_the_golden_globes_math_maybe_theres_no_last_fkable_day_for_tv_actresses_but_film_is_a_different_story/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/empire_veep_sq.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The median age of nominees in all but one of TV\u2019s actress categories this year is over 40\u2014not so at the movies", "title": "Doing the Golden Globes math: Maybe there\u2019s no \u201clast f**kable day\u201d for TV actresses \u2014\u00a0but film is a different story", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/empire_veep_sq.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alicia Vikander, Amy Schumer, Carol, cate blanchett, Film, Golden Globes, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Leonardo DiCaprio, Melissa McCarthy, patricia arquette, saorise ronan, Tina Fey, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Median ages for 2016 Golden Globes nominees, by category:FILMBest actress, motion picture, drama: 27, Alicia VikanderBest actor, motion picture, drama: 41, Leonardo DiCaprioBest actress, motion picture, comedy: 34, Amy SchumerBest actor, motion picture, comedy: 48, Mark RuffaloSupporting actor, motion picture: 53, Jennifer Jason leighSupporting actor, motion picture: 43, Idris Elba\nIn the \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d sketch, Schumer (34) runs into Tina Fey (45), Patricia Arquette (47), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (54).\nThis year\u2019s Golden Globes\u2014our annual chance to look at both television and film accolades side by side\u2014put that on incredible display.\nNowhere is this age disparity more apparent, this year, than in the most prestigious category of the Golden Globes\u2014motion picture, drama.\nThe three are celebrating Louis-Dreyus\u2019 \u201clast fuckable day,\u201d the day where the entertainment industry no longer deems a woman fit for romantic interest opposite a man."}
