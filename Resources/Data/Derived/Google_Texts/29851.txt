Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul unleashed on the White House Wednesday after press secretary Josh Earnest suggested Republican front-runner Donald Trump disqualified himself from the 2016 horse race for suggesting the U.S. should temporarily block Muslims from entry.

"What he said is disqualifying. And any Republican who's too fearful of the Republican base to admit it has no business serving as president either," Earnest told reporters during a press briefing Tuesday.

Paul, whose own amendment to halt visa issuance to individuals seeking to come to the U.S. from 32 Muslim-majority countries failed 10-89 to pass the Senate last Thursday, decided to respond to Earnest's claim on Twitter with a tirade demonstrating why, he believes, President Obama is "unqualified" for the Oval Office.
