Including an additional guesthouse and the furnishings, Mr. Fuller said he spent closer to $7.5 million. The property, pictured at center, spans roughly 3.5 acres. Dorian Aerial & Architectural Photograph \u2026\n\nBuilt in 1915, the property has been dubbed 'Century Oaks,' because of the old-growth oak trees that line the property, Mr. Fuller said. Some trees on the property are several hundred years old, he said. Jim Sykes \u2026\n\nMr. Fuller works in the transportation industry and owns car dealerships, he said. A waterfront view from the Mediterranean-style home is shown. Jim Sykes \u2026\n\nThe main home measures more than 23,000 square feet, according to the listing agent, and the property includes two swimming pools, one of which is shown. Mr. Fuller says that the home is perched on a bluff, and offers waterfront views. Jim Sykes \u2026\n\n'It's great to watch fireworks on the Fourth of July' from the boardwalk, Mr. Fuller said. 'It's one of the prettiest views in the world,' he said. Jim Sykes \u2026\n\nPart of the foyer, with marble flooring and intricate crown moldings, is shown. Elsewhere, the home includes Brazilian cherry-wood floors. Jim Sykes \u2026\n\nThe ceilings in parts of the home reach 25 feet, according to the listing agent.

The 5,000-square-foot guesthouse includes additional bedrooms. Mr. Fuller says he is selling the house because his children are grown and 'it's just a little much for one person.'
