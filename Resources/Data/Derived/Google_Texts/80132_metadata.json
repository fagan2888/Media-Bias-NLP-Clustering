Though everybody still knows about smoking\u2019s health risks, the habit seems to be on the rise due to a resurgence in the old belief that smoking is, simply, cool. Many studies, including one by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in 2011, have suggested this swell n popularity indicates a large demographic of teenage smokers. Once again, smoking has become a prominent social outlet \u2014 specifically among teens and college students. But it\u2019s only because our generation thinks of it as a choice \u2014 not an addiction.\n\nFor kids and young adults, smoking has increased in popularity over the last several years. A survey conducted this past March by the Cancer Research Center in the UK indicates that 207,000 children in the UK, ranging from 11 to 15 years old, start smoking each year.\n\nParalleling this rise, youth smoking in the U.S. has also increased. The aforementioned study shows that, in the period from 1991 to 2009, teenage smoking has risen by about 12%. However, this study is quick to emphasize that this was an increase in \u201ccasual\u201d smoking, defined as one to five cigarettes per day, rather than heavy smoking, which is defined as more than 11 cigarettes per day. While this interpretation of casual smoking was determined specifically for the study, five cigarettes per day seems like quite a high number to be considered \u201clight.\u201d\n\nOf course, this recent resurgence in smoking is also accompanied by a seemingly ever-lasting \u201ccool\u201d connotation for cigarettes. Anyone who\u2019s seen a movie from the 40s knows that smoking is cool. A study conducted by JAMA Pediatrics in 2011 examined the prominence of smoking on popular television shows in 2007. The study found that 40% of shows contained at least one scene with tobacco, and of those scenes, 89% involved cigarettes.\n\nSo what do the images of \u201ccasual\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d smoking lead to? The social smoker, now a common term among millenials, refers to someone who smokes to facilitate a conversation. This is a smoker who doesn\u2019t seem addicted, but still smokes regularly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research suggests a new generation of kids and young adults believe lighting up is a choice, not an addiction", "author": "Ali Walton", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research suggests a new generation of kids and young adults believe lighting up is a choice, not an addiction", "title": "Why teen smoking\u2019s on the rise", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/09/teens_have_started_smoking_again_because_they_think_its_cool_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/shutterstock_161273528.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research suggests a new generation of kids and young adults believe lighting up is a choice, not an addiction", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/shutterstock_161273528.jpg", "title": "Why teen smoking\u2019s on the rise", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why teen smoking\u2019s on the rise", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, addiction, millennials, Nicotine, PolicyMic, Smoking, teens", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc46\"", "article_summary": "Though everybody still knows about smoking\u2019s health risks, the habit seems to be on the rise due to a resurgence in the old belief that smoking is, simply, cool.\nTopics: addiction, millennials, Nicotine, PolicyMic, Smoking, teens, Life News, NewsThis article originally appeared on PolicyMic.\nThe aforementioned study shows that, in the period from 1991 to 2009, teenage smoking has risen by about 12%.\nSo what do the images of \u201ccasual\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d smoking lead to?\nParalleling this rise, youth smoking in the U.S. has also increased."}
