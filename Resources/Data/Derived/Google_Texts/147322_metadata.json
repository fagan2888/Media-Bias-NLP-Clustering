He and other cybersecurity experts said the risk from these attacks extends beyond losing information to opening opportunities for serious damage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy for people to say, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen here,\u2019 \u201d said Kurtz, who was White House senior director for critical infrastructure protection in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. \u201cThe problem is that the bad guys aren\u2019t necessarily that selective. \u2026 There is no doubt that you could use a cyber attack to make things blow up.\u201d\n\nTerry Boss, senior vice president of environment, safety and operations at Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, a Washington trade group, disagrees.\n\nA major pipeline incident \u201cisn\u2019t realistic,\u201d Boss said.\n\nEven if hackers got past cybersecurity protections, he said, simple mechanical controls can prevent pipeline pressure buildup.\n\n\u201cIs it disruptive if there\u2019s a cyber event for a company? Absolutely,\u201d Boss said. \u201cIs it going to affect the health of the customers along the pipeline or delivery? No. We\u2019re doing everything we can do to prevent that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nFew energy companies are willing to talk about whether it\u2019s that easy to attack their systems. Fifteen gas companies operating in Western Pennsylvania declined to comment about specifics - or at all - on their cybersecurity precautions.\n\nConsol Energy Inc., based in Cecil, tells employees to watch out for email scams, discourages them from using external flash drives and warns them to be careful online at home. The company formulates quarterly cybersecurity response plans and is in the second year of a three-year computer systems review, said George Rosato, Consol vice president of information systems and technology. The company\u2019s plans address how quickly it could recover from a cyber incident.\n\n\u201cAs data moves back and forth, and specifically outside of our firewalls, we have to make sure we can protect that data,\u201d Rosato said.\n\nThe chances of an adversary initiating a cyber attack on an oil and gas company are much greater than that of a physical attack, said former Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge.\n\nThe industry makes a tempting target for terrorists or foreign countries that want to hurt the economy by disrupting energy supplies, Ridge said. Activists opposed to fossil fuels, meanwhile, would consider it a victory to cause problems, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grave business risk to minimize the potential impact of a successful cyber attack, and I think the oil and gas industry, for a variety of reasons, is probably at the top of the list,\u201d Ridge told the Tribune-Review.\n\nHackers regularly target energy companies, accounting for nearly a third of the incidents handled last year by Homeland Security\u2019s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team.\n\nEven among energy producers, oil and gas operators face extended risks because projects often involve multiple companies working together, sharing information and trying to integrate systems, experts said.\n\nOne company might drill a hole, another frack the shale, and yet another transport the gas through a pipeline. Employees monitor the activity remotely, sending information from the drill site to a field office and then to the corporate headquarters. Each step involves computers and corporate networks - presenting a wealth of hacking opportunities.\n\n\u201cThe more third parties you work with, in general, they could then become a target to pivot into your network,\u201d said Bob Marx, a cybersecurity and industrial automation consultant with Cimation, an energy consulting company from Houston, Texas, with offices in Pittsburgh.\n\nEnergy companies traditionally have worried more about hackers stealing their secrets - where they plan to drill, how much money they make - but executives realize they have to pay attention to infrastructure threats, said David Miller, chief security officer at Covisint, a Detroit company that provides secure online communications for energy companies.\n\nComputer security experts said ample evidence exists that software can be used to spawn dangerous situations.\n\nThe Energy Department showed in 2007 how computer code can cause an electricity generator to spew black smoke. Three years later, a computer virus called Stuxnet destroyed Iran\u2019s uranium centrifuges. In 2012, hackers wiped out 30,000 computers at Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil company.\n\nYet 60 percent of energy companies in an international survey this year by Oil & Gas IQ, an industry news site, said they do not have a cyber attack response plan.\n\nLack of education and awareness remain top hurdles in preventing cyber attacks on oil and gas operations, security officials said.\n\nHacking methods continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, said Graham Speake, who teaches cybersecurity to oil and gas executives at SANS Institute, a Bethesda, Md., training company.\n\nThe Marcellus shale is a vulnerable play because there are smaller companies drilling, and executives often do not know about online risks or where to seek help, he said.\n\nSeveral government-led, public-private partnerships exist to share information and warn against attacks, but no regulations require oil and gas companies to protect data.\n\nTargeted email scams, called \u201cspear-phishing,\u201d are the most common attacks among oil and gas operators, said FBI Special Officer Michelle Pirtle, coordinator of the Pittsburgh chapter for InfraGard, an FBI-led cybersecurity information-sharing initiative.\n\nThe automated equipment used by the oil and gas industry often runs on antiquated technology that is easy to use but hard to protect, said Marx with Cimation. Information can be put online without operators realizing it, and new technology to shield that information is not always compatible with old systems, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem even if hackers simply get into systems and start manipulating data or blocking information, said Miller at Covisint in Detroit.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1IJLEZi\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, http://pghtrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the vast network of data, drilling and pipes that's made Marcellus shale an international energy reserve, computer attacks pose a serious threat.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/25/oil-gas-operators-could-be-vulnerable-to-hackers/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "In the vast network of data, drilling and pipes that\u2019s made Marcellus shale an international energy reserve, computer attacks pose a serious threat.", "title": "Oil, gas operators could be vulnerable to hackers"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "In the vast network of data, drilling and pipes that's made Marcellus shale an international energy reserve, computer attacks pose a serious threat.", "card": "summary", "title": "Oil, gas operators could be vulnerable to hackers"}, "Author": "KATELYN FERRAL and ANDREW CONTE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "In 2012, hackers wiped out 30,000 computers at Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil company.\nSeveral government-led, public-private partnerships exist to share information and warn against attacks, but no regulations require oil and gas companies to protect data.\nFifteen gas companies operating in Western Pennsylvania declined to comment about specifics - or at all - on their cybersecurity precautions.\nLack of education and awareness remain top hurdles in preventing cyber attacks on oil and gas operations, security officials said.\nYet 60 percent of energy companies in an international survey this year by Oil & Gas IQ, an industry news site, said they do not have a cyber attack response plan."}
