In the four years that followed, in the wake of Republican gains, Congress\u2019 productivity fell off a cliff, passing fewer bills than at any point in modern American history \u2013 and as a consequence, Obama still didn\u2019t have reason to dust off the veto pen.\n\nIndeed, after six years in office, Obama\u2019s total number of vetoes is just two . That\u2019s the lowest of any two-term president since Abraham Lincoln\n\nBut the paltry total probably won\u2019t last much longer. In his State of the Union address last night, Obama mentioned six times his willingness to veto various measures under congressional consideration. Just hours before the speech, the White House put some of these threats in writing\n\nThough he\u2019s spending the day preparing to deliver his 2015 State of the Union address, Mr. Obama hasn\u2019t gone entirely off the grid. He issued two veto threats Tuesday, warning Republicans he would block two bills pertaining to abortion and natural gas pipeline permitting. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would ban abortions after 20 weeks unless they were necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest\u2026. The second bill, the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act, would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve or deny applications for natural gas pipeline projects within 12 months.\n\nSome of these bills are almost certain to reach the president\u2019s desk, so Obama\u2019s veto pen will come out of the box for the first time in over four years. But before it does, let\u2019s pause to note that there\u2019s nothing especially wrong with veto threats on a conceptual level.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin\u2019s (D-W.Va.) recent complaints seemed off-base.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said Thursday he was disappointed that the White House threatened to veto his legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline, arguing the president\u2019s move was \u201cnot the way a democracy works.\u201d The West Virginia lawmaker said he was upset Obama did not reserve judgment on the bill until it went through the committee and amendment process in an interview with Fox News\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d\n\nActually, in our democracy, this is exactly how the process works. In fact, veto threats make quite a bit of sense \u2013 since legislation needs the support of the House, the Senate, and the president in order to become law, it\u2019s actually quite beneficial to the process if lawmakers know in advance which proposals a president is inclined to reject. On an institutional level, these threats are arguably a White House\u2019s way of doing Congress a favor \u2013 don\u2019t invest too much time and effort in this bill, a president sometimes tells lawmakers, because it won\u2019t get my support. Members are better off working on something else.\n\nIn practice, congressional Republicans apparently don\u2019t appreciate the guidance. Maybe they think they\u2019ll override the vetoes; maybe they\u2019re going through the motions to make a partisan point without any real regard for whether their bills will become law or not.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If GOP lawmakers think Obama's bluffing, and that he really won't veto these proposals, I suspect they're going to be disappointed.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-keeps-his-veto-pen-handy", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If GOP lawmakers think Obama's bluffing, and that he really won't veto these proposals, I suspect they're going to be disappointed.", "title": "Obama keeps his veto pen handy", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-keeps-his-veto-pen-handy", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/2012/12/wh_ap120421120201_400x300_1.jpg?itok=QnRUjXkJ", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-keeps-his-veto-pen-handy", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2012/12/wh_ap120421120201_400x300_1.jpg?itok=XHaHN75m", "height": 553}, "title": "Obama keeps his veto pen handy", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If GOP lawmakers think Obama's bluffing, and that he really won't veto these proposals, I suspect they're going to be disappointed."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-21T11:15:28-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Obama keeps his veto pen handy", "tags": "barack-obama,joe-manchin,republicans,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "01/21/2015 11:15:28 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-keeps-his-veto-pen-handy"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If GOP lawmakers think Obama's bluffing, and that he really won't veto these proposals, I suspect they're going to be disappointed.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Republicans, Barack Obama, Joe Manchin"}, "article_summary": "But before it does, let\u2019s pause to note that there\u2019s nothing especially wrong with veto threats on a conceptual level.\nHe issued two veto threats Tuesday, warning Republicans he would block two bills pertaining to abortion and natural gas pipeline permitting.\nIn his State of the Union address last night, Obama mentioned six times his willingness to veto various measures under congressional consideration.\nSome of these bills are almost certain to reach the president\u2019s desk, so Obama\u2019s veto pen will come out of the box for the first time in over four years.\nThe second bill, the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act, would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve or deny applications for natural gas pipeline projects within 12 months."}
