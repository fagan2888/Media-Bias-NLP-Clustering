But in the queer male community, these disorders are quietly at epidemic levels \u2014 gay men are up to three times more likely than heterosexuals to have a clinical or subclinical eating disorder. Statistics from the International Journal of Eating Disorders suggests that 15% of gay or bisexual men have struggled with disordered eating habits throughout their lives, including binge eating, anorexia and bulimia. Of men who struggle with eating disorders, around 42% identify as gay or bisexual. And research shows that eating disorders are the most lethal of all psychiatric illnesses.\n\nIf this is such a problem, why aren\u2019t more people talking about it? According to Troy Roness, a national eating disorders advocate, speaker and writer for the Huffington Post, the problem is that is subject is still \u201ctaboo\u201d among men. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of understanding and education around male eating disorders,\u201d Roness told me, \u201cand the reasons behind that are guilt and shame. I think the notion of having an eating disorder as a male means that you believe you\u2019re perceived as weaker and not able to take care of yourself. It\u2019s hard to reach out and get help when it means that somebody is questioning their masculinity.\u201d\n\nRoness began to struggle with anorexia at the age of 19, though he\u2019d dealt with body image issues for most of his life. After going through his parents\u2019 divorce and going off to college, Roness claims that he didn\u2019t have \u201cthe emotional skills to deal with traumatic events in [his] life.\u201d So as a college student, he decided that he wanted to get healthier and get in shape. For Roness, it was about getting the power back in his life. \u201cWhen it comes to your interaction with family and friends and your social circle, an eating disorder is a way to control things,\u201d he said. According to Roness, choosing \u201cwhat you eat and don\u2019t eat becomes controllable but can be controllable in an unhealthy way.\u201d\n\nAlthough Roness began to drop weight at alarming rates, he didn\u2019t recognize that there was anything wrong. He became so emaciated that he couldn\u2019t stay warm on his own anymore and he recalled wrapping himself in an electric blanket in the living room for body heat. I asked him how he rationalized that to himself \u2014 if he didn\u2019t think he was sick, what did he think was going on? \u201cI felt that I was overworking myself,\u201d Roness responded. \u201cI felt a constant urge to work out. When I looked in the mirror, I saw parts of my body that weren\u2019t muscular enough. They weren\u2019t right and they needed to be fixed.\u201d\n\nAs working out became an obsession, Troy Roness reached out for help \u2014 to the \u201cDr. Phil\u201d show. Roness called in to the program to ask how to \u201cstop working out,\u201d and the show\u2019s producers quickly called him back to book him on the show and start him on the road to recovery. Roness found inpatient eating disorder treatment with all-male units, and many of the patients in his groups were struggling just like he was \u2014 he found out he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cI was able to relate to straight men and gay men with the same issues, even a 40-something father of three. No matter sexual orientation, age, ethnicity or socioeconomic status, these issues were a struggle for everybody.\u201d\n\nAccording to Benjamin O\u2019Keefe, an actor and LGBT rights activist, only one in 10 people with eating disorders will seek treatment. \u201cPeople do die from this,\u201d O\u2019Keefe reminded me. \u201cEating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental disease. I had to get to rock bottom before I saw how bad it was.\u201d O\u2019Keefe grew up the \u201cchubby\u201d kid, idolizing the men with gaunt cheeks and six-pack abs in Abercrombie ads, and as an actor, he knew he had to fit into that mold. So he came up with a solution he thought was brilliant: don\u2019t eat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe no one had thought of it before,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said, with a sad laughter in his voice.\n\n\u201cIt started as such a conscious decision, but it was also something I couldn\u2019t control,\u201d O\u2019Keefe continued. \u201cI was suddenly getting all this attention, the kind of attention that I\u2019d never gotten before. I was fitting more into what society thought was \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Keefe lingered on this last word. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think that it was so normal to me. I think that\u2019s what people need to understand about eating disorders,\u201d O\u2019Keefe explained. \u201cYou could consciously understand that you are dying but you wouldn\u2019t fully understand that you are dying. It\u2019s sad that in our society, some people would die to look a certain way.\u201d At the time, O\u2019Keefe didn\u2019t look in the mirror and see someone who needed help. He just saw the person he was killing himself to be.\n\nAfter three months, Benjamin O\u2019Keefe lost 80 pounds. He celebrated the weight loss by passing out during the middle of a show. There was no ignoring the problem now.\n\nO\u2019Keefe couldn\u2019t afford \u201ctraditional treatment,\u201d so he consulted therapists and sought the help of friends as he developed a support network for recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s important to reach out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are willing to carpool on the road to recovery. There\u2019s help out there. There are people who want you to get better and be the best you that you can be.\u201d For O\u2019Keefe, striving to be his best self meant finally seeing that there was more to him than what he saw in the mirror. \u201cI realized that my life is bigger than a number on a scale,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life is meaningful. I found meaning in something other than the way I look.\u201d\n\nZach Stafford, a writer for Slate and RedEye Chicago, recalled hating his body and how it looked from an early age; he was uncomfortable being shirtless in front of other people. In the Tennessee town he grew up in, there was a strong connection among boys between their bodies and athleticism. He said it was part of the \u201cgender gap.\u201d \u201cBeing a young boy in the South, your whole life should be outdoors,\u201d Stafford said, \u201cbut it was cool for the girls to stay in.\u201d As a young gay kid, he wanted to be inside with the girls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eating disorders disproportionately affect gay men, but medicine hasn't caught up", "title": "A hidden epidemic: Eating disorders in the gay community", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Eating disorders disproportionately affect gay men, but medicine hasn't caught up", "title": "A hidden epidemic: Eating disorders in the gay community", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/02/a_hidden_epidemic_eating_disorders_in_the_gay_community/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/man_scale.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eating disorders disproportionately affect gay men, but medicine hasn't caught up", "title": "A hidden epidemic: Eating disorders in the gay community", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/man_scale.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nico Lang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Anorexia, Bulimia, Eating Disorders, Editor's Picks, gay men, LGBT, LGBTQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6e4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Anorexia, Bulimia, Eating Disorders, Editor's Picks, gay men, LGBT, LGBTQ, Life NewsWe don\u2019t always think about men when we think about eating disorders.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of understanding and education around male eating disorders,\u201d Roness told me, \u201cand the reasons behind that are guilt and shame.\nStatistics from the International Journal of Eating Disorders suggests that 15% of gay or bisexual men have struggled with disordered eating habits throughout their lives, including binge eating, anorexia and bulimia.\n\u201cI was able to relate to straight men and gay men with the same issues, even a 40-something father of three.\nAnd research shows that eating disorders are the most lethal of all psychiatric illnesses."}
