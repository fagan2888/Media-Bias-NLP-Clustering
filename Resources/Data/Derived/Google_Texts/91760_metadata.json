The idea is to provide a simple tool where employers, insurance agents shopping for employers or individuals can access information and sign up for health care plans.\n\nExchanges are a hot topic ushered in by federal health care changes in the ACA, but this isn\u2019t a government program. It\u2019s a privately-run exchange, and differs from the federal exchange in that it also presents related insurance products, like vision and dental insurance.\n\n\u201cStarting September 1st, individuals and employers across Michigan, who can work with their licensed insurance agent of choice, will have a single source, multi-carrier, insurance solution for comparing and accessing available medical, dental, vision and supplemental insurance plans, as well as a wide range of other non-insurance related products,\u201d said Barry Robinson, Vice President of Chamber Services & Membership Development. \u201cAlso available in the marketplace are calculators to help determine federal subsidy eligibility and potential tax consequences for failing to enroll in qualified health plans.\u201d\n\nTo get federal subsidies on health insurance, people will still have to go through the federal exchange system, Russell said. But the site helps people determine if they need to go that route. Before now, that wasn\u2019t an option.\n\n\u201cIndividuals and small business owners in the state of Michigan if they wanted to buy insurance through an insurance exchange were going to have to go to the federal exchange to get it done,\u201d Russell said.\n\nThe federal exchange website healthcare.gov was initially plagued by technical problems. Even without them, it can be complicated. But Russell said when the site launches it will be more user friendly.\n\n\u201cI think everybody who visits our site and starts to use it is going to realize that we\u2019ve actually made it simple,\u201d Russell said.\n\nThe chamber has been developing the product for about a year.\n\nEmily Lawler is a Capital/Business reporter at MLive.
