All of a sudden, you hit 65 and your whole available product line is different. Unless you have somebody to really help you, you don\u2019t get it.\u201dSeltzer\u2019s comments follow a report from America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), which concluded that beneficiaries could pay as much as $900 more in 2015 if the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS)\u2019 proposed cuts take effect.The cuts have angered many in the industry, including NAHU\u2019s John Greene, who believes the changes represent \u201ca solution in search of a problem.\u201d\u201cThis program is under budget by 40%. It has a 90% satisfaction rate among beneficiaries. It\u2019s operating well,\u201d Greene stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much on autopilot.\u201dAHIP, NAHU and other industry organizations are fighting the proposed cuts, along with a change to Medicare Advantage\u2019s commission schedule. Instead of paying agents for selling a policy to a first-time buyer for the entire 12 months\u2014beginning on the date of the sale and ending the following year\u2014the compensation schedule will be pro-rated to run to the end of the year.The resulting decrease in commission will drive many agents out of the Medicare business, many industry experts fear.For long-time Medicare producer Patrick Freeman, however, the changes are a long way from certain.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s certain these cuts will go through. I think you\u2019ll see a lot of pushback from seniors,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThey took away money last year, and people were really angry. It\u2019s not a done deal yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/programs/medicare-market-remains-profitable-despite-proposed-cuts-17530.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/medsign%20(300%20x%20198).jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "Proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage won\u2019t dampen profits, producers say\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter if they do.", "title": "Medicare market remains profitable, despite proposed cuts"}, "twitter": {"description": "Proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage won\u2019t dampen profits, producers say\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter if they do.", "title": "Medicare market remains profitable, despite proposed cuts", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/programs/medicare-market-remains-profitable-despite-proposed-cuts-17530.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/medsign%20(300%20x%20198).jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage won\u2019t dampen profits, producers say\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter if they do.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much on autopilot.\u201dAHIP, NAHU and other industry organizations are fighting the proposed cuts, along with a change to Medicare Advantage\u2019s commission schedule.\nAll of a sudden, you hit 65 and your whole available product line is different.\n\u201cThey took away money last year, and people were really angry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a service we feel we have to provide.\nI think you\u2019ll see a lot of pushback from seniors,\u201d Freeman said."}
