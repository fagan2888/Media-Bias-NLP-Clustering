Any Republicans asking \u201cwhere are the jobs?\u201d today should probably have their heads examined.\n\nThe new report from Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the U.S. economy added 321,000 jobs in November. The overall unemployment rate stayed at 5.8 and remains at its lowest point in over six years.\n\nOnce again, public-sector layoffs did not drag down the overall employment figures. Though jobs reports over the last few years have shown monthly government job losses, in November, the private sector added 314,000 while the public sector added 7,000. The latter may not sound like much, but after several years in which that total was negative, it\u2019s at least somewhat heartening.\n\nAs for the revisions, all of the news was excellent: September\u2019s totals were revised up from 256,000 to 271,000, while October\u2019s figures were revised up, from 214,000 to 243,000. Combined, that\u2019s an additional 44,000 jobs.\n\nAll told, this is one of the best jobs report Americans have seen in many years. There were some spikes in early 2010, but those were largely the result of temporary Census hiring, while this new data points to genuine, robust job growth. It remains very difficult for President Obama\u2019s critics to explain these numbers: the hiring boom is underway after tax increases and full implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll told, over the last 12 months, the U.S. economy has added over 2.73 million jobs overall and 2.66 million in the private sector. What\u2019s more, November was the 50th consecutive month of positive job growth \u2013 the best stretch since 1939 \u2013 and the 56th consecutive month in which we\u2019ve seen private-sector job growth \u2013 the longest on record.\n\nAt this point, with the calendar year nearly over, 2014 will easily be the best year for U.S. job creation since 1999.\n\nAbove you\u2019ll find the chart I run every month, showing monthly job losses since the start of the Great Recession.
