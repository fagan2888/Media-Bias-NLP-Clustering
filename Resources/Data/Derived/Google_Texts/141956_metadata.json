He is not coming home yet, so we brought it to him.\u201d\n\nMesa\u2019s group carried on their shoulders a statue of Nuestra Senora de Lujan, the patron saint of Argentina. \u201cFaith unites borders. And we wanted to unite the virgins,\u201d she said of the Caacupe and Lujan virgins.\n\nFrancis decided to skip Argentina on his South American pilgrimage, not wanting to get involved in the country\u2019s upcoming presidential election. He plans to go back home for the first time next year on a trip that will take him also to Chile and Uruguay. He did fly through Argentine airspace en route from Bolivia to Paraguay \u2014 the closest he\u2019s been to home since his 2013 election.\n\nYouth groups chanted \u201cPope Francis, Paraguay is with you!\u201d as they waited for the pontiff to arrive Saturday. Elderly faithful periodically kneeled on the cement to pray. During periodic bursts of rain, the faithful pulled out plastic ponchos and umbrellas, passing around sweets and sipping on mate tea to stay warm.\n\nMaria Luisa Gonzalez, 54, sat with her husband and prayed. She recounted how, when she was 8 years old, she had a terrible stomachache that persisted for a few weeks. The day her parents decided to take her to a doctor, she saw a painting of the Virgin of Caacupe hanging on a street vendor\u2019s cart.\n\n\u201cI immediately felt so much better that we didn\u2019t go to the appointment,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that, I believed in the virgin\u2019s miracles, and I have been coming every year to give thanks since I was 15.\u201d\n\nTradition has it that the virgin was carved by a Guarani man named Jose, by many accounts an early convert to Christianity around the beginning of the 17th century. Francis\u2019 Jesuit order and their Franciscan brothers were both evangelizing the region and created settlements that gave unusual autonomy to local indigenous people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope\u2019s Mass in Paraguay looks to become Argentine homecoming", "title": "Pope\u2019s Mass in Paraguay looks to become Argentine homecoming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pope\u2019s Mass in Paraguay looks to become Argentine homecoming", "title": "Pope\u2019s Mass in Paraguay looks to become Argentine homecoming", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/11/popes_mass_in_paraguay_looks_to_become_argentine_homecoming/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/paraguay-pope-south-america.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope\u2019s Mass in Paraguay looks to become Argentine homecoming", "title": "Pope\u2019s Mass in Paraguay looks to become Argentine homecoming", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/paraguay-pope-south-america.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Peter Prengaman and Nicole Winfield", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5e34\"", "article_summary": "Youth groups chanted \u201cPope Francis, Paraguay is with you!\u201d as they waited for the pontiff to arrive Saturday.\nHe did fly through Argentine airspace en route from Bolivia to Paraguay \u2014 the closest he\u2019s been to home since his 2013 election.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsCAACUPE, Paraguay (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis received a very Argentine welcome Saturday at Paraguay\u2019s most important pilgrimage site, where thousands of his countrymen joined hundreds of thousands of Paraguayan faithful for a Mass that seemed poised to become a makeshift homecoming for the Argentine pope.\nFrancis decided to skip Argentina on his South American pilgrimage, not wanting to get involved in the country\u2019s upcoming presidential election.\nAnd we wanted to unite the virgins,\u201d she said of the Caacupe and Lujan virgins."}
