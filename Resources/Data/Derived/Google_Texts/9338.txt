LOS ANGELES (AP) — California regulators are investigating whether two giant medical insurers misled consumers about which doctors they covered under federal health care reform packages.

KNX 1070’s Charles Feldman reports the Los Angeles Times says Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California are the focus of the probe over their enactment of limited health coverage networks under the Affordable Care Act.

The California Department of Managed Care says patients complained they were erroneously told certain medical providers were included when they chose a health plan — only to get treatment and be told a doctor wasn’t part of their network.

About 200 complaints have been filed against the companies this year.

Anthem and Blue Shield have acknowledged mistakes were made but say they’ve tried to fix them and have added thousands of new providers.
