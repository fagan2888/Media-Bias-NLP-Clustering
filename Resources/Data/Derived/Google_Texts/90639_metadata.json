You got this far, and you don\u2019t want to be holding back the team, I guess to say. It\u2019s an extremely tough decision to make.\u201d\n\nBishop faced shots for about 10 minutes at Amalie Arena, appearing to test his mobility and post-to-post movement. He hadn\u2019t been on home ice since he left Game 2 twice in the final minutes of the Lightning\u2019s 4-3 victory.\n\nBishop won Game 3 in Chicago despite appearing to be hurt. Vasilevskiy played well in Tampa Bay\u2019s 2-1 loss in Game 4 on Wednesday, with the Blackhawks evening the series at two games apiece.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping,\u201d Cooper said when asked if Bishop would be available for Game 5. \u201cI hope I have a decision to make between him and Andrei. That would be great.\u201d\n\nCooper then abruptly left his morning press briefing after one question.\n\nEarlier in the week, Cooper declared that Bishop would play again in this series, but didn\u2019t know when that would happen. The Final has only two or three games remaining over the next five days, depending on the outcome.\n\nIn his first career trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs, Bishop had started Tampa Bay\u2019s first 23 games until Game 4, making 27 consecutive starts overall since March 31. Kristers Gudlevskis backed up Vasilevskiy, while Bishop had a miserable night in street clothes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cI was more nervous for that game I\u2019m not playing than for any game. I thought Vasi came in and did a great job. He did everything he needed to do. I thought he played a great game. We had a chance to win that game. It\u2019s a tough spot to put a kid in like that. You can see why he\u2019s going to be as good as he is.\u201d\n\nThe 20-year-old Vasilevskiy was a first-round pick in 2012, and he played 16 regular-season games this year after joining the Lightning in December. The Russian is considered one of the top goaltending prospects in hockey, and his Tampa Bay teammates seem thoroughly confident in him.\n\n\u201cYou can see the bright future he has,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ben Bishop, injured Tampa Bay goalie, still uncertain for Game 5", "title": "Ben Bishop, injured Tampa Bay goalie, still uncertain for Game 5", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/13/ben-bishop-injured-tampa-bay-goalie-still-uncertain-for-game-5/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_102236_ben-bishop.jpg", "height": 384}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_102236_ben-bishop.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-13T10:20:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:21:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Lightning goalie Ben Bishop spent 15 minutes on the ice Saturday during Tampa Bay\u2019s morning skate for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final.\nVasilevskiy played well in Tampa Bay\u2019s 2-1 loss in Game 4 on Wednesday, with the Blackhawks evening the series at two games apiece.\nIn his first career trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs, Bishop had started Tampa Bay\u2019s first 23 games until Game 4, making 27 consecutive starts overall since March 31.\nAlthough Bishop said \u201cthere\u2019s progress being made\u201d on the undisclosed injury that kept him out of Game 4, the goalie and Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper both said they\u2019ll determine later whether Bishop can start.\nRookie Andrei Vasilevskiy will start his second straight game if Bishop can\u2019t go."}
