Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson reccaimed the top spot on the NFL Players Inc.â€™s list of top players sales from Johnny Manziel, who topped the rankings at the end of the first fiscal quarter.

Peyton Manning jersey sales ranked No. 2 on the top 50 list, while 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers rounded out the top five.

The quarterly list released by the NFLPI, the marketing and licensing arm of the NFL Players Association, is based on overall sales of officially licensed products from online and retail outlets.

Among the highlights of the latest rankings: Wilson outsold all players in both Nike game jerseys and T-shirts; Bears receiver (and ex-Bronco) Brandon Marshall made the biggest quarter-over-quarter jump of 18 spots, to No. 13; and Manziel, down six spots to No. 7, was the only rookie in the top 50.

But more importantly: Manning ranked No. 1 in Fathead sales.
