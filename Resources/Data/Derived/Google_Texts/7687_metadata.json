Cassandra Giraldo for The Wall Street Journal\n\nAs teenagers in San Jose, Calif., David and Robert Walter used to defy their parents and secretly stay up to watch David Letterman on TV, promising each other that one day they\u2019d go to New York to see him tape the \u201cLate Show\u201d live.\n\nOn Wednesday, the brothers were set to fulfill that dream, at the last possible opportunity.\n\nThe Walter brothers were among about 200 super-fans who gathered outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan Wednesday to collect tickets for the taping of Mr. Letterman\u2019s farewell show that afternoon. The 68-year-old late-night host is retiring after more than three decades on air.\n\nThe Walter brothers flew in from San Jose to see the final show. It was something they had to do, Robert Walter said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to come. There\u2019s no ifs, ands, or buts about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there. Done.\u201d\n\nThe brothers said they\u2019ll remember Mr. Letterman for his raw and unfiltered approach not only to comedy, but also to more serious issues. David Walter said he remembers turning to the \u201cLate Show\u201d after Sept. 11, 2001, to hear Mr. Letterman speak about the terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about Dave. People look to him for comedy, but he could be serious,\u201d said Robert Walter. \u201cHe wore his emotions on his sleeve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen something big happened, he was the one you tuned in to,\u201d said David Walter.\n\nDavid Letterman fans begin lining up in front of Ed Sullivan Theater in the hopes of grabbing tickets to Mr. Letterman\u2019s final show. Cassandra Giraldo for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Walter brothers traded memories of favorite \u201cLate Show\u201d skits \u2014 \u201cMonkey Cam,\u201d \u201cKnow Your Cuts of Meat\u201d \u2014 with another pair of brothers waiting outside the theater: Bruce and Barry Schwartz.\n\nRelated: Bill Murray Jumps Out of a Cake; Bob Dylan Performs on David Letterman\u2019s Second-to-Last \u2018Late Show\u2019\n\nThe 63-year-old twins said they felt like they grew up with Mr. Letterman. \u201cWe age along with Dave,\u201d said Barry Schwartz, the older twin by six minutes. He said he has seen the \u201cLate Show\u201d in person a half-dozen times.\n\nMichael Tidwell, a 59-year-old attorney who took a 4 a.m. train from Silver Spring, M.D., Wednesday, said he has seen the show about a dozen times live, scoring tickets to special tapings in London and Washington, D.C., by writing personal letters and, in one case, sending in 800 postcards to a ticket lottery.\n\nMr. Tidwell said he liked Mr. Letterman\u2019s wit and \u201cirreverence,\u201d his \u201cwillingness to mock the genre\u201d of late-night television.\n\nDespite his love for the show, Mr. Tidwell was philosophical about seeing Mr. Letterman\u2019s tenure come to an end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cThings come and go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss him,\u201d artist Tom Barlow, 50, said of Mr. Letterman. Mr. Barlow stood on the sidewalk by the theater, next to an easel holding his recently completed streetscape painting of the \u201cLate Show\u201d marquee.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s earned a place in American culture.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A small group of super-fans gathered outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan Wednesday to collect tickets for the taping of Mr. Letterman\u2019s farewell show that afternoon.", "title": "Letterman Fans Line Up to Watch One Final \u2018Late Show\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/05/20/letterman-fans-line-up-to-watch-one-final-late-show/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IN399_NYLETT_P_20150520153850.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Letterman Fans Line Up to Watch One Final \u2018Late Show\u2019", "description": "A small group of super-fans gathered outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan Wednesday to collect tickets for the taping of Mr. Letterman\u2019s farewell show that afternoon.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Thomas MacMillan", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "A small group of super-fans gathered outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan Wednesday to collect tickets for the taping of Mr. Letterman\u2019s farewell show that afternoon.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-05-20T18:19:08-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/05/20/letterman-fans-line-up-to-watch-one-final-late-show/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-23106", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A small group of super-fans gathered outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan Wednesday to collect tickets for the taping of Mr. Letterman\u2019s farewell show that afternoon.", "title": "Letterman Fans Line Up to Watch One Final \u2018Late Show\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/05/20/letterman-fans-line-up-to-watch-one-final-late-show/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IN399_NYLETT_P_20150520153850.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-23106", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-05-20T22:08:41-04:00"}, "article_summary": "David Letterman fans begin lining up in front of Ed Sullivan Theater in the hopes of grabbing tickets to Mr. Letterman\u2019s final show.\n\u201cThings come and go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to miss him,\u201d artist Tom Barlow, 50, said of Mr. Letterman.\nDavid Walter said he remembers turning to the \u201cLate Show\u201d after Sept. 11, 2001, to hear Mr. Letterman speak about the terrorist attacks.\nThe Walter brothers flew in from San Jose to see the final show.\nMr. Tidwell said he liked Mr. Letterman\u2019s wit and \u201cirreverence,\u201d his \u201cwillingness to mock the genre\u201d of late-night television."}
