The group recently announced a $2.5 million ad campaign targeting Democrats facing tough reelections in 2014: Sens. Kay Hagan (N.C.), Mary Landrieu (La.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.).\n\nIn 2012, Americans for Prosperity hit New Mexico and 30 other states in their \"Obama\u2019s Failing Agenda\" bus tour. Davis believes the group's departure from New Mexico is a sign of its own failures.\n\n\u201cAFP\u2019s 2012 bus tour was named the \u2018failed agenda\u2019 tour and it made several stops across the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out they were onto something with that. But it turns out the failed agenda in New Mexico wasn\u2019t that of President Obama and progressives. It was their own.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Billionaire Koch Billionaire Koch\n\n1 of 13 Share this slide:\n\nCredit: Realtor.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-01-13 21:47:56 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "...", "title": "Koch-Funded Group Ditches New Mexico Amid Spending Blitz", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/12/koch-brothers-new-mexico_n_4586414.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1558177/images/o-KOCH-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "...", "creator": "@ashalman", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1558177/images/o-KOCH-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Koch-Funded Group Ditches New Mexico Amid Spending Blitz", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-12 21:47:56 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4586414", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "koch brothers new mexico,Progress Now,video,obamacare,Koch Brothers,New Mexico,Americans for Prosperity,progressnow,anti-obamacare ads,obama,campaign-finance,Barack Obama", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "koch brothers new mexico,Progress Now,video,obamacare,Koch Brothers,New Mexico,Americans for Prosperity,progressnow,anti-obamacare ads,obama,campaign-finance,Barack Obama", "published_time": "2014-01-12 21:47:56 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-01-23 18:56:26 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3867\"", "article_summary": "It was their own.\u201dAlso on HuffPost: Billionaire Koch Billionaire Koch1 of 13 Share this slide:Credit: Realtor.com\n\u201cAFP\u2019s 2012 bus tour was named the \u2018failed agenda\u2019 tour and it made several stops across the state,\u201d he said.\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, is pulling out of New Mexico amid the rollout of a multi-million dollar anti-Obamacare ad campaign, ProgressNow New Mexico has confirmed.\nIn 2012, Americans for Prosperity hit New Mexico and 30 other states in their \"Obama\u2019s Failing Agenda\" bus tour.\nAmericans for Prosperity expanded to New Mexico as part of multi-state expansion to thwart support for President Barack Obama's reelection in 2012."}
