Many people wore \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d stickers. I don\u2019t know if it is an official campaign slogan, but it sounds snappy.\n\nOf course, \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d was giant TV comedy from the 1950s that can be seen on Netflix. The slogan is reminiscent of an historic campaign slogan from the 1950s \u2013 I Like Ike \u2013 which helped former Gen. Dwight Eisenhower win the presidency in 1952.\n\nThe \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d slogan was suggested by Reno labor activist Andy Barbano. He thinks it would make a great bumper sticker. Of course, there may be some trust or trademark on the slogan that would make Flores' offical use of \"I Love Lucy\" either illegal or expensive.\n\n\u201cThey are saying they love Lucy,\u201d Barbano said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great campaign gimmick. It\u2019s a much better slogan to have on bumper stickers, rather than something like, \u2018I\u2019m voting for Lucy.\u2019 It creates buzz and gets people talking about the candidate.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S NO SECRET Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is involved in a feud with the conservative, fabulously wealthy billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David.\n\nNow, Nevada\u2019s junior senator \u2013 Republican Dean Heller \u2013 is a target of a conservative seniors group with ties to the Koch Bros.\n\nThe 60 Plus Association is urging Heller and other bipartisan members of the Senate Banking Committee not to \u201cbring Obamacare to the mortgage industry.\u201d The 60 Plus Association is concerned changes to the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the Crapo-Johnson bill could hurt seniors whose investments include bonds sold through these mortgage giants.\n\nThe group is running TV ads in Nevada, saying that \u201cDean Heller is teaming up with Barack Obama to take over the mortgage industry.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a stretch for Nevadans \u2013 Heller and Obama \u201cteaming up.\u201d Other members of the Banking Committee are getting similar pressure in their home states.\n\nThe 60 Plus Association hopes their pressure on the senators will impact the upcoming markup of the bill in the Senate, according to reports.\n\n\u201cWith this proposal, Senator Heller is simply eliminating too-big-to-fail Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to the dislike of some on Wall Street, in order to protect Nevada taxpayers and prevent yet another bailout in the future,\u201d said spokeswoman Chandler Smith.\n\nU.S. REP. MARK AMODEI has had some issues with his recent detached retina surgery. Yet it appears the worst is behind him, said spokesman Brian Baluta.\n\nMark was cleared by his doctor to fly to D.C., which he did on (a recent) Sunday,\u201d Baluta said. \u201cHis eye is still healing, but he has been able to participate in a full slate of meetings, hearings and votes this week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reno Nevada News - rgj.com is the home page of Reno Nevada with in depth and updated Reno local news.
