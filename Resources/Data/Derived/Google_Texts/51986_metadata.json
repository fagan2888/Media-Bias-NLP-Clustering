Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday blamed the liberal media and Washington insiders with trying to portray front-runner Donald Trump as the presumptive nominee.\n\nHe said those forces wanted the GOP race to be over because there is no difference between Mr. Trump and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton are flip sides of the same coin,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters in Indianapolis, Indiana, as he vowed to campaign hard for that state\u2019s May 3 primary.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ted Cruz pledges \u2018major announcement\u2019 at 4 p.m. Wednesday\n\nHe noted that the billionaire businessman had previously contributed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaigns. He insisted they had the same views on Obamacare and raising taxes, although Mr. Trump disputes that characterization of his positions.\n\n\u201cI recognize that the New York media executives and the Washington lobbyists running Donald Trump\u2019s campaign both want the campaign to be over. They are desperate for it to be over,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cThey now recognize that this campaign has moved on to much more favorable territory.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s landslide victories Tuesday in five Northeast states put him far ahead in the delegate hunt and on track to clinch the nomination before the July convention in Cleveland.\n\nThe Texas senator\u2019s only path to the nomination is through a contested convention where he hopes to win after multiple ballots.\n\nMr. Cruz cast the Indiana primary as a decisive battle that could block Mr. Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates needed to lock up the nomination. He said Hoosier State voters face the \u201cdecision of which path we want to go down.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we want to go down a path of a campaign that is based on yelling and screaming and cursing and insults, or do we want to unify behind a campaign that is a positive, optimistic, forward-looking, conservative campaign based on real policy solutions to the challenges facing this country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\n\nThe Cruz campaign has announced that he will make a major announcement Wednesday at 4 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential hopeful Sen.
