A number of professors took umbrage at both Bauerlein\u2019s definition of what a professor should be and \u2014 as University of Rhode Island History professor Erik Loomis argued \u2014 whether Bauerlein should even be in the position to be deciding what other professors are supposed to be.\n\nSalon reached out to Bauerlein to ask whether he would like to address the pushback against his piece, and he graciously agreed to do so.\n\nIs it possible that your experience at Emory just doesn\u2019t accord with the experience of teachers at other institutions? Or do you think that Emory is representative enough of academia at large to draw generalizations about students and teachers based on it?\n\nI emphasized four-year colleges where students pursue BA and BS degrees, which is certainly a limitation on the commentary. The situation at two-year colleges and with vocational education is certainly different. And within that four-year population we have differences among liberal arts colleges, religious institutions, large state universities, etc. But I stand by the general drift, which is sustained by data from NSSE, the American Freshman Survey, the College Senior Survey, Academically Adrift, and longitudinal studies of grade and homework time.\n\nDo you think you might be idealizing student-teacher interactions from the \u201960s and \u201970s? After all, the composition of the student body was far different then \u2014 far fewer women and minorities, for example. Also, is that difference maybe significant in economic terms? I know that when I taught at the University of California, Irvine, the majority of my students had jobs \u2014 often times more than one \u2014 and had to in order to afford college. That fact influenced my ability to interact with them in office hours, because try as I might, creating hours that were both 1) reasonable for a sane human being and 2) able to accommodate the majority my students was, frankly, well nigh impossible.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I get the inference about student-teacher interactions and identity changes. When I started at UCLA in 1977, I had several female teachers, a few Hispanic and Asians, and gays and lesbians, too \u2014 no black teachers that I can recall \u2014 and that didn\u2019t affect the quality of interaction. If you are suggesting that non-white male students might have a harder time relating to white male teachers, well, I\u2019ve found that identity-based factor unconvincing.\n\nThe economic point, however, I agree with entirely. I knew many students who worked part-time in college (I did from day one), but they didn\u2019t have loans pressing down on them and high tuition fees. UCLA back then was around $500 a year. It is no wonder that students have become more mercenary in their approach.\n\nThat said, then, it is even more important that professors impress upon students the moral meaning of their studies. This is a unique time of life, and it passes quickly, and most of them will never again have the chance to discuss why Paolo and Francesca have to suffer so long [for the sin of lust in Canto V of Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d], what makes the opening measures of Wagner\u2019s \u201cTristan\u201d so great, who the Neocons were\u2026here we impress upon students a higher eloquence, the significance of the past, the cultivation of taste, and all the other things that youth culture and mass culture disregard.\n\nFinally, yes, it is impossible for teachers at large institutions to go one-on-one with all their students. You are right \u2014 and it\u2019s deplorable.\n\nLate in my teaching career, I shifted to teaching writing classes based on visual rhetoric, not because I didn\u2019t value literature \u2014 but because I considered the main point of a composition class to be the writing and development of critical thinking. It seems to me you believe that the object of analysis \u2014 a literary text as opposed to a film or comic book \u2014 is as important as the analysis itself. Why is that?\n\nNo, Scott, I regard the object as more important than the analysis, not as important.\n\nOne reason comes from cognitive science, which says that background knowledge (bare familiarity) is essential for critical thinking. In one well-known experiment, reading researchers had two populations of children, one with significantly higher abstract reading skills than the other (verbal IQ such as size of vocabulary and ability to use words they already know) but the lesser group knew more about baseball than the better group. When they were tested on a passage that covered baseball, the reading scores equalized.\n\nSo, building familiarity with significant historical, cultural, political etc. phenomena is crucial to critical thinking. (This is the longstanding argument of E.D. Hirsch\u2019s cultural literary project.) The question is what counts as significant. People who think that critical thinking can be cultivated as easily through the study of \u201cMad Men\u201d as through the study of \u201cParadise Lost\u201d are naive. We need great books and high culture, works of genius and events of historical import, political theory and religious doctrine, creations that have stood the test of time, that possess aesthetic excellence and introduce youth to the full range of human experience. Identity is no criterion of selection, nor is political correctness, nor ideology. (The slogan \u201ceverything is political\u201d is a pernicious dogma.) Marx should be taught as well as Edmund Burke, D-Day more than Manzanar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Controversial professor discusses NYTimes essay \"What's the Point of a Professor?,\" the adjunct crisis and more", "title": "\u201cAcademia is the Titanic\u201d: Mark Bauerlein on teaching in the morally-bankrupt grind of the new American university", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Controversial professor discusses NYTimes essay \"What's the Point of a Professor?,\" the adjunct crisis and more", "title": "\u201cAcademia is the Titanic\u201d: Mark Bauerlein on teaching in the morally-bankrupt grind of the new American university", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/12/academia_is_the_titanic_mark_bauerlein_on_teaching_in_the_morally_bankrupt_grind_of_the_new_american_university/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/professor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Controversial professor discusses NYTimes essay \"What's the Point of a Professor?,\" the adjunct crisis and more", "title": "\u201cAcademia is the Titanic\u201d: Mark Bauerlein on teaching in the morally-bankrupt grind of the new American university", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/professor.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Academia, adjunct crisis, Emory University, Mark Bauerlein, professor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One reason comes from cognitive science, which says that background knowledge (bare familiarity) is essential for critical thinking.\nPeople who think that critical thinking can be cultivated as easily through the study of \u201cMad Men\u201d as through the study of \u201cParadise Lost\u201d are naive.\nOr do you think that Emory is representative enough of academia at large to draw generalizations about students and teachers based on it?\nphenomena is crucial to critical thinking.\nTopics: Academia, adjunct crisis, Emory University, Mark Bauerlein, professor, Media News, Life NewsIn the New York Times on Sunday, Emory English professor Mark Bauerlein asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the Point of a Professor?\u201d and answered, in part, that what they should be is examples of \u201cmoral authority,\u201d but that for a number of reasons they are increasingly becoming morally bankrupt \u201caccreditors\u201d instead."}
