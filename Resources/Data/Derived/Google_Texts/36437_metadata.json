Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, City Council President Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young and Chase Brexton Health Care CEO Richard Larison were among those who offered remarks and cut the ribbon for the grand opening.\n\nThe new facility in the former Monumental Life building at 1111 N. Charles St. will allow Chase Brexton, a nonprofit provider, to expand its services. The Mount Vernon Center sees about 9,000 patients annually; the new Center will allow for more than doubling that number to about 25,000 based on projections. It features a patient-centered \u201cpod\u201d design and space for new obstetrics/gynecology services.\n\n\u201cBeginning in just a few months, hundreds of thousands of uninsured Marylanders will have access to new health insurance options through the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Larison said. \u201cWe look forward to meeting increasing demand and educating patients with the same compassionate care we\u2019ve provided for 35 years.\u201d\n\nAs part of this expansion and evolution of its services, the organization is changing its name to Chase Brexton Health Care to more accurately reflect the comprehensive primary care services that it provides.\n\nFounded in 1978 as a volunteer-run health clinic for Baltimore\u2019s LGBT community, Chase Brexton has a history of providing care to underserved members of the community and helping patients manage chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and HIV. Since then, it has expanded to a total of six locations in the region, annually serving nearly 25,000 patients from all walks of life.\n\nAlong with the newly relocated main Baltimore location, Chase Brexton has primary care offices in Randallstown, Columbia and Easton, as well as with Sheppard Pratt\u2019s Way Station facility in Columbia. It is also provider of the student health services at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). The new facility replaces its former location a few blocks away on the corner of Cathedral and Eager Streets.\n\n\u201cChase Brexton is a model of healthcare equity in Baltimore and around the region,\u201d said Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. \u201cFor decades, it has played a critical role in our area by providing high-quality care to anyone who needs it, no matter their ability to pay. With this new facility in the heart of Mount Vernon, Chase Brexton is poised to serve many more people, including many who will be newly insured.\u201d\n\nBuilding on its comprehensive care menu that includes dental, pharmacy, mental health and substance abuse services, Chase Brexton has recently added obstetrics and gynecology care.\n\nWith Chase Brexton\u2019s \u201cpod\u201d design, patients are literally at the center of their own care. Treatment rooms line the perimeter of each pod and medical staff move among the rooms to visit patients, who are able to remain in a single room for their entire visit.\n\nChase Brexton\u2019s leaders two years ago purchased the Monumental Life building and began renovations to transform the 192,000- square-foot property into its new headquarters.\n\n\u201cThe primary goal of the renovation was to respect and preserve historically significant features of the ornate Monumental Life complex while adapting and reconfiguring the property to provide much needed health services for the downtown Baltimore community,\u201d said Kim Price, president of Chase Brexton\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe expansion of services does not change its mission with respect to the LGBT community, according to Dr. Julie Eastin of the Behavioral Health department.\n\nThe facility is outpatient only, and appointments are needed.
