It is already on the short list of 15 documentaries from which the final five nominations will be announced on Jan. 14. But rather than wonder whether Moore will score a second Oscar (his first was for \u201cBowling for Columbine\u201d in 2002), the question to ask is whether this film can spark a political revolution just in time for the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWhere to Invade Next\u201d has a wide release set for Feb. 12, which is also Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birthday and the week of the New Hampshire primary. Coincidence? Definitely not.\n\nThe date for the release is only part of the story. The film will be launched in one of the most progressive and activist formats ever conceived. Early test scores of the film have it getting the highest viewer ratings of any of Moore\u2019s previous films. \u201cWhat it has shown us is the film not only plays well as just a movie, but the issues raised in the film deeply affect people,\u201d Moore said.\n\nSo Moore asked his distributors to get on board with a release plan designed to rock the nation: \u201cI said \u2026. give me a month or so to barnstorm the country, me personally, in a big rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tour bus, and we will criss-cross the country showing the film for free, leading up to the New Hampshire primary \u2014 because the issues in the film are the issues, the real issues, people want being discussed in this election year.\u201d They may also have music and rallies along the way.\n\nMoore has been a constant innovator in political comedy, so it is no surprise that he has hatched a creative marketing plan to draw as much attention to his new film as he can. But it isn\u2019t just the stunts that will make the film socially significant; it\u2019s the actual film itself.\n\n\u201cWhere to Invade Next\u201d begins with the observation that the United States has not won a war since World War II. It then comically imagines the Department of Defense calling on Moore to step in and save our nation. His plan? Invade nations not to take them over, but to take their good ideas. We then see a hilariously ironic shot of Moore on a ship draped in the American flag and heading out on his quest.\n\nMoore then embarks on a tour of a series of European nations and one in Africa where he finds society getting it right. From debt-free education to paid leave, women\u2019s rights, prison reform and delicious school lunches, Moore offers viewers a world where people simply live better than we do here.\n\nIn a brilliant move, Moore has made his most patriotic film yet without shooting a single frame in the United States.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t get glimpses into our own society, but these largely come from news footage of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and elsewhere \u2014 not from Moore\u2019s camerawork. The contrast is stark. Abroad, Moore conquers other nations to pillage their good ideas. At home, we see a nation ripped apart by racism and torn by political division.\n\nThe American flag is literally everywhere in this film. And it works as an excellent motif. It is at once ironic and intensely patriotic. Most of the shots have Moore carrying the flag across airports into new countries and planting it strategically as he \u201cclaims\u201d what he has found for America in a twist on the well-worn imperialist/militarist gesture.\n\nReversing the link between the right and obsessive patriotism, now it is \u201clefty\u201d Moore who brandishes the flag everywhere.\n\nBut what starts as funny acquires greater and greater force as the film moves on\u2014a force that might have especially intense consequences this election cycle. Moore\u2019s use of the flag both underscores his very real patriotism, and highlights the way that left progressives have been displaced as advocates for our nation. The irony of Moore carrying the flag references the various ways that his politics have been called out as treasonous, as anti-American, and as subversive. As Moore moves throughout the film alongside the American flag he isn\u2019t just claiming the good ideas of other nations; he is claiming the flag and its symbolic force for those on the left.\n\nIt is a bold move and a much-needed one as we enter another election cycle. Geoffrey Nunberg has documented the explicit ways that the right has fashioned itself as the party of patriotism and American values. He points out that it is due to these efforts that even the phrase \u201cliberal values\u201d sounds weird. He reminds us of how awkward it was when John Kerry started his DNC speech with the statement \u201cI\u2019m John Kerry and I\u2019m reporting for duty.\u201d Today conservatives literally \u201cown\u201d the flag and the idea of American values. If any real progressive politics are going to take place in this nation, that will have to change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans have hid shamefully behind the patriotism and the flag.
