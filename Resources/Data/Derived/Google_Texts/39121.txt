The American Conservative Union Saturday honored the Tennessee General Assembly as the most conservative legislature in the country at the group’s Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in National Harbor, Md., reports Michael Collins.

State Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, who is running for the 8th Congressional District seat, and state Rep. Timothy Hill, R-Blountville, accepted the award.

This is the first year the organization has given the award.

“I’m proud of our record as the most conservative state in America,” Kelsey said.

“We’ve balanced our budget,” Kelsey said. “We’ve stopped Obamacare Medicaid expansion. We’ve cut taxes repeatedly. We’ve passed a constitutional amendment to forever ban the state income tax. This is a record we should be proud of, and I appreciate the American Conservative Union has recognized that success.”
