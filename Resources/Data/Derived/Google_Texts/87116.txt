An angler who disappeared Monday afternoon trying to save his dog from the Arkansas River near Florence has been found dead, said Captain Don Pinover of the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office.

Shane Bollig, a 42-year-old from Cañon City returned his dog to the riverbank before being swept away.

Bollig was found over a mile downstream from where he disappeared, Pinover said. Arkansas Headwaters rangers Tuesday midday found his body lodged under debris in the river.

Foul play is not suspected, Pinover said.

Efforts to find Bollig Monday night and Tuesday morning, which included an aerial search of the area, did not locate him.

The Denver Post reported Tuesday that 11 people had drowned in open water in Colorado since May, including a woman who jumped into a ditch to rescue a dog. The Fremont County death brings that toll to 12.
