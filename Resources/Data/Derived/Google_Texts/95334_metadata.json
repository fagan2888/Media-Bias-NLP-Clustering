According to Haas, that covered salaries, benefits, department operations, workers\u2019 compensation, retiree medical costs and fleet expenditures.\n\nThe city is dealing with trying financial circumstances because of the loss of redevelopment funding, said City Councilman Tom Figg.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is going to be one of the most difficult budget years the city\u2019s ever faced,\u201d he said.\n\nFigg said he hasn\u2019t had discussions with Haas about outsourcing the Police Department, but outsourcing of all services was a topic of discussion at the city\u2019s strategic planning session in late February. He noted those conversations will continue in April.\n\nIt\u2019s not known how much the city might save if it outsourced police duties because it would depend on the level of services purchased from what amounts to a \u201cmenu\u201d of choices, Figg said. \u201cBut the conventional wisdom is there are cost savings by virtue of scales of economy.\u201d\n\nFigg would like to see the city pass a tax measure that restricts the use of funds for the Police Department, which he said takes the lion\u2019s share of the city\u2019s general fund. However, getting voters to approve a restricted-use tax isn\u2019t easy. It requires approval from two-thirds of the city\u2019s voters and an attempt to enact that kind of tax measure failed in 1994.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a higher threshold for voter approval,\u201d Figg said.\n\nPolice Chief Robert Gager said cost-saving measures have been implemented in his department since the loss of redevelopment funding. For example, Gager canceled a traffic officer program and reduced its K-9 police dogs from four to one.\n\nTwo positions in the department\u2019s Special Problems Unit have not been filled either. At the same time, overtime has risen because the department has been \u201cplagued with numerous injuries, causing us to operate at minimum staffing levels,\u201d Gager said.\n\nIf morale is low, Gager said it isn\u2019t outwardly visible in the department. Productivity is up and the crime rate is down, he said.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty of the city being able to address the shortfall in revenues and increased expenses concerns us all,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in the Police Department we are doing all we can to improve operations and reduce costs, but we are running out of viable options.\u201d\n\nThe Port Hueneme police are paid notably higher wages than officers in other cities.\n\nLast year, the Port Hueneme Police Department employed 32 people at an average wage of $133,997, up 12 percent from $119,165 in 2013. Police departments in Ventura, Simi Valley and Santa Paula paid average wages in 2013 of $71,307, $91,255, and $43,526, respectively.\n\nTalk of outsourcing comes 20 years after Port Hueneme residents rallied to keep their police department.\n\nIn 1994, the last time there was talk about contracting out services, residents peddled hot dogs and T-shirts to get taxpayers to pass a measure that would have generated $500,000 a year from restricted-use property taxes. The measure, which required two-thirds voter approval, failed.\n\nResidents didn\u2019t give up, however. In 1996 \u2014 when Port Hueneme police officers earned an average $39,787 in base salary and deferred compensation \u2014 voters approved a utility tax meant in part to help police.\n\nThe utility tax dollars went into the general fund, meaning they don\u2019t necessarily have to be spent on policing. The utility tax generated $1.15 million last year, which doesn\u2019t come close to covering the more than $8 million Port Hueneme spent last year for its police department.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Port Hueneme is looking at outsourcing police services", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/port-hueneme/port-hueneme-is-looking-at-outsourcing-police-services-ep-1010259303-347138462.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/crimepolice1stock_15284513_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 436}, "type": "article", "description": "Port Hueneme is considering contracting with an outside law enforcement agency to replace its small police department, which employs some of the highest paid officers in Ventura County.", "title": "Port Hueneme is looking at outsourcing police services"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/crimepolice1stock_15284513_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Port Hueneme is looking at outsourcing police services", "description": "Port Hueneme is considering contracting with an outside law enforcement agency to replace its small police department, which employs some of the highest paid officers in Ventura County.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9b3\"", "article_summary": "Talk of outsourcing comes 20 years after Port Hueneme residents rallied to keep their police department.\nLast year, the Port Hueneme Police Department employed 32 people at an average wage of $133,997, up 12 percent from $119,165 in 2013.\nIn 1996 \u2014 when Port Hueneme police officers earned an average $39,787 in base salary and deferred compensation \u2014 voters approved a utility tax meant in part to help police.\nThe utility tax generated $1.15 million last year, which doesn\u2019t come close to covering the more than $8 million Port Hueneme spent last year for its police department.\nFigg said he hasn\u2019t had discussions with Haas about outsourcing the Police Department, but outsourcing of all services was a topic of discussion at the city\u2019s strategic planning session in late February."}
