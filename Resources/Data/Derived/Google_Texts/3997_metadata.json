(AP) - The final chunks of concrete are expected to fall this September in the nation\u2019s largest dam-removal project, but nature is already reclaiming the Elwha River on Washington\u2019s Olympic Peninsula.\n\nSo much sediment, once trapped in reservoirs behind two hydroelectric dams, has flowed downstream that it has dramatically reshaped the river\u2019s mouth, replenished eroding beaches and created new habitat for marine creatures not observed there in years.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinook salmon and steelhead have been streaming into stretches of the Elwha River and its tributaries previously blocked by the Elwha Dam, which stood for nearly a century before it came down in 2012.\n\nWith the first dam gone, the ocean-migrating fish have been swimming as far upriver as they can. Scientists have observed them at the base of the second 210-foot-tall Glines Canyon Dam about 13 miles upstream, as if they want to continue on.\n\nAs they move into areas previously blocked, salmon and steelhead are acting as a fertilizer for the ecosystem, delivering marine nutrients to river otters and other wildlife.\n\nDemolition crews this month are waiting for river flows to drop, so they can begin removing the remaining 30 feet of the Glines Canyon Dam. By the end of the year, the Elwha River is expected to flow dam-free from the Olympic Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, about 80 miles west of Seattle.\n\nJust three years into dam removal, scientists say they\u2019ve been surprised at how quickly changes are happening.\n\nThe most stunning change is taking place at the river\u2019s mouth. Millions of cubic yards of sediment held behind the dams have flowed downriver and pushed the estuary out about a quarter mile. A once rocky, cobblestone scene is now sandy beach - ideal for forage fish, juvenile salmon and shellfish.\n\n\u201cNew estuary is literally being created. It\u2019s wild to watch,\u201d said Anne Shaffer, marine biologist with the Coastal Watershed Institute in Port Angeles. \u201cFish are using this freshly formed habitat, and they\u2019re using it with such abundance.\u201d\n\nMarine creatures such as eulachon, or candlefish, and Dungeness crab have been documented in the estuary for the first time in decades.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by a lot of things, but I was stunned by how fast the estuary has expanded,\u201d said Robert Elofson, river restoration director with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. The tribe is a partner with the National Park Service in the $325 million river-restoration project.\n\nAn estimated 40 to 50 percent of the total expected sediment has come down the river so far, said Andy Ritchie, project hydrologist with the National Park Service. Not all of what remains will make its way down, he said. Some won\u2019t be released except during very high river flows, and some is beyond the river\u2019s reach, Ritchie added.\n\nAll that sediment has created turbid and muddy waters for migrating fish, and scientists initially wondered how salmon and steelhead would react.\n\nBut tribal and federal biologists tracking fish have been able to answer intriguing questions, including: When the dams are removed, will the fish survive in turbid waters?\n\n\u201cThose fish are finding the clear creeks, and they\u2019re spawning,\u201d said John McMillan, a biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cThe clear water sources are really important.\u201d\n\nOnce they get into the river, \u201ctheir instinct is just to go upstream. They\u2019ll go as far as they can to see what\u2019s there,\u201d he said.\n\nOn a recent day, McMillan pointed out an adult steelhead as it swam from the murky, grey waters of the Elwha river into clear Indian Creek, one of two tributaries open to the fish now that the Elwha Dam is gone.\n\nIn recent weeks, McMillan and another tribal biologist have been counting steelhead fish nests in Indian Creek and Little River. So far they\u2019ve counted 108 redds in those tributaries, as well as a couple in the main river.\n\nThat\u2019s about two-thirds of what biologists were seeing before the dam was removed, he said.\n\nThe fish are providing a rich nutrient source for river-dependent wildlife, such as river otters and American dippers, a small grey aquatic songbird.\n\nBiologists have radio-tagged and taken tissue samples of river otters to understand what they\u2019re eating. Early results show there\u2019s been an increase in marine nutrients in the animals studied, said Kim Sager-Fradkin, a wildlife biologist with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking up marine nutrients definitely and sooner than we expected,\u201d she said.\n\nThe tribe has also been collaborating with the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center to study the impact of dam removal and return of salmon on American dippers and other birds.\n\n\u201cWe know that they\u2019re getting access to salmon, and we know there are potential benefits of that,\u201d said Christopher Tonra, a research fellow with the Smithsonian, who is in process of finalizing study results.\n\nWhen salmon first migrated upriver after the first dam was removed, the dippers keyed in on them right away and were observed gobbling up fish eggs as they spawned, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how fast everything has happened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The final chunks of concrete are expected to fall this September in the nation's largest dam-removal project, but nature is already reclaiming the Elwha River on Washington's Olympic Peninsula.", "Author": "PHUONG LE", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The final chunks of concrete are expected to fall this September in the nation\u2019s largest dam-removal project, but nature is already reclaiming the Elwha River on Washington\u2019s Olympic Peninsula.", "title": "As dams fall, rapid changes on Elwha River", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/5/as-dams-fall-rapid-changes-on-elwha-river/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/05/eda950b834b6081a590f6a706700751c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/05/eda950b834b6081a590f6a706700751c.jpg", "title": "As dams fall, rapid changes on Elwha River", "description": "The final chunks of concrete are expected to fall this September in the nation's largest dam-removal project, but nature is already reclaiming the Elwha River on Washington's Olympic Peninsula.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ef0\"", "article_summary": "PORT ANGELES, Wash.
