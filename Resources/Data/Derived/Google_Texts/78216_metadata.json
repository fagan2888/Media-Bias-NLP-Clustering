What are his options?\n\n\n\nStudious Parent\n\nDear Studious Parent,\n\nI\u2019m guessing from your question that neither parent has a group health plan that would cover him. That is likely to be the least expensive option. Assuming that is not available, then he needs to find his own plan.\n\nIf he could earn $11,490 (100% of Federal Poverty for a one-person household), then he could qualify for subsidies to buy his own plan from the exchange. In this case, his insurance would be nearly free. If he earns less than that, he can\u2019t get the subsidies. This is due to a quirk in the federal law: the federal law assumed that all states would offer Medicaid to people at the 100% or less Federal Poverty income level. However, not all states \u2013 and Missouri is one of them \u2013 are \u201cexpanding\u201d Medicaid. Your son is one of the many thousands of people falling into the coverage gap created by states that are not offering Medicaid to all low-income people. (I am assuming that your son is not disabled or otherwise eligible for Medicaid.)\n\nHis university also does not offer a student health insurance plan, but does refer students to an insurer. This is worth checking out. It may be less expensive than you think.\n\nIf he does end up with no insurance, he would not be charged the penalty tax. This is small comfort, I realize.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Health Unsurance", "description": "My 21-year-old son is currently an unemployed student at Avila University in Kansas City Missouri and has no health coverage.\u00a0 What are his options?
