The Nuggets\u2019 starting shooting guard was injured taking a hit to the head/jaw area as he tried to get through a screen during the game against San Antonio on Friday night.\n\n\u201cHe got the hit, we took him out, put him back in the game,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe attempted a shot, and Gary\u2019s one of our best shooters, and the shot was way off. But then, when he was on defense and he was facing me, he just didn\u2019t look right. (Nuggets head trainer) Dan Shimensky saw it as well, so we got him out, did the testing. \u2026 We\u2019ll see when we can get him back.\u201d\n\nSaid Harris: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just taking it day by day. It\u2019s making sure my mind\u2019s right and feeling better. \u2026 It\u2019s really just making sure everything is good.\u201d\n\nKeeping Wilson close. Now that Wilson Chandler has already had surgery and begun the rehab process, Malone is insistent about keeping him around and active with the team as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThat was one thing that I felt very strongly about,\u201d Malone said. \u201cEven though the season has been taken from him, it\u2019s important that we have Wilson around \u2026 just for his own sanity, if you will. Make sure he feels a part of it, still. So once he starts traveling, we\u2019ll have him travel with us the whole time. I might even give him a clipboard so he can be one of our coaches.\u201d Christopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets Gary Harris working through first concussion", "title": "Nuggets Gary Harris working through first concussion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/nuggets-gary-harris-working-through-first-concussion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128__Gary-Harrisp1.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128__Gary-Harrisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T21:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:13:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe got the hit, we took him out, put him back in the game,\u201d Malone said.\n\u2026 We\u2019ll see when we can get him back.\u201dSaid Harris: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just taking it day by day.\nDALLAS \u2014 There\u2019s a first time for everything, but Nuggets guard Gary Harris wishes there wasn\u2019t a first time for this \u2014 a concussion, which kept him out of Saturday night\u2019s game at Dallas.\nI might even give him a clipboard so he can be one of our coaches.\u201d Christopher Dempsey, The Denver Post\nHe\u2019s officially day to day, but he must pass tests and be cleared by a doctor before he can return to the court, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said."}
