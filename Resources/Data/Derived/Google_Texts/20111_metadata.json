This year, the penalty will be $325 or 2 percent of income, and by 2016 it will be $695 or 2.5 percent of income.\n\n\u201cThe substantial increase in penalties under the individual mandate next year is a big wild card,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy organization. \u201cWe\u2019re in unchartered territory here about how effective these bigger penalties will be in nudging people to get insured.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe marketplaces are working,\u201d Mr. Levitt added, \u201cbut higher enrollment would both improve the insurance risk pool and reduce the number of Americans uninsured.\u201d\n\nThe individual mandate was included in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 to make sure enough healthy Americans signed up, spreading out the costs for higher-risk customers.\n\nA divided U.S. Supreme Court upheld the mandate in 2012 as an appropriate use of Congress\u2019 taxing power.\n\nBut congressional Republicans are still intent on scrapping the health care law, and may use a fast-track budget procedure known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to take a swing at it.\n\nGOP leaders say they may not be able to eviscerate the law through the budget, but Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, said repealing the individual mandate is \u201cdefinitely on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis law is only being held together by mandates and coercion, and that\u2019s why we continue to look at ways to repeal the mandates and give people more freedom and choices,\u201d Mr. Buck said.\n\nEven as it struggles to meet the 2016 enrollment projection, the Obama administration is on track on other measures, including a CBO estimate that 17 million fewer people lack insurance this year because of the health care law.\n\nBut in setting lofty goals for the exchanges, the CBO estimated the effect of the individual mandate and other potential changes, including the belief that employers would shift workers onto the exchanges or that customers would enter the Obamacare marketplace ahead of late 2017, when they can no longer hold plans that do not comply with the law.\n\nUnder political duress, the White House let customers transition to compliant plans to keep Mr. Obama\u2019s notorious promise that people who like their plans can keep them under his law.\n\nSizing up reality versus long-range estimates, Health and Human Services has begun to set its own, more modest goals for exchange enrollment, ignoring CBO\u2019s guess of 12 million for 2015 and setting the mark at 9.1 million enrollees. So far, it\u2019s besting its less ambitious goal.\n\nThe agency says it is doing its own evaluation of the marketplace and will likely announce its enrollment targets for 2016 before signups begin in November.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projected enrollment total for 2016 seems overly optimistic,\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cEnrollment may reach that level eventually, but I doubt it will happen by next year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama will need to more than double the number of Americans enrolled in Obamacare exchange plans to reach 21 million next year, the target set in budget projections, in what is shaping up as the next major test for the health care law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama will need to more than double the number of Americans enrolled in Obamacare exchange plans to reach 21 million next year, the target set in budget projections, in what is shaping up as the next major test for the health care law.", "title": "Obamacare enrollees must double to make budget projections work", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/13/obamacare-enrollees-must-double-to-make-budget-pro/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/Obama.jpg", "description": "President Obama will need to more than double the number of Americans enrolled in Obamacare exchange plans to reach 21 million next year, the target set in budget projections, in what is shaping up as", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare enrollees must double to make budget projections work"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Congressional Budget Office"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8d3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt is definitely something that people pay attention to,\u201d said Rachel Klein, director of organizational strategy at Families USA, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable health care.\n\u201cAt this point, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projected enrollment total for 2016 seems overly optimistic,\u201d Mr. Levitt said.\nBut congressional Republicans are still intent on scrapping the health care law, and may use a fast-track budget procedure known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to take a swing at it.\nPresident Obama will need to more than double the number of Americans enrolled in Obamacare exchange plans to reach 21 million next year, the target set in budget projections, in what is shaping up as the next major test for the health care law.\nThe tax during the first year was $95 or 1 percent of income above the filing threshold \u2014 a relatively minor bite."}
