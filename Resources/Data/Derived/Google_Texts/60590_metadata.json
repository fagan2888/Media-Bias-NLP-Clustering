A number of consumer groups support the effort, including AARP, the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and the Pension Rights Center.\n\nHowever, the DOL\u2019s timetable to release the proposal for public comment-it was scheduled for August-may be delayed because 30 House Democrats, in a letter, requested to meet with Labor Secretary Thomas Perez first. The lawmakers say they\u2019re concerned that the proposal to raise investment advice standards for retirement plan advisers could hurt people with modest assets.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nA DOL spokesman confirmed that Perez had received the letter, but declined to say whether the lawmakers\u2019 concerns would ultimately delay the proposal\u2019s release.\n\nThe DOL isn\u2019t going to issue something that blocks people with modest means from getting professional advice that\u2019s in their best interest, says Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the CFA. \u201cThe DOL has given us every reason to believe that it\u2019s fully aware of these concerns and it\u2019s not going to back down from writing the rule.\u201d\n\nShe said the financial services industry is \u201clobbying hard\u201d against raised standards for advisers. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if a few members of Congress would write to DOL or any of the regulatory agencies and urge them to write a rule that best protects investors and makes sure their interest are served.\u201d\n\nMary Wallace, a legislative representative at AARP, calls the need for a higher fiduciary standard \u201ca no-brainer.\u201d She says the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 was enacted to oversee such standards and hasn\u2019t been expanded since.\n\n\u201cThe market is a whole new world from the way it was almost 40 years ago,\u201d Wallace says. \u201cWhoever heard about IRAs? There are more players and products now and the current [regulatory] umbrella doesn\u2019t cover all of them. It isn\u2019t right and it puts people at risk. It is essential that this rule be upgraded.\u201d\n\nThe letter by the New Democrat Coalition said in part: \u201cBefore you send any proposal to the Office of Management and Budget, we respectfully request the opportunity to have a dialogue on how to best protect low- and middle-income individuals and small business, while ensuring access to investment education, information, and affordable investment products and services.\u201d It was signed by Reps. Rush Holt (N.J.), Carolyn McCarthy (N.Y.), Ron Kind (Wis.), Patrick Murphy (Fla.) and 26 other House Democrats, according to Investment News.\n\nThe forthcoming DOL proposal is actually a \u201cre-proposal.\u201d The original one was released for public comment and withdrawn in 2011 so it could be amended to reflect some of the feedback from the financial industry and others, a DOL spokesman said.\n\n>> Get discounts on financial products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nThe DOL has said it\u2019s trying to protect workers and retirees who rely on 401(k)s and IRAs as their nest eggs from advice that may be unsuitable. The fiduciary standard means that professionals who recommend an investment for their clients must do so because it\u2019s in the clients\u2019 best interest, not because they\u2019d gain a huge commission from it.\n\niStockphoto/GlobalStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "If you have a 401(k) or other retirement plan, you may be waiting even longer before new government standards are imposed that require your financial adviser to act in your best interest.
