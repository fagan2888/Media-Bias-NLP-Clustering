I know, I can\u2019t believe it either. People argue about global warming, but at this point I\u2019m not sure anyone can doubt global quickening because the years are passing much faster than they used to. By my estimation, 2015 lasted only nine months, and I\u2019m quite sure 2016 already skipped completely over February and March.\n\nI\u2019ve joked about Oliver being a perfect baby, but he really is awesome. The boy was legitimately sleeping through the night by six weeks. Not that I minded six months of 1 a.m. Netflix viewing with Linus, but I enjoyed sleeping at 1 a.m. so much more. Oliver took bottles like a champ, didn\u2019t flinch when we switched him to formula and eats anything we chop up and put on his plate. And not to get too graphic, but even Oliver\u2019s diapers are, well, I mean they\u2019re still gross, but not as gross as I\u2019ve seen. Remember more than once I had to cut Linus out of a onesie and was minutes away from calling the Hazmat team.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "OANow.com", "description": "Baby Oliver turns 1 tomorrow.
