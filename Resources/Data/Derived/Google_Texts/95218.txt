Editor’s note: This letter responds to a story about a 35 percent increase in health care premiums for the city of Lancaster and its employees.

The front page of Wednesday’s edition must be an error! President Obama said we were going to save $2,500 per year with his Obamacare scam.

I also think it is absurd that the city is paying 75 percent of the cost of employee health insurance, when most private sector jobs have barely 60 percent of the cost paid by their employers.

Just more fleecing of the taxpayers.
