(AP) \u2014 Frustration is mounting for many of the 300,000 West Virginia residents who\u2019ve gone three days without clean tap water.\n\nChris Laws found bottled water on Saturday for his two elderly next-door neighbors.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t get out,\u201d said Laws, 42, of Marmet, a coal miner. \u201cI\u2019m keeping an eye on them. You got to watch out for your neighbors. They\u2019re the ones who are going to watch out for you.\u201d\n\nHe said he was angry at the company at the center of the leak, Freedom Industries.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are facing bad situations because of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling. What I don\u2019t understand is how did this happen?\u201d\n\nThe emergency began Thursday following complaints to West Virginia American Water about a licorice-type odor in the tap water. The source: the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, which had leaked out of a 40,000-gallon tank at a Freedom Industries facility along the Elk River.\n\nState officials said Saturday they believe about 7,500 gallons leaked. Some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river; it\u2019s not clear exactly how much entered the water supply.\n\nIt could take days for clean tap water to flow again. First, water sample test results must consistently show that the chemical\u2019s presence in the public water system is at or below 1 parts per million, the level recommended by federal agencies, West Virginia American Water President Jeff McIntyre said Saturday at a news conference.\n\nMost visitors have cleared out of Charleston while locals are either staying home or driving out of the area to find a hot meal or a shower elsewhere. Orders not to use tap water for much other than flushing toilets mean that the spill is an emergency not just for the environment but for local businesses.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to cook anything at home and was hoping they were open,\u201d Bill Rogers, 52, said outside a closed Tudor\u2019s Biscuit World in Marmet, just east of Charleston. \u201cIt seems like every place is closed. It\u2019s frustrating. Really frustrating.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question businesses have been hurt \u2014 particularly restaurants and hotels, said Matt Ballard, president of the Charleston Area Alliance, the state\u2019s largest regional chamber of commerce.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it can be quantified at this point because we don\u2019t know how long it will last,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping a solution by early next week so business can get back to normal.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance is urging business owners to check their insurance policies to see if they can make claims over lost sales. It plans to hold workshops to assist businesses with those issues, Ballard said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It may be some days before many West Virginia residents have clean tap water again", "title": "300,000 still without water after chemical spill", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It may be some days before many West Virginia residents have clean tap water again", "title": "300,000 still without water after chemical spill", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/12/300000_still_without_water_after_chemical_spill/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_160453973.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It may be some days before many West Virginia residents have clean tap water again", "title": "300,000 still without water after chemical spill", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_160453973.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Associated Press", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, chemical spill, Environment, Water, West Virginia, West Virginia American Water Company", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: chemical spill, Environment, Water, West Virginia, West Virginia American Water Company, Sustainability News, NewsCHARLESTON, W.Va.
