"Informatica plans to announce next week new products designed to help healthcare entities speed data analysis and make better use of aging applications, the company revealed to Healthcare IT News.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of the data management vendor stating that it has agreed to a private equity buyout by Permira Funds and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board potentially valued at $5.3 billion.\n\nNext week at HIMSS15, in fact, Informatica is slated to unveil Healthcare Analytics Accelerator as well as the Application Retirement for Healthcare Solution.\n\nThe Analytics Accelerator enables healthcare organizations to access and trust data from a variety of sources and formats, according to Michelle Blackmer, Informatica\u2019s healthcare industry marketing director.\n\n\u201cHealthcare organizations can extract the data from all these applications and bring it together in its raw form, but integrated,\u201d Blackmer said. \u201cNow analysts can have access to that data through any kind of query tool, whether it\u2019s Microsoft Sequel Server, Excel, or a business intelligence tool.\u201d\n\nAs healthcare organizations increasingly rely on data analytics to treat patients, monitor disease trends, and improve operational efficiencies, they must confront challenges regarding data quality and the length of the analytics process.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as providers modernize or consolidate their IT systems, many implement new applications while still running older software.\n\n\u201cHealthcare providers may have every intention of retiring old applications, but then they fall behind or get so focused on implementing new applications that they don\u2019t circle back,\u201d Blackmer explained. \u201cBut that means they\u2019re paying maintenance and they\u2019re supporting an application that they might just need for analytics purposes.\u201d\n\nInformatica\u2019s Application Retirement for Healthcare Solution aims to eliminate the cost of maintaining these legacy applications while enabling easy access to retired data that can be used for reporting, analytics and operations.\n\n\u201cThe solution allows them to archive those applications and maintain access to the data from a reporting standpoint but retire paying maintenance on it,\u201d Blackmer said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new tools will
