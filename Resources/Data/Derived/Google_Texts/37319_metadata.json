(Courtesy of The Little Sisters of the Poor)\n\nTwo members of the order of Catholic nuns waging a court battle against President Obama\u2019s signature health-care reform law will attend his final State of the Union address Tuesday as guests of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis).\n\nThe Little Sisters of Poor are challenging the health law\u2019s requirement that group insurance plans offer contraceptive coverage at no additional cost. The order runs 30 nursing homes in the United States, and while it has invoked a \u201cconscience clause\u201d in the health law meant to accommodate religious objections, its female employees would remain eligible for free birth control from a third party under a workaround devised by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That workaround is on hold pending the outcome of the litigation.\n\nThe nuns are challenging the conscience-clause workaround, and they have the backing of leaders ranging from Ryan to Pope Francis, who met with the sisters during his September trip to Washington. The Supreme Court announced in December it would take up the sisters\u2019 case this year.\n\n[At the Supreme Court, \u2018Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019 has a ring to it]\n\nRyan, who is Catholic, announced Monday that Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, the order\u2019s mother provincial, and Sister Constance Veit will sit in the Speaker\u2019s Box during Tuesday\u2019s address. \u201cThe Little Sisters of the Poor care for the most vulnerable among us, and they should be free to practice their faith without the threat of government interference or intimidation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Sisters\u2019 stand in defense of religious liberty \u2013 one of our most fundamental rights \u2013 is nothing short of courageous, and it\u2019s my privilege to support their cause.\u201d\n\nThe sisters are the most sharply political guests that will be seated in the Speaker\u2019s Box on Tuesday. Ryan has also invited a young constituent \u2013 4-year-old Logan Barritt of Milton, Wis. \u2013 who, with the help of his parents, used $1.90 from his piggy bank to seed more than $1,300 in donations to fund care packages for military members overseas.\n\nRyan is also seeking to highlight his anti-poverty agenda just a few days after hosting a poverty-themed presidential candidates forum in South Carolina, inviting several figures involved in faith-based and nonprofit programs for the poor.\n\n[Paul Ryan turns the GOP presidential race toward a forgotten issue: Poverty]\n\nThey include, according to a list furnished by Ryan\u2019s office, the Rev. Melvin Hargrove, president of Racine Unified School District and the founder of Zoe Outreach Ministries; Bishop Shirley Holloway, founder of House of Help City of Hope in Washington; Pastor Omar Jahwar, founder of Vision Regeneration, a gang intervention group in Dallas; Antong Lucky, founder of We Make Real Music, another Dallas-based gang intervention group; and Joanna Wynn, founder of Walkin\u2019 In My Shoes of Kenosha, Wis. Ryan\u2019s office helped Wynn secure federal disability benefits more than a decade ago and now leads an organization \u201cdedicated to helping young people break the cycle of poverty.\u201d\n\nAlso attending at Ryan\u2019s invitation is Robert Woodson, founder and president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant winner who has long been celebrated by conservative thinkers for his advocacy for community-based solutions to poverty.\n\nCorrection: This article has been changed to state that the Little Sisters of the Poor manages 30 nursing homes inside the United States instead of around the world. Also, the order\u2019s employees are not currently eligible for free contraception due to a court order that will remain in place until the pending litigation is resolved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul D.
