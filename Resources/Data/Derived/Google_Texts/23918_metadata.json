L. No. 111-148, and amended the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product. The BPCIA also includes procedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications for licensure of biological products submitted under the BPCIA. As part of these new procedures, amendments were also made to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e).\n\nIn the first reported decisions on disputes concerning the BPCIA, the litigants did not follow the BPCIA patent dispute procedures, as codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(l), colloquially known as the \u201cpatent dance\u201d. In Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc., No. C-13-2904 MMC (N.D. Cal. November 12, 2013), prior to filing an application for approval of its biosimilar product, Sandoz sued Amgen and Hoffman-La Roche Inc., seeking a declaratory judgment that two patents were invalid and unenforceable and would not be infringed if Sandoz offered for sale or sold a biosimilar product to Amgen\u2019s Enbrel (used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis). The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss because Sandoz had not complied with its obligations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 262(l)(2)-(6) and Sandoz had not established subject matter jurisdiction for a declaratory judgment action. On appeal, in Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc., 773 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the Federal Circuit affirmed on the basis that the case did not meet the \u201cimmediacy and reality\u201d requirements necessary for a justiciable case or controversy under the Declaratory Judgment Act and Article III of the Constitution, and did not reach the issue of whether failure to participate in the \u201cpatent dance\u201d required dismissal of the action.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Marilyn Neiman", "description": "The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (\u201cBPCIA\u201d) was enacted on March 23, 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.
