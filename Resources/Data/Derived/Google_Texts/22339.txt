The 2016 enrollment period for Covered California health insurance runs November 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016. Residents can apply for coverage on the State exchange online at sonoma-county.org/healthcarereform and mybenefitscalwin.org, or in-person through at the County Human Services Dept. Economic Assistance offices and various locations throughout the County, including the Redwood Community Health Clinics. See the online listing of enrollment locations, or call Economic Assistance at (877) 699-6868. For Covered California coverage that takes effect January 1, the purchase deadline is December 15, 2015.

“No one should have to worry about losing their health insurance when they change jobs or launch a business. No one should have to worry about losing their home because of an unexpected medical emergency. The Affordable Care Act and Covered California have gone a long way toward making these fears a thing of the past – we are urging the public to sign up for coverage during the open enrollment period,” said Sonoma County Supervisor Efren Carrillo. Supervisor Carrillo serves as liaison to both the Department of Health Services and Human Services Department.

“Many low-income clients apply for Covered California subsidized insurance and are happily surprised to find they are eligible for free or low-cost coverage through Medi-Cal,” says Human Services Department Economic Assistance Director Kim Seamans. “Residents covered by either program have access to the same services, so their needs can be met either way.” Medi-Cal enrollment, unlike Covered California, is open year-round online and through the Economic Assistance offices.

As a result of the federal Affordable Care Act, most Americans are required to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. In 2016, the penalty will be $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to $2,085 per family or 2.5% of yearly household income, whichever is higher.

To avoid any penalties, Sonoma County residents are encouraged to sign up for the State program, Covered California, by December 15, 2015 in order to have required coverage as of January 1, 2016. Says Seamans, “For lower-income residents, it’s not a question of whether they are eligible, it’s a matter of finding out what they are eligible for. Economic Assistance expects to take in a large number of applications in the next few months, so we ask people to be patient with the process.”

The Department of Health Services Director Dr. Stephan Betz stated, “We are striving to be the healthiest county in California, and an important part of that effort is making sure our residents have access to medical care regardless of income. Enrolling residents in health coverage through Covered California or Medi-Cal is one way individuals and their families can remain healthy and covered.”

Currently, more than 100,000 people in Sonoma County are on Medi-Cal. In 2014-2015, Human Services Department Economic Assistance Division enrolled more than 12,700 people in Covered California plans. Based on household income, an individual or family may qualify for a tax credit to help pay for health care coverage through Covered California, or for a low- or no-cost plan through Medi-Cal.
