Interpreter-gate just won’t go away. And thanks to Saturday Night Live, we can laugh at the debacle just one more time.

The South African deaf interpreter who signed what amounted to gibberish during Nelson Mandela’s memorial service last week was spoofed in the opening skit on the latest “Saturday Nigh Live.”

Fake signer Thamsanqa Jantjie “clearly had no idea what he was doing,” Obama, played by cast member Jay Pharaoh, said in the spoof presidential address — only to be joined at the podium moments later by a grinning and gesticulating Kenan Thompson.

“We have our best people working on it,” “Obama” insisted of the Obamacare website woes, as Thompson used both hands to trace the silhouette of a bootylicious woman and then flashed two thumbs up.

Pharaoh soon summoned a pair of fake Secret Service agents to drag the fake signer away.

Watch the skit and have a happy Monday!
