For North Carolina, the number of individuals under state or federal correctional authority nearly tripled from 1978 to 2013, increasing to 356 from 214 individuals per 100,000 residents over this time period. This growth in the state\u2019s imprisonment rate is accompanied by increased state corrections spending \u2013 rising from $538 million in 1978 up to $1.7 billion in 2013 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nGrowth in the state\u2019s imprisonment population has been costly for North Carolina and nationally. More and more state dollars for state corrections spending has contributed to fewer dollars available for public schools and other public investments that serve as the foundation of economic growth. In 2011, state lawmakers passed the Justice Reinvestment Act, which aims to manage the state\u2019s prison population growth by creating better outcomes for offenders and, in turn, reduce recidivism. However, the state\u2019s ongoing revenue crisis resulting from costly tax cuts and continued budget cuts limit opportunities for proven, cost-effective initiatives, such as drug treatment courts.\n\nWhat is clear is that state corrections operations in North Carolina consume a significant amount of resources, and individuals, at the expense of other important public investments.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f78\"", "article_summary": "This growth in the state\u2019s imprisonment rate is accompanied by increased state corrections spending \u2013 rising from $538 million in 1978 up to $1.7 billion in 2013 when adjusted for inflation.\nGrowth in the state\u2019s imprisonment population has been costly for North Carolina and nationally.\nMore and more state dollars for state corrections spending has contributed to fewer dollars available for public schools and other public investments that serve as the foundation of economic growth.\nAn insightful interactive map created by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows the extraordinary growth in imprisonment rates nationwide.\nWhat is clear is that state corrections operations in North Carolina consume a significant amount of resources, and individuals, at the expense of other important public investments."}
