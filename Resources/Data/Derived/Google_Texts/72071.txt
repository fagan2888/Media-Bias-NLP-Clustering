The above is video of professional wrestler Daniel Bryan, a former WWE champion who owns one of the greatest chants in human history.

Imagine this man, known in real life as Bryan Danielson, chasing down a couple of burglary suspects he saw exiting his home, subduing one of them until officers arrived, and rightly exploding the Internet.

The AP reports:

“I saw the guys running out the back. I chased them. I caught one of them. I kept him until police got there,” Danielson said.

Danielson and Cesar Sosa, 22, got into a struggle, but the former champ subdued him until officers arrived, Phoenix police Sgt. Tommy Thompson said. The second suspect got away.

The former champ said he didn’t have to apply the “Yes! lock” — his signature move — to get Sosa to surrender, but he did put him in a rear naked choke hold.

Danielson noted that it “didn’t take much” to take the guy down.

Perhaps not. He has some experience taking down mountains.
