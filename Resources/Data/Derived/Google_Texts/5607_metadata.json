Small business owners have split and shifting views about hot-button issues like religious freedom bills, pot legalization and the 2016 presidential race, a new poll found.\n\nManta conducted a series of polls among its small business community, and found that \u201c2015 is shaping up to be a politically charged year for small businesses \u2014 from Indiana to presidential candidates to the legalization of marijuana,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nWith Indiana and Arkansas drawing ire from citizens and corporations alike over their passage of their Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) legislation, a family-owned pizzeria in Indiana became a prime example of just how such laws can affect small businesses.\n\nREAD MORE: Indiana hires PR firm to fix image in wake of religious freedom bill controversy\n\nMemories Pizza's proprietors told a local news affiliate they would refuse to cater for a same-sex wedding \u2012 a right they said is provided to them under the Indiana RFRA. The eatery immediately became the face of a much-larger movement waged against the state\u2019s so-called \u201clicense to discriminate.\u201d The attention eventually prompted the store to temporarily close amid security concerns, the owners said. The Indiana pizzeria raised close to a million dollars from people upset with the backlash.\n\nIn light of the national debate on RFRA bills, Mantra asked small businesses whether they would support a similar initiative in their own state. A slim majority \u2012 53 percent \u2012 said that they would not.\n\nOther legislation is spreading among states as well, including bills about the use of both medical and recreational marijuana.\n\nAs more and more states follow the lead of Colorado and Washington in the legalization of pot \u2012 or, at the very least, decriminalization of the drug \u2012 small businesses are almost evenly split on whether it will be a net boom or bust for their local economies. The survey showed 29 percent believe legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana would be a boon for local small businesses, while 32 percent dissented and 39 percent were unsure.\n\nThe legalization won\u2019t prevent employers from requiring their workers to take drug tests \u2012 42 percent of small business owners report that they will either begin or continue their current practice of drug testing, if marijuana is legalized in their state.\n\nManta found that testing may be a smart move. The poll showed 59 percent of respondents who don\u2019t own a small business said they wouldn\u2019t patronize a small business that didn\u2019t drug test its employees, even if marijuana is legalized or decriminalized.\n\nREAD MORE: Majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana \u2013 polls\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA, better known as Obamacare) also has a significant impact on small businesses. It remains controversial, Manta found, particularly among small business owners tackling changes in premiums and new coverage requirements.\n\n\u201c\u2018Obamacare\u2019 is not yet in full effect for many small businesses, but they\u2019re already feeling the squeeze,\u201d Manta said. \u201cFor those not offering health insurance, the impact on growth and hiring can be severe.\u201d\n\nNearly six in 10 \u2012 59 percent \u2012 of small businesses don\u2019t offer health insurance because it\u2019s too expensive and, of those that do, 77 percent saw premiums increase since their last renewal. Almost a quarter \u2012 24 percent \u2012 of those businesses that don\u2019t offer health care said they have lost potential employees to other job opportunities because they did not offer health insurance.\n\nManta discovered \u201ca significant [political] shift among small business owners\u201d in its poll.\n\nAmong the 2016 presidential hopefuls, Hillary Clinton has the highest approval with 42 percent of small business owners\u2019 support, even though they have \u201ctraditionally swayed Republican.\u201d As recently as August 2014, Clinton was ranked in third place behind prospective GOP candidates Mitt Romney, who has declined to run, and Rand Paul, who has since entered the race.\n\nManta is a company that provides online resources dedicated to helping small businesses become more competitive in their respective industries, Manta says on its website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Competition from big corporations isn\u2019t the only thing entrepreneurs worry about.
