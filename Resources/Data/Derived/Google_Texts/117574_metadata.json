(AP) - Arkansas is at risk of losing more than $50 million in federal highway funding after the state\u2019s highest court ruled that prosecutors must show intent in driving while intoxicated cases, a state transportation official said Tuesday.\n\nA spokesman for the Highway and Transportation Department said a change in state law is needed so the state will still be eligible to receive certain federal highway funds. Spokesman Danny Straessle said the department hopes Gov. Asa Hutchinson will include changing state law on the agenda for a special session convening next week for an economic development project.\n\n\u201cAny loss of federal funding is a concern because federal funding is at a premium right now,\u201d Straessle said. \u201cAny of those federal funds that are at risk, we want to minimize that risk and make sure we don\u2019t miss out on any of that money.\u201d\n\nJustices last month reversed the DWI conviction of a Springdale man who was caught \u201csleep driving\u201d after taking Ambien. The driver appealed, arguing state law requires someone to knowingly drive while intoxicated in order to be convicted.\n\nStraessle said highway officials are worried the ruling would put Arkansas out of compliance with certain DWI laws the government requires states to have to receive some highway funding.\n\nSen. David Johnson, who had raised concerns about the ruling earlier this month, said he believed the law can be changed to clarify that DWI is a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d offense, meaning one that doesn\u2019t requiring proving mental intent.\n\n\u201cThe solution is an easy fix,\u201d Johnson, D-Little Rock, said. \u201cThe Arkansas Supreme Court identified an obvious ambiguity and it\u2019s an ambiguity the Legislature needs to fix.\u201d\n\nHutchinson last week announced he was calling a special session beginning May 26 to take up an incentive package aimed at helping Lockheed Martin win a defense contract for its facility in south Arkansas. A spokesman said Hutchinson on Wednesday will announce what else would be on the agenda for the session, and said the DWI law change was among the items he was considering including.\n\nThe concern about the potential funding loss comes as the state has put more than $282 million in road projects on hold because of uncertainty surrounding the Federal Highway Trust Fund.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas is at risk of losing more than $50 million in federal highway funding after the state's highest court ruled that prosecutors must show intent in driving while intoxicated cases, a state transportation official said Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/19/officials-fear-50-million-at-risk-after-arkansas-d/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Arkansas is at risk of losing more than $50 million in federal highway funding after the state\u2019s highest court ruled that prosecutors must show intent in driving while intoxicated cases, a state transportation official said Tuesday.", "title": "Officials fear $50 million at risk after Arkansas DWI ruling"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arkansas is at risk of losing more than $50 million in federal highway funding after the state's highest court ruled that prosecutors must show intent in driving while intoxicated cases, a state trans", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Officials fear $50 million at risk after Arkansas DWI ruling"}, "Author": "ANDREW DeMILLO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc70f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAny loss of federal funding is a concern because federal funding is at a premium right now,\u201d Straessle said.\nThe driver appealed, arguing state law requires someone to knowingly drive while intoxicated in order to be convicted.\nStraessle said highway officials are worried the ruling would put Arkansas out of compliance with certain DWI laws the government requires states to have to receive some highway funding.\n(AP) - Arkansas is at risk of losing more than $50 million in federal highway funding after the state\u2019s highest court ruled that prosecutors must show intent in driving while intoxicated cases, a state transportation official said Tuesday.\nAsa Hutchinson will include changing state law on the agenda for a special session convening next week for an economic development project."}
