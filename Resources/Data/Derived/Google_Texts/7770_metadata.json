But the 2013 numbers were skewed because of the inclusion of the $20 billion deal that took Round Rock-based Dell Inc. private.\n\nThe 255 deal count is actually understated. To prevent duplication, Mergermarket includes a deal only if the target company is based in Texas.\n\nThat excludes the biggest deal announced in the quarter, AT&T\u2019s $65 billion acquisition of DirecTV. AT&T is based in Dallas; DirecTV, the target company, is based in California.\n\nNonetheless, the increase is big.\n\n\u201cThis is the most sustained recovery on M&A that we\u2019ve seen since before the recession,\u201d says Scott Cohen, a corporate partner at Jones Day in Dallas. \u201cI like what I see, but I always want more and I\u2019m always afraid it will end.\u201d\n\nSharing the wealth\n\nCohen says the surge \u201ccrosses virtually all industries,\u201d including energy, food, health care, chemicals and technology. One of the more high-profile non-energy deals came in January, when the private equity firm Apollo Global Management purchased Irving-based CEC Entertainment, parent of Chuck E. Cheese, for $1.3 billion.\n\n\u201cOur health care group is swamped, our consumer products and food folks are very active, and, of course, energy deals are going crazy,\u201d says Rick Lacher, managing director of investment banking for Houlihan Lokey in Dallas. \u201cPeople are simply more bullish on the economy, money is readily available, and that makes for a good M&A market.\u201d\n\nMenges points out that the Affordable Care Act has created a resurgence in deal-making among health care companies seeking to add services offering new types of medical devices or new technologies.\n\n\u20182006 again\u2019\n\n\u201cThe credit markets are wide open and financing is readily available,\u201d says Andrew Calder, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Houston. \u201cIt is an exciting time. It feels like 2006 again.\u201d\n\nWhile most business sectors have witnessed increased M&A activity, this is still Texas, where oil and gas reign.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the 255 public deals were in the energy sector.\n\nLawyers say that many of the deals this year involve companies that are shedding assets not core to their long-term business plan and using that cash to buy assets that are core.\n\nA good example is Canada-based Encana Corp., which sold $1.8 billion in natural gas assets in Wyoming to Fort-Worth-based TPG Capital on March 31, only to use that cash five weeks later to purchase $3.1 billion in Eagle Ford shale assets that include oil from Freeport-McMoRan.\n\nAt the same time, private equity firms have become even more aggressive in snatching up assets viewed as strong long-term investments.\n\n\u201c2013 was a record fundraising year for private equity firms, diversified funds and mega-funds, and now those firms are searching for places to invest,\u201d says Chris Rowley, an M&A partner at Vinson & Elkins in Dallas.\n\n\u201cWe are also seeing a lot of new energy deals that are private and are not included in the Mergermarket data,\u201d says Rowley. \u201cFor example, we have seen private equity funds also backing private energy management teams with equity lines of credit to help them grow organically.\u201d\n\nRobin Fredrickson, an oil and gas partner at Latham & Watkins, continues to handle a lot of joint ventures \u2014 an increasing number of them private, she says \u2014 involving private equity firms or foreign-based energy companies.\n\nChad Watt, an M&A specialist at Mergermarket, said that corporate lawyers and investment bankers are the huge financial winners in the M&A surge.\n\nWho\u2019s who\n\nMergermarket data show that Vinson & Elkins was involved in 35 of the 255 deals, followed by Jones Day (23), Latham (22) and Kirkland (20).\n\nGoldman Sachs, Evercore Partners and JPMorgan took the top financial advisory spots, though boutiques served as financial advisers in a growing number of deals.\n\nWatt notes that all parties \u2014 the buyer, seller and lending institution \u2014 in a merger or acquisition employ lawyers who, unlike investment bankers, are paid whether the deal closes or fails.\n\n\u201cThis is a very good time to be an M&A lawyer in Texas,\u201d says Watt.\n\nMenges offers a slight warning.\n\n\u201cI worry that there is now an M&A fever or an exuberance similar to the pre-Lehman collapse days,\u201d he says. \u201cThe good news is that most of today\u2019s investors have the scars and experiences from those days and they have become a lot more diligent in their deal-making.\u201d\n\nFor a list of law firms and investment banks that handled the most M&As in Texas,
