Note: Hospital referral regions are defined by assigning hospital service areas to the region where the greatest proportion of major cardiovascular procedures are performed, with minor modifications to achieve geographic contiguity, a minimum population size of 120,000, and a high localization index. A hospital service area is a collection of zip codes whose residents receive most of their hospitalizations from the hospitals in that area. Medicare reimbursements shown in the figure correspond to a random sample of enrollees belonging to both the Medicare A (inpatient) and B (physician services) programs.
