He will play on a line with Paul Stastny and Gabe Landeskog, on the right wing. While Tanguay will play against the Panthers, he will get Saturday\u2019s game off against Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to overdo it right away with Alex,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cThe plan is to have him take (Saturday) off, then come back Tuesday in Dallas. It\u2019s good to have him back. We were playing so well when he got hurt. It\u2019s nice to have everybody back. This is kind of the lineup we projected, and we have more depth now.\u201d\n\nRoy will move hot rookie Nathan MacKinnon back to center on the third line, playing with Max Talbot and P.A. Parenteau.\n\nSemyon Varlamov will start in goal against Florida veteran Tim Thomas, who beat the Avs in a game at the Pepsi Center earlier this season. The Panthers will be without rookie center and leading scorer Aleksander Barkov, who is hurt. Barkov went second overall to Florida in last year\u2019s NHL draft, one spot behind MacKinnon.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alex Tanguay nervous, excited for return to Avs lineup in Florida", "title": "Alex Tanguay nervous, excited for return to Avs lineup in Florida", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/24/alex-tanguay-nervous-excited-for-return-to-avs-lineup-in-florida/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140123_113908_alex-tanguay-avs-1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140123_113908_alex-tanguay-avs-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T13:19:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T08:08:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SUNRISE, fla. \u2014 Alex Tanguay has been an NHL player since 1999, but he sounded like a rookie Friday morning.\nThe Panthers will be without rookie center and leading scorer Aleksander Barkov, who is hurt.\nWhile Tanguay will play against the Panthers, he will get Saturday\u2019s game off against Tampa Bay.\n\u201cNervous, anxious,\u201d is how the Avalanche forward described his emotions following the team\u2019s morning skate at the BB&T Center, where the team will play the Florida Panthers to kick off a three-game road trip.\nBarkov went second overall to Florida in last year\u2019s NHL draft, one spot behind MacKinnon."}
