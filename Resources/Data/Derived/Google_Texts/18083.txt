“Saturday Night Live” hit on North Korea and the Sony hacks twice this weekend, proving that unlike most of Hollywood, they aren’t scared of Kim Jong-un.

The show started off with a bang, bringing back Mike Myers as Dr. Evil to interrupt the cold open and discuss his anger over the North Korea and Sony hacker situation.

“What the F people? It’s just silly to see you two fight over a silly comedy,” he said. “It’s like watching two bald men fight over a comb. Who cares?”

But he is not mad that “The Interview” won’t be in theaters. Dr. Evil is upset that these stupid hackers are giving evil a bad name and his response is absolutely perfect.

Kim Jong-un also made an appearance on the show’s “Weekend Update” segment in the form of cast member Bobby Moynihan. Though Moynihan quickly found out that might not have been the best idea.

His co-host warned him that the bit could be dangerous and shortly after, a number of red dots from sniper guns were promptly aiming at Moynihan’s chest.

He broke character to “save his life” although he still skipped over giving the assassins his real name.

“I’m Seth Rogen,” he joked. “Seth Rogen, everybody.”
