"Flush from victory after securing the release of four American prisoners from Iran, Secretary of State John Kerry played right into the hands of congressional Republicans still furious over the landmark nuclear deal with the Middle Eastern nation.\n\nIn an interview with CNCBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the nation\u2019s top diplomat said he couldn\u2019t rule out that some of the money Iran is due to receive in sanctions relief would end up in the pockets of groups the U.S. and other countries consider to be terrorist organizations.\n\nRelated: Kerry: Iran\u2019s Frozen Assets Are Far Less Than $150 Billion\n\n\u201cI think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists,\u201d Kerry said, referring to Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n\u201cYou know, to some degree, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I can tell you this: Right now, we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time.\u201d\n\nOne of the GOP\u2019 chief criticisms of the nuclear deal with Iran is that Tehran would receive $150 billion in sanctions relief which could be used to fund terrorist groups or efforts aimed at further destabilizing the already volatile region.\n\nThat dollar amount was repeated so much by lawmakers and Republican White House hopefuls, including frontrunner Donald Trump, that Kerry was forced to respond earlier this week, saying the figure would likely be closer to $50 billion after Iran met its international debts.\n\nRelated: Is Obama\u2019s \u2018Good Day\u2019 with Iran the First of Many?\n\nThursday\u2019s concession, however slight, sent the GOP into a rage, and party representatives wasted no time linking it to the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cSecretary Kerry admitted what we suspected all along \u2013 that the nuclear deal Hillary Clinton spearheaded with Iran is a giant stimulus bill for radical Islamic terrorists,\u201d Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus said in a statement.\n\nThe former secretary of State\u2019s defense of the nuclear accord \u201cis another reminder of the failed foreign policy she would continue if elected,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats have a simple decision to make: join with Republicans to block sanctions relief that will aid terrorists, or continue to support President Obama and his failed foreign policy,\u201d a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee said in a statement.\n\nRelated: Iran Sanctions Lifted As Nuclear Infrastructure Is Disabled\n\nAn aide to House Speaker Paul Ryan (WI) put out a release ripping Kerry.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, Mr. Secretary, tell us something we don\u2019t know,\u201d the release said.\n\nKerry\u2019s statement likely also will add new fuel to the fire that the $1.7 billion the U.S. gave to Iran, amid the prisoner swap that saw the American freed for seven Iranians, was actually a ransom payment and not at all linked a financial dispute dating back to the 1980s.\n\nThe White House has adamantly denied the charge, but that won\u2019t stop it being repeated over and over again, much like the supposed $150 billion in sanctions relief, as Election Day draws closer and Republicans look to hammer Democrats on the issue of national security.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Flush from victory after helping
