Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican and presidential contender, told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump, the flamboyant presidential candidate who has been topping Republican primary polls, piled on with his trademark candor, saying Mrs. Clinton is effectively disqualified from the race.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, what she\u2019s done is criminal. I don\u2019t see how she can run,\u201d Mr. Trump told CNN.\n\nBoth the State Department and intelligence community inspectors general looked into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, and concluded information contained in them should be withheld from the public because it should be classified. Their memo urged the State Department to enact better controls to make sure the emails being put out in public weren\u2019t divulging secrets.\n\nMrs. Clinton has said she set up the separate account on a private server largely out of convenience \u2014 though some of her specific reasons, such as not wanting to carry multiple phones, have proved dubious \u2014 and her office has said she did not send or receive classified information on the account.\n\nBut the revelation of the account has been a headache for Mrs. Clinton, who is fending off attacks from congressional Republicans investigating her actions in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, and a primary challenge from Sen. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination and drawing huge crowds with his left-populist message.\n\nRepublican presidential contenders say the roadblocks in the early throes of her second White House run are the byproducts of her own decisions.\n\nMr. Trump said her handling of email \u201cis far worse than what General [David H.] Petraeus did, and he\u2019s gone down in disgrace,\u201d referring to the decorated general who resigned as director of the CIA amid allegations he shared classified information during an affair with his biographer.\n\nUntil now, Mr. Trump had reserved his sharpest attacks for his fellow Republicans \u2014 criticizing the war record of Sen. John McCain, calling Sen. Lindsey Graham a lightweight who wouldn\u2019t be able to find work in the private sector and tossing other barbs at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nYet Mrs. Clinton would easily defeat Mr. Trump, by 56 percent to 40 percent, in a hypothetical general election, according to a new poll from CNN-ORC, while edging former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush by 5 percentage points and Mr. Walker by 9.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters have accused congressional Republicans of trying to erode that edge by attacking her role in the wake of the Benghazi attacks and sensationalizing her email arrangement.\n\nThe fight spilled onto Capitol Hill over the weekend, as the House Select Committee investigating the Benghazi attacks split along partisan lines over the importance of the inspector general\u2019s move.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and the panel\u2019s chairman, said committee members on both sides have been aware of concerns about classified emails within the \u201cself-selected record\u201d turned over by Mrs. Clinton. He reiterated his call for Mrs. Clinton to turn over her private server for an independent forensic evaluation.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether the server is voluntarily relinquished or acquired by other lawful means,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is clearly sufficient cause to examine the contents of said server for the presence of other classified information.\u201d\n\nThe sides couldn\u2019t even agree this week on whether Mrs. Clinton was set to testify before the committee. Her campaign said she was willing to testify Oct. 22, although the committee said it was still negotiating with her lawyer.\n\nThe New York Times, which first reported on the potential email problems, said the State Department and intelligence community inspectors general had referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. The paper printed a correction Friday, retracting the claim of a criminal referral and saying Mrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t specifically targeted in the referral.\n\n\u201cMaybe the heat is getting to everybody,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at an event in New York City, adding \u201cthere have been a lot of inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump said he preferred the first version of the Times story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to me, how she\u2019s been protected,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2981 Stephen Dinan, David Sherfinski and Maggie Ybarra contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential contenders blasted Hillary Rodham Clinton's use of a private email server Sunday ahead of a possible showdown, saying revelations about classified material in some of the messages vindicates doubts about her trustworthiness.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republican presidential contenders blasted Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server Sunday ahead of a possible showdown, saying revelations about classified material in some of the messages vindicates doubts about her trustworthiness.", "title": "Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of \u2018criminal\u2019 activity in email scandal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/26/donald-trump-accuses-hillary-clinton-of-criminal-a/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/21/7_212015_gop-trump-2016-2-118201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/21/7_212015_gop-trump-2016-2-118201.jpg", "description": "Republican presidential contenders blasted Hillary Rodham Clinton's use of a private email server Sunday ahead of a possible showdown, saying revelations about classified material in some of the messa", "card": "summary", "title": "Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of \u2018criminal\u2019 activit"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Donald Trump, Department Of State, Department Of Justice"}, "article_summary": "The paper printed a correction Friday, retracting the claim of a criminal referral and saying Mrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t specifically targeted in the referral.\nTheir memo urged the State Department to enact better controls to make sure the emails being put out in public weren\u2019t divulging secrets.\nHe reiterated his call for Mrs. Clinton to turn over her private server for an independent forensic evaluation.\nRepublican presidential contenders blasted Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server Sunday ahead of a possible showdown, saying revelations about classified material in some of the messages vindicates doubts about her trustworthiness.\nYet Mrs. Clinton would easily defeat Mr. Trump, by 56 percent to 40 percent, in a hypothetical general election, according to a new poll from CNN-ORC, while edging former Florida Gov."}
