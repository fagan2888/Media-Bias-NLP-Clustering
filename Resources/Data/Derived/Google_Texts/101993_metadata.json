Judge Ronald White of the Eastern District of Oklahoma decided Pruitt v. Burwell on September 30.\n\nWhite\u2019s decision centered on the language of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which specifies subsidies are available for plans purchased on exchanges \u201cestablished by a state under Section 1311.\u201d No similar language authorizing subsidies exists elsewhere in the Obamacare law regarding exchanges established by the federal government, leading Judge White to conclude subsidies are only available for plans purchased through state-based exchanges.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a consequential victory for the rule of law,\u201d Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who brought the lawsuit, said in a statement after the decision was announced. \u201cThe administration and its bureaucrats in the IRS handed out billions in illegal tax credits and subsidies and vastly expanded the reach of the health care law because they didn\u2019t like the way Congress wrote the Affordable Care Act.\u2026 Today's ruling vindicates what we recognized early on, and that is the administration can't rewrite the Affordable Care Act by executive fiat.\u201d\n\nActual Wording vs. Presumed Intent\n\nThe heart of the dispute is whether the federal government can provide subsidies for individuals purchasing health plans through the federal exchange. Although the text of the law authorizes subsidies only on exchanges established by states, the IRS determined in May 2012 the statute allowed subsidies for plans bought on exchanges not set up by states.\n\nAdvocates of Obamacare claim it was not Congress\u2019 intent to provide subsidies only to plans bought on exchanges established by the states, and that the language of the law suggesting otherwise is a drafting error.\n\nOpponents, meanwhile, argue Congress knew exactly what it was doing, or at least it\u2019s not clear lawmakers intended to offer subsidies for health plans purchased on federal exchanges, and that many others also understood the language of Obamacare meant no subsidies for plans sold through a federal exchange.\n\nIn a report for American Action Forum, a nonprofit organization that opposes Obamacare, health care policy researcher Brittany La Couture documents Idaho and Indiana contemporaneously understood the law to mean no subsidies would be available in their state if they relied on a federal exchange, leading the former to establish a state-based exchange and the latter to reject one.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that state legislators who spent a reasonable amount of time and resources to gain a thorough understanding of the law consistently recognized the true effect of establishing an exchange on subsidy eligibility for their citizens,\u201d La Couture concluded. \u201cThese legislators understood the plain text of the law to say that eligibility for federal subsidies arises only from an exchange established by a state under Section 1311, and not from an exchange established by the federal government on behalf of the state. This understanding did ultimately contribute to states\u2019 decisions on whether or not to establish their exchanges.\u201d\n\nObamacare Architect: State-Only\n\nContradicting the argument for interpreting the letter of the law as an unintentional drafting error are several statements by one of the chief architects of the law, MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, stating subsidies were intended only for state-based exchanges.\n\nIn July, videotapes of Gruber speaking to different groups about state exchanges and subsidies surfaced. In one video he tells the group, \u201cThat is really the ultimate threat\u2014will people understand that, gee, if your governor doesn\u2019t set up an exchange, you\u2019re losing hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits to be delivered to your citizens.\u2026 So that\u2019s the other threat, is will states do what they need to do to set it up.\u201d\n\nIn another, even more explicit statement caught on tape, Gruber says, \u201cWhat\u2019s important to remember politically about this is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits\u2014but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. So you\u2019re essentially saying [to] your citizens you\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country. I hope that that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges.\u201d\n\nGruber, who was paid $400,000 by the Obama administration to consult on the law\u2019s development, has since claimed he didn\u2019t mean what he said, that his comments were a \u201cspeak-o,\u201d the verbal equivalent of a typo.\n\nHeaded for Supreme Court?\n\nJudge White\u2019s ruling shows he was not swayed by the Obama administration\u2019s argument that it was simply a drafting error.\n\n\u201c\u2026[T]he court is upholding the Act as written,\u201d Judge White wrote in his ruling, citing a 1993 case that found \u201c\u2026vague notions of a statute\u2019s \u2018basic\u2019 purpose are nonetheless inadequate to overcome the words of its text\u2026\u201d\n\nJudge White immediately stayed his order prohibiting subsidies for plans purchased on federal exchanges, assuming there would be an appeal. Appeals have also been filed over rulings in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which also ruled subsidies were available only through exchanges established by states, and the Fourth Circuit, which reached the opposite conclusion.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a huge win for Oklahoma, but it\u2019s just a first step,\u201d Attorney General Pruitt concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s likely this issue will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. We look forward to making our case and continuing the effort to hold federal agencies accountable to their duty to enforce the laws passed by Congress.\u201d\n\nSean Parnell (sparnell@heartland.org) is managing editor of Health Care News", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a4d\"", "article_summary": "A federal district court judge in Oklahoma ruled health insurance policies purchased through the federal exchange are not eligible for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\nIn July, videotapes of Gruber speaking to different groups about state exchanges and subsidies surfaced.\nPresumed IntentThe heart of the dispute is whether the federal government can provide subsidies for individuals purchasing health plans through the federal exchange.\nAlthough the text of the law authorizes subsidies only on exchanges established by states, the IRS determined in May 2012 the statute allowed subsidies for plans bought on exchanges not set up by states.\n\u201cThese legislators understood the plain text of the law to say that eligibility for federal subsidies arises only from an exchange established by a state under Section 1311, and not from an exchange established by the federal government on behalf of the state."}
