A New Jersey woman is accused of falsifying an emergency so that she could drive home from a bar after a night of drinking without risking arrest.

Hayley Oates, 25, made it home safely from a Wayne, New Jersey bar last Monday after calling 911, but ended up in trouble with the authorities nevertheless after bragging about her scheme on social media.

Police said Ms. Oates placed an emergency call at around 3:15 a.m. on Monday and claimed she was being attacked in the parking lot of Mother’s Ale House.

Law enforcement was quickly dispatched to the scene, but couldn’t find evidence of an assault. A subsequent review of footage captured by nearby surveillance cameras failed to provide investigators with any clues.

Soon after, however, authorities said Ms. Oates logged on to Facebook and admitted to having falsified the attack so that she could get home without worrying about being pulled over for drunk driving.

“lmao.. 2 mins later the cop peals out..silly piggies tricks r for u,” she allegedly wrote after her escapades.

Ms. Oates was charged on Thursday with filing false reports to law enforcement and creating a false public alarm, a local CBS News affiliate reported.

“You’re misusing the system. You have 911 personnel that are answering the call. You have police officers that should be doing other things, are now responding to a call that’s false so that you can drive away drunk?” said Detective Capt. Laurence Martin of the Wayne Police Department.

“And then bragging about it on social media — that’s as dumb as it gets,” he said.

Previously, a cop from nearby Paramus, New Jersey, died on the job while responding to a falsified 911 call in 1993.
