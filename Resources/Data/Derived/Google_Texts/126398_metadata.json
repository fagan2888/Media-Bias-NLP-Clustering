Committee Chairman Byron Cook has scheduled the hearing for HB 4105, HB 3130 and HB 2351.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn January, State Representative Cecil Bell (R-Magnolia) introduced HB 4105 to protect the sovereignty of Texas and traditional marriage, according to a previous report on Breitbart Texas. The bill is titled the Preservation of Sovereignty and Marriage Act.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart Texas in January, Bell talked about the firestorm from the gay community over his bill. \u201cThe homosexual community across the nation has sent several thousand emails to my capitol email account. Less than 10 percent came from Texas, but this is their national cause and this bill alarms them.\u201d\n\nBell said the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects Texas\u2019 right to determine laws related to marriage such as the Texas Traditional Marriage Constitutional Amendment. \u201cTexas will stand up and defend its constitutional rights against federal overreach,\u201d Bell said.\n\nThe bill would prohibit funds from state and local governments being used to license or support same-sex marriage. This would include the blocking of salaries of any government employee engaged in subverting Texas law regarding marriage.\n\nAlso on the agenda for Wednesday\u2019s hearing is HB 3130 by State Rep. Marsha Farney (R-Georgetown). The bill is reforms Section 1. Title 8 of the Texas Insurance Code by prohibiting insurance coverage for abortions under state exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, 42 U.S. C. Section 18021). The bill does not provide any reforms to private insurance plans relating to abortions, nor does it deal with the insurance of State of Texas employees. If this bill were to pass, Texas taxpayers would be subsidizing elective abortion coverage under these plans.\n\nHB 1435, offered by State Rep. John Smithee (R-Amarillo), does address abortion reform related to private insurance coverage. Smithee\u2019s bill has been referred to the State Affairs Committee as well, but Chairman Cook has yet to schedule it for a hearing.\n\n\u201cTexas Right to Life hopes that the House Committee on State Affairs will recognize the strength and legal scholarship in Texas Right to Life\u2019s priority bills and set these bills for hearings soon,\u201d said spokeswoman Melissa Conway, in response to questions from Breitbart Texas.\n\nHB 3130 weakens the definition in current law of a medical emergency. The bill strikes the term \u201clife-threatening.\u201d Instead, the bill states unless the immediate abortion is necessary to avert her death or \u201ca delay in performing the abortion creates a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, other than a psychological or emotional condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the committee is hearing two bills that are problematic weaker versions of the stronger bills,\u201d she continued, \u201cand we hope the committee will be open to our feedback and strengthen the bills.\n\n\u201cThe bill could be used as a loophole to authorize the coverage of elective abortions,\u201d Conway explained. \u201cThis is the opposite of the stated purpose of the bill.\u201d\n\nShe said the bill \u201cchanges the language of current law that disqualifies a woman\u2019s mental/emotional state as a medical emergency reason for abortion. For example, a woman\u2019s threat of harming herself or committing suicide in the future does not count as a medical emergency in current law, but HB 3130 changes that.\u201d\n\nThe second bill Conway referred to is HB 2351. This bill by State Rep. Patricia Harless (R-Spring) addresses the ethics committee review process used by hospitals and doctors to withdraw treatment from patients and thereby speed their deaths.\n\nCurrent Texas law [Texas Health and Safety Code, 166.046] allows a physician or hospital to withdraw life-sustaining medical treatment, including food and water, from a patient for any reason despite the patient\u2019s advance directive or expressed wishes. Once the physician\u2019s decision is made and then approved by the hospital\u2019s own ethics committee or futility committee process, the patient/family are given ten days to transfer to another facility or to another physician. Neither the physician nor the facility is obligated to provide the patient with life-sustaining treatment beyond the tenth day. This can and has led to the death of patients.\n\nHB2351 instructs health care facilities to write two types of policies about this ethics committee and the 10-day law: one on conflicts of interest and a second on discrimination of disabled patients. Neither requirement explains what the policy should be, but rather directs hospitals to write policies. This leaves the hospital free to do whatever it thinks is best. \u201cSome hospitals may not currently use written policies,\u201d Conway explained, \u201cbut hospitals still have unmitigated authority to determine who lives and who dies under the ten-day law.\u201d\n\nConway explained that another problem with HB 2351 is that it instructs health care facilities to write an internal policy concerning financial and professional conflicts of interest for the members of the ethics or futility review committee. The bill does not; however, reform current law that gives unilateral authority to the committee over the lives of patients. \u201cThere is no way to remove conflicts of interest from this process under HB 2351 without reforming current law,\u201d she stated.\n\n\u201cNeither bill scheduled for this week adequately addresses the subject matter of insurance coverage for abortion or reform to the hospital ethics committee process,\u201d Conway stated. \u201cThe committee will be allocating time on these two bills when they could be passing real reforms on insurance coverage and on the Texas Advance Directive Law.\u201d\n\n\u201cHB 1435 by Representative Smithee protects insurance consumers from subsidizing the abortion of others in three different risk pools, whereas HB 3130 only addresses the ACA exchanges,\u201d she explained. \u201cHB 3130 not only relaxes the current law on the definition of \u2018medical emergency,\u2019 but HB 3130 effectively does not restrict insurance coverage of abortion at all.\u201d HB 1435 has been referred to the State Affairs Committee but has not yet been scheduled for a hearing.\n\n\u201cHB 3414 by Representative James Frank offers real protections for hospitalized patients who are disabled from discriminatory quality of life value judgments made by an unelected ethics committee,\u201d Conway expressed. \u201cThis differs from HB 2351 which includes loopholes that endanger hospitalized patients who are disabled.\u201d\n\nIn a memorandum obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics, Burke J. Balch, J.D., who also serves on the National Right to Life Committee wrote:\n\nIn order to avoid supporting genuine legislation to prevent the involuntary denial of lifesaving medical treatment discriminatorily based on disability sanctioned by current Texas law, HB 2351 has been put forward in the evident hope that legislators who vote for it will have the excuse of claiming that they have done something to limit this injustice. In fact, HB 2351\u2019s apparent limit on disability discrimination is utterly meaningless. Under it, health care facilities would adopt policies that they themselves would have full discretion to draft \u201cto prohibit consideration of a patient\u2019s permanent physical or mental disability during a review [under the existing Texas law allowing facility ethics committees to authorize involuntary denial of life-preserving medical treatment] unless the disability is relevant in determining whether a medical or surgical intervention is medically appropriate.\u201d The bill leaves completely open to facility and facility committee interpretation whether a patient\u2019s disability \u201cis relevant in determining whether a medical or surgical intervention is medically appropriate.\u201d Many medical ethicists have published articles and books maintaining that if a person\u2019s \u201cquality of life\u201d is deemed too poor for life to be worth living, or to justify expending medical resources on preserving it, then life-preserving treatment is for that reason not \u201cmedically appropriate.\u201d And all too many consider that certain levels of physical or mental disability bring a person\u2019s \u201cquality of life\u201d below a tolerable minimum. A judgment whether the quality of one\u2019s life is worth living is a very subjective one. Current Texas law takes that judgment away from the person whose life it is, or that person\u2019s family or other legally authorized surrogate, and puts it in the hands of health facility committees \u2013 and HB 2351 would fully preserve their ability to judge whether the degree of a person\u2019s disability makes preserving that patient\u2019s life \u201cmedically appropriate.\u201d It is one thing to support an incremental measure that falls short of the ideal but makes a substantive improvement in an existing bad law. It is quite another to promote a bill whose content makes no substantive difference in providing protection to people with disabilities. HB 2351 is not merely useless; it is worse than useless because its self-contradicting language can be employed in an attempt to mislead constituents into thinking their representatives did something \u2013 when in fact they did nothing \u2013 to protect people with disabilities from being forced to die against their will.\n\nThe hearing by the State Affairs Committee is currently scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, or upon final adjournment or recess of the House in room JHR 140. If you wish to testify on, for, or against the bills, you will need to register on one of the automatic registration kiosks located in the hallway behind the hearing room.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nBob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.
