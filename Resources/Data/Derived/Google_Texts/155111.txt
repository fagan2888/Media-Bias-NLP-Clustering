PITTSTON -- There was no winner after the Powerball drawing Saturday night, so the jackpot is still up for grabs.

Now, the jackpot is estimated to top $400 million.

Newswatch 16 stopped at a rest stop in Luzerne County to check out ticket sales.

Though you're more likely to get struck by lightning than win the Powerball, some folks plan to put their luck to the test!

"[What do you think about the Powerball reaching $400 million?] That's a lot. If I can win that, that's retirement right there," said Joe Iquadi from Georgia.

The next Powerball drawing is this Wednesday night. You can watch it right before Newswatch 16 at 11.
