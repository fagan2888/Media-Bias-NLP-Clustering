What could be more natural?\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t happened, in this country or abroad, to anything like the extent that those would-be Cassandras feared. Nonetheless, we continue to hear calls for economic redistribution, the clinical term for public policies transferring money from the relatively few rich to the much more numerous non-rich.\n\nWe also hear cries of frustration from advocates of such polices. The latest example is Thomas Edsall, the longtime Washington Post reporter now writing for the New York Times. Unlike most other liberal reporters, who are optimistic cheerleaders for their team, Edsall has long been alert to signs of liberalism\u2019s weakness.\n\nIn a long blog post, Edsall notes \u201ca steady decline in support for redistributive government.\u201d He cites a study by Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, another ardent redistributionist, that \u201cas inequality increases, so does ideological conservatism in the electorate.\u201d\n\nEdsall cites evidence that support for health care \u201cas a government-protected right\u201d has fallen off from 69 percent in a 2006 Gallup poll, replaced by a 52 percent majority for the proposition that health care is not a federal responsibility.\n\nThose poll numbers should not be taken too literally. Many respondents were surely hazy about what it means to say that a service like health care is a \u201cright.\u201d And after passage of Obamacare, talk of a federal responsibility tends to evoke partisan responses in a country split just about evenly between two ideologically distinct parties.\n\nThat said, Edsall is right to conclude that there has been a diminution of faith in government as an instrumentality. The reasons are not hard to find. Atop the list: the Obamacare mess. The rollout of healthcare.gov \u2014 which the government had 42 months to prepare for \u2014 was a disaster. In contrast, there were 42 months between Pearl Harbor and V-E Day. Government performed a lot better then.\n\nThings will get even messier if the Supreme Court reads the Obamacare statute as written in the King v. Burwell case expected to be decided in June. In Edsall\u2019s words, \u201cpublic and private health care would be disrupted, to put it mildly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that Yale Law Professor Peter Schuck highlights in the title of his 2014 book, \u201cWhy Government Fails So Often.\u201d As I put it in a column then, gummint don\u2019t work good.\n\nBut can\u2019t government at least shuffle money around? After all, it does something like that in taxing payroll earnings and paying Social Security benefits to the elderly. Yes, the checks go out, but the program is on an unsustainable trajectory.\n\nAnd when you look at the policies redistributionists advance, you see either things with trivial effects or things that are politically inconceivable.\n\nConsider some redistributive policies often advocated. Increasing the minimum wage and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014 the latter supported by some Republicans \u2014 would redistribute income, a little. Rewriting labor laws to show more favor to private sector unions is a political nonstarter and likely wouldn\u2019t restore unions to anywhere near their 1950s peak.\n\nWhat about higher taxes on the rich, the recommendation of French economist Thomas Piketty in his ballyhooed book, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d? When actor Will Smith was interviewed on French television, he supported the idea in general. But when told that France\u2019s top rate was 75 percent, he exclaimed, \u201cSeventy-five! That\u2019s different. Well, God bless America.\u201d France\u2019s socialist government has since lowered the rate.\n\nBritish Labour party leader Ed Miliband is calling for higher taxes on high earners and \u201cmansions\u201d and might enact them after the May 7 election. But again, the redistributive effect looks marginal \u2014 unless these measures choke economic growth. You do get more income equality when you destroy wealth. Everyone is worse off.\n\nThe fact is, America already has a redistributionist income tax: the top 20 percent of earners pay 84 percent of income tax revenues, and the top 1 percent, with 17 percent of income, pay 46 percent.\n\nAmericans have an innate sense that it\u2019s a mistake to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. They seem to understand that, if taxes are too high, the affluent will figure out ways to shelter income. In other words, they doubt that a government incapable of building a working website can effectively redistribute income and wealth.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Skeptics about democracy in the 18th and 19th centuries argued that the enfranchised masses would use their votes to seize the property of the relatively few rich.
