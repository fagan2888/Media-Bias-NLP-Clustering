North Carolina was named Wednesday as one of four states to be welcomed into the National Interscholastic Cycling Association. The announcement was made at a press conference during the bicycle industry's annual Interbike trade show in Las Vegas.

Communities within North Carolina that have already expressed an interest in being part of the new league include Hendersonville, Brevard, Cornelius, Huntersville, Charlotte, Davidson, Leland, Mayodan, Jacksonville, Carrboro, Raleigh and Wilkesboro. The National Interscholastic Cycling Association will form a league in North Carolina in 2016.

Mike Long, co-director of the North Carolina league said, "Chris McQueen and I are very excited to be working with NICA to bring organized middle and high school mountain bike racing to North Carolina. With thousands of miles of trails across North Carolina, mountain biking is tremendously popular in this state, and a lot of students and their families will benefit from the NICA program. North Carolina has ample infrastructure to support an interscholastic mountain biking league and our robust cycling community will certainly make this a success."

NICA, founded in 2009, creates interscholastic mountain biking programs for student-athletes and coaches across the United States. The California-based non-profit provides leadership, services and governance for each recognized state league to produce quality mountain bike events, and stresses the development of strong body, strong mind and strong character for its student-athletes.
