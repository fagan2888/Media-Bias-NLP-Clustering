It would take nearly 14 hours for his parents to reach the nearest hospital, yet Haiden survived.\n\nHaiden\u2019s mother, Emily Morgan, was on a Royal Caribbean cruise with her husband Chase and 3-year-old daughter when she began feeling contractions. Though she was only five months pregnant \u2014 and her doctor had approved the trip earlier \u2014 Emily began to feel as though something was wrong when the pains didn\u2019t stop after three or four hours. When the blood began rushing, they hurried to the medical unit on the ship.\n\n\u201cI knew something was wrong, but I didn\u2019t really comprehend how wrong,\u201d Emily told The Washington Post. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about what the possibilities were. All I knew was I was going to have a baby.\u201d\n\nShortly after, however, Emily\u2019s fear set in: \u201cI was na\u00efve,\u201d she told The Washington Post. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what was going to happen from there\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize that there were going to be complications, and there were going to be problems, and we were a long way out at sea. All of that unfolded as we went along.\u201d\n\nThe nurse and on-ship doctor assisted Emily in the medical unit, but they told her they weren\u2019t equipped to handle a 23-week-old preemie. Any baby born before 37 weeks is considered premature; a baby born at 23 is considered severely abnormal, and has only a 30 percent chance of survival. The doctor and nurse were nervous that the baby wouldn\u2019t make it \u2014 but he was born late at night on Aug. 31, then managed to survive the rest of the night despite battling hypothermia due to being so small.\n\n1 1/2-pound baby born on cruise ship beats odds to survive http://t.co/xLfk0GEtGb pic.twitter.com/73WhBqIOhD \u2014 WKRN (@WKRN) September 25, 2015\n\nEmily and Chase Morgan stayed awake that night hoping to keep their baby alive for as long as they could. They wrapped him in new towels to keep him warm, and even created a makeshift incubator made of microwaved saline pouches.\n\nBy the next morning, the cruise ship, which had been speeding to Puerto Rico \u2014 the closest land \u2014 arrived two hours early. Haiden was still alive, so he was rushed to a hospital where he was placed in an incubator. He will have to stay in the intensive care unit in Miami until December, where he\u2019ll hopefully recover from potential complications, infections, low weight, and breathing problems.\n\nRegardless, the Morgans are grateful that their baby survived the long night on the cruise ship, a testament to Haiden\u2019s (and his parents\u2019) strong disposition.\n\n\u201cThe doctors really tell us that he\u2019s a miracle baby,\u201d Emily told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he\u2019s here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "miracle baby, preemie", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A baby born at only 23 weeks survived after beating hypothermia and other risks on a cruise ship.", "title": "1.5-Pound 'Miracle Baby' Born Survives After Cruise Ship Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-baby-haiden-morgan-15-pound-preemie-born-cruise-ship-beats-odds-and-survives-354466", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/25/cruise.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A baby born at only 23 weeks survived after beating hypothermia and other risks on a cruise ship.", "title": "1.5-Pound 'Miracle Baby' Born Survives After Cruise Ship Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-baby-haiden-morgan-15-pound-preemie-born-cruise-ship-beats-odds-and-survives-354466", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/25/cruise.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/25/cruise.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-25T14:24:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T14:24:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A baby born at only 23 weeks survived after beating hypothermia and other risks on a cruise ship."}, "article_summary": "Any baby born before 37 weeks is considered premature; a baby born at 23 is considered severely abnormal, and has only a 30 percent chance of survival.\n\u201cThe doctors really tell us that he\u2019s a miracle baby,\u201d Emily told The Washington Post.\nBy the next morning, the cruise ship, which had been speeding to Puerto Rico \u2014 the closest land \u2014 arrived two hours early.\n\u201cI knew something was wrong, but I didn\u2019t really comprehend how wrong,\u201d Emily told The Washington Post.\n1 1/2-pound baby born on cruise ship beats odds to survive http://t.co/xLfk0GEtGb pic.twitter.com/73WhBqIOhD \u2014 WKRN (@WKRN) September 25, 2015Emily and Chase Morgan stayed awake that night hoping to keep their baby alive for as long as they could."}
