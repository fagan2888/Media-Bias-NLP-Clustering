He will report to CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner.\n\nPreviously, Counihan served as CEO of Connecticut's health exchange, arguably the most successful of the state healthcare exchanges created by the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. As the release about his appointment points out: \"Connecticut was the first state to surpass the goal for Affordable Care Act enrollees, and since 2012, the state's uninsured rate has been cut nearly in half -- from 7.9 percent to 4.0 percent.\"\n\nMaryland is planning to use Connecticut's technology for the upcoming enrollment period, and several other states have contacted the state about using its platform.\n\n[Would a national database be healthy for us?

Now a managing director at Manatt Health Solutions, an interdisciplinary policy and business advisory division of the law and consulting firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, Ario was the first director of the Office of Health Insurance Exchanges at the US Department of Health & Human Services, serving in 2010 and 2011.\n\nNoting Counihan's experience in Connecticut and as a health insurance executive before that, Ario said Counihan \"knows how to market insurance over the web.\"\n\nKevin Counihan\n\n(Source: Arielle Levin Becker/The Connecticut Mirror)\n\nMarketing HealthCare.gov might be the least of Counihan's worries. Though the federal exchange has seemingly overcome the many technical snafus that plagued its launch last October, the second round of enrollments, starting Nov. 15, could stress the system.\n\n\"November will be rocky,\" Ario predicted. \"It's a really daunting task to bring on another 6 or 8 million\" people while retaining and renewing those already enrolled. Collectively, more than 8 million people have signed up through the state marketplaces and the federal site since their inception, according to the Obama administration's April tally.\n\nWhile shepherding the next ACA open enrollment period, Counihan will need to work closely with the states operating their own healthcare marketplaces, a few of which have had their own technology crises. Cover Oregon, for example, said in April that it would shut down and send state residents instead to the federal HealthCare.gov site. Cover Oregon cited costs, including the expense of fixing the site before the next open-enrollment period in November, as among the reasons for the decision. That flop also precipitated Oregon's lawsuit against the contractor and software provider Oracle and a parallel lawsuit by Oracle against Oregon.\n\nAlong with consumers and states, the new HealthCare.gov CEO will need to work with commercial insurance companies, more of whom are involved than during the first open enrollment.\n\nMeanwhile, CMS has yet to announce who will become HealthCare.gov's chief technology officer, reporting to CEO Counihan. The CTO position was announced in June.\n\nThe release about Counihan's appointment also disclosed that Tim Hughey of Accenture, the federal Marketplace system developer and maintainer, will continue to provide technology support to CMS throughout the next open enrollment. \"He will focus on technology issues in the areas of systems architecture, tools, security, and networks across all contractors involved in the federal Marketplace,\" the release said.\n\nFind out how NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory addressed governance, risk, and compliance for its critical public cloud services.
