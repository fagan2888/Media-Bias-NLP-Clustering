But is Obamacare really in danger, or is this just another election year political ploy?\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans won Round 2 in a potentially historic lawsuit Thursday when a federal judge declared the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money to subsidize health insurers without obtaining an appropriation from Congress,\u201d reports the L.A. Times. \u201cLast year, U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer broke new ground by ruling the GOP-controlled House of Representatives had legal standing to sue the president over how he was enforcing his signature healthcare law. On Thursday, she ruled the administration is violating a provision of the law by paying promised reimbursements to health insurers who provide coverage at reduced costs to low-income Americans.\u201d\n\nIf the news sounds alarming and groundbreaking, well, it really isn\u2019t. Even Collyer\u2019s own decision has already been put on hold due to the likelihood that it will be overturned.\n\nSo what\u2019s really happening? Republicans are trying to undermine the ACA under the last possible scenario, since their dozens of attempts to defund it Congressionally have failed. They\u2019ve claimed Congress never approved the actual funding for the cost-sharing portion of the law.\n\n\u201cAt issue is the \u2018cost sharing\u2019 provision in the law that requires insurance companies offering health plans through the law to reduce out-of-pocket costs for policy holders who qualify. The government offsets the added costs to insurance companies by reimbursing them,\u201d explains CNN.com. \u201cBut lawyers for the House argued that Congress did not properly approve the money for those reimbursements. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, sided with the challengers but said that she would stay her ruling pending appeal. \u2018Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one,\u2019 she wrote.\u201d\n\nBased on the millions who are now covered who went uninsured before, or have better coverage, or more affordable plans thanks to Obamacare, it would seem like Congressional Republicans would want to tiptoe softly around being the party to block Americans from healthcare.\n\nBut it is an election year, and House Republicans especially have extremely gerrymandered, extremely far right districts at home to answer to, which means they will be pursuing this with every last breath. After all, it doesn\u2019t just continue their war on Obamacare, it also brings up their favorite other anti-Obama talking-point: his use of executive orders. It\u2019s a twofer that\u2019s just too tempting to ignore while revving up for November 2016.\n\nLegal experts worry about Collyer\u2019s decision that Congress has standing to even bring up a lawsuit against the President, declaring it sets a precedent that could open the door for all disagreements among government branches to be litigated rather than addressed through the constitutional process.\n\n\u201cNicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan who frequently comments on ObamaCare cases, wrote in a blog post that he shared the judge\u2019s skepticism of the administration\u2019s arguments on the substance of the case,\u201d reports The Hill. \u201d\u2018What I don\u2019t share, though, is the district court\u2019s confidence that she could properly hear this case,\u2019 Bagley wrote. \u2018Until now, no one has thought that one house of Congress could file a federal lawsuit to hash out an appropriations dispute with the executive branch. This shouldn\u2019t be the first time, even if the administration broke the law.\u2019 He predicted that the court of appeals would have \u2018little patience\u2019 for the idea that the House has standing to sue. Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who supports ObamaCare, likewise noted that if the court of appeals ruled the House has standing it would open the floodgates so that \u2018you\u2019re just going to have the courts doing nothing but refereeing disputes between Congress and the administration.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe GOP may have a \u201cwin\u201d on their battle against Obamacare, but it seems unlikely to be a lasting one. Then again, in an election year, just having a victory to tout on the trail may be all they wanted.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP has finally gotten a \"win\" on their anti-Obamacare suit, but it may not have any affect in the long run.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3178/3177559.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "obamacare,aca,affordable care act,congressional republicans,aca lawsuits,2016 election", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But is Obamacare really in danger, or is this just another election year political ploy?\nAfter all, it doesn\u2019t just continue their war on Obamacare, it also brings up their favorite other anti-Obama talking-point: his use of executive orders.\nBut it is an election year, and House Republicans especially have extremely gerrymandered, extremely far right districts at home to answer to, which means they will be pursuing this with every last breath.\nThen again, in an election year, just having a victory to tout on the trail may be all they wanted.\n\u201cBut lawyers for the House argued that Congress did not properly approve the money for those reimbursements."}
