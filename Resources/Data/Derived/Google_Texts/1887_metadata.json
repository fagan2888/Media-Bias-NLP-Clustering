They towered over Dovgal and the students as they shook hands and exchanged a few quiet words.\n\nThe men comprised a Ukrainian special operations unit known as the \u201ccleaners.\u201d Their mission is to trail regular Ukrainian forces as they retake towns from separatists, rooting out any remaining separatists in hiding who may try to launch terrorist attacks against government troops.\n\nAfter a few minutes of instruction, one of the IT Academy students handed the iPad controller to a commando. While hovering anxiously over his pupil\u2019s shoulder, the student guided the soldier through takeoff, a few maneuvers and a gentle landing.\n\n\u201cThese drones are very, very easy to use,\u201d Dovgal later explained. \u201cVery user friendly. It\u2019s intuitive like an Apple product. You can just turn it on and fly it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u2022 \u2014\n\nWhile reports Wednesday indicated the U.S. has approved sending unarmed Raven drones to Ukraine, Dovgal and his students have been building drones for Ukraine\u2019s military out of their workshop at the Kyiv IT Academy since May 2014\u2014an operation financed by an online fundraising campaign.\n\nThe workshop is a cluttered mess of half-assembled drones, remote-control aircraft pirated for parts and countless other mechanical and electronic components scattered randomly across desks and shelves.\n\nDovgal, wearing a traditional Ukrainian shirt called a Vyshynka (which has become a patriotic statement in wartime Ukraine), speaks at a rapid-fire pace, often breaking conversation to reply to a student\u2019s question or answer a phone call. He is planning a trip to the front lines in two days to deliver drones to an army unit and conduct a whirlwind training course.\n\n\u201cOur priority now is getting drones in the field,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must produce something to send to the warzone. It just takes two to four days to modify, test and get these drones to the volunteers. And only a day or two to train them in how to use it.\u201d\n\nA sharpshooter who trains police snipers but has no military experience, Dovgal was looking for a way to help Ukrainian soldiers after the conflict began in eastern Ukraine last spring. Frustrated by Kyiv\u2019s lack of investment in UAVs, the university professor decided to leverage the skills of his students and engineers at the IT Academy to launch his own crowd-sourced drone assembly and training program.\n\nIn a two-day process, Dovgal\u2019s team modifies the DJI Phantom drones, which are available for purchase on the Internet, to carry Sony A-7 video cameras and have greater range. The total cost of each drone and its modifications runs about $2,300.\n\nThe modified Phantom drones are inexpensive compared with similarly sized UAVs such as the 4.2-pound RQ-11 Raven, which the U.S. Army flies and costs about $30,000 (each complete Raven system, including control equipment, is estimated at about $250,000, according to GlobalSecurity.org).\n\nDovgal and his team have fielded about 30 drones since May 2014. And even though the Ukrainian drones lack the sophistication of U.S. drones like the Raven, the feedback from front-line Ukrainian units has been positive, Dovgal said.\n\nAble to reach an altitude of about 5,000 feet and with a horizontal range of more than a mile, the modified drones allow troops to scout enemy positions without mounting foot patrols that are vulnerable to ambush.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers tell me, \u2018Now we don\u2019t have to walk around and risk our lives,\u2019\u201d Dovgal said. \u201cWe have lots of thank yous.\u201d\n\nDovgal\u2019s drone program prioritizes ease of use and rapid deployment in the combat environment along with minimizing costs. To this end, the IT Academy team leans on commercially available off-the-shelf technology. The operator, for example, views the drone\u2019s video feed through an iPad or smartphone, through which the UAV\u2019s flight path is also controlled.\n\nOne of Dovgal\u2019s key goals is to build drones that soldiers can learn to fly after just a few hours of training. Manpower shortages and the unending pace of combat operations has left the Ukrainian military little time to spare for drone pilot training. Therefore, Dovgal often accompanies students and other civilian volunteers to transport the drones to the front lines, where he puts Ukrainian troops through a whirlwind pilot training program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to train a drone pilot than a helicopter pilot,\u201d said Dimitri Franchuk, 26, an engineer at the IT Academy and a hobby remote-control helicopter pilot. \u201cAnd if a drone gets shot down, it\u2019s nothing. If a helicopter is shot down, it\u2019s much worse.\u201d\n\nDovgal primarily funds his program through an online campaign, occasionally using his own money to overcome any shortfalls. The IT Academy pitches its drones as a cost-effective way to support Ukraine\u2019s military, which has been stretched to its operational limits by a war that has killed more than 6,000 soldiers and civilians in nearly a year, according to the United Nations.\n\nSmall drones like the Phantom are able to accomplish some of the same surveillance and reconnaissance tasks as manned aircrafts and helicopters at a fraction of the cost\u2014a key benefit considering Ukraine\u2019s air force is short on both pilots and hardware after suffering heavy losses in 2014.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian military reports, 23 Ukrainian aircrafts were shot down while supporting combat operations in eastern Ukraine in 2014, representing about 12 percent of the country\u2019s fleet of 187 aircraft at the end of 2013.\n\nThe official number of Ukrainian pilots killed was not immediately available.\n\n\u201cAll of our best pilots have died,\u201d said Galina Khlopotenko, 30, an engineer at the IT Academy. \u201cThese drones save lives.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u2022 \u2014\n\nWhile currently limited to daytime surveillance, the IT Academy aims to upgrade its drones with more sophisticated sensors and weapons in a move to level the playing field between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military as well as U.S. and NATO officials, pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas are equipped with a fleet of surveillance drones supplied by Russia. The Kremlin, however, denies supplying the separatists with drones and other military hardware.\n\nDovgal declined to specify what type of armaments might go on the Ukrainian drones, but he said the intent of drone-based weapons would be to target separatist UAVs.\n\nIf Ukrainian drones achieved such a capability, it would be the first official instance of drone-on-drone warfare.\n\nDovgal has been appealing to the United States for help since last summer, acknowledging the U.S. military\u2019s experience with the tactical use of drones in combat operations.\n\n\u201cWe would like the U.S. to do some training and share some technology with us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like the Americans to help, but we can\u2019t wait for that to happen. We need something in our hands right now.\u201d\n\nCiting a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity, Agence France-Presse reported Wednesday the United States has agreed to supply unarmed RQ-11 Raven drones to Ukraine as part of a broader $75 million U.S. assistance package of nonlethal aid, including 30 heavily armored and 200 regular Humvees.\n\nWhile the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) routinely uses drones (which are supplied by independent military contractors) to patrol the Ukraine-Russia border to monitor cease-fire terms, the United States has not previously agreed to send Ukraine drones.\n\nIn a February 2015 report, \u201cA Military Assessment of the Russian War in Ukraine,\u201d American Foreign Policy Council senior fellow Stephen Blank called on the United States to supply Ukraine with drones.\n\n\u201cUkraine also clearly needs UAVs or weapons to use against Russian drones,\u201d Blank wrote.\n\n\u2014 \u2022 \u2014\n\nAfter their test flight, the \u201ccleaners\u201d spent a few minutes interacting with the IT Academy students and Dovgal, cracking a few rare smiles as they curiously inspected the small Phantom drone. And then, as if they were a football team breaking the huddle, the soldiers swiftly grabbed their backpacks, loaded into two unmarked vans and drove away. They were scheduled to deploy to the front lines in less than two weeks.\n\nLeft alone, the students slowly packed up their equipment, returned to their workshop and went back to work.\n\n\u201cWe call ourselves the soldiers of soldering iron,\u201d Franchuk said, driving through Kyiv on the way back to the university. \u201cIt makes us feel proud that we can do something to help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Frustrated by Ukraine\u2019s lack of investment in UAVs, a university professor decided to launch his own crowd-sourced drone assembly and training program.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Frustrated by Ukraine\u2019s lack of investment in UAVs, a university professor decided to launch his own crowd-sourced drone assembly and training program.", "title": "Ukraine\u2019s Grassroots Drone Program Takes Flight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150311_Drones_Nolan.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:29:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NMGQqk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Frustrated by Ukraine\u2019s lack of investment in UAVs, a university professor decided to launch his own crowd-sourced drone assembly and training program.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150311_Drones_Nolan.jpg"}, "title": "Ukraine\u2019s Grassroots Drone Program Takes Flight", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-03-12T03:01:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:29:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, drones, Russia, NATO, OSCE, UAVs"}, "article_summary": "After a few minutes of instruction, one of the IT Academy students handed the iPad controller to a commando.\nFrustrated by Ukraine\u2019s lack of investment in UAVs, a university professor decided to launch his own crowd-sourced drone assembly and training program.\nIf Ukrainian drones achieved such a capability, it would be the first official instance of drone-on-drone warfare.\nManpower shortages and the unending pace of combat operations has left the Ukrainian military little time to spare for drone pilot training.\n\u2014 \u2022 \u2014After their test flight, the \u201ccleaners\u201d spent a few minutes interacting with the IT Academy students and Dovgal, cracking a few rare smiles as they curiously inspected the small Phantom drone."}
