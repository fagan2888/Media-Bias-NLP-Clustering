And whether Manning chooses to sue is his business. A spokesman said he\u2019ll make the decision after the season.\n\nIf Manning chooses not to sue, by the way, no one should attempt to read anything into the decision. Defamation suits are expensive and difficult to win, and can easily drag on for years. Who needs that grief?\n\nBut whatever the ultimate verdict on Al Jazeera\u2019s report, the controversy over HGH is not about to disappear.\n\nTo begin with, credible critics, including former players such as Brady Quinn and Christian Fauria, contend the NFL is saturated with HGH, thanks to ineffective testing. In addition, a growing number of voices are arguing that if the substance actually helps athletes recover from serious injuries \u2014 such as Manning certainly suffered before he came to the Broncos \u2014 then players should be allowed to use it on a limited basis for healing. And the logic is compelling.\n\nTo be clear, this is not the same as advocating that performance-enhancing drugs be legal in sports but regulated. Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell makes that case, but it\u2019s not persuasive. Not only would the drugs distort the game, but to the extent they produce players who are bigger and faster, they might increase the injury rate. Former quarterback Quinn believes that already is happening.\n\nMoreover, drugs have side effects \u2014 which in HGH\u2019s case, according to USA Today, include \u201cpossible cancer, abnormal organ growth, accelerated osteoarthritis and earlier death.\u201d\n\nYet what about limited use by players injured and out of action? Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is one of those who argues for it, and Cuban is putting his money where his mouth is. His foundation is funding a two-year, first-of-its-kind clinical trial at the University of Michigan to see whether HGH \u201chelps prevent the muscles around the knee joint from weakening to a point of no return\u201d after an ACL injury, according to ESPN.\n\nIt\u2019s important research, and there ought to be more of it in order to clarify just how useful HGH might be in terms of recovery \u2014 or if its effects are more myth than reality.\n\nIf research shows that temporary use of HGH can accelerate athletes\u2019 return to their former strength and quickness \u2014 or, more critically, prevent them from suffering permanent erosion of their talents \u2014 then the burden will be on opponents to explain why it shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Is athletes\u2019 use of HGH always wrong?", "title": "Is athletes\u2019 use of HGH always wrong?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/08/is-athletes-use-of-hgh-always-wrong/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160108__OP10HGHp1.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160108__OP10HGHp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-08T15:40:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T02:03:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But whatever the ultimate verdict on Al Jazeera\u2019s report, the controversy over HGH is not about to disappear.\nIf Manning chooses not to sue, by the way, no one should attempt to read anything into the decision.\nTo begin with, credible critics, including former players such as Brady Quinn and Christian Fauria, contend the NFL is saturated with HGH, thanks to ineffective testing.\nTo be clear, this is not the same as advocating that performance-enhancing drugs be legal in sports but regulated.\nAnd whether Manning chooses to sue is his business."}
