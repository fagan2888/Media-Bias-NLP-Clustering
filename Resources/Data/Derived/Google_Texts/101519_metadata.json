Connor, research associate professor in the department of medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University, began her one-year term June 1 as the president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the world\u2019s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals.\n\nConnor, of Portland, Ore., is the 89th president of the Academy, which was founded in 1917. She has been the Academy\u2019s president-elect since June 2013, and will serve as president until May 31, 2015.\n\nAt OHSU, Connor is the director of the nutrition elective for medical students, as well as the developer of the nutrition course for physician assistant students. She joined OHSU in 1975. Previously, she was a research dietitian at the University of Iowa Clinical Research Center.\n\n\u201cI am passionate about Academy members being viewed for what we are \u2013the nation\u2019s food and nutrition leaders,\u201d Connor said. \u201cI support elevating the level of dietetics practice across the board. Where practice is occurring at a very high level, we will showcase and support these programs and foster new ones.\u201d\n\nConnor said she will draw on her background as a scientist to promote an increasing emphasis on research in providing nutrition care, particularly as the health system evolves under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI have had the great fortune to work in a research group in which each of us was encouraged to do more than we thought we could ever do \u2013 so we did,\u201d Connor said.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for the Academy and our members to move our profession forward, increase the recognition of registered dietitian nutritionists and dietetic technicians, registered as the food and nutrition experts \u2013 in our workplaces, in our communities, nationally and internationally.\u201d Connor said.\n\nConnor has published dozens of scientific research papers and books based on pioneering research she and her colleagues conducted on healthful eating to prevent coronary disease and other chronic diseases. Connor\u2019s innovative research on omega-3 fatty acids and the developing brain and retina helped lead to the addition of DHA to infant formula.\n\nConnor previously was chair-elect of the Academy Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors; chaired the Foundation\u2019s Scholarship Committee; and is a former member of the Academy\u2019s Nominating Committee.

Connor received the Oregon Academy\u2019s Award of Merit in 1989, the national Academy\u2019s 1996 Excellence in Research Award and the Academy\u2019s 2010 Medallion Award.\n\nConnor is a graduate of Kansas State University and earned a master\u2019s degree from the University of Iowa.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Photos of Sonja Connor are available and media interviews may be arranged by emailing media@eatright.org.\n\n###\n\nAll registered dietitians are nutritionists \u2013 but not all nutritionists are registered dietitians. The Academy\u2019s Board of Directors and Commission on Dietetic Registration have determined that those who hold the credential registered dietitian (RD) may optionally use \u201cregistered dietitian nutritionist\u201d (RDN) instead. The two credentials have identical meanings.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the world\u2019s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals. The Academy is committed to improving the nation\u2019s health and advancing the profession of dietetics through research, education and advocacy.
