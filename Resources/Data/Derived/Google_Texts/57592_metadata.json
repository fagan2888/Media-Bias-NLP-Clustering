A top contractor who built the website says a federal agency looking into the problems has now asked for internal documents.\n\nMike Hellgren has more on what we\u2019re learning about the probe.\n\nThe contractor says he is fully complying with the request, which comes from the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. But legal experts caution it is too early to read too much into any possible federal investigation.\n\nMaryland\u2019s health exchange website, which allows people to sign up for Obamacare, was plagued with errors from the start and cost taxpayers millions. Now we\u2019re learning federal auditors may be digging for more information.\n\nThe CEO for a contractor who put the site together tells WJZ: \u201cOn July 30, Noridian Healthcare Solutions received a document request from the inspector general. The company is cooperating fully.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were all these dollars paid when there\u2019s very little documentation about what work was done?\u201d said Congressman Andy Harris, (R) Maryland.\n\nHarris, who fought against Obamacare, claims new subpoenas could be the start of a wider investigation. But legal analyst Andrew Levy says that\u2019s going too far.\n\n\u201cThe fact that subpoenas have been issued allows you to conclude absolutely nothing,\u201d Levy said.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s unclear whether anybody is being targeted in Maryland, whether they\u2019re contractors, government employees or public officials.\n\nIn other states with similarly troubled exchanges, lawsuits have already begun. In Oregon, where, like Maryland, catchy commercials promised more than the site delivered, the FBI is looking into possible fraud.\n\n\u201cHundreds of millions of dollars have been spent or allocated and little to show for it, especially at Cover Oregon,\u201d said Congressman Greg Walden, (R) Oregon.\n\nBut in Maryland, a spokesman for the exchange says it has not received a subpoena.\n\nFor the lieutenant governor, who took a leadership role, the problems have become a political issue. His campaign accuses Harris of playing political games and says he\u2019s had no communication with federal investigators.\n\nThe inspector general, whose office is nonpartisan and independent, will neither confirm nor deny any investigation into Maryland\u2019s health exchange.\n\nMaryland\u2019s exchange could eventually cost taxpayers more than $260 million.\n\nOther Local News:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The investigation continues into Maryland's troubled health exchange.
