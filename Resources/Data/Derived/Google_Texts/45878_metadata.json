The biggest was the discovery of Birgfeld\u2019s remains by a hiker in the Wells Gulch area in Delta County on May 6, 2012.\n\nBut in the end what made the difference wasn\u2019t new gotcha evidence like a fingerprint or a DNA link. The determining evidence was circumstantial and known by Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s deputies since the beginning of the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe believe at this point we have crossed off the list all the things we needed to do to make an arrest,\u201d Mesa County Sheriff-elect Matt Lewis said in a news conference Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s not a significant event as much as this is an exhaustive process we\u2019ve been going through.\u201d\n\nJones faces charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, second-degree kidnapping and second-degree arson.\n\nMany of the clues that led to Jones\u2019 arrest were known within days or weeks of Birgfeld\u2019s disappearance on June 30, 2007.\n\nWhen she vanished, Birgfeld was for many just a devoted mother holding down several different jobs to support her three young children and hold onto her upscale Grand Junction home. The twice-divorced Birgfeld sold Pampered Chef products and homemade baby slings from her home.\n\nBy day, the bubbly, friendly, outspoken woman was a doting mom, but by night she was a high-priced call girl who charged clients nearly $3,000 for a single evening. She had advertised in-call and out-call services under the alias of \u201cCarrie\u201d on a website called NaughtyNightlife.com and scheduled liaisons with other call girls.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Delta County,denver,DNA,Glenwood Springs,Lester Ralph Jones,Mesa County,Paige Birgfeld,Pampered Chef,Prostitution,sheriff's department,soccer mom,stripper", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Cold Cases", "description": "Mesa County: arrest made in death of soccer mom turned escort", "title": "Mesa County: arrest made in death of soccer mom turned escort", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2014/11/22/mesa-county/9547/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2014/11/paige.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Mesa County: arrest made in death of soccer mom turned escort", "title": "Mesa County: arrest made in death of soccer mom turned escort", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2014/11/22/mesa-county/9547/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2014/11/paige.jpg", "creator": "@kmitchelldp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Mesa County: arrest made in death of soccer mom turned escort"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf6e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s not a significant event as much as this is an exhaustive process we\u2019ve been going through.\u201dJones faces charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, second-degree kidnapping and second-degree arson.\nThe determining evidence was circumstantial and known by Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s deputies since the beginning of the investigation.\n\u201cWe believe at this point we have crossed off the list all the things we needed to do to make an arrest,\u201d Mesa County Sheriff-elect Matt Lewis said in a news conference Friday.\nBefore the Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s Department felt comfortable arresting Lester Ralph Jones in the death of Paige Birgfeld, they had to discount the possibility that many other men may have been culpable.\nMany of the clues that led to Jones\u2019 arrest were known within days or weeks of Birgfeld\u2019s disappearance on June 30, 2007."}
