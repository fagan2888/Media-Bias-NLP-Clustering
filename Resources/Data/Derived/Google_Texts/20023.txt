WEST BROMWICH, England (AP) - Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes saved two second-half penalties in a 1-0 win at West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League on Saturday.

The Brazilian rushed out and brought down Saido Berahino to give away the first penalty. Gomes made up for this by diving to his right to beat away Berahino’s penalty after 67 minutes.

Gomes repeated the feat 20 minutes later after Etienne Capoue tripped James McClean. Berahino again took the penalty and Gomes launched himself the other way to palm away the spot kick.

He also twice stopped Stephane Sessegnon in the first half, and acrobatically denied Gareth McAluey shortly after halftime.

That meant Ben Watson’s 27th-minute goal off Adlene Guedioura’s corner was enough for Watford to clinch only its third victory in its last 16 league matches.
