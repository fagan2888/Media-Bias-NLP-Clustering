That\u2019s according to a recent survey of federal employees.\n\nThe survey was conducted by the research group Government Business Council just prior to revelations that Hillary Clinton allegedly exclusively used personal email and a private server at her Chappaqua, N.Y., residence for her government communications while serving as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nPersonal email is \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d used for government business in their agency, according to 16 percent of survey respondents. One-third, 33 percent, said personal email is used \u201csometimes\u201d or more frequently.\n\nThirty-one percent said personal emails used for business are not preserved for archiving. Forty-seven percent said they don\u2019t know whether or not the records are properly preserved.\n\nClinton: Not the First\n\nThe revelation about Clinton\u2019s use of personal email is the latest, but not the first.\n\nIn fact, Clinton herself was a vociferous critic of the George W. Bush administration\u2019s email practices after it was learned in 2007 that millions of White House emails sent on a non-government server may have been \u201clost.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the State Department inspector general (IG) identified multiple instances of officials improperly using and failing to archive personal email from 2010 to 2014.\n\n>>> 19 Times the Government Withheld Documents It Didn\u2019t Want You to See\n\nFor example, the IG said officials at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand were not implementing procedures on records management and \u201cemail messages \u2026 are not preserved.\u201d\n\nIRS manager Lois Lerner allegedly used an msn.com email account labeled \u2018Lois Home\u2019 for government-related communications. Lerner was a key player in what the IG found was the tax agency\u2019s unfair targeting of conservative groups.\n\nFormer Obama EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used private email accounts, as well as a secret EPA email address under the pseudonym \u201cRichard Windsor,\u201d to conduct official business. That included communicating with a climate lobbyist.\n\n\u201cP.S. Can you use my home email rather than this one when you need to contact me directly? Tx, Lisa.\u201d \u2014EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson email to a lobbyist.\n\nJackson\u2019s use of personal email accounts was inadvertently revealed in a Freedom of Information Act production. In an email chain between Jackson and a Sierra Club official, Jackson\u2019s personal Verizon email address was redacted citing a \u201cprivacy exemption.\u201d But it was left unredacted later in the thread.\n\nThe EPA inspector general recently found the agency\u2019s Chemical Safety Board Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso and two top officials used personal email accounts to conduct official business. The IG said the officials did not preserve the emails, in violation of federal regulations.\n\n>>> Lawsuit Seeks EPA Administrator\u2019s Deleted Messages\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder\u2019s criminal division head, Lanny Breuer, was caught forwarding controversial Fast and Furious-related emails to his personal account.\n\nObama Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Holder\u2019s former assistant attorney general for civil rights, allegedly used his private email account to leak non-public information about official business.\n\nAs to whether Holder himself ever used personal email for government business, the Justice Department isn\u2019t saying. A spokesman did not respond to requests for information about Holder\u2019s email practices.\n\nIn Justice Department emails turned over in a federal Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, Holder\u2019s email name is redacted with no explanation. It\u2019s unknown whether the redactions conceal use of an email address that does not belong to an official government account.\n\nFast and Furious-related emails between Holder and his wife Sharon Malone, and his mother, are currently being withheld under executive privilege invoked by President Obama.\n\nThere are similar redactions of the email name for Obama adviser Eric Schultz. In one instance, \u201cprivacy\u201d is cited as the reason. In other cases, no explanation is given.\n\nSecurity Questions\n\nExperts say it\u2019s not only a question of whether federal officials are trying to skirt Freedom of Information law that requires release of public documents upon request; there are also security concerns. From that standpoint, Clinton\u2019s example may be the most concerning.\n\nGovernment Executive says security experts are \u201cstill scratching their heads about why Clinton would have taken the unusual step of setting up a home-managed email account, a move that potentially made her messages vulnerable to foreign hackers keen on spying on the U.S.\u2019s top diplomat.\u201d\n\n\u201cComputer-security analysts \u2026 warned that emails sent across separate servers\u2014instead of delivered entirely within government servers\u2014posed greater risk of being intercepted or spied on.\u201d \u2014@GovExec\n\nA high-ranking government official familiar with the potential security risks says Clinton\u2019s case raises many security issues.\n\n\u201cThere are times when the location of the secretary of state and other cabinet members is sensitive\u201d or even classified, said the official, \u201cespecially, if they are traveling with [the president].\u201d\n\nA smartphone using a commercial Internet service provider would theoretically broadcast its location most of the time, over an unauthorized network, including when that location classified, the official said.\n\nThe official also noted that it\u2019s not known whether Clinton carried her phone into areas where classified discussions took place. \u201cIf she did, that [could be] a security violation.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: How to Free the Government\u2019s Grip on Freedom of Information\n\nThe State Department has said Clinton did not send classified information via email. A Clinton spokesman has said she has been complying with the \u201cletter and spirit of the [federal records] rules.\u201d\n\nClinton sent a tweet last week shortly after the House Benghazi Committee subpoenaed her emails.\n\nI want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 5, 2015\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there will not be a way to fully validate the completeness of that production,\u201d Jason Straight told Government Executive. Straight is chief privacy officer and senior vice president of cybersecurity at UnitedLex.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hillary clinton, personal email, obama administration", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "High-level federal executives routinely use personal email for business, in likely violation of the Federal Records Act.
