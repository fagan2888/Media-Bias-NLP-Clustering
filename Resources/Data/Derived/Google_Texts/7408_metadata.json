LOUIS (KMOX) \u2013 Some hospitals are scaling back financial assistance for middle and lower income patients, hoping to push them into signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne local hospital that\u2019s doing just that.\n\nBarnes Jewish Hospital has started charging co-pays to uninsured patients, no matter how poor.\n\nLaw Professor Sidney Watson at Saint Louis University\u2019s Center for Health Law Studies calls this a bad idea, especially in Missouri.\n\n\u201cHere in Missouri, there is no affordable health insurance available to those who could quality for the Medicaid expansion, and one of the things that Barnes Jewish Hospital is doing is charging them very high co-pays for people at that income level,\u201d she says.\n\nWatson says charging could deter patients from needed treatment, or push them into possible bankruptcy.\n\nBarnes Jewish officials acknowledged the establishment of co-pays; however, they say patients will continue to receive needed medical care, regardless of their ability to make a payment at time of service.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
