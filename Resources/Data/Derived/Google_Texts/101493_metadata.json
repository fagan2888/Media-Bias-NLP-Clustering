Better Business Bureau alerts consumers to look out for fraudulent sellers when shopping for tickets online.\n\n\u201cThe most common ways secondary-ticket sellers scam college baseball fans is by delivering counterfeit tickets or simply not sending the tickets,\u201d BBB President Jim Hegarty said. \u201cEven if the tickets do arrive, they are sometimes not for the seats the seller advertised \u2013 which can mean the fan is stuck with seats that aren\u2019t next to each other or are not in the reserved section but are located in the general admission section, which may mean long waits in line and no guarantee to get in.\u201d\n\nMany consumers who did not yet purchase their tickets or may be looking for reduced ticket prices may go to the Internet and the secondary-ticket market. Fans should also be skeptical of the hundreds of online auctions, online classifieds, and bulletin boards using person-to-person sales.\n\nTo avoid problems buying tickets, the NCAA advises CWS ticket seekers to check out ticket information at ncaa.com/cws to find out the latest on available tickets, prices and fan-to-fan ticket exchange information.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau offered more advice for baseball fans:\n\nPay with a credit card or through PayPal, which offer some protection and potential reimbursement. Never pay with a cashier\u2019s check or wire money to a seller; you\u2019ll have no way to get your money back if the tickets do not arrive.\n\n\n\nWhen buying from an individual through an online exchange don\u2019t be lured away from the website by the seller. Even if you met the seller on the exchange website, the company may not guarantee any lost money if a transaction occurs outside their domain.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "There are thousands of fans searching for tickets for the College World Series that begins on June 14 in Omaha.
