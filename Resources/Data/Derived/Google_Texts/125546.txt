Aetna and Virtua Health, a healthcare provider in New Jersey, are collaborating on a new accountable care organization.

The Aetna Whole Health-Virtua plan will be introduced in South Jersey later this year and will use Virtua's community-based health system of hospitals, outpatient facilities, urgent care centers, and health and wellness centers, supported by the clinically integrated network of Virtua Physician Partners, Aetna said.

An ACO is a coordinated care system that reward hospitals and doctors for providing better and more efficient care at a lower cost.

The Aetna/Virtua ACO will offer consumers and businesses a co-branded commercial health plan that will be affordable while improving healthcare outcomes, the insurer said.

"Aetna is working to produce more healthy days for its members," said Michael Costa, executive director for Aetna's New Jersey market. "We're moving toward new arrangements that reward hospitals and doctors for providing better, more efficient care, rather than simply more care."
