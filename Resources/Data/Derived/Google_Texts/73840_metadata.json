According to the state-run news organization RT, he said, \u201cMy attitude to this organization is special,\u201d adding, \u201cIt would only be for the better if this organization is dissolved.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the USA should be excluded from the bloc, and after this it would be possible to painlessly disband the whole organization,\u201d Naryshkin said. \u201cThis would be a good step towards greater security and stability on the whole European continent.\u201d\n\nNATO\u2019s original purpose, of course, was to deter Russian aggression in Europe. Moscow\u2019s actions over the past few years, including the invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula, its continued support of armed rebellion in the east of Ukraine, and its frequent testing of national boundaries with warships and military planes have all left its neighbors somewhat disinclined to drop their collective guard.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Outrageous Defense Spending Puts Russia Back in the USSR\n\nHowever, that hasn\u2019t stopped the Putin regime from complaining about what it sees as a Western effort to hem Russia in by surrounding it with countries covered by the alliance\u2019s mutual defense treaty. Montenegro hardly qualifies as being a significant military power or, for that matter, a close neighbor of Russia. But every expansion of the alliance rankles in Moscow.\n\nThe recent downing of the Russian bomber by Turkey, which cost the life of one of the plane\u2019s pilot\u2019s and one Russian Marine sent on a rescue mission, has upped the Kremlin\u2019s sensitivity toward NATO. Turkey, a NATO member, is covered by the alliance\u2019s mutual defense agreement, meaning that any retaliation from Russia would risk a major confrontation.\n\nThe Turkish government particularly annoyed Putin after the shoot-down by calling an emergency NATO meeting instead of reaching out to Moscow with an explanation.\n\nIn his annual press conference with the Russian media Thursday, Putin used some rather salty language to describe his impression of Turkey\u2019s behavior and to insinuate that the U.S. government might have been involved in the attack, or at least have agreed not to object to it.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Campaign Against Turkey Hits the High Seas\n\nWhen a reporter asked about the possible involvement of a \u201cthird party\u201d in the attacks, according to The Telegraph, Putin said, \u201cI get your inference, but we do not know this. But if someone in the Turkish government decided to lick the Americans in a certain place, well I don't know then, was that the right decision or not?\n\n\u201cI don't even know if the Americans wanted this or not. I can imagine that on some level there were agreements that if we bring down the Russian plane, then you close your eyes to us to entering the territory of Iraq and will occupy part of it.\n\n\u201cI don't know, maybe such an exchange happened. Indeed, we do not know. In any case, they have put all of us in a very difficult situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top Russian lawmaker on Thursday described the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a \u201ccancerous tumor on the whole European continent,\u201d upping anti-NATO rhetoric in Russia not long after Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that the organization is acting as a shield for Turkey, which recently shot down a Russian bomber on its border with Syria.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Anti-NATO Language Gets\u2026Salty", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Putin-s-Anti-NATO-Language-Gets-Salty", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/putin_standing_boats_ships_navy_fleet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Putin-s-Anti-NATO-Language-Gets-Salty", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/putin_standing_boats_ships_navy_fleet.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A top Russian lawmaker on Thursday described the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a \u201ccancerous tumor on the whole European continent,\u201d upping anti-NATO rhetoric in Russia not long after Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that the organization is acting as a shield for Turkey, which recently shot down a Russian bomber on its border with Syria.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But if someone in the Turkish government decided to lick the Americans in a certain place, well I don't know then, was that the right decision or not?\n\u201cI don't know, maybe such an exchange happened.\nTurkey, a NATO member, is covered by the alliance\u2019s mutual defense agreement, meaning that any retaliation from Russia would risk a major confrontation.\nMontenegro hardly qualifies as being a significant military power or, for that matter, a close neighbor of Russia.\n\u201cI don't even know if the Americans wanted this or not."}
