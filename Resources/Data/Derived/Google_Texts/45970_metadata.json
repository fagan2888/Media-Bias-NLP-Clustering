He is currently making the rounds promoting his new TNT cooking reality show On the Menu.\n\nAlthough Lagasse did not provide specifics over what he is simmering about, presumably the TV chef may have been alluding to the intrusive regulations (including Obamacare, a.k.a. the Affordable Care Act) as well as taxation imposed on businesses by the Obama administration.\n\nIn an interview with The Week, Lagasse claimed that restaurants generally run by small businessmen and women are on a knife edge when it comes to remaining profitable, in part because of the increased cost of food and fuel in areas where he (as well as other entrepreneurs) operates restaurants.\n\nI have nowhere to go, really \u2014 other than broke. It\u2019s becoming a very challenging industry to become a very successful average restaurateur. I can\u2019t charge $300 a person in my restaurant or I would not be in business. Am I using any different ingredients? Not really. Am I using any caliber of service staff? I don\u2019t think so. I think our service is as good or better than most places. And then you add all the Obama nonsense to what it\u2019s become in the last several years. I don\u2019t have anything against Mr. Obama. I\u2019m just saying the way that, you know\u2026 the government should stay out of things. [\u2026] Pretty soon, they\u2019re going to wipe a lot of the middle restaurateurs and restaurant cooks. [\u2026] If it continues, then watch: you\u2019re going to have high-end, and you\u2019re going to have fast food, and you\u2019re going to have chain restaurants.\u201d\n\nEmeril admitted that he doesn\u2019t have a solution for America\u2019s ongoing and not appetizing economic woes, and if he did, \u201cI could run for president\u2026 All I can tell you is that the balance of the economic cycle is out of whack.\u201d\n\nThe celebrity chef owns 14 restaurants across the country but no one will probably need to hold a bake sale for him. In 2008 Martha Stewart Living bought the rights to the Emeril Lagassse cookbooks, TV shows, and kitchen merchandise for an estimated $50 million or more.\n\nFollowing Lagasse\u2019s comments to The Week, the New Orleans headquarters of his restaurant group issued the following statement to the New Orleans Times-Picayune:\n\nThe restaurant industry is one of most notoriously challenging industries and Chef was speaking to how the challenges of today\u2019s economy impact it nation-wide. Diners are more sophisticated and informed now than ever before and making more careful choices on how they spend their dollars in restaurants. As operating costs, especially food, continue to rise, it is an ongoing challenge for any restaurateur to maintain the quality of food, service and experience and not have their customers bear that burden.\u201d\n\nNone of Emeril\u2019s three New Orleans restaurants are in danger of closing their doors according to the Times-Picayune.\n\nIn a clarification about his reference to \u201cObama nonsense,\u201d Emeril Lagasse himself told The Wall Street Journal that \u201cI don\u2019t have a political side. [Obama] has a very tough job doing what he\u2019s doing and managing what he\u2019s doing under what\u2019s happening in the world. But at the same time, I think that we as a nation, we as people, we have our own problems. And I think that we need to be really looking at that as a nation. And what\u2019s really moving things forward.\u201d\n\n[image credit: Visit St. Pete/Clearwater]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse apparently is experiencing heartburn from what he deemed \"Obama nonsense\" that is adversely affecting the restaurant business", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse apparently is experiencing heartburn from what he deemed \u201cObama nonsense\u201d that is adversely affecting the restaurant business", "title": "Emeril Lagasse Scalds \u2018Obama Nonsense\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1502497/emeril-lagasse-scalds-obama-nonsense/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Emeril-Obamacare-nonsense-Flickr.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T20:38:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-26T21:19:02+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Emeril-Obamacare-nonsense-Flickr.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-09-26T20:38:06+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "emeril,emeril lagasse,emeril lagasse obama nonsense,food network,top chef,business", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Emeril-Obamacare-nonsense-Flickr.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse apparently is experiencing heartburn from what he deemed \u201cObama nonsense\u201d that is adversely affecting the restaurant business"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf91\"", "article_summary": "Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse apparently is experiencing heartburn from what he deemed \u201cObama nonsense\u201d that is adversely affecting the restaurant business.\nIn a clarification about his reference to \u201cObama nonsense,\u201d Emeril Lagasse himself told The Wall Street Journal that \u201cI don\u2019t have a political side.\nAnd then you add all the Obama nonsense to what it\u2019s become in the last several years.\nFoodies are well familiar with Emeril (particularly his \u201cBam!\u201d exhortation) from his cooking shows on the Food Network and as a judge on Top Chef.\nthe Affordable Care Act) as well as taxation imposed on businesses by the Obama administration."}
