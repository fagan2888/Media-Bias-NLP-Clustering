A renewal of the movement could draw negative attention to Tillis as he works to unseat Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.).\n\nIn January, Tillis told The New York Times that he wanted this session to \"be the shortest it can be.\"\n\nTillis has said his main priority this session would be addressing teacher pay. State Democrats argue he is attempting to moderate his public profile with a less inflammatory agenda.\n\n\"Speaker Tillis may be looking for political band-aids after the damage he did to North Carolina last legislative session, but there's no escaping his record of public education cuts, raising taxes on the middle class, and rejecting health care for 500,000 North Carolinians,\" state Democratic Party spokesman Ben Ray told The Huffington Post in an email.\n\nThe Rev. William Barber, who is president of North Carolina's NAACP, rejected Republican attempts to characterize the movement as a tool of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"We are black. We are white. We are young. We are old. We are Democrats. We are Republicans,\" Barber said Tuesday, according to WRAL. \"We are North Carolina. We are here to stay, and we are not going away.\"\n\nSee tweets from the movement's lobbying day below:\n\n'Moral Monday' demonstrators amass in front of House Speaker Tillis' office. pic.twitter.com/0txYO5hK6o \u2014 Gary Robertson (@garydrobertson) May 27, 2014\n\nProtesters outside Tillis' office pic.twitter.com/Rt2G31DafB \u2014 Josh Shaffer (@joshshaffer08) May 27, 2014\n\nMoral Monday demonstrators inside House Speaker Thom Tillis' office pic.twitter.com/bHfk1dVzWh \u2014 Andy Mattison (@AndynewsAndy) May 27, 2014\n\nRelated on HuffPost: Senate Seats Up For Grabs In 2014 Senate Seats Up For Grabs In 2014\n\n1 of 33 Sen.
