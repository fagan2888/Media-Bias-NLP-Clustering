Every movement on the course we wanted to be perfect.\u201d\n\nSamkova, who paints a mustache on her upper lip \u201cfor good luck\u201d during every race, said she grew up watching the Olympics on television and aspired to someday join the show.\n\n\u201cNow I am also Olympic. Yeah it\u2019s crazy,\u201d she said.\n\nPumping her arms in a kneeling, Tebow-esque celebration, Samkova joined Canada\u2019s Dominique Maltais (silver) and France\u2019s 19-year-old Chloe Trespeuch (bronze) on the podium.\n\nMaltais, a firefighter from Montreal, won bronze at the Torino Winter Games in 2006, but stumbled in the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. She rededicated herself to her sport in 2010, committing to four years of intense training with an eye on the podium in Sochi.\n\n\u201cThe last four years have been like I was on a mission,\u201d said the 33-year-old. \u201cEverything \u2026 was to get faster on that course. Like I said, hard work pays off and I think that it did today.\u201d\n\nSalt Lake City\u2019s Fay Gulini finished fourth after battling through seeding, quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n\n\u201cOn this course, it kind of seemed like just staying on your feet was important and I was able to do that pretty consistently,\u201d said the 21-year-old, who finished 12th at the 2010 Winter Olympics and 6th last month at Aspen\u2019s X Games. Gulini said the Russian cross course was \u201cthe toughest all season.\u201d\n\nThe carnage was spectacular, with crashes every race and three women leaving the course in a rescue sled. American Jackie Hernandez viciously slammed her head in a crash and slid horrifyingly lifeless down a landing during her seeding run. She suffered a concussion, but was on hand to cheer her teammates in the final.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of a headache,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for asking.\u201d\n\nThe course scared a lot of the women, Gulini said, for one because of so much time in the air.\n\n\u201cThis is a great course but it\u2019s intimidating,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually have courses that are this big. It\u2019s so much fun, but it will get in your head. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that the girls don\u2019t have the capability of hitting those huge jumps, but it will get in your head, and I think that\u2019s what it was for a lot of people. It was a mental thing.\u201d\n\nThe mental aspect definitely hit medal favorite Lindsey Jacobellis, who posted the second-fasted time in seeding and won her first quarterfinal. In her semifinal she was alone and leading when she crashed on a banked turn. It was reminiscent her finish in the 2006 Winter Olympics, when she was leading through the final jump but an ill-advised, showboating trick made her crash and she settled for silver. After falling, she won Sunday\u2019s consolation \u201csmall final.\u201d\n\nSaid the 28-year-old, her face draped in disappointment: \u201cIt\u2019s just a big bummer that it didn\u2019t work out for me and I wasn\u2019t able to complete the course. I was riding really well.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevims", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eva Samkova of Czech Republic wins gold in women\u2019s snowboard cross at Sochi Olympics", "title": "Eva Samkova of Czech Republic wins gold in women\u2019s snowboard cross at Sochi Olympics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/15/eva-samkova-of-czech-republic-wins-gold-in-womens-snowboard-cross-at-sochi-olympics/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216_055941_womens-snowboard-cross-final.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216_055941_womens-snowboard-cross-final.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T05:50:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:22:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde22c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s just because of my whole team,\u201d said Samkova, the Czech Republic\u2019s only female snowboard cross athlete in the Sochi Olympics.\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia \u2014 The camera atop Eva Samkova\u2019s helmet didn\u2019t catch much more than a blur of snow on Sunday in the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park\u2019s harrowing snowboard cross course.\nMaltais, a firefighter from Montreal, won bronze at the Torino Winter Games in 2006, but stumbled in the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010.\nIt was reminiscent her finish in the 2006 Winter Olympics, when she was leading through the final jump but an ill-advised, showboating trick made her crash and she settled for silver.\nGulini said the Russian cross course was \u201cthe toughest all season.\u201dThe carnage was spectacular, with crashes every race and three women leaving the course in a rescue sled."}
