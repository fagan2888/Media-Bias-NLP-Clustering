If you can\u2019t take certain pieces of equipment out there to have festivals or parties or have events, I think that is unfortunate, especially if you\u2019re going to do it in a responsible way,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThese events have been permitted by the Florida Department of Environment Protection, but the judge\u2019s order interprets the law as banning even this occasional vehicle traffic, which could damage sensitive sand dunes.\n\nWhile the legal injunction doesn\u2019t prohibit events on Treasure Island\u2019s beaches, it\u2019s likely to effectively kill them if food, drink and entertainment vendors aren\u2019t allowed to use vehicles to setup.\n\n\u201cFor Sanding Ovations, there\u2019s just no way to get the trucks out there. We can\u2019t get the sand out there and we can\u2019t get the equipment out there to move around the sand,\u201d City Manager Reid Silverboard said at last week\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cObviously, the other complication with not being able to do anything on the beach is part of the way we recoup [city] expenses is by having vendors and beer trucks and things like that.\u201d\n\nSome events, such as the American Legion\u2019s annual charitable car show, likely will move to the Treasure Island Community Center Park on the opposite side of Gulf Boulevard, which is where the Rotary Club moved its Greatest Show on Surf carnival last spring, to avoid complications from the pending lawsuit.\n\nThe park, however, is a much smaller venue and scant parking will make it difficult for many to attend, says Tong, who organizes the car show.\n\nThe commission ultimately stopped short of cancelling a handful of budgeted city events for 2015, including Sanding Ovations and Bands on the Sand, directing staff to weigh whether they\u2019re still financially feasible in a different location or without putting any vehicles on the beach.\n\nIn addition to the city\u2019s appeal, Tong and others have raised the possibility of seeking a change to state law that would allow communities to set their own rules about vehicle traffic on the beach.\n\nAt the meeting, several commissioners and residents spoke with dismay about the ruling, though at least one person praised the hoteliers\u2019 actions, saying it would protect the community\u2019s most precious asset for years to come.\n\n\u201cThat beach is our bait and hook for businesses and several thousand people who live in and visit Treasure Island,\u201d said Mel Lenehan.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 19:00:48 -0400", "Description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 If the artists in this past weekend\u2019s Sanding Ovations festival want to build sand sculptures on Treasure Island beach next year, they may have to haul in their materi", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 If the artists in this past weekend\u2019s Sanding Ovations festival want to build sand sculptures on Treasure Island beach next year, they may have to haul in their materi", "title": "Rule against driving on beach could put damper on festivals", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pinellas-county/rule-against-driving-on-beach-could-put-damper-festivals-20141123/", "image": {"width": 3588, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141123/ARTICLE/141129670/EP/1/1/EP-141129670.jpg", "height": 2274}, "updated_time": "2014-11-24T08:07:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TREASURE ISLAND \u2014 If the artists in this past weekend\u2019s Sanding Ovations festival want to build sand sculptures on Treasure Island beach next year, they may have to haul in their mate", "title": "Rule against driving on beach could put damper on festivals", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141123/ARTICLE/141129670/AR/0/AR-141129670.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-11-23T19:00:48Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-11-24T08:07:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa12\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat beach is our bait and hook for businesses and several thousand people who live in and visit Treasure Island,\u201d said Mel Lenehan.\nCity officials in Clearwater said they were reviewing the judge\u2019s order to determine whether it would have any impact on their beach events.\n\u2014 If the artists in this past weekend\u2019s Sanding Ovations festival want to build sand sculptures on Treasure Island beach next year, they may have to haul in their material with wheelbarrows.\nWe can\u2019t get the sand out there and we can\u2019t get the equipment out there to move around the sand,\u201d City Manager Reid Silverboard said at last week\u2019s meeting.\nAt a meeting last week, city commissioners even debated if raking the sand with a tractor fits the law\u2019s definition of \u201ccleanup\u201d and \u201cmaintenance,\u201d the only justifiable reasons for driving on the beach."}
