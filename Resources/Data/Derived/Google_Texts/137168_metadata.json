Supporters of the law say it\u2019s another reason to be optimistic.\n\nThe percentage of uninsured Americans dropped from 17.9 percent in September to 15.2 percent in March, the survey shows. And because 17.5 percent were still uninsured in December, the data suggests that most of that drop occurred in 2014 as Americans rushed to sign up before the March 31 deadline for open enrollment.\n\nMost of the survey was completed by March 6 \u2013 before the final open enrollment surge took place \u2013 meaning the final insurance tally could be even higher.\n\nThe nationally representative survey of approximately 7,500 adults was conducted by researchers at the Urban Institute and funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which is also an underwriter of the NewsHour health unit.\n\nSince President Obama announced on Tuesday that 7.1 million Americans had enrolled in coverage through the insurance marketplaces, many have wondered how many actually gained new coverage under the law. A percentage of the 7.1 figure are likely those who were forced to re-enroll in coverage after being forced from their previous plans by the law.\n\nSome, including the conservative Heritage Foundation, say the Obama administration\u2019s figures may be inflated because it\u2019s still unknown how many of the \u201cnewly insured\u201d have taken the crucial step of paying their first month\u2019s premium. The distinction: Those who have enrolled through the marketplace but fail to make that payment will remain uninsured.\n\nWhile those behind the survey admit that much is still unknown, they say it\u2019s a good indicator that the law is working as intended.\n\n\u201cThe 15 percent drop in uninsurance among adults since September reveals a very promising start for the ACA\u2019s key coverage expansion provisions,\u201d said Sharon Long, an Urban Institute health economist and the coordinator of the survey. \u201cOne can expect even more significant changes as the end-of-March surge in enrollments is accounted for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 5.4 million Americans gained health insurance since September, according to a survey released Thursday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "pubdate": 20140403, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "More than 5.4 million Americans gained health insurance since September, according to a survey released Thursday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "title": "Survey finds 5.4 million Americans gained insurance under new health law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/182609341-image-of-person-trying-to-enroll-for-health-insurance.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/survey-reports-5-4-million-americans-gain-health-insurance-affordable-care-act/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "More than 5.4 million Americans gained health insurance since September, according to a survey released Thursday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "title": "Survey finds 5.4 million Americans gained insurance under new health law", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/182609341-image-of-person-trying-to-enroll-for-health-insurance.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "robert wood johnson foundation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, health insurance, obamacare, robert wood johnson foundation"}, "article_summary": "More than 5.4 million Americans gained health insurance since September, according to a survey released Thursday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nThe percentage of uninsured Americans dropped from 17.9 percent in September to 15.2 percent in March, the survey shows.\nThe results are the first indicator of how many uninsured Americans may have benefited from the Affordable Care Act since the insurance marketplaces opened last October.\nSupporters of the law say it\u2019s another reason to be optimistic.\nSince President Obama announced on Tuesday that 7.1 million Americans had enrolled in coverage through the insurance marketplaces, many have wondered how many actually gained new coverage under the law."}
