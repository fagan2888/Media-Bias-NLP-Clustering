And in addition to slamming the Democratic presidential frontrunner for instability around the world, Bush is looking to prove his own toughness as the potential GOP presidential nominee. It was less than two weeks ago when Clinton knocked Bush around at the National Urban League conference in his home state of Florida. \"I don't think you can credibly say that everyone has a right to rise and then say you're for phasing out Medicare or for repealing Obamacare,\" Clinton said, referencing the name of Bush's political operation. When Bush took the stage moments later, he did not respond, drawing criticism from some within his party being overly passive. That's why Bush, in addition to laying out his national security philosophy, is hoping he can use tonight to calm GOP concerns that he's just not tough enough.\n\nPOPPING ON NBC POLITICS\n\nTrump continues to lead in recent polls, even after his recent battle with Megyn Kelly.
