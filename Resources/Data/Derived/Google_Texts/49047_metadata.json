Congratulations! That will cost you a quarter of a million dollars.\n\nYes, all you procreators: according to new stats from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price tag for raising a baby born in 2013 to the age of 18 just soared over $245,000 for a middle-income couple. The figure is up $4,260 from 2012.\n\nNotice that this number does not include college, just your basic food, lodging, transporting, clothing and various sundries associated with just getting the kid up and through the door.\n\nWTF? Part of the problem, the report shows, is that childcare costs have rocketed into the stratosphere, often costing as much as renting a home.

With all that burden, Friedman found that despite a desire to be parents, young people could not see how it would be feasible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But the U.S. still refuses to adopt policies that would lessen the staggering burden", "author": "Lynn Stuart Parramore", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "But the U.S. still refuses to adopt policies that would lessen the staggering burden", "title": "The price tag for raising a child in America will actually blow your mind", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/28/the_price_tag_for_raising_a_child_in_america_will_absolutely_blow_your_mind_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_59080258.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But the U.S. still refuses to adopt policies that would lessen the staggering burden", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_59080258.jpg", "title": "The price tag for raising a child in America will actually blow your mind", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The price tag for raising a child in America will actually blow your mind", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Babies, Fatherhood, Motherhood, Parenthood", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd425\"", "article_summary": "Is it any wonder that millennials, also saddled with student debt, are not planning to have children, even though they may want them?\nTopics: AlterNet, Babies, Fatherhood, Motherhood, Parenthood, Life News, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetDid you have a kid in 2013?\nWith all that burden, Friedman found that despite a desire to be parents, young people could not see how it would be feasible.\nMeanwhile, America\u2019s median income is 8 percent less than its pre-recession level, and healthcare costs are still growing faster than inflation.\nCNN cites recent data on center-based care for a single infant, and it has surpassed median rent payments in nearly half of the states."}
