Under previously issued Department of Health and Human Services regulations, insurance companies were barred from selling such plans beginning January 1, 2013.\n\nMere minutes after Obama made his announcement, former-Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said on MSNBC, \"I wonder if he has the legal authority to do this, since this was a congressional bill that set this up.\"\n\nThe short answer is, \"no.\"\n\nBut before we examine why this latest Obama executive action is illegal, let's step back and look at two of his previous transgressions:\n\nDACA\n\nFrustrated by his failure to pass the DREAM Act in Congress, on June 15, 2012, Obama announced his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy for illegal immigrants. Pursuant to a memo signed by then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Illegal immigrants who came to the United States before they were 16, were younger than 31, had been in the United States for at least 5 years, were either in school or had graduated high school, and had not committed \u201csignificant\u201d crimes, could now be given \u201cdeferred action\u201d status.\n\nIllegal immigrants who are awarded \"deferred action\" status are allowed to obtain a work permit, get a Social Security number, and apply for a driver\u2019s license. But Napolitano said the status is temporary and must be renewed every two years.\n\nNothing in any federal statute grants Obama or Napolitano the legal authority to create such a program. Instead, the Obama administration claimed that presidents have long exercised prosecutorial discretion on immigration enforcement. And it is true. There is a well established history, and case law supporting it, of presidents granting non-enforcement status to for particular groups for foreign policy or humanitarian reasons (like Haiti after a natural disaster).\n\nBut these acts of discretion were always done on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis. They were not a wholesale rewrite of immigration law, let alone one that had been recently specifically rejected by Congress.\n\nEmployer Mandate\n\nFast forward to July 2nd of this year, when the Treasury Department announced new regulations that delayed enforcement of Obamacare's employer mandate by a year. Nothing in Obamacare authorizes Obama to do this, in fact the statute very clearly says that the employer mandate must take effect \"after Dec. 31, 2013.\"\n\nSo how did Obama justify changing the date with out Congressional approval? He cited a completely separate portion of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 7805(a), which the IRS has used in the past to delay enforcement of new tax laws. But, as I wrote at the time, 7805(a) had never been used on the scale that Obama used it:\n\nIRS has previously used the section to delay a penalty under the 2007 Small Business and Work Opportunity Act and a tax hike in the 2011 Airport and Airway Extension Act. But both of those delays were for less than a year (six months and one month, respectively), only applied to minor portions of much broader legislation, and were issued the same year the original legislation passed. By contrast, the Obamacare employer-mandate delay was issued more than three years after the original law passed, will be in effect at least a year (possibly longer), and involves a major cost saving feature [$12 billion] of the underlying legislation.\n\nThe Latest Fix\n\nMoving back to the if-you-like-your-plan-you-can-keep-it fix, the Obama administration is again unable to identify anything in Obamacare that gives them this authority, and they couldn't find anything in underlying HHS statutes either. Instead, they are citing a 1985 Supreme Court case, Heckler v. Chaney, which they say gives them the necessary enforcement discretion.\n\nBut Heckler v. Chaney had nothing to do with changing existing law. In that case, death row inmates sued the Food and Drug Administration in an effort to force them to apply existing regulations to the use of drugs used for lethal injection. The Court found that the FDA had discretion over how to enforce their existing regulations.\n\nBut the latest Obamacare fix is not just a decision not to enforce existing regulations, it creates brand new ones, including a requirement for what insurers must include in their policy cancellation letters.\n\nMore importantly though, if Obama can get away with citing Heckler v Chaney to rewrite Obamacare, he can cite it to rewrite any law, at any time he wants, for whatever reason.\n\nFrom his illegal recess appointments to his illegal Solyndra contract rewrite, this Obamacare rewrite is Obama's most illegal act yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama's latest abuse of executive power is his biggest yet..05/23/2016 22:01:35PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Obama's latest abuse of executive power is his biggest yet.", "title": "- Obama's Obamcare Fix is His Most Illegal Power Grab Yet", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2013/11/15/obamas-obamcare-fix-is-his-most-illegal-power-grab-yet-n1747326", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/319/2013-11-15T124758Z_1_CBRE9AE0ZMB00_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Obama's latest abuse of executive power is his biggest yet.", "title": "- Obama's Obamcare Fix is His Most Illegal Power Grab Yet", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2013/11/15/obamas-obamcare-fix-is-his-most-illegal-power-grab-yet-n1747326", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/319/2013-11-15T124758Z_1_CBRE9AE0ZMB00_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama's Obamcare Fix is His Most Illegal Power Grab Yet, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cb4\"", "article_summary": "From his illegal recess appointments to his illegal Solyndra contract rewrite, this Obamacare rewrite is Obama's most illegal act yet.\nThe Court found that the FDA had discretion over how to enforce their existing regulations.\nBut Heckler v.
