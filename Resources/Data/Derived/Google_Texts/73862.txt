CLERMONT â€” South Lake Hospital will have navigators available starting Monday to help people make decisions about coverage through the Affordable Care Act's health-insurance marketplace.

Open enrollment for the second year of the program began Saturday and ends Feb. 15.

Residents with questions about or who need assistance enrolling in coverage plans can receive free one-on-one help from an independent licensed navigator from 1 to 8 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays through Feb. 11.

"Being able to have a navigator here at the hospital allows easy accessibility for all those in south Lake County," Lance Sewell, South Lake Hospital chief financial officer, said in a news release.

Licensed navigators have gone through a comprehensive training program to prepare them to help individuals and small businesses analyze health coverage options through the marketplace and fill out eligibility and enrollment forms.

Those seeking help must make an appointment, which will last about an hour to an hour and a half. For more information or to make an appointment, call 877-564-5031 or go to coveringcfl.net.
