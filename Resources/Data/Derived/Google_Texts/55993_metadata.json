PETERSBURG \u2014 The No. 1-ranked Bengal cat in the world, a feline from Indiana, drew a crowd at the Skyway Cat Club of Tampa Bay\u2019s 30th annual TICA Cat Show on Sunday. But the judges, who rarely agree, thought a 6-month-old Bengal owned by Melody Boyd, a Savannah, Georgia-based foreclosure attorney was prettier.\n\n\u201cYou want to know the dark and dirty side of cat shows? It\u2019s all politics. It\u2019s all how well-known the cat is,\u201d Boyd said in a near whisper. \u201cThis show is the least political in the cat show circuit, and the judges are very fair. You spend a lot of time and money doing this, and you want to make sure your cat is judged fairly on its merits. That\u2019s why you choose carefully where you go.\u201d\n\nThe weekend show, held at the Minnreg Building in Pinellas Park, was by far the group\u2019s biggest, with more than 147 entrants. Judges come from as far away as France and breeders from across America and Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another show in Orlando right now and we got more than they have, but I\u2019m just bragging,\u201d said Theresa Kempton, a TICA judge and producer of the Skyway show. \u201cWe pick up five or six new faces every year and they keep sticking with us. We even have the same spectators come in every show to see how the cats have grown.\u201d\n\nThough the show provides ample opportunity to peruse local vendors, socialize with other cat lovers and even adopt a future champion, the claws come out during competition, which is all about poise, pedigree and physique. TICA has a written standard for each cat breed: what eyes, jaws and coats should look like with the best breeding.\n\nIt took Kempton five years of study to become a judge, but in the world of cat shows that\u2019s the first step towards a position in the international circuit.\n\nSome breeders get ready by taking their cats through a busy Home Depot to familiarize them with being around other humans. They create mock showing tables and cages so the cats will be relaxed during show time.\n\n\u201cThere is no prize money. There is no check,\u201d said Boyd, who sells her cats through Boyd\u2019s Bengals. \u201cThe only thing you get to walk away with is the prestige, the joy of winning and the ability to bask in the glory that you\u2019re cat came out on top.\u201d\n\nSheila Andreasen upgraded her sedan to a van this year to drive 10 cats to the show from her home in Dothan, Alabama. Unlike many of the breeders, Andreasen finds her show cats in local rescue organizations, and after the show puts them up for adoption through her organization Kee Kitty Friends. Every time she braves the drive to make it to a Skyway show she usually finds homes for at least two, she said.\n\n\u201cThe drive actually was just lovely, they all fell asleep believe it or not,\u201d Andreasen said. \u201cThe deciding factor is my practice run to make sure they\u2019ll all ride OK in the car.\u201d\n\nAll About Cats, a rescue and adoption shelter based in Pinellas, also uses the show to put their cats in front of animal lovers that could be good adoptive parents. The shelter is run completely by volunteers out of \u201cfoster homes,\u201d and is providing for more than 100 cats, most saved from being euthanized by the county.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to find homes for all our strays, but there are just too many cats in this county,\u201d said Margret Hodgens, a volunteer. \u201cWe got one of our cats \u2014 who was pregnant with six kittens \u2014 two hours before she was going to be euthanized ... Knowing we save cats like that is just the best feeling of love.\u201d\n\nadawson@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-9851\n\nTwitter: @adawsonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 17 Aug 2014 17:31:09 -0400", "Description": "ST.
