The issue is expected to come up again this session.\n\nIn his budget proposal for 2016, Gov. Rick Scott said he wants to see the state employees who pay $8.34 for individual coverage or $30 a month for family coverage - certain managers, the governor and lawmakers in the Florida House - pay the same monthly health insurance premiums as the rest of Florida's state employees: $50 a month for an individual or $180 for a family.\n\nBut lawmakers are seeking more sweeping changes, including establishing a price transparency pilot project, setting lower premiums for Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans and eventually offering four different \u201cmetal tier\u201d benefit levels.\n\nState Sen. Jeff Brandes (R-St. Petersburg) filed SB 1434 Wednesday to overhaul health insurance for state employees. It\u2019s similar to measures that have been proposed in the past in the Florida House, including a proposal from state Rep. Jason Brodeur, who chairs the Health & Human Services Committee.\n\nBrodeur\u2019s proposal failed during the 2015 regular session, but he said he plans to try again this year with a proposed committee bill.\n\n\u201cI will be filing changes to the state group health insurance plan, likely very similar to last year,\u201d Brodeur said in an email to WUSF News.\n\nSince 2005, most state workers in Florida have paid $50 dollars a month for individual coverage, or $180 dollars a month for their family.\n\nThese monthly premiums are the same whether they enroll in a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)or a PPO. Among the changes sought in the bill proposed last session by Brodeur were lowering the monthly premiums for the PPO, and increasing them for the HMO.\n\n\"Something that gives you more should cost a little more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe upward adjustment reflects the fact that these are offered as richer benefits, that\u2019s the actual value of what we are giving, or providing, as part of the plan.\"\n\nBut the 2015 legislative session ended early over disagreement over Low Income Pool funds, so dozens of bills, including Broduer\u2019s changes to state employee health insurance, died. That meant it was more or less business as usual last fall at the benefits fairs held across Florida for state workers.\n\nShabnam Mehra, an assistant director in planning and analysis who has worked for the University of South Florida in Tampa for almost two decades, is one of about 150,000 people who work for the state.\n\nShe said she's seen the state universities grow and change, but one thing that hasn't changed in recent years is how much she pays for a health plan for her family. During open enrollment last fall, she decided to stay with her AvMed plan through the state.\n\n\"I'm fine, no changes, so I'm fine,\u201d Mehra said.\n\nMany workers see the benefit as a trade-off for salaries that are lower than in the private sector. Mehra said the plan offered through her husband\u2019s job is much more expensive than the insurance she has as a state employee.\n\n\u201cIt's much lower,\u201d Mehra said. \u201cI have a husband who works commercially, and he's covered on my plan for this reason.\u201d\n\nThe state estimates it cost about $1.5 billion in 2013 for health insurance that covers more than 300,000 state employees and their families.\n\nLottie Watts is a reporter and producer with WUSF in Tampa.
