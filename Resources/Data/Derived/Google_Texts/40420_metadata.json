Not so, says a new study from Oregon: Individuals covered by Medicaid \u2014 the vast majority of those newly obtaining coverage under ObamaCare \u2014 actually use the ER more often than those without insurance. This translates into an increase in expensive emergency care and a concomitant burden on taxpayers.\n\nIn the Beaver State, researchers had an ideal situation in which to test the hypothesis that increased health coverage would lead to decreased ER visits. In 2009, Oregon chose to expand its Medicaid coverage to about one-third of eligible adults, selecting those who would receive coverage by lottery. Researchers were then able to follow truly random samples of individuals who had coverage and those who did not.\n\nWhat they found will surprise many ObamaCare supporters. According to the study, published in the journal Science, over an 18-month period following the Medicaid expansion, Oregonians who received coverage under the program actually visited ERs 40 percent more frequently than those who did not. \u201cThe pattern was so strong that it held true across most demographic groups, times of day and types of visits, including those for conditions that were treatable in primary care settings,\u201d noted the New York Times.\n\nIndeed, so lacking in urgency were most of these patients\u2019 conditions that while ER visits increased, hospital admissions did not. \u201cIn fact,\u201d reported the Los Angeles Times, \u201cthe increased use was most pronounced in cases classified as \u2018primary care treatable\u2019 and \u2018non-emergent,\u2019 authors wrote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you cover the uninsured, emergency room use goes up by a large magnitude,\u201d senior study author and MIT economics professor Amy Finkelstein told the paper. \u201cIn no case were we able to find any subpopulations, or type of conditions, for which Medicaid caused a significant decrease in emergency department use.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, runs contrary to the theory, advanced by ObamaCare proponents including President Barack Obama himself, that insuring people will cause them to seek care from their primary-care physicians rather than ERs, which by law are required to treat all comers regardless of ability to pay.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s very important that we provide coverage for all people because if everybody\u2019s got coverage, then they\u2019re not going to the emergency room for treatment,\u201d Obama said in 2009.\n\n\u201cOur health care system has forced too many uninsured Americans to depend on the emergency room for the care they need,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement later that year. \u201cWe cannot wait for reform that gives all Americans the high-quality, affordable care they need and helps prevent illnesses from turning into emergencies.\u201d\n\nA fact sheet issued by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) asserts: \u201cToday, uninsured citizens often turn to emergency rooms for non-urgent care because they don\u2019t have access to primary care doctors \u2014 leading to crowded emergency rooms, longer wait times and higher cost. By expanding Medicaid, those without insurance will have access to primary care, lowering costs and improving overall health.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Finkelstein told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cNow we know \u2014 the hope that Medicaid will save money turns out not to be correct, at least in the first two years.\u201d The study\u2019s authors \u201ccalculated that Medicaid increased annual ER spending by $120 a covered person,\u201d the newspaper wrote. With four million Americans having already applied for Medicaid under ObamaCare, that comes to an extra $480 million per year that will be drained out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets \u2014 a tab that is likely to grow as demand for emergency care does.\n\nThus far, only half the states, plus the District of Columbia, have chosen to expand Medicaid to cover individuals making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 a decision afforded them by the Supreme Court\u2019s convoluted finding that states could not be forced to participate in the expansion even as individuals could be forced to buy private insurance.\n\n\u201cThis will make the states that didn\u2019t expand look even smarter, because they didn\u2019t fall for the false promise of lower ER use, and the states that did expand Medicaid will have even more crowded emergency rooms,\u201d Cato Institute director of health policy studies Michael Cannon told the Journal.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why an increase in the insured population also leads to an increase in ER visits. \u201cThink of health coverage as an across-the-board price cut for all medical services,\u201d Columbia Business School economics professor Ray Fisman wrote in a Slate article. \u201cWhen prices go down, demand goes up, so insurance naturally leads to more health care use overall, including emergency care.\u201d\n\nEarlier research into Oregon\u2019s Medicaid expansion bears out this contention. This research \u201cfound that enrolling in the public program increased hospital visits, primary care trips and prescription drug use,\u201d penned the Washington Post\u2019s Sarah Kliff. \u201cWith financial barriers removed, Medicaid patients see their primary care doctor more \u2014 and also go to the emergency department at an increased frequency.\u201d What\u2019s more, \u201cMedicaid coverage also increased the probability of having any visit to the emergency department by 7 percent,\u201d she added.\n\nAll this extra care costs money. Harvard School of Public Health economist Katherine Baicker, another principal author of the latest study, told the Journal that \u201cthe data from all their research to date suggest that extending Medicaid to the uninsured increases health-care costs between 25% and 35% per person.\u201d Again, most, if not all, of that cost is borne by taxpayers.\n\nNot all ObamaCare cheerleaders are surprised or even concerned by these findings.\n\n\u201cI would view it as part of a broader set of evidence that covering people with health insurance doesn\u2019t save money,\u201d MIT economist Jonathan Gruber told Kliff. \u201cThat was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn\u2019t designed to save money. It\u2019s designed to improve health, and that\u2019s going to cost money.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nGruber should know. He was one of the architects of Massachusetts\u2019 2006 healthcare law, the prototype for ObamaCare (for which Gruber was also consulted by the White House), right down to the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. Today, Massachusetts has the highest per capita health spending rate in the country \u2014 36 percent higher than the national average and 11.2 percent greater than the runner-up, New York.
