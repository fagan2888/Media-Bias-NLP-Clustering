Ted Cruz won the Iowa Republican caucus, while on the Democratic side Hillary Clinton edged out Bernie Sanders by just a handful of votes. Marco Rubio finished third on the GOP side, just behind Donald Trump. That's moved the betting odds in Clinton and Rubio's favor at ElectionBettingOdds.com.

Almost everyone running for office today declares himself a "leader" who "gets things done." There's no modesty, little acknowledgement that so much of what government does is costly attempts to fix problems that government created at home and abroad.
