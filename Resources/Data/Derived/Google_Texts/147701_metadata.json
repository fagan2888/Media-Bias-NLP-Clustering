I can think of worse ways to illustrate the Left\u2019s wholesale destruction of Western culture. Writing at The Blaze, Penny Young Nance of Concerned Women for America relates another heartwarming message from Planned Parenthood, and offers a response:\n\nThis week, [Planned Parenthood president] Cecile Richards decided to hijack yet another holiday and make it about everything it isn\u2019t. They did it for Christmas, and now they\u2019re doing it for Valentine\u2019s Day. Taking feminism to its logical conclusion, Cecile declared that \u201cwhat women need for Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d is abortion and birth control. Listen up men, you thought dinner would be nice? Wrong. And that you would pay? Well, that\u2019s just degrading, because in the eyes of the Left, what women \u201cneed\u201d eliminates the need for a committed man in their lives or for anyone else besides them and Lena Dunham. They will refuse to let you open the door, scoff when men offer a seat, and yet, at the end of the day, complain that there are no \u201creal men out there anymore.\u201d\n\nThis was accompanied by some photos of ladies from the Concerned Women for America holding up their own \u201cwhat women need for Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d signs, which I won\u2019t spoil, so click the link above to see them.\n\nThis is perhaps an awkward moment for feminists to be pushing abortion extremism as the defining ideology of Valentine\u2019s Day, since the recently consecrated dashboard saint of their movement is busy running around Texas and trying to convince everyone she\u2019s a pro-lifer. Of course, no one on either side of the debate believes her, but it\u2019s still a significant sign of weakness in the abortion lobby that she feels compelled to say the words.\n\nAs Mallory Quigley, communications director of the Susan B. Anthony List, puts it: \u201cShe\u2019s only trying to give the appearance of softening her views without really changing her position. Such exceptions as Wendy Davis would allow for the \u2018health of the mother\u2019 would make the legislation meaningless. This is standard language for the abortion lobby, and you will notice that none of the pro-abortion groups so much as blinked at her statement.\u201d\n\nWell, we\u2019ll just have to work harder to make them blink, won\u2019t we?\n\nAt the risk of sounding old-fashioned (\u201cConservative!\u201d I say, in the same tone of voice Jack Sparrow uses to say \u201cPirate!\u201d when accused of cheating at swordplay) if there\u2019s one day during the year that should be more about romantic love than just sex, and the efficient disposal of its consequences, Valentine\u2019s Day is it. Romance is an ideal, and what use are those, unless you hold them high every now and then?\n\nAre we not supposed to strive for something higher, gentler, and more eternal than quick hook-ups without complications? I\u2019m not asking that question rhetorically. I honestly wonder if the people who shape our culture believe love and fidelity hold a moral plane, or even a level of personal fulfillment, higher than satisfying our immediate urges.\n\nHard work has been done by the Left to separate people from the ideal of lifelong marriage and the nourishment of families. They want us to be alone with the State, our towering mother and lover, the only partner Barack Obama\u2019s fictional \u201cJulia\u201d character needed to live out her entire life and raise a child. We are in the end stage of a project to make us concede, one and for all, that restraint plays no role in romance, sex is an entirely biological process, and there\u2019s nothing special about men and women bonding to each other for life and taking care of their children. We\u2019re not (yet) supposed to hate that model of love and loyalty; we\u2019re just supposed to give it a polite round of unenthusiastic applause as one lifestyle choice among many, of no particular value. It certainly isn\u2019t supposed to be something young men, or especially young women, dream about any more. Their increasingly early sexualization gives them much less adolescent time for such fantasies.\n\nCan\u2019t we have a day that\u2019s all about the magic, mystery, warmth, and anticipation that lead up to that first kiss of the evening\u2026 or the kiss that begins a lifetime together? Can\u2019t it be about what we hope for, as much as what we desire? I suppose things have gone so sour that old-fashioned notions of Valentine\u2019s Day now constitute a political statement, and the other side demands equal time in our social consciousness.\n\nNot to be outdone, the sociopaths in the environmentalist movement like to use Valentine\u2019s Day as an opportunity to remind you that human procreation is an act of violence against the fragile Earth The Media Research Council has a sample of this twaddle: \u201cInstead of the shopping mood, let\u2019s talk about getting in a different kind of mood. You know what I\u2019m talking about. Saving the planet.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone, The New Republic delivered a shocking expose. You know what Valentine\u2019s Day cards are really made of? Global warming, that\u2019s what. \u201cIf your other half bought you a Valentine\u2019s card, be sure to say thanks for the 18.5 grams of CO2 it created,\u201d sneered the magazine\u2019s Twitter voice.\n\nWhile Cupid tries to dodge through the flak bursts from these sourpusses and their eco-guilt artillery, let me ask them a question. If you\u2019re obsessing over the grams of CO2 released by packing a Hoops & Yoyo love ballad into a piece of stiff paper, why don\u2019t you call for the complete cessation of commercial air travel? One jumbo jet is going to blast out more CO2 than all the Valentine\u2019s Day cards in Christendom. If we\u2019re teetering on the verge of planetary immolation (or freezing, or whatever the witch doctors say is the big threat this week) then we shouldn\u2019t be indulging in such luxuries, should we?\n\nGet serious and call for the end of an industry the human race got along with just fine until less than a century ago. We can keep aircraft for medical emergencies, military use, and of course the transportation needs of the Ruling Class \u2013 they need swift and luxurious travel, but the peons don\u2019t, not really. It\u2019s ridiculous to mess around with grams of carbon when the astounding number of aircraft soaring through our skies are dumping tons of it every day. Environmentalists and left-wing social planners think lowly citizens move around too much anyway. Taking our cheap commuter flights away would be an important step toward more effective lifestyle planning for the Little People.\n\nBut no, we get hassled over everything from hairspray to mash notes. The idea is to keep us in a constant state of guilt and fear, softening our resistance to command by getting us to concede, in a thousand little ways, that we don\u2019t really deserve the freedom we insist on, and that our traditions are thoughtless prejudices from the past we should jettison like so much ballast.
