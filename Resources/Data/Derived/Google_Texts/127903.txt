Eliu Jiminez, 19, was arrested late Saturday by Denver police in connection with a fatal hit-and-run accident at Federal Boulevard and Dartmouth Avenue.

Jiminez is being held for investigation of vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of a fatal accident and DUI.

A police helicopter followed the hit-and-run vehicle to Iliff Avenue and Irving Street — a few blocks from the accident — and Jiminez was arrested there.

The victim, who police have not identified, was crossing Federal at about 11:10 p.m. Saturday when a car traveling southbound struck him, throwing him into the north-bound lane.

Another vehicle hit him there and left the scene, Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said Sunday.

The driver of the first car to hit the pedestrian stopped. The victim was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

The Denver Office of the Medical Examiner will identify the victim.
