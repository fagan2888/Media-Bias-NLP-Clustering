The government has repeatedly stressed that companies in which Temasek has a major stake, which range from Singapore Airlines to massive telecommunications firm SingTel, operate just as any other private company and are subject to the same market forces.\n\n\u201cYou have the issue that these are not, in Singapore\u2019s view, SOEs like any other \u2014 certainly not like the loss-making, corrupt firms found elsewhere in this region,\u201d said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Singapore-based Asian Trade Centre.\n\nSingapore\u2019s demands in the TPP run counter to what it got in its bilateral free trade agreement with the U.S. in 2003, in which it was able to exempt Temasek from the agreement\u2019s SOE rules but had to apply the rules to any subsidiaries in which Temasek had at least a 20 percent stake.

Welcome to Morning Trade, where we will soon be exporting turkey from the oven and importing it into our stomachs. Please note that Morning Trade will be on hiatus for the next two days to better focus on eating and digestion of yummy foods. But you can still send me trade tips at vguida@politico.com or @vtg2.\n\nA PIECE OF EXPORT PIE: The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has plated up some Thanksgiving stats in a blog post. \u201cMuch of the bread, stuffing, and cakes that accompany traditional Thanksgiving dinners are made from wheat. Last year, the United States exported $10.5 billion in wheat and wheat products, with Washington State leading all U.S. states with nearly $2.5 billion in wheat exports,\u201d it said: http://1.usa.gov/1pkZs7x.\n\nU.S., INDIA RELEASE WIDE-RANGING STATEMENT: The U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum had no immediate outcomes but did produce commitments to work together in contentious areas. Both countries agreed on work plans for cooperating on agriculture, services, intellectual property and investment in manufacturing, the two sides said in a joint statement Tuesday on the high-level dialogue, the first in four years.\n\nThe statement recognized the importance of providing a transparent and predictable policy environment, trade secrets protection, and \u201cthe paramount goal\u201d of ensuring the poorest populations in India and the United States have access to quality health care. U.S. and Indian officials committed to exchanging information in these areas and identifying ways in which trade and innovation policies can improve access to health care and affordable medicines. They also agreed to meet again next year in Washington.\n\nRick Rossow, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, pointed to President Barack Obama\u2019s upcoming trip to India near the end of January as a potentially galvanizing event, putting pressure on the two sides to come up with some \u201cdeliverables\u201d for the meeting. A realistic goal could include an agreement by India\u2019s Parliament to loosen restrictions on foreign investment in the insurance sector, he said.\n\nU.S. BUSINESSES HEARTENED BY INDIA FORUM: Patrick Kilbride, executive director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Global Intellectual Property Center, called the forum \u201ca good start.\u201d \u201cOur expectation going in was that this would be an agenda-setting opportunity,\u201d he said, adding that this is the first time that many of these issues \u2014 particularly surrounding pharmaceutical patents \u2014 have been discussed at this level.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this has taken place, the fact that there is broad agreement on an agenda, the fact that they didn\u2019t seem to close off any avenues of discussion \u2026 we\u2019re very pleased with direction of the engagement,\u201d Kilbride told POLITICO.\n\nChris Moore, senior director for international business policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, praised the work by USTR, but he noted the \u201cvagueness\u201d in the statement, such as on investment, and said his group would have liked to see more concrete progress \u201cas an indication of India\u2019s willingness to engage and to really work with us toward solutions to longstanding issues\u201d as well as new ones.\n\nBut Jamie Love, director of the nonprofit group Knowledge Ecology International, which advocates for the poor, had a different take on the meeting. \u201cIf Michael Froman succeeds in cutting off India as a supplier of inexpensive generic medicines, he will kill more people than Obamacare will save, and that's not much of a legacy,\u201d he said.\n\nCONGRESS WARNS EU ON DIGITAL MARKET: The chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House committees with jurisdiction over trade criticized digital rules under consideration by the European Parliament, which they argue would create a \u201cwalled-off \u2018EU cloud.\u2019\u201d \u201cProvisions calling for particular outcomes in the enforcement of EU competition law and localization of cloud computing services \u2026 are especially troubling,\u201d the lawmakers say, adding that such moves could hurt the ability of the U.S. and EU to negotiate their proposed bilateral trade deal. See the letter here: http://politico.pro/1FoOJgr.\n\nEU NODS TO TTIP SECRECY CONCERNS: The European Union will make public certain negotiating proposals covering the \u201crules\u201d portion of the U.S.-EU trade talks, new European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said Tuesday, apparently referring to areas such as intellectual property rights, food safety, labor and the environment.\n\nThe European Commission on Tuesday, responding to public concern about TTIP, agreed to pare back some of the secrecy surrounding the negotiations by giving members of the European Parliament and other interested parties more information about proposals being discussed.\n\n\u201cMany of the fears are not well-founded,\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m said. \u201cWe can only discuss this if we have all of the documents, or most of the documents available, so we can have a fact-based discussion.\u201d\n\nBernd Lange, chairman of the parliament\u2019s Committee on International Trade, praised the move. \u201cThe transparency will be stronger and I appreciate it very much,\u201d Lange told reporters at a news conference with Malmstr\u00f6m. He also made a pitch for the European Commission to publicly disclose its services trade offer, one of the areas of greatest public concern. See the full story by Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer and Adam Behsudi here: http://politico.pro/1rdpivz.\n\nIN OTHER TTIP NEWS: The European Commission hopes to publish a report before the end of the year summarizing the results of its public consultations on whether to include an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in the pact with the United States, Malmstr\u00f6m said Tuesday. \u201cThis is something we\u2019ll be taking forward the beginning of next year,\u201d she told reporters, noting the commission had received nearly 153,000 comments on the issue.\n\nCHOCOLATE CEO TO JOIN ADVISORY COMMITTEE: Obama announced his intent to nominated John Bilbrey, CEO of The Hershey Company, to serve on the Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations. See the White House release here: http://politico.pro/1zskotr.\n\nMIDEAST TRADE MISSION COMING UP: Ken Hyatt, deputy undersecretary of Commerce for international trade, will lead 11 U.S. companies on a trade mission to Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan from Dec. 3-11 to explore possible infrastructure projects.

Twenty-five ambassadors from countries such as Brazil, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Thailand called on congressional leaders to do so in a Nov. 20 letter. See the ambassadors\u2019 letter here: http://politico.pro/11SY3uY.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT:\n\n\u2014 Kazakhstan is close to being able to join the WTO, according to the organization\u2019s director-general, Roberto Azevedo, Reuters reports: http://reut.rs/1thgQGL.\n\n\u2014 Asia will continue to grow faster than other regions, an economist with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development told German news agency Deutsche Welle: http://bit.ly/1ts4DOs.\n\n\u2014 India\u2019s textile industry could grow five-fold in the next 10 years, The Ahmedabad Mirror reports: http://bit.ly/1recHrW.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

TPP will promote economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region, expanding demand for U.S. food and agricultural products among nearly half a billion consumers. The TPP also will strengthen trade rules and provide specific new market access commitments for U.S. exports.\n\nWithout the TPP Agreement, U.S. exports to Pacific Rim countries will be at a serious competitive disadvantage, and competitor countries \u2013 including other TPP nations and those such as the European Union that are negotiating free trade agreements with countries in the region \u2013 will leap at the opportunity to fill the void if the United States rejects the deal.\n\nThe United States needs to implement the TPP Agreement, which will significantly boost U.S. exports and create hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs. http://bit.ly/1U51u4F **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Singapore\u2019s demands complicate TPP.", "title": "Singapore\u2019s demands complicate TPP \u2014 U.S.-India statement wide-ranging \u2014 EU nods to TTIP secrecy concerns", "url": "http://www.politico.com/morningtrade/1114/morningtrade16261.html", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "keywords": "India", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Singapore\u2019s demands complicate TPP.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc618\"", "article_summary": "The United States needs to implement the TPP Agreement, which will significantly boost U.S. exports and create hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs.\nThe TPP also will strengthen trade rules and provide specific new market access commitments for U.S. exports.\nLast year, the United States exported $10.5 billion in wheat and wheat products, with Washington State leading all U.S. states with nearly $2.5 billion in wheat exports,\u201d it said: http://1.usa.gov/1pkZs7x.\nU.S., INDIA RELEASE WIDE-RANGING STATEMENT: The U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum had no immediate outcomes but did produce commitments to work together in contentious areas.\nWelcome to Morning Trade, where we will soon be exporting turkey from the oven and importing it into our stomachs."}
