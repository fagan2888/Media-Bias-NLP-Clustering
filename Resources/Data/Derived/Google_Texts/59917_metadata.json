It finds that the business case for employing workers age 50+ has grown even stronger in the last 10 years, reinforcing a 2005 AARP study that found that these experienced workers are highly motivated, productive and cost effective.\n\n\u201cLeading employers across all industries value the expertise and experience of workers 50+ and know that recruiting, retaining and engaging them will improve their business results,\u201d said AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins today in releasing the report.\n\n\u201cJust as today\u2019s 50+ population is disrupting aging and eroding negative stereotypes, today\u2019s 50+ workforce is adding value by exhibiting traits that are highly sought after in today\u2019s economy,\u201d Jenkins added.\n\nRoselyn Feinsod, senior partner at Aon Hewitt, said \u201cWorkers age 50+ are highly valuable within many organizations \u2013 particularly in those industries that require highly skilled workers or workers with unique skill sets, such as health care or energy.\u201d\n\nThe AARP report comes at a time when experienced workers are playing an increasing role in the workplace. In 2002, workers age 50+ made up 24.6 percent of the workforce. By 2012, they were 32.3 percent. And by 2022, they are projected to represent 35.4 percent of the total workforce.\n\nThe new study addresses the misconception that older workers cost \u201csignificantly more\u201d than younger workers. In fact, adding more age 50+ talent to a workforce \u201cresults in only minimal increases in\u2026labor costs,\u201d AARP found. For one thing, the report notes that 90 percent of large employers now base pay in part on performance, rather than exclusively on tenure.\n\nIn addition, in terms of retirement costs, only 22 percent of large companies now offer a defined benefit pension plan, down dramatically from the 68 percent in 2004.\n\nLooking at the 50+ segment of the workforce from a performance standpoint, AARP and Aon Hewitt report that older workers remain the most engaged age group. The study states that 65 percent of workers age 55+ are considered \u201cengaged\u201d, based on survey data, while younger employee engagement averages 58 to 60 percent.\n\nAlthough the generational differences in engagement might not seem large, \u201cit takes only a five percent increase in engagement to achieve three percent incremental revenue growth,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThat translates into a large company with $5 billion in revenue achieving a $150 million revenue increase as a result of even a five percent engagement improvement, the study says.\n\nThe report concludes \u201cAn engaged older workforce can influence and enhance organizational productivity and generate improved business outcomes.\u201d\n\nAARP commissioned the study to assess the advantages of both retaining and attracting older workers.The analysis relies primarily on data from Aon Hewitt databases, an extensive literature review and interviews with 18 large employers to obtain anecdotal information on how they approach older workers.\n\nThe Business Case study is the second major workforce-related report by AARP in the past several weeks. On March 30, the AARP Public Policy Institute released a landmark report showing that, despite recent economic gains, half of the people ages 45 to 70 who experienced unemployment during the past five years are not currently working. Among those who had become reemployed, nearly half said they were earning less than in their previous jobs.\n\n###\n\nABOUT AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
