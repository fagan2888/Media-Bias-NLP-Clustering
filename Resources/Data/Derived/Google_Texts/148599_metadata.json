The owner of Yellow Cab of Mobile and a pair of other transportation companies, Wilcox campaigned on making state laws more business-friendly and reforming homeowners insurance. She said she is looking forward to getting to work in House, which already is in session.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled. We\u2019ve got a large crowd here,\u201d she said. \u201cI am just tickled.\u201d\n\nCarr, whose professional background is in disaster relief management, recently finished a stint in the Governor\u2019s Office of Faith-Based & Volunteer Services helping victims of the 2011 Alabama tornadoes find housing. He said he wanted to offer a choice to voters who have had no Democratic alternative in recent elections.\n\n\u201cI think the main thing is I\u2019m extremely disappointed in the turnout,\u201d he said, referring to the fact that the special election drew only about 10 percent of the district\u2019s registered voters. \u201cIt just confirms to me that the people who should be voting are not voting. (The results) didn\u2019t look much different than the Republican primaries.\u201d\n\nWilcox fought a hotly contested primary battle against Susan Hightower, besting her by 70 votes out of 3,380 cast. In a district that supported Republican Mitt Romney by a nearly 3-1 margin in the 2012 presidential election, Wilcox said she urged supporters to guard against complacency for today\u2019s vote, which comes a week later than scheduled because of last week\u2019s winter storm.\n\nThe general election matchup was a financial mismatch. Including the primary rounds, Wilcox reported raising nearly $75,000 \u2013 including heavy contributions from political action committees \u2013 and spending more than $52,000.\n\nCarr, meanwhile, got no PAC money, raising just $2,551. Faced with a 29-1 fundraising disparity, Carr said he focused on running a grass-roots campaign. He said he would try to repeal the Alabama Accountability Act, which provides taxpayer money for students from \u201cfailing\u201d schools to attend private schools. He said he also favored accepting federal funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand Alabama\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nWilcox said she intends to have a ceremonial swearing-in Wednesday morning at 9 in Tillman\u2019s Conrer and then drive to Montgomery to take her official oath of office from House Speaker Mike Hubbard, R-Auburn. The district has not had representation since former Rep. Jim Barton resigned in August.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis district needs a vote right away,\u201d she said.\n\nAs currently constituted, District 104 stretches from the Dog River area and Interstate 65 in Mobile all the way to the Mississippi state line. By the time Wilcox runs for re-election in June, though, the district will be radically different thanks to redistricting.\n\nThe new District 104 will be more compact, with a western boundary of March Road between Old Pascagoula Road to the south and Ben Hamilton Road to the north.\n\nEven as she prepares to take off mid-session, Wilcox must turn one eye toward the 2014 elections. Wilcox already has qualified to run in the Republican primary in June. Carr said he is considering running again. The qualifying deadline is Friday.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Brendan Kirby", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "House District 104, Margie Wilcox, Stephen Carr, news", "title": "Margie Wilcox rolls to landslide win as House district in Mobile stays Republican", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Margie Wilcox rolls to landslide win as House district in Mobile stays Republican \", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/live/2014/02/margie_wilcox_rolls_to_landsli.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/wilcox-carr1jpg-46ebaa84c499a475.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12132695\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-05T02:03:41Z\", \"author\": \"Brendan Kirby\", \"tags\": [\"@river-mobile\",\"@river-state\",\"House District 104\",\"Margie Wilcox\",\"Stephen Carr\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/wilcox-carr1jpg-46ebaa84c499a475.jpg", "title": "Margie Wilcox rolls to landslide win as House district in Mobile stays Republican", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "According to complete but unofficial results, Margie Wilcox won 90.5 percent of the vote, carrying all 15 precincts and the absentee ballots.
