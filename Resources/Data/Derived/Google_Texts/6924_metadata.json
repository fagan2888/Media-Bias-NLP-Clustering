In 2012, there were nearly 50 million Medicare enrollees in the United States , and that number will continue to grow as the Baby Boomers march towards retirement.So while CMS continues to measure how much hospital cleanliness and physician interaction play into patient satisfaction, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in Princeton, NJ, looked at patient satisfaction a bit differently. They asked patients if they thought they had received the best care possible in the previous 12 months, and broke it down between those enrolled in managed care Medicare programs and those in fee-for-service programs.The following are the states (including the District of Columbia) that had the most \u2013 and fewest \u2013 Medicare beneficiaries rate their care as \u201cbest\u201d in the previous 12 months.
