Radio talk show host and author of Power Divided is Power Checked, Jason Lewis has been alluding to a new project he has been working on since he decided not to make a second run for political office. At long last, he has released details of this new project at www.galt.io.

So what is Galt.IO and what does he mean by “Go Galt without leaving home”? It seems to be Bitcoin meets Fundanything.com meets Facebook as a way for liberty minded people to “think globally, act locally.” Perhaps Jason Lewis can explain it better in the video below.

Will Galt.IO work to outmaneuver the progressives and their causes? Who knows, but I must say that I am intrigued. This experiment might be so crazy and so original, it might just work.
