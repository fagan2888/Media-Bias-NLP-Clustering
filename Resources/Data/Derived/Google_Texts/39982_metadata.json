But last month a New York Times Times editorial claimed that \u201cthe assertion by private businesses and their owners of an unprecedented right to impose the owners\u2019 religious views on workers who do not share them.\u201d\n\nWhat changed over the course of a year that now makes it a \u201cwar on contraceptives\u201d to oppose adding such coverage? As Ramesh Ponnuru explains, it\u2019s not really about contraceptives but an attack on religion:\n\nIf 2011 was marked by a widespread crisis of employers\u2019 imposing their views on contraception on employees, nobody talked about it. What\u2019s actually new here is the Obama administration\u2019s 2012 regulation requiring almost all employers to cover contraception, sterilization and drugs that may cause abortion. It issued that regulation under authority given in the Obamacare legislation. The regulation runs afoul of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a Clinton-era law.

The act further says that no later law should be read to trump this protection unless it explicitly says it\u2019s doing that. The Affordable Care Act has no such language.
