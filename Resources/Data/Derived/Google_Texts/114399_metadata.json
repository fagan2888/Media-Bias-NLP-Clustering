Examples include leveraging technology to more efficiently and effectively discharge patients and to coordinate care post-discharge, as well as the use of medical homes.\"\n\nHospitals Under Pressure\n\nUnfortunately, the ACA provision that calls for payment penalties has had the greatest effect on hospitals who serve some of the neediest patients. These hospitals are being unfairly penalized because the socio-demographic characteristics of the patients they serve mean it is more likely these impoverished patients will need readmission, notes Akin Demehin, senior associate director, policy, for the American Hospital Association.\n\nRecent data from CMS show that approximately 77% of hospitals serving the poorest patients incur a readmissions penalty. By contrast, only 36% of hospitals with the fewest poor patients will receive a penalty.\n\n\"Hospitals treating the poorest patients tend to get the stiffest penalties.\"\n\nauto image + link\n\n\"We certainly agree with the goal to address readmissions that should be prevented, but hospitals are concerned with the structure of the program,\" says Demehin. \"Your likelihood of being readmitted has to do a lot with factors the hospitals can't control. Sometimes communities where patients live don\u2019t have primary-care physicians, or patients have difficulties in getting medications. Hospitals treating the poorest patients tend to get the stiffest penalties.\"\n\nEven with those challenges, hospitals are stepping up their game.\n\n\"Planning patient discharge has become a real focus for hospitals,\" says Demehin. \"In terms of understanding what their risk of readmission might be, and which patients are at higher risk. Discharge planning has become something that\u2019s woven into the care plan.\"\n\nIn addition, hospitals have have amped up their patient-education efforts and formed better collaborative relationships with their healthcare partners, such as nursing homes and home health agencies. Efforts such as these have led to a \"pretty steady decrease in the national rate of readmission,\" he notes.\n\nNew Technology is Helping\n\nThe ACA hospital readmission penalties, coupled with the EHR Incentive \"meaningful use\" program and other initiatives, have led to a huge growth in technology designed to help providers address readmissions.\n\n\"From just a data-tracking standpoint, medical practices need to have good information from the hospital,\" says Palmer, adding that monitoring devices are just one example of a technology that has allowed physicians to make sure patients are receiving timely follow-up care. Because primary-care physicians are taking on more responsibility as care coordinators, much of the technology on the market is aimed at them, she adds.\n\nAnd while EHRs have helped care-coordination and data collection efforts, there is a growing market for business intelligence technology that helps healthcare organizations have a better understanding of risk factors.\n\n\"Once EHRs are in place, other enabling technology can leverage the rich data for the benefit of better patient care,\" says Sensor. \"Examples include data mining by diagnosis to improve the delivery of care and alerts for the provider that may indicate a need for clinical intervention.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Marisa Torrieri", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/d7/17/d7178407473210dce9e71dd8c7522662.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-it,healthcare-hospital-admin,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Health IT,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "What hospitals are doing to reduce readmissions in 2015", "pub_date": "dec 04, 2014", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-04T09:20:00", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Thursday, December 04, 2014, 09:20 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2024-11-21T09:20:00", "teaser": "<p>Readmissions&nbsp;waste&nbsp;at least $26 billion annually, and the pressure is on to reduce that number.&nbsp;</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2014-12-04", "sailthru.description": "Readmissions\u00a0waste\u00a0at least $26 billion annually, and the pressure is on to reduce that number.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Readmissions\u00a0waste\u00a0at least $26 billion annually, and the pressure is on to reduce that number.", "title": "What hospitals are doing to reduce readmissions in 2015", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/what-hospitals-are-doing-to-reduce-readmissions-in-2015/339720/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Dollarphotoclub_42007990.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/23/2e/232eb74fa1242361f48d5e9a0dea1f20.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ff5\"", "article_summary": "What hospitals are doing to reduce readmissions in 2015The New Year is weeks away but healthcare organizations have already resolved to strengthen their focus on reducing hospital readmissions, which waste at least $26 billion annually.\nThanks largely in part to Affordable Care Act's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, which requires CMS to reduce payments to hospitals with excess readmissions, hospitals and medical practices are feeling increased pressure to keep patients out of the ER after hospitalizations.\nRecent data from CMS show that approximately 77% of hospitals serving the poorest patients incur a readmissions penalty.\nHospitals Under PressureUnfortunately, the ACA provision that calls for payment penalties has had the greatest effect on hospitals who serve some of the neediest patients.\nauto image + link\"We certainly agree with the goal to address readmissions that should be prevented, but hospitals are concerned with the structure of the program,\" says Demehin."}
