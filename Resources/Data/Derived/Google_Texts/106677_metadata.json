While some Democrats hailed the findings as encouraging for reducing \u201cjob lock,\u201d the Comedy Central host criticized the Obama administration for its dull response to Republican attacks.\n\n\u201cNobody believed me when I said Obamacare was a job killer, and now it is,\u201d Colbert said Wednesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before they roll out the death panels and the elder catapults.\u201d\n\nBut have no fear, Obama supporters, Colbert told his audience. The president was prepared to unleash his \u201ceconomic nerd patrol\u201d to dispel all fears, namely Jason Furman, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who gave a dull and boring explanation of the CBO\u2019s findings \u2014 that lulled Colbert to sleep.\n\n\u201cSure, what Professor Lunesta said is technically true. Obamacare gives people healthcare options allowing them to work less if they choose. But what looks better on a bumber sticker?\u201d the Comedy Central host asked.\n\nHe then flashed to two options: One from the GOP slamming Obamacare for shrinking the work force, and another from Democrats giving a long-winded explanation as to why 2.3 million Americans no longer need to work.\n\nWhile some Republicans argued the CBO\u2019s findings showed a loss of 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) clarified that instead, 2.3 million Americans would choose not to work, as they have guaranteed healthcare.\n\nWatch Colbert\u2019s clip below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Stephen Colbert took a nice little nap during his Comedy Central show, \"The Colbert Report,\" on Wednesday night, lulled to sleep by the official who was supposed to serve as the Obama administration's point man against attacks regarding Obamacare's impact on the economy.", "title": "[WATCH] Stephen Colbert rips WH's lame response to 2 million less...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 504, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/01/Picture-22-504x400.png", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/02/06/watch-stephen-colbert-rips-whs-lame-response-to-2-million-less-workers-under-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "white-house-council-of-economic-advisers", "published_time": "2014-02-06T08:00:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T08:12:52+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2294\"", "article_summary": "But what looks better on a bumber sticker?\u201d the Comedy Central host asked.\nWhile some Republicans argued the CBO\u2019s findings showed a loss of 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, Rep.
