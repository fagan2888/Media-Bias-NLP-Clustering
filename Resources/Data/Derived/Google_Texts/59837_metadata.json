On average, the brains of autistic people experienced a 42 percent increase in capacity to generate \u201cinformation,\u201d according to lead investigator Dr. Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Gal\u00e1n. \"Our results suggest that autistic children are not interested in social interactions because their brains generate more information at rest, which we interpret as more introspection in line with early descriptions of the disorder,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe study follows Galan\u2019s previous work finding connectivity differences in the brains of autistic children, asserting how those differences account for the increased complexity of the autistic brain. The investigators analyzed patterns found after recording the brain activity of autistic children using magnetoencephalography.\n\nThe investigators also measured the brain\u2019s functional connectivity among regions, allowing them to actually measure a child\u2019s \u201cintrospection level,\u201d according to Dr. Jos\u00e9 L. P\u00e9rez Vel\u00e1zquez, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Toronto who worked on the study. \"This is a novel interpretation because it is a different attempt to understand the children's cognition by analyzing their brain activity,\" he said in the statement. \u201cMeasuring cognitive processes is not trivial; yet, our findings indicate that this can be done to some extent with well-established mathematical tools from physics and engineering.\"\n\nThe work supports the \u201cIntense World Theory\u201d of autism proposed by neuroscientists as the Brain Mind Institute in Switzerland. They describe the neurological disorder as a \u201chyper-functioning\u201d of brain circuitry leading to a state of over-arousal.\n\nIn December, the research team published a paper describing the first part of this overall work, wherein they found a difference in connectivity between the autistic and neurotypical brains. \"We propose that the excessive production of information in the absence of relevant sensory stimuli or attention to external cues underlies the cognitive differences between individuals with and without autism,\" the investigators wrote. \"We conclude that the information gain in the brain's resting state provides quantitative evidence for perhaps the most typical characteristic in autism: withdrawal into one's inner world.\"\n\nSource: Velazquez, Jose L.
