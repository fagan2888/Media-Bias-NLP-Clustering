George Balteria, CEO of Quote Selection Insurance Services states, "Anyone can go to the Covered California website on their own and spend hours trying to learn and figure everything out. It's another to use a licensed professional who has done this hundreds of times in a face-to-face environment, someone who can truly help people decide which options meet their needs, budget and lifestyle. In addition, it is a huge benefit to have someone available at an office who can assist with future questions or concerns.‚Äù

Certified personnel at the Enrollment Centers are fully committed to providing individuals enrolling in Covered California a painless, easy, and fun experience.
