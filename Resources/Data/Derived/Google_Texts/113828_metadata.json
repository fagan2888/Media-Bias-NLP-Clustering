It will be held in the United States from June 3-26 - the first time outside South America - and feature 10 teams from South America, as well as six from the CONCACAF region.\n\nU.S. federal prosecutors alleged a company formed to buy the Centennial Copa America\u2019s marketing rights agreed to pay $110 million in bribes to South American soccer officials.\n\nThe last three presidents of soccer\u2019s governing bodies for South America and the CONCACAF region have been indicted, including former CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb, who agreed to plead guilty. The corruption probe led FIFA President Sepp Blatter to announce his resignation last spring, just days after he was elected to a fifth term. His successor is due to be chosen Friday by a special FIFA Congress.\n\nFollowing the initial indictments in May, the U.S. Soccer Federation refused to host the tournament until the previous business agreements were terminated.\n\nMessi, a five-time world player of the year, has already committed to playing in the tournament and organizers also hope it will include top stars such as Brazil\u2019s Neymar, Uruguay\u2019s Luis Suarez and Chile\u2019s Alexis Sanchez.\n\nThe Americans meet Colombia in the tournament opener on June 3 at Santa Clara - a match that carries historical significance.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, the two teams played in California during the group stage of the 1994 World Cup, a match won by the U.S. 2-1. The result led 10 days later to the murder of Andres Escobar, a 27-year-old Colombian defender who had deflected a pass from John Harkes into his net for an own goal.\n\n\u201cOne of the toughest groups because of the history of all the teams involved,\u201d Colombia coach Jose Pekerman said.\n\nColombia went 3-0 in its group at the 2014 World Cup and was knocked out by Brazil in the quarterfinals. Ranked eighth in the world, Colombia has a player pool that includes stars James Rodriguez and Jackson Martinez.\n\n\u201cWe know we start right on our toes with the opening whistle in Santa Clara,\u201d U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lionel Messi and his Argentina squad have been drawn against defending champion Chile in the group stage of this year's Centennial Copa America tournament in a rematch of last year's final that gave the Chileans their first major tournament title.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Lionel Messi and his Argentina squad have been drawn against defending champion Chile in the group stage of this year\u2019s Centennial Copa America tournament in a rematch of last year\u2019s final that gave the Chileans their first major tournament title.", "title": "Argentina faces Chile in Copa America in rematch of final", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/21/argentina-grouped-with-chile-in-copa-america-draw/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/21/copa_america_draw_soccer.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/21/copa_america_draw_soccer.jpeg", "description": "Lionel Messi and his Argentina squad have been drawn against defending champion Chile in the group stage of this year's Centennial Copa America tournament in a rematch of last year's final that gave t", "card": "summary", "title": "Argentina faces Chile in Copa America in rematch of final"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c4b\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK (AP) - Lionel Messi and his Argentina squad have been drawn against defending champion Chile in the group stage of this year\u2019s Centennial Copa America tournament in a rematch of last year\u2019s final that gave the Chileans their first major tournament title.\nIt will be held in the United States from June 3-26 - the first time outside South America - and feature 10 teams from South America, as well as six from the CONCACAF region.\nRanked eighth in the world, Colombia has a player pool that includes stars James Rodriguez and Jackson Martinez.\n\u201cOne of the toughest groups because of the history of all the teams involved,\u201d Colombia coach Jose Pekerman said.\nThe last three presidents of soccer\u2019s governing bodies for South America and the CONCACAF region have been indicted, including former CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb, who agreed to plead guilty."}
