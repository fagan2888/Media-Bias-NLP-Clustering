A Trump aide with knowledge of the call said the conversation was arranged days ago with the goal of resolving the current rift between the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and Ryan.\n\nThe real-estate developer and TV personality expected to focus the call on policy areas where he and Ryan are in agreement, but he has no plans to make significant changes to his policy platform, according to the Trump aide.\n\nA spokesman for Ryan\u2019s political team, Zack Roday, confirmed the call was scheduled for Wednesday night. A person familiar with the call confirmed it took place, saying it was a good conversation and there was no talk of endorsements.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the call tonight is for the two of them to continue their conversation about unifying the party. We never gave any indication that the call was about an endorsement,\u201d Roday told Bloomberg.\n\nNo Decision\n\nThe standoff has turned into a significant complication for both Trump, who is trying to consolidate the party after a bruising primary, and for Ryan, who\u2019s under pressure from both opponents and supporters of the combative candidate.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Ryan responded to reports that he had begun telling confidants he is ready to end his standoff with Trump, saying that he has not decided yet whether to endorse Trump.\n\n\u201cI have not made a decision,\u201d the House speaker told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re still having productive conversations.\u201d\n\nThe conflict began in early May when the speaker announced he was not yet ready to back Trump, a decision that Ryan now worries is exacerbating his party\u2019s divisions, said two people close to the lawmaker.\n\nTrump campaign manager Paul Manafort also told a small group of lawmakers last Thursday that he expects an endorsement from Ryan as early as this week, according to two people in the meeting.\n\nManafort told the gathering last week that Ryan\u2019s backing would put added pressure on the party\u2019s remaining holdouts to fall in line and endorse Trump. It would also link the speaker more directly to the candidate, marking a significant break for a man who ran on a presidential ticket in 2012 with Mitt Romney\u2014by far Trump\u2019s loudest critic inside the party.\n\n\u2018Good Conversations\u2019\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryan said he is still hearing input and suggestions from all sides.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we actually discuss the principles that we all share in common and the policies that come from them. And get a good understanding on bills,\u201d he said. \u201cOur staffs talk virtually every day. We\u2019re having good conversations.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore folks are getting with him as well\u2014other members of Congress\u2014and that\u2019s all that you need to do to begin to get on the same page,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan has said that he doesn\u2019t want a \u201cfake unification,\u201d but the pair remain far apart on several significant policy issues, particularly free trade and immigration.\n\n\u201cThere are clearly going to be policy disputes between Republicans,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday. \u201cThe point is can we operate off the common principles.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes over the past two weeks, Ryan and Trump aides have held a series of meetings on policy issues that could clear the way for Ryan\u2019s endorsement.\n\nRyan\u2019s chief of staff, David Hoppe, has been either attending or closely monitoring meetings away from Capitol Hill with Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide who used to work for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, according to a person familiar with the meetings. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump.\n\nThe meetings have not yet involved other Republican congressional leadership offices. They are described by the person as a significant exchange of ideas, not just on broad political principles, but on individual issues and specific legislation.\n\nPolicy Rollout\n\nRyan said House Republicans will proceed next month with their plans to unveil a policy agenda for the coming year, which will include recommendations from six task forces.\n\n\u201cNow, we\u2019re ready to start releasing them,\u201d Ryan said, noting that the first one, on poverty, should come out in early June. \u201cThis is an agenda for the next president.\u201d\n\nRyan was asked about a Republican health-care bill that was announced this week by Rules Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas, which does not completely repeal Obamacare.\n\nRyan said he did not know details, and that \u201cthere are a lot of bills out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point is, everybody should feel free to offer their ideas. That\u2019s Congress. You\u2019ll see our vision for repealing and replacing Obamacare as part of our agenda project in June when we roll it out,\u201d said Ryan.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael C Bender,Jennifer Jacobs,Billy House", "description": "The pair of Republican\u00a0leaders try to break a weeks-long impasse\u00a0over\u00a0an endorsement.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQAeUCM0ETxI/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The pair of Republican\u00a0leaders try to break a weeks-long impasse\u00a0over\u00a0an endorsement.", "title": "Trump, Ryan Speak by Phone Amid Endorsement Impasse", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-25/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-to-speak-by-phone-tonight", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQAeUCM0ETxI/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The pair of Republican\u00a0leaders try to break a weeks-long impasse\u00a0over\u00a0an endorsement.", "title": "Trump, Ryan Speak by Phone Amid Endorsement Impasse", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-25/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-to-speak-by-phone-tonight", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQAeUCM0ETxI/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "The pair of Republican\u00a0leaders try to break a weeks-long impasse\u00a0over\u00a0an endorsement."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Trump, Ryan Speak by Phone Amid Endorsement Impasse", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "O7R0VE6TTDSK01", "parsely-author": "Billy House", "date": "2016-05-25T19:59:38.441Z", "keywords": "Donald John Trump,Donald Trump", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Donald John Trump,Donald Trump", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-25T19:59:38.441Z", "parsely-tags": "Donald John Trump,Donald Trump,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-25/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-to-speak-by-phone-tonight"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf041\"", "article_summary": "Donald Trump and Paul Ryan spoke by telephone on Wednesday night, as the pair of Republican leaders try to break a weeks-long impasse over an endorsement.\nTwo members of Trump\u2019s team told Bloomberg that they believe a formal endorsement from Ryan, the U.S. House speaker, is imminent.\n\u201cI have not made a decision,\u201d the House speaker told reporters.\nRyan has said that he doesn\u2019t want a \u201cfake unification,\u201d but the pair remain far apart on several significant policy issues, particularly free trade and immigration.\nEarlier Wednesday, Ryan responded to reports that he had begun telling confidants he is ready to end his standoff with Trump, saying that he has not decided yet whether to endorse Trump."}
