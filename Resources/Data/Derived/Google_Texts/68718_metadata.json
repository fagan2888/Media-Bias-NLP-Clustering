It doesn\u2019t say it would be a good idea,\u201d said Bill Glahn, an independent energy analyst for Piedmont Consulting and an energy official in the administration of former Gov. Tim Pawlenty. \u201cIt just said that given enough time and money, it\u2019s technically feasible. I could have told you that.\u201d\n\nCritics say the state got it backwards, generating a technical report at ratepayers\u2019 expense for an energy policy that doesn\u2019t yet exist and may not be economically feasible.\n\n\u201cThey should be asking whether it\u2019s a good idea before they spend money on figuring out how to get it done,\u201d said Glahn. \u201cAnd with consumers and employers in the state already trying to figure out how they\u2019re going to pay their energy bills, even the study money could have been better used elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTo reach higher levels of renewable energy on the power grid, investment would need to increase exponentially. The report estimates a cost of more than $2.5 billion to upgrade transmission systems to accommodate a 50 percent renewable energy mandate in Minnesota.\n\n\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A report released by the Minnesota Commerce Department lays the groundwork to increase the state's renewable energy mandates from 30 to 40 percent by 2030.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A report released by the Minnesota Commerce Department lays the groundwork to increase the state's renewable energy mandates from 30 to 40 percent by 2030.", "title": "Minnesota Wind-Solar Mandate Would Mean Costly Grid Upgrade", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericasfive034032.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-12T17:04:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/14e4NnO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A report released by the Minnesota Commerce Department lays the groundwork to increase the state's renewable energy mandates from 30 to 40 percent by 2030.", "title": "Minnesota Wind-Solar Mandate Would Mean Costly Grid Upgrade", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericasfive034032.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "wind", "published_time": "2014-11-13T03:01:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-12T17:04:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Minnesota, wind, solar, energy, energy mandate"}, "article_summary": "The report estimates a cost of more than $2.5 billion to upgrade transmission systems to accommodate a 50 percent renewable energy mandate in Minnesota.\nA new report released by the Minnesota Commerce Department lays the technical groundwork for ramping up one of the nation\u2019s highest state renewable energy mandates from 30 to 40 percent by 2030.\nOne technicality left out of the $750,000 study underwritten by Minnesota utility ratepayers: Who pays for what in a potentially massive upgrade of high-voltage transmission lines from the Dakotas to Indiana.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say it would be cost effective to upgrade the system to accommodate 40 percent renewables.\nA search of the 178-page report shows the authors never mention ratepayers, leaving unanswered whether spending nearly $400 million to upgrade the grid would be a good investment for Minnesota consumers and employers."}
