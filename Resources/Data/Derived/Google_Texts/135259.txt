Iowa’s Medicaid director has resigned to take a position at the University of Iowa.

A Tuesday release from the Iowa Department of Human Services said Jennifer Vermeer’s resignation is effective August 21.

Vermeer, who has been in her position since 2008, will move on to serve as the assistant vice president of medical affairs with University of Iowa Health Care.

While in her position with the Iowa Department of Human Services, Vermeer initiated team-based approaches to patient-centered care, secured a federal grant to develop new payment and service delivery models and implemented Affordable Care Act requirements, the release said.

The release said Iowa Medicaid’s program integrity efforts have saved about $120 million in taxpayer funds over the last four years.

Julie Lovelady, Iowa Medicaid Deputy Director, has been appointed interim director and a national search is underway to fill Vermeer’s position.

Vermeer will begin her new position at UI Health Care on August 25, with an annual salary of $210,000.
