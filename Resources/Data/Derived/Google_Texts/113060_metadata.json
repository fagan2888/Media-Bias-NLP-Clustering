You\u2019d feel pretty bad. Correspondingly, you\u2019d probably feel a lot better if and when you finally stopped. What would that improvement in your condition tell you?\n\nIt certainly wouldn\u2019t imply that hitting yourself in the head was a good idea. It would, however, be an indication that the pain you were experiencing wasn\u2019t a reflection of anything fundamentally wrong with your health. Your head wasn\u2019t hurting because you were sick; it was hurting because you kept hitting it with that baseball bat.\n\nAnd now you understand the basics of what has been happening to several major economies, including the United States, over the past few years. In fact, you understand these basics better than many politicians and commentators.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a tale from overseas: austerity policy in Britain. As you may know, back in 2010 Britain\u2019s newly installed Conservative government declared that a sharp reduction in budget deficits was needed to keep Britain from turning into Greece. Over the next two years growth in the British economy, which had been recovering fairly well from the financial crisis, more or less stalled. In 2013, however, growth picked up again \u2014 and the British government claimed vindication for its policies. Was this claim justified?\n\nNo, not at all. What actually happened was that the Tories stopped tightening the screws \u2014 they didn\u2019t reverse the austerity that had already occurred, but they effectively put a hold on further cuts. So they stopped hitting Britain in the head with that baseball bat. And sure enough, the nation started feeling better.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo claim that this bounceback vindicated austerity is silly. As Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University likes to point out, if rapid growth after a gratuitous slump counts as success, the government should just close down half the economy for a year; the next year\u2019s growth would be fantastic. Or as I\u2019d put it, you shouldn\u2019t conclude that hitting yourself in the head is smart because it feels so good when you stop. Unfortunately, the silliness of the claim hasn\u2019t prevented its widespread acceptance by what Mr. Wren-Lewis calls \u201cmediamacro.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, back in America we haven\u2019t had an official, declared policy of fiscal austerity \u2014 but we\u2019ve nonetheless had plenty of austerity in practice, thanks to the federal sequester and sharp cuts by state and local governments. The good news is that we, too, seem to have stopped tightening the screws: Public spending isn\u2019t surging, but at least it has stopped falling. And the economy is doing much better as a result. We are finally starting to see the kind of growth, in employment and G.D.P., that we should have been seeing all along \u2014 and the public\u2019s mood is rapidly improving.\n\nWhat\u2019s the important lesson from this late Obama bounce? Mainly, I\u2019d suggest, that everything you\u2019ve heard about President Obama\u2019s economic policies is wrong.\n\nYou know the spiel: that the U.S. economy is ailing because Obamacare is a job-killer and the president is a redistributionist, that Mr. Obama\u2019s anti-business speeches (he hasn\u2019t actually made any, but never mind) have hurt entrepreneurs\u2019 feelings, inducing them to take their marbles and go home.\n\nThis story line never made much sense. The truth is that the private sector has done surprisingly well under Mr. Obama, adding 6.7 million jobs since he took office, compared with just 3.1 million at this point under President George W. Bush. Corporate profits have soared, as have stock prices. What held us back was unprecedented public-sector austerity: At this point in the Bush years, government employment was up by 1.2 million, but under Mr. Obama it\u2019s down by 600,000. Sure enough, now that this de facto austerity is easing, the economy is perking up.\n\nAnd what this bounce tells you is that the alleged faults of Obamanomics had nothing to do with the pain we were feeling. We weren\u2019t hurting because we were sick; we were hurting because we kept hitting ourselves with that baseball bat, and we\u2019re feeling a lot better now that we\u2019ve stopped.\n\nWill this improvement in our condition continue? Britain\u2019s government has declared its intention to pick up the baseball bat again \u2014 to engage in further austerity, which does not bode well. But here the picture looks brighter. Households are in much better financial shape than they were a few years ago; there\u2019s probably still a lot of pent-up demand, especially for housing. And falling oil prices will be good for most of the country, although some regions \u2014 especially Texas \u2014 may take a hit.\n\nSo I\u2019m fairly optimistic about 2015, and probably beyond, as long as we avoid any more self-inflicted damage. Let\u2019s just leave that baseball bat lying on the ground, O.K.?", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141228202618, "twitter": {"description": "So much for that story line about the president being a job-killer.", "title": "The Obama Recovery", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/opinion/paul-krugman-the-obama-recovery.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003421287"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "PaulKrugman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/opinion/paul-krugman-the-obama-recovery.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003421287", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/opinion/paul-krugman-the-obama-recovery.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 28, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Great Britain,United States Economy,Economic Conditions and Trends,Labor and Jobs,United States Politics and Government,Obama  Barack,United States", "CN": "paul-krugman", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "So much for that story line about the president being a job-killer.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "description": "So much for that story line about the president being a job-killer.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 28, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-12-29", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2014-12-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "29krugman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141229121924, "hdl_p": "The Obama Recovery", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/opinion/paul-krugman-the-obama-recovery.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "So much for that story line about the president being a job-killer.", "title": "The Obama Recovery"}, "pdate": 20141228, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003421287, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Obama Recovery", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1730\"", "article_summary": "Your head wasn\u2019t hurting because you were sick; it was hurting because you kept hitting it with that baseball bat.\nLet\u2019s just leave that baseball bat lying on the ground, O.K.\nSuppose that for some reason you decided to start hitting yourself in the head, repeatedly, with a baseball bat.\nSo they stopped hitting Britain in the head with that baseball bat.\nBritain\u2019s government has declared its intention to pick up the baseball bat again \u2014 to engage in further austerity, which does not bode well."}
