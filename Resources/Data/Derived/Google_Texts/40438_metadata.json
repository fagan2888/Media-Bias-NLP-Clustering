Holloway was working at the time as a bicycle technician at Eastern Mountain Sports, but had been thinking about striking out with a business of his own. The two men began working on a deal for Holloway to buy the bike shop.\n\nThree years later, Henry\u2019s Bikes, the Newark, Del., store that Holloway purchased is doing so well that it\u2019s about to move to a larger location.\n\nHolloway\u2019s not the only one tapping his inner entrepreneur with a small business purchase. After several years of sluggish sales following the recession, the market for buying and selling small businesses is finally making a comeback.\n\nIn the third quarter of this year, small business transactions jumped 42 percent over the same period in the previous quarter, to reach nearly 1,700 closed transactions, according to a report by online business-for-sale marketplace BizBuySell. Sales of restaurant and retail businesses led the way, with transaction growth of 11- percent and 61 percent respectively.\n\nRELATED: HR: BIG SAVINGS FOR SMALL BUSINESS\n\nBy comparison, the site saw just over 1,000 transactions in the fourth quarter of 2009.\n\n\u201cAs the economy continues to improve, consumer confidence increases, and small businesses continue to gain in market share, you\u2019re going to see more businesses looking to sell,\u201d says Brian Miller, COO of AdviCoach, a national business coaching company. \u201cThe best time to sell is when a business is doing well.\u201d\n\nHere are four reasons the small business marketplace is thriving:\n\n1) Prices are good. The median sale price for a small business was up 3 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter to show gains.\n\n\u201cDuring the downturn a lot of potential sellers paused because their business\u2019 valuations were down,\u201d says Andy Cagnetta, CEO of brokerage firm Transworld. \u201cNow that earnings have picked back up, they feel like there\u2019s an opportunity to sell again.\u201d That\u2019s especially good news for business owners who have been wanting to move on from their company for several years now.\n\nEven with recent growth, valuations aren\u2019t quite up to their pre-recession peaks, which means that buyers also feel like they\u2019re getting a good price, especially for businesses that are poised for future growth.\n\nRELATED: MEET AMERICA\u2019S NEW SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS: EX-CONS\n\n2) Baby Boomers are in transition. The trend also reflects broader demographic shifts in the country. As a growing number of Baby Boomer leave their 9-to-5 jobs in corporate America, many are looking for a \u201csecond act\u201d that works with their lifestyle, provides some income, and also offers flexibility. In 1996, just 14 percent of new entrepreneurs were age 55 to 64; last year they made up 23.4 percent of all new entrepreneurs, according to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.\n\nExperts say that Boomers also represent a growing portion of business sellers as well. Long-time business owners who are ready to retire from the business they\u2019ve run for decades see today\u2019s market as a good time to make an exit.\n\nSuch was the case with Levine Communications Office, a Los Angeles-based PR firm sold by founder Michael Levine in April. \u201cThe firm has a great track record, and a great reputation, but Michael was ready to move on and do something different,\u201d says David T. Fagan, CEO of Icon Builder Media, who purchased LCO in April. \u201cWe met weekly for six months before we settled on a deal.\u201d\n\n3) Banks are starting to lend again. During the throes of the economic downturn, it was difficult to get banks to even talk about small business loans. Even though credit is still tight, qualified buyers are finding loans. In fiscal year 2013, which ended in September for the federal government, the Small Business Administration backed 54,106 loans, up slightly from the previous fiscal year. Small business lending rose 16 percent in September, year-over-year, according to the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index, reflecting a continued upward trend.\n\nDetermined business buyers are also finding other ways to get cash to bankroll a deal. Holloway used a home equity loan to purchase his bike shop; and the LCO deal was done with seller financing.\n\n4) Private equity is getting into smaller deals. Small businesses with EBITA (annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) that exceed $2 million may be able to do something that hasn\u2019t done in the past: find a private equity buyer. As returns in stocks and bonds start to look risky, private money is increasingly eyeing smaller deals that promise a better return.\n\n\u201cIf you can attract private equity, it\u2019s a uniquely good time to sell,\u201d says Doug Tatum, the Wright Travel Chair of Entrepreneurship at Middle Tennessee State University and an officer at the Association for Corporate Growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money there chasing fewer deals, and they\u2019re coming downhill and looking at smaller companies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After several years of sluggish sales following the recession, the market for buying and selling small businesses is finally making a comeback.", "title": "4 Reasons Sales of Small Businesses Are Booming", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/06/4-Reasons-Sales-Small-Businesses-Are-Booming", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102012_Small_Business_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/06/4-Reasons-Sales-Small-Businesses-Are-Booming", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102012_Small_Business_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After several years of sluggish sales following the recession, the market for buying and selling small businesses is finally making a comeback.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb03f\"", "article_summary": "Small business lending rose 16 percent in September, year-over-year, according to the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index, reflecting a continued upward trend.\nAfter several years of sluggish sales following the recession, the market for buying and selling small businesses is finally making a comeback.\nDuring the throes of the economic downturn, it was difficult to get banks to even talk about small business loans.\nHolloway\u2019s not the only one tapping his inner entrepreneur with a small business purchase.\n\u201cThe best time to sell is when a business is doing well.\u201dHere are four reasons the small business marketplace is thriving:1) Prices are good."}
