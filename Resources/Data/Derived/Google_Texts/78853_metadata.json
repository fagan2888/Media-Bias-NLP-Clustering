Some of the leaders in the industry are Microchip Technology Inc., a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, who announced its partnership with Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. (SiS) to provide customers with complete projected-capacitive touch (PCAP) and 3D-gesture interface modules, which will lead to faster development and lower costs.\n\n\u201cThe modules will make it easier to design multi-touch and 3D gesture displays with Microchip\u2019s award-winning GestIC\u00ae technology, which offers a hand tracking range of up to 20 centimeters (cm) from the display surface. Hand gestures are universal, hygienic and easy to learn. In addition, they enhance safety by reducing the need for precise hand-eye coordination,\u201d the press release notes.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be partnering with SiS, in order to meet the growing demand for 3D control displays in the consumer, automotive, home-automation and IoT markets,\u201d said Dr. Roland Aubauer, director of Microchip\u2019s Human-Machine Interface Division. \u201cMicrochip is committed to furthering the innovation in human-interface technologies, and SiS\u2019s modules will ultimately allow our customers to integrate these two interface technologies into their applications faster. With this partnership, the next dimension of intuitive, gesture-based user interfaces is now available for a broad range of end products.\u201d\n\n\u201cSiS is honored to have the opportunity to partner with a world-class company such as Microchip,\u201d said Jonathan Shyi, president of SiS. \u201cWe are thrilled to have the ability to introduce the very first 2D/3D combination solution to the world. By partnering with Microchip, we foresee a huge increase in demand and market share for these new products. We are committed to continually introducing innovative, intuitive and creative technology to the world, and this partnership is a prime example.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Microchip\u2019s GestIC technology products, visit http://www.microchip.com/GestIC-010516a.\n\nSiS modules with Microchip\u2019s GestIC technology was demonstrated at Microchip\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas last week.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/human-microchip-updates-gesture-display-and-hand-tracking-ranges-in-new-tech-13691/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/microchip-in-hands-xray.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "Human microchip updates: gesture display and hand tracking ranges in new tech"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SiS modules with Microchip\u2019s GestIC technology was demonstrated at Microchip\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas last week.\n\u201cThe modules will make it easier to design multi-touch and 3D gesture displays with Microchip\u2019s award-winning GestIC\u00ae technology, which offers a hand tracking range of up to 20 centimeters (cm) from the display surface.\nWe are committed to continually introducing innovative, intuitive and creative technology to the world, and this partnership is a prime example.\u201dTo learn more about Microchip\u2019s GestIC technology products, visit http://www.microchip.com/GestIC-010516a.\nHumans getting a microchip is a sensitive topic, but continues to move forward with amazing advancements in new technology.\n\u201cMicrochip is committed to furthering the innovation in human-interface technologies, and SiS\u2019s modules will ultimately allow our customers to integrate these two interface technologies into their applications faster."}
