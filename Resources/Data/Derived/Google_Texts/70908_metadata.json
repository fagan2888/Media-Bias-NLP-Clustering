The Youth Olympic Games are a creation of the International Olympic Committee, and the opening ceremony took place at the ski jump where the opening ceremony of the 1994 Olympics was held.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty amazing experience,\u201d said Radamus, a product of Ski & Snowboard Club Vail. \u201cWhen the torch was lit and the fireworks started going off, it really hit me where I was. And, regardless of the result, the sort of experience I was about to have.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Radamus won the gold medal in super-G. The day after that, he won the super combined (super-G and slalom). Three days later he won the giant slalom.\n\nThe IOC created the Youth Olympics in 2010 for athletes 14 to 18 years old. The first Winter Youth Olympics were held four years ago in Innsbruck, Austria, where Olympics were held in 1964 and 1976. There have been two Summer Youth Olympic Games (Singapore in 2010 and China in 2014).\n\nThe world junior championships have long been an important proving ground for young ski racers, but the Youth Olympics are a bigger event because they take in athletes from other winter sports.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere is completely different,\u201d Radamus said in a telephone interview. \u201cBecause it\u2019s probably the biggest event that most of these athletes have ever attended, the energy is a lot different. The people are all anxious an excited and nervous, just having a lot of fun here.\u201d\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway, age 12, lit the Olympic caldron at the opening ceremony. The ski races took place on the slope at Hafjell where Picabo Street and Diann Roffe-Steinrotter won medals at the 1994 Olympics.\n\nRadamus\u2019 parents are ski coaches. His father, Aldo, has been the executive director of Ski Club Vail since 2002. Before that he was director of development for the U.S. Ski Team, a U.S. team coach and the head alpine coach at the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club. River\u2019s mother, Sara, has been a coach since the 1980s and conducts annual summer camps in Whistler, British Columbia.\n\n\u201cHe literally grew up on the side of the mountain,\u201d Ski Club Vail alpine director Karen Ghent said of River. \u201cHe was skiing summer and winter from a young age, and he was exposed to some really good skiing at a very young age because of his mom and dad. Skiing is really second-nature to the kid.\u201d\n\nAldo declined to be interviewed, preferring for the focus to be on his son, but River acknowledges the debt he owes his parents.\n\n\u201cAldo is really a legend in U.S. ski racing development history,\u201d River said. \u201cHe\u2019s been integral in so many parts of how we develop athletes in this country, and he\u2019s been an integral part of the athletes that have been developed.\u201d\n\nRiver had other advantages: The men\u2019s World Cup visits Beaver Creek annually, and Ski Club Vail racers get to work on \u201cslip crews\u201d who side-slip the course periodically during races to keep the track clear of loose snow. He\u2019s been around the world\u2019s best racers and got to fore-run two races at the world championships last February.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very dedicated ski racer,\u201d Ghent said. \u201cHe is as knowledgeable as they come in understanding the sport, understanding what makes someone fast, understanding the equipment. He is as mature as he can be, beyond his years. He\u2019s among the best in the world at his age for sure.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s poised too. After winning the super-G by 0.03 of a second and winning the super-G portion of the combined by 0.89 of a second, things got a little dicey on the slalom portion of the combined. Cross blocking a gate, he lost his grip on one of his poles.\n\nNegotiating fast-approaching slalom gates, he made several attempts to grab the pole while cross-blocking gates with his open hand.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit of a mess,\u201d Radamus said. \u201cI was not panicking but knew I had to do something fast, because as big a margin as nine-tenths is, I knew I was not holding on to that very well. I kept frantically grabbing at the pole. Finally I grabbed the tip of the pole with my other hand and forced it back into my grip, just in time for the last four gates. I pinned it through there and dove for the finish line.\u201d\n\nAnd won the race by 0.03 of a second. That was last Sunday. Wednesday he won the GS by a more than a second, a substantial margin.\n\nHe failed in his attempt for a clean sweep Friday, failing to finish the slalom, but Lillehammer marked a major breakthrough for a young racer with Olympic aspirations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve become good at, and I wouldn\u2019t rather do anything else on a daily basis,\u201d Radamus said. \u201cI would love to make ski racing a career and continue doing this thing I love for as long as I possibly can. After this week I\u2019ve had in the Youth Olympic Games, it\u2019s definitely a dream to be able to compete in the real one one day.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Vail skier River Radamus claimed three gold medals at the Youth Olympic Games", "title": "Vail skier River Radamus claimed three gold medals at the Youth Olympic Games", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/vail-skier-river-radamus-claimed-three-gold-medals-at-the-youth-olympic-games/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__BN20160221_Z00_BNSP21OLYSKIp1.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__BN20160221_Z00_BNSP21OLYSKIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T17:14:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T04:05:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe literally grew up on the side of the mountain,\u201d Ski Club Vail alpine director Karen Ghent said of River.\nRadamus, an alpine racer from Vail, turned 18 the day the Youth Olympic Games began Feb. 12 in Lillehammer, Norway.\nAnd, regardless of the result, the sort of experience I was about to have.\u201dThe next day, Radamus won the gold medal in super-G.\nThere have been two Summer Youth Olympic Games (Singapore in 2010 and China in 2014).\nThe first Winter Youth Olympics were held four years ago in Innsbruck, Austria, where Olympics were held in 1964 and 1976."}
