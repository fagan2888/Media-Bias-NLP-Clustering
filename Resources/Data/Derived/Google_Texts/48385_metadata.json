Philippe Chancel \u2026\n\nThe genesis of Mr. Othoniel's work, titled 'Beautiful Dances,' dates to 2011, when the artist was invited by landscape architect Louis Benech to collaborate on a proposal for a Versailles-sponsored competition to reimagine the Water Theater Grove. Pictured, a watercolor sketch of the fountain sculptures Jean-Michel Othoniel \u2026\n\nThe arabesque forms of Mr. Othoniel's fountain sculptures were inspired by notations in Raoul-Auger Feuillet's 1701 book, 'The Art of Expressing Dance Through Demonstrative Characters, Figures and Signs,' which Louis XIV used to study Baroque dances. Shown here are notations for the dance: 'The Entrance of Apollo.'

Philippe Chancel \u2026\n\n'Beautiful Dances' is linked to the past through its materials and manufacture. Mr. Othoniel partnered with a traditional glassblowing workshop in Murano\u2014Venice's island of glass artisans\u2014to create four blue orbs that will mark the locations of fountains in Le N\u00f4tre's original garden design.\n\nPictured, Mr. Othoniel working with glassblowers in Basel on one of the nearly 2,000 gilded glass beads that make up 'Beautiful Dances.'
