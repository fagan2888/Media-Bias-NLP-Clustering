(RELATED: Doctors Begin to Refuse Obamacare Patients)\n\nJeff Anderson, the executive director of the 2017 Project, which advocates replacing Obamacare with conservative solutions, forcefully asserted that, \u201cHealth care is not a right; it is a good.\u201d Yet he also acknowledged that, \u201cthe surest way to NOT repeal Obamacare would be to disrupt health coverage for millions of people,\u201d suggesting conservatives must articulate a politically attractive alternative in order to achieve the goal of repeal.\n\nThe problem with the reform school\u2019s approach, he said, is that it assumes \u201crepeal is not important,\u201d and that a few minor tweaks would be sufficient to render Obamacare pro-market, both of which notions he rejected.\n\nRoy countered that although his plan does not necessarily require full repeal, it does repeal \u201cbig chunks\u201d of Obamacare, and creates a framework for transitioning to a more market-oriented approach.\n\n\u201cIf some kernels of Obamacare can help us reform Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d he argued. \u201cThen we have an obligation to use them.\u201d (RELATED: Gruber in 2009: Obamacare Will NOT be Affordable)\n\nPerhaps the most radical outlook aired at the meeting came from Cato\u2019s own Michael Cannon, who argued that not only should Obamacare be repealed, but so should other government health care programs, which he claimed would unleash the innovative power of the market.\n\nOne of the most lauded aspects of Obamacare, Cannon noted, is its prohibition on denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. Yet few people realize that before the debate over health care reform even began, \u201cthe market was innovating right under Congress\u2019 nose,\u201d allowing individuals to purchase protection plans to prevent their premiums from rising in the event they developed a chronic condition.\n\nObamacare regulations also block other insurance innovations, Cannon said, such as \u201ctotal satisfaction guarantees,\u201d which he speculated most Americans would love to have.\n\nCannon said he is \u201cconcerned about whether innovation-killing provisions would survive\u201d under more-moderate schemes for repeal, saying those plans \u201care Obamacare-Lite because they retain refundable tax credits, which are redistribution of income.\u201d (RELATED: Report: Premiums Rising Faster Under Obamacare Than Eight Years Before COMBINED)\n\nIn response, Roy conceded that, \u201ca libertarian insurance market would be better than the one we have now, but doesn\u2019t have the political support,\u201d adding that the main consideration among the competing approaches comes down to \u201cwhat we think is politically feasible.\u201d\n\nGiven that universal health care remains a popular concept, even if specific embodiments have proven less so, Roy argued that conservatives should focus on finding ways \u201cto get government out of the market,\u201d rather than fixating on the elimination of subsidized health insurance.\n\nBy replacing subsidies with tax credits, he explained, \u201cwe can actually cover more people than Obamacare while spending less money, and there are people on the center-left who are open to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf all you look at is a narrow range of options that seem politically feasible,\u201d Cannon replied. \u201cThen that\u2019s all you get. Our goal is to expand the window of feasible policy options.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can paint a vision of a completely free, fully reformed health care system,\u201d he asserted. \u201cPeople will listen.\u201d\n\nFollow Peter Fricke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
