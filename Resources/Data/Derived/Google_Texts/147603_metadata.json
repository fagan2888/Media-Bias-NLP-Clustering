(Photo: Getty Images / iStockphoto )\n\nThe May 14 story about Cyrus Wilson, a man wrongly convicted of murder in 1994 and the witnesses now coming forth admitting they lied due to police pressure, only reinforces why the death penalty should be abolished. Had this innocent man been sentenced to death, it would be a more tragic story of wrongful justice.\n\nThere are many reasons why capital punishment is wrong \u2014 from sanctity of life, vengefulness, not a crime deterrent, costs vs. life imprisonment, inflicting pain on the person and the families, etc. But Wilson\u2019s story, though not unique, speaks to the fallibility of evidence, witnesses, the police and the courts that could take the life of innocent people. The principle that not one innocent life should be taken is fundamental in religion and in our society.\n\nI implore others to tell our governor to discontinue scheduled executions and our legislature to ban capital punishment in favor of life in prison.\n\nMichael Bolduc\n\nFranklin 37064\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1nbpnsB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The principle that not one innocent life should be taken is fundamental in religion and in our society.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The principle that not one innocent life should be taken is fundamental in religion and in our society.", "title": "Miscarriage of justice shows need to end death penalty", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/2014/05/18/miscarriage-justice-shows-need-end-death-penalty/9255743/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The principle that not one innocent life should be taken is fundamental in religion and in our society.", "title": "Miscarriage of justice shows need to end death penalty", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f704ab9ea188554d241efceeeca3ec9b417cd105/c=84-0-422-338&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/deathrow.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f1d7e6dffcf8e8545f4c6869a80647b3480ff287/c=126-0-380-338/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/deathrow.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71ccacf4ab47611bd38acc06ab9f564cbabce2bb/c=84-0-422-338/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/deathrow.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef315d5df1cd019af6862e995e3c35911ece8caf/c=28-0-479-338/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/deathrow.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/626e662f5ff631ddbeaefbfcfeb413ddd2ac1c5a/c=0-26-507-311&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/deathrow.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-05-18T16:13:36-05:00", "shorthed": "Death penalty should be abolished now", "articleid": 9255743, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ceafe67699e9fd6ca0749f5be24fd8b3c343fcb/c=0-26-507-311/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/deathrow.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/438383c7638d00aca92a44df227cc90bbc089485/c=158-0-348-338/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/deathrow.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Miscarriage of justice shows need to end death penalty"}, "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Stories that continue to emerge of people wrongly convicted of murder reinforces why the death penalty should be abolished.\nHad this innocent man been sentenced to death, it would be a more tragic story of wrongful justice.\nThe principle that not one innocent life should be taken is fundamental in religion and in our society.\n(Photo: Getty Images / iStockphoto )The May 14 story about Cyrus Wilson, a man wrongly convicted of murder in 1994 and the witnesses now coming forth admitting they lied due to police pressure, only reinforces why the death penalty should be abolished.\nBut Wilson\u2019s story, though not unique, speaks to the fallibility of evidence, witnesses, the police and the courts that could take the life of innocent people."}
