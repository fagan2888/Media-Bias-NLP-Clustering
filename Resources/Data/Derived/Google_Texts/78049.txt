Representatives of Dayton-based CareSource have been invited to participate in a national forum next month in Washington, D.C., where they will share their strategies for success selling private health plans in the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Health Insurance Marketplace.

The forum, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers HealthCare.gov — the federal online platform for the marketplace — is intended “to give insurers that are still adapting to the exchange a chance to hear from companies that have had more success,” according to a blog post announcing the forum.

CareSource, the state’s largest Medicaid managed care provider with more than 1 million customers, began selling its Just4Me brand health plans in Ohio’s insurance marketplace in 2014.

Since then, the company has expanded its commercial health insurance business to Indiana and Kentucky and West Virgina and had about 130,000 marketplace enrollees across all four markets at the beginning of this year — up 50 percent from the same period a year ago, according to Scott Streator, who will be one of the speakers at the forum and is senior vice president of CareSource’s marketplace product line.
