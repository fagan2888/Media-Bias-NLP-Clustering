In that time, the work has become progressively more difficult, while the weather has become progressively warmer. Today, we\u2019re trying to finish up some heavy demolition, tearing out a two-story fireplace \u2014 lots of brick and cinder block to break apart, throw into a wheelbarrow and trundle up a hill to a waiting trailer.\n\nThis, after busting up a 6-inch slab of concrete, which met the same fate.\n\nThe work isn\u2019t easy. Nor is it my chosen profession. Let\u2019s just say I doubt I\u2019ll be adding it to my LinkedIn profile.\n\nWe moved to Fort Collins a little more than four years ago, escaping the Rust Belt at the bottom of the real estate collapse. I worked in television at the time. I\u2019d never had trouble finding work in the past, so we didn\u2019t give it much thought.\n\nBut now that I\u2019m 50-something, it appears they\u2019ve changed the hiring rules. After several years of looking but not finding anything, followed by a brief stint stocking grocery store shelves overnight, I was hooked up with \u201cBob the Builder\u201d by one of my wife\u2019s co-workers. He was desperate, and I had nowhere else to go.\n\nWhile I always considered myself to be in decent shape, the notion was dispelled some time ago. Now the gods are simply driving home that point. By 10 a.m., I am wilting in the heat. By noon, I am completely out of gas.\n\nMy nemesis this day is the 18-inch-wide plank that serves as a ramp up into the trailer where I\u2019m to dump all the fireplace rubble. With every wheelbarrow load, negotiating this incline becomes more treacherous. The preferred method is to get a bit of a running start and just glide up the ramp with a few confident strides. But confidence is supplanted by exhaustion as my legs turn to rubber, leaving me wobbling like a drunk on a balance beam.\n\nInevitably, I lose control and spill a couple of loads onto the driveway. After that I simply avoid the ramp, push my wheelbarrow to the edge of the trailer and toss the broken stone and bricks in by hand. Bob is not amused but accepts the fact \u2014 grudgingly \u2014 that the extra time it takes me to empty the wheelbarrow this way is still quicker than collecting scattered chunks of broken masonry up off the pavement.\n\nLunch, finally, and the chance to sit. How I\u2019ll make it through the afternoon is anyone\u2019s guess. A quick check of my phone provides mute testament to my ongoing persona non grata status in the current job market: no voice messages, e-mails or texts despite perhaps half a dozen applications.\n\nSo I dust off my hat and head back to my Sisyphean task, pushing another load of brick and concrete up the hill under that indifferent, perfect blue Colorado sky.\n\nCurt MacDougall lives in Fort Collins.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: No country for old men", "title": "Guest Commentary: No country for old men", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/29/guest-commentary-no-country-for-old-men/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150529__OP30MACDOUGALLp1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150529__OP30MACDOUGALLp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-29T16:44:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T10:18:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1601\"", "article_summary": "With every wheelbarrow load, negotiating this incline becomes more treacherous.\nIn that time, the work has become progressively more difficult, while the weather has become progressively warmer.\nMy nemesis this day is the 18-inch-wide plank that serves as a ramp up into the trailer where I\u2019m to dump all the fireplace rubble.\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.\nAfter that I simply avoid the ramp, push my wheelbarrow to the edge of the trailer and toss the broken stone and bricks in by hand."}
