Rand Paul continued to drive momentum for criminal justice reform Wednesday, saying the greatest barrier to jobs and voting in the U.S. is a criminal record.\n\n\u201cIf we want to help people work and help people vote, we\u2019ve got to fix the overcriminalization problem,\u201d Paul said before an intimate crowd during the Bipartisan Summit on Fair Justice hosted by the Coalition for Public Safety and #cut50.\n\nThe Republican presidential hopeful advocated following California\u2019s lead in dropping minor nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors so voting and employment opportunities are preserved for those who commit minor crimes.\n\nPaul said the reduction also freed prison space in the state\u2019s overcrowded system, allowing federal prosecutors to effectively detain violent felons for their entire sentences.\n\nOvercrowding is the result of an explosion in the federal prison population since the 1980s, when politicians dropped a tsunami of harsh sentencing laws on the criminal justice system in a sweeping crime and drug crackdown.\n\nThe consequence was an 800-percent increase in the prison population over the past 30 years, with more than 208,000 people locked in federal prisons, of which half are serving for nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates said during the event that these numbers are driven largely by drug laws encompassing mandatory minimums that are not \u201ccalibrated\u201d to match the crime to the sentence. She said this complicates the ability to distinguish punishment between a cartel leader and a low-level drug offender, eliciting steep human and financial costs.\n\nThe U.S. spends $80 billion a year on jails and prisons, a number that consumes one-third of the Department of Justice\u2019s entire budget. Yates said this \u201cswallows\u201d funds that could be allocated to state and local law enforcement along with prevention and reentry programs in prisons.\n\n\u201cEvery dollar we spend on incarcerating the nonviolent, low-level drug offenders is a dollar that we can\u2019t spend on investigating and prosecuting the threats that we face today,\u201d she said.\n\nPaul noted the emergence of 10 separate bipartisan bills in the Senate seeking reform to the criminal justice system, underscoring a growing movement to push something through the usually gridlocked Congress.\n\nBut he heeded caution, reminding the audience that despite a \u201cgroundswell\u201d in bipartisan coalitions pushing for an overhaul, legislation still faces an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to pass legislation in Washington, and it\u2019s not a done deal that anything\u2019s going to pass,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He says we need to help people who have records and can't find jobs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He says we need to help people who have records and can't find jobs.", "title": "Rand Paul: 'We've Got to Fix the Overcriminalization Problem'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150722_CrimJusticeEvent.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-23T16:56:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KlDurY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He says we need to help people who have records and can't find jobs.", "title": "Rand Paul: 'We've Got to Fix the Overcriminalization Problem'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150722_CrimJusticeEvent.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-07-22T19:02:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T16:56:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Rand Paul, Sally Yates, criminal justice reform, Bipartisan Summit on Fair Justice"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we want to help people work and help people vote, we\u2019ve got to fix the overcriminalization problem,\u201d Paul said before an intimate crowd during the Bipartisan Summit on Fair Justice hosted by the Coalition for Public Safety and #cut50.\nSen.
