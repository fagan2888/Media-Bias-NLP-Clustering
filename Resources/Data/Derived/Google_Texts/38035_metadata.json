Now that it is mired in a ratings slump, Lack\u2019s mandate as chairman will be figuring out if MSNBC needs a complete overhaul or a sharpening of its mission.\n\nThe current picture is seriously ugly. Through early March, Chris Hayes\u2019 viewership at 8 p.m. on weekdays was down 23 percent from last year, Rachel Maddow was off 24 percent and Lawrence O\u2019Donnell down 26 percent. Among the 25-to-54-year-old demographic that is the basis for advertising sales, the prime-time lineup lost nearly half its audience. Daytime isn\u2019t much better.\n\nFatigue is natural for fans of any presidential administration in its sixth year, and liberals are traditionally less loyal to political talk media than conservatives.\n\n\u201cLike political groups that raise money, they do better when they have something to rail against,\u201d said Mark Feldstein, veteran television journalist and professor at the University of Maryland.\n\nPhil Griffin, MSNBC president, has lately sought to broaden MSNBC\u2019s outlook by taking on a greater variety of stories, even hiring a food correspondent, and there\u2019s been some uptick in the ratings the past few weeks. He changed the daytime lineup, ditching opinionated programs hosted by Ronan Farrow and Joy-Ann Reid and establishing a news-focused bloc with Jose Diaz-Balart, Andrea Mitchell and Thomas Roberts.\n\nGriffin has run MSNBC since 2006. Normally, executives at networks with his ratings are looking for another job, especially with a new boss coming in. But he and Lack have a long relationship, and Griffin has credited Lack with kick-starting his career by assigning him to supervise NBC News coverage of the O.J. Simpson case.\n\nThe shift in focus during the day has led some fans to fear MSNBC may abandon its liberal focus altogether.\n\nThat\u2019s very unlikely. Despite the ratings, analyst SNL Kagan predicts MSNBC will earn $509 million in revenue this year. While that\u2019s below Fox News Channel ($2.18 billion) and CNN ($1.16 billion), that would still be slightly up from $501 million in 2014, Kagan said.\n\nThe financial health is largely due to long-term deals with cable and satellite operators to carry MSNBC, made when the network sold itself as a counterbalance to Fox News, said Derek Baine, Kagan analyst. Bad ratings depress advertising prices, and while they would hurt MSNBC\u2019s future if they persist, the advertising is not as important as the carriage deals.\n\nConsidering Lack spent much of his first go-round at NBC News struggling to find an identity for MSNBC, the idea of searching for a new one is no doubt unappealing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC News\u2019 boss faces challenge fixing MSNBC", "title": "NBC News\u2019 boss faces challenge fixing MSNBC", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NBC News\u2019 boss faces challenge fixing MSNBC", "title": "NBC News\u2019 boss faces challenge fixing MSNBC", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/nbc_news_boss_faces_challenge_fixing_msnbc/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/tv-slumping-msnbc.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NBC News\u2019 boss faces challenge fixing MSNBC", "title": "NBC News\u2019 boss faces challenge fixing MSNBC", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/tv-slumping-msnbc.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Bauder", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce5e\"", "article_summary": "While he was gone, MSNBC changed from traditional news to a political network with a liberal lens.\nGriffin has run MSNBC since 2006.\nDespite the ratings, analyst SNL Kagan predicts MSNBC will earn $509 million in revenue this year.\nThe shift in focus during the day has led some fans to fear MSNBC may abandon its liberal focus altogether.\nNormally, executives at networks with his ratings are looking for another job, especially with a new boss coming in."}
