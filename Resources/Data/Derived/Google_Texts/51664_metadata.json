Andrew Cuomo traveled to Puerto Rico over Labor Day weekend to show his support for the island's governor and its beleaguered finances.\n\nThe governor has repeatedly called for Congress to let Puerto Rico declare bankruptcy, and on Sunday, Sen. Chuck Schumer, State Sen. Gustavo Rivera and New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito urged Congress to do the same.\n\nHouse Republicans so far haven't warmed to the idea.\n\nOn Monday, the speaker and Mayor Bill de Blasio released a joint statement saying \"there is simply no reason our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico shouldn\u2019t be afforded the same protections available to all 50 states.\"\n\n\"New York City urges Congress to act swiftly before it\u2019s too late and this very real fiscal crisis turns into a humanitarian one,\" they said.\n\nImproving health care delivery is crucial for Puerto Rico, New York officials have said, because two-thirds of the island's population rely on some form of government-run health care.\n\nBut with hospitals and other medical facilities lacking basic necessities like functioning HVAC units, delivering cost-effective care is a challenge. When the result is patients being sicker than they need to be, the government spends more than it should on health care, adding to its financial woes.\n\nIf approved, the waiver wouldn't solve the larger problem, which is how Puerto Rico pays for its Medicaid program.\n\nCurrently, the island receives about 55 percent reimbursement for its approximately $2.8 billion Medicaid program. But those federal dollars come from a $6.4 billion pot that was set aside as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat pot of money was supposed to last Puerto Rico through 2019, but cost overruns mean it will likely run out within the next 18 months. When it does, the federal contribution toward Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program is capped at $400 million. Given the size of the program, that\u2019s an effective rate of 14 percent. (New York, a far wealthier state, receives a 50 percent match from the federal government.)\n\nThe looming crisis has forced doctors to flee the island in search of better rates and patients to flee in search of better care, only exacerbating Puerto Rico's problems.\n\nThe only way to change the Medicaid reimbursement rate is through Congress, and if that does not happen, an administrative waiver that brings back federal dollars to reduce the costs of care takes on even greater importance because the island will need to find a way to stretch the dollars it does receive, and reduce the overall expense of the program.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>State Medicaid director Jason Helgerson is back in Puerto Rico trying to put the finishing touches on an application for a Medicaid waiver the island can send the federal government.&nbsp;</p>", "title": "Cuomo officials back in Puerto Rico as crisis looms", "url": "http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/12/cuomo-officials-back-in-puerto-rico-as-crisis-looms-029126", "image": "http://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a-Jason%20Helgerson_6.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "<p>State Medicaid director Jason Helgerson is back in Puerto Rico trying to put the finishing touches on an application for a Medicaid waiver the island can send the federal government.&nbsp;</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| WMHT via YouTube Cuomo officials back in Puerto Rico as crisis loomsState Medicaid director Jason Helgerson is back in Puerto Rico trying to put the finishing touches on an application for a Medicaid waiver the island can send the federal government.\nAndrew Cuomo traveled to Puerto Rico over Labor Day weekend to show his support for the island's governor and its beleaguered finances.\nImproving health care delivery is crucial for Puerto Rico, New York officials have said, because two-thirds of the island's population rely on some form of government-run health care.\nThat pot of money was supposed to last Puerto Rico through 2019, but cost overruns mean it will likely run out within the next 18 months.\nIf approved, the waiver wouldn't solve the larger problem, which is how Puerto Rico pays for its Medicaid program."}
