The company says it\u2019s testing a \u201cGrand Mac\u201d and \u201cMac Jr.\u201d in the central Ohio and the Dallas areas, and will see how they do before deciding on a national rollout.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s landmark Affordable Care Act was seemingly dealt a huge blow Tuesday when the nation\u2019s largest insurer by number of people covered, United Healthcare,announced it was leaving the state exchanges in all but a \u201chandful\u201d of states. Still, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees would continue to have a choice of three or more insurers, even in the absence of United.\n\nTwo more \u201cFacebooks\u201d lurk inside, as the Messenger \u201cchat feed\u201d evolves to a news feed, and leads the way to native ads. As we have made modest changes to our estimates our price target for Facebook increases to $142 from $140 prior. Our $142 price target is based on discounted cash flow with a 10.5% weighted average cost of capital and a 3% terminal growth rate. We note that both Messenger and WhatsApp have surpassed 900 million and 1 billion users, respectively.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On today\u2019s edition of Rob Black\u2019s Winners and Losers, our financial expert Rob Black and KRON 4\u2019s Mark Danon to talk about McDonald's, Presi\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=472672814", "og": {"site_name": "KRON4.com", "description": "On today\u2019s edition of Rob Black\u2019s Winners and Losers, our financial expert Rob Black and KRON 4\u2019s Mark Danon to talk about McDonald\u2019s, President Obama\u2019s landmark Affordable Care Act and\u2026", "title": "Rob Black\u2019s Winners and Losers: McDonald\u2019s testing bigger, smaller Big Mac", "url": "http://kron4.com/2016/04/20/rob-blacks-winners-and-losers-mcdonalds-testing-bigger-smaller-big-mac/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvkron.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/black6.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On today\u2019s edition of Rob Black\u2019s Winners and Losers, our financial expert Rob Black and KRON 4\u2019s Mark Danon to talk about McDonald\u2019s, President Obama\u2019s landmark Affordable Care Act and\u2026", "creator": "@kron4news", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvkron.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/black6.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Rob Black\u2019s Winners and Losers: McDonald\u2019s testing bigger, smaller Big Mac", "site": "kron4news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Bay Area News, National, News, Top Video", "msapplication-tooltip": "San Francisco Bay Area News and Weather", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.kron", "fb": {"pages": 76378187097}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kron4.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c3b964b0ec8331fdc42c806ab42993d9?s=16", "application-name": "KRON4.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KRON4", "published_time": "2016-04-20T19:26:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T19:26:58+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "E6zua_1Hx3PqDQT7AXZraHKgjfzBwVxgG6fPV6wzriM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "McDonald\u2019s is testing bigger and smaller versions of its Big Mac as the world\u2019s biggest hamburger chain pushes to revive its business.\nSAN FRANCISCO (KRON) \u2014 On today\u2019s edition of Rob Black\u2019s Winners and Losers, our financial expert Rob Black and KRON 4\u2019s Mark Danon to talk about McDonald\u2019s, President Obama\u2019s landmark Affordable Care Act and Facebook.\nAs we have made modest changes to our estimates our price target for Facebook increases to $142 from $140 prior.\nOur $142 price target is based on discounted cash flow with a 10.5% weighted average cost of capital and a 3% terminal growth rate.\nThe company says it\u2019s testing a \u201cGrand Mac\u201d and \u201cMac Jr.\u201d in the central Ohio and the Dallas areas, and will see how they do before deciding on a national rollout."}
