If IUDs do not work and a female FARC member is not forced to have an abortion, they are forced to part ways with their child who would be deemed a distraction from fighting.\n\nIn spite of the the atrocious manner in which the FARC treats women in its organization, the rebel group is described in a romantic manner by The New York Times which states:\n\n\u201cWhile marriage is unknown here, relationships among guerrillas are common. The man asks his commander for permission, just as many rural Colombians would ask the father for a woman\u2019s hand. When the two want to have sex, they tell the commander and then slip off into the woods, with palm fronds for bedding.\u201d\n\nCurrently FARC negotiators and Colombian government officials failed to reach a peace agreement by their own self-imposed deadline of Wednesday. Had a peace been negotiated, it would have brought an end to the longest-running conflict in Latin America.\n\nFollow JP on Twitter\n\nClick here for reuse options!
