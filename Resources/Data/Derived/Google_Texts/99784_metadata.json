These devices emit light of all colors, but it\u2019s the blues that pose a danger to sleep. Blue light is especially good at preventing the release of melatonin.\n\nFor nocturnal animals, this hormone spurs activity. For daytime species, melatonin signals it\u2019s time to sleep.\n\nOrdinarily, the pineal gland, a pea-size organ in the brain, begins to release melatonin a couple of hours before your regular bedtime. The hormone is no sleeping pill, but it does reduce alertness and make sleep more inviting.\n\nHowever, light \u2014 particularly of the blue variety \u2014 can keep the pineal gland from releasing melatonin, thus warding off sleepiness. You don\u2019t have to be staring directly at a television or computer screen: If enough blue light hits the eye, the gland can stop releasing melatonin. So easing into bed with a tablet or a laptop makes it harder to take a long snooze, especially for sleep-deprived teenagers more vulnerable to the effects of light than adults.\n\nDuring adolescence, the circadian rhythm shifts, and teens feel more awake later at night. Switching on a TV show or video game before bedtime will push off sleepiness even later, even if they have to be up for school.\n\n\u201cTeenagers have all the same risks of light exposure, but they are systematically sleep-deprived because of how society works against their natural clocks,\u201d said sleep researcher Steven Lockley of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAsking a teenager to get up at 7 a.m. is like asking me to get up at 4 a.m.\u201d\n\nMariana Figueiro of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute investigates how light affects human health, and her recent research focused on which electronics emit blue light intense enough to affect sleep.\n\nWhen comparing melatonin levels of adults and teenagers looking at computer screens, she was astonished by the younger group\u2019s light sensitivity. Even when exposed to just one-tenth as much light as adults were, the teens actually suppressed more melatonin than the older people.\n\nIn another experiment, she had adults use iPads at full brightness for two hours and measured their melatonin levels with saliva samples. One hour of use didn\u2019t significantly curtail melatonin release, but two hours\u2019 did.\n\nSo although teenagers may be particularly susceptible, we all should be aware that artificial light can affect our circadian rhythms.\n\n\u201cThe premise to remember is all light after dusk is unnatural,\u201d Lockley said. \u201cAll of us push our sleep later than we actually would if we didn\u2019t have electric light.\u201d\n\nA study in 2013 found that people who camped for a week in the Rocky Mountains, exposed only to natural light and no electronics, had their circadian clocks synchronized with the rise and fall of the sun. Although there were only eight campers, they all reacted in the same way, whether they considered themselves early birds or night owls.\n\nTo counteract the effects of blue light, Figueiro and Lockley recommend a free app, F.lux, that automatically warms up the colors on your various screens \u2014 more reds and yellows \u2014 at sunset and returns them to normal at sunrise.\n\n\u201cThe amount of light you need to see is lower than the amount of light you need to affect your melatonin,\u201d Figueiro said, which means that screens can be used at night without disrupting sleep cycles if you put some distance between your eyes and the device.\n\nIn other words, place the tablet farther away from your face than usual, or watch TV instead. Also, turning the brightness setting down on laptops, tablets and phones should help.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/shutterstock_1557255891.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd168f\"", "article_summary": "Blue light is especially good at preventing the release of melatonin.\nHowever, light \u2014 particularly of the blue variety \u2014 can keep the pineal gland from releasing melatonin, thus warding off sleepiness.\nYou don\u2019t have to be staring directly at a television or computer screen: If enough blue light hits the eye, the gland can stop releasing melatonin.\nOrdinarily, the pineal gland, a pea-size organ in the brain, begins to release melatonin a couple of hours before your regular bedtime.\nOne hour of use didn\u2019t significantly curtail melatonin release, but two hours\u2019 did."}
