OKLAHOMA CITY Â—- A program envisioned by Veterans Affairs Secretary Rita Aragon is quietly giving confidence and hope to hundreds of veterans behind bars.

Aragon, a retired major general who led the Oklahoma Air National Guard, created "Battle Buddies" about a year ago. The program pairs veterans on the outside with those who are incarcerated.

The volunteers assist veterans who are nearing release in completing applications for benefits and with finding housing and jobs once they are out of custody.

Oklahoma has 1,290 known veterans behind bars, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

One of them is Kerwyn Fox, who is serving a 10-year sentence for an Oklahoma County rape conviction. He is projected to be released in 2019 and is up for parole in 2017, he said.

He said he will rely on Battle Buddies to help him find a job and a place to stay, and to steer him toward career training.

Even those who may never see the outside again find participation uplifting.

Bill Wanless is serving a life-without-parole sentence for a Payne County murder conviction. He said he wants to encourage those veterans who do have "one foot out the door" to succeed upon their release from prison.

Mike Addison is the warden at Joseph Harp Correctional Center in Lexington, where Wanless and Fox are doing time. Addison is also a veteran.

"It has been very beneficial for the facility," he said of the program.

Aragon said nearly 200 veterans have volunteered to assist those behind bars.

"I tell them to never hang your head and stand proud," saidJerlettaHalford-Pandos, who volunteers along with her husband, Ron Pandos. "You are a veteran.

"We are finding that more and more of the ones that were kind of hopeless now have a purpose. They exhibit that by changing their appearance to a positive look. They walk with energy in their step. They feel like they belong to something."

Aragon said it was heart-wrenching to see American heroes who served their nation in uniform come home and not be able to deal with the emotions and mental issues and wind up in trouble.

When Aragon travels to correctional facilities, she said one of the first things veterans she meets do is to salute the flag and say the Pledge of Allegiance, something which is a first in a long time for many and has led to tears.

"I tell them thank you for your service," Aragon said. "Whatever got you into this place does not negate the service you rendered, offering up your own life to defend freedom for the rest of us."

For so long, they have been told that they are "scum," Aragon said.

Ronald Pandos is a veteran who volunteers for the program. He also served time. Veterans share a unique bond, he said.

"A veteran will talk to a veteran before they will talk to anyone else," Pandos said.

Another volunteer, Gary Hendrick, said the state may have more veterans behind bars than it realizes.

"A lot of Vietnam veterans won't claim they were in the military because of the way they were treated," Hendrick said.

The program, which requires no state funds, has drawn praise from Gov. Mary Fallin.

"Our soldiers face challenging and stressful circumstances when they are deployed," Fallin said. "When they return home, those circumstances can occasionally help contribute to serious mistakes and trouble with the law. While I will never excuse criminal behavior, I do believe we should do everything we can to get troubled veterans back on the right track."

She said the program honors those who serve and provides resources they need when they are released.
