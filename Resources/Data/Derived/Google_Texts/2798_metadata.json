Certainly, as the editorial suggests, we would not want anything that happens to WCU to have a negative impact on our community.\n\nHowever, many of us worry that that is indeed what would happen if WCU leaves PASSHE.\n\nThe Daily Local\u0092s editorial mentions that the legislation\u0092s authors, Senators Dinniman and Tomlinson, are in favor of secession, as are \u0093other trustees and advocates for West Chester.\u0094 Note that the people who do the educating of WCU\u0092s students \u0096 the faculty \u0096 are not included in this group. Many faculty were taken by surprise by the legislation, and many have grave concerns.\n\nFirst, tuition. WCU exists so that future Pennsylvania citizens have access to college education \u0097 a necessity not only for personal success but for a flourishing Commonwealth. WCU is the only reasonable option for students of limited means to obtain four-year degrees in the greater Philadelphia area. However, if WCU becomes a state-related institution, the first year tuition hike for one of WCU\u0092s students is estimated to be about $550 or 9 percent. In subsequent years, tuition would likely increase faster than inflation because of increased debt and rising personnel costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis will certainly have an impact not only on whether a student will be able to attend WCU but what a student would be able to spend in the local economy. The faculty union, APSCUF (Association for the PA State College and University Faculty), has shown that PASSHE campuses contribute $6 to their local economies for every $1 invested by the state appropriation. Many students spend their Ram Bucks in downtown businesses. We cannot endanger this.\n\nFaculty were also amazed to learn that a decision introduced to them as requiring lengthy deliberation and thorough discussion seems already to have been decided. For example, WCU\u0092s foundation, the arm that manages donations to WCU, has hired a PR firm to \u0093sell\u0094 the new legislation.\n\nNo one likes to be under the thumb of a state administration that makes unreasonable demands, and faculty support reducing unnecessary and onerous state control. But the potential effects on student financial commitments, student programs of study, faculty and staff working conditions, and a local university\u0092s financial burdens may outweigh any increased flexibility upper administration gains from not having to answer to Harrisburg. And certainly it will cost a lot more for WCU to set up a local finance system, course management software, enrollment software, health care plans, library access, and other processes by which our students benefit from PASSHE economies of scale. These costs will need to be passed on to students.\n\nThe story that WCU had to give up money to Harrisburg last year is simply not true: it was money that could have been WCU\u0092s if an unbalanced funding formula had been implemented. However, the formula was not ultimately used, and so the money was not WCU\u0092s to give back. WCU is in excellent financial shape at present and has no need to split from the state system in order to survive.\n\nIndeed, independent auditors\u0092 reports have shown that even the other campuses are not truly \u0093in trouble,\u0094 although some are claiming that is the case.\n\nUnfortunately, this legislation does not address the real problem, which is that our state government, led by an anti-public-education governor and legislative majority, has backed away from any commitment to public education at any level. To keep higher education affordable for all Pennsylvanians, we should be working to restore the huge cuts that state universities have absorbed in the past decade and find alternatives to raising tuition.\n\nContact your legislators to ask them to oppose SB 1275 and make a real commitment to supporting higher education in Pennsylvania.\n\nCHERYL WANKO\n\nWCU faculty member\n\nDissecting the Florida election\n\nChris Matthews, he of the \u0093thrill up my leg\u0094 when he hears Obama speak -- well, maybe not so much lately -- is mad at Florida voters for having elected an underdog Republican over a heavily funded, better known Democrat for a coveted U.S. congressional seat. Above all, he\u0092s annoyed they don\u0092t understand that Democrats have the answers to their problems, that \u0093Democrats generally can see the complexity of our times.\u0094 He added, \u0093They don\u0092t think they have all the answers. They\u0092d like to see some deal making between the parties and across the aisles.\u0094\n\nGet it? The president, in particular, who never misses the opportunity to insult Republicans, accusing them of wanting to starve children, throw \u0093Grannie over the cliff\u0094, and above all, of being constantly at war against women -- he and the rest of his party, that paradigm of bonhomie and cooperation, Harry Reid too we presume, would \u0093like to see some deal making between the parties and across the aisles?\u0094 Sure. And I\u0092d like to have the same vacation benefits as Michelle Obama too, but it aint gonna happen!\n\nBoth parties are studying the results of the Florida special House election to determine its portent for the forthcoming fall elections. The unpopularity of the president and his signature Obamacare legislation played a part in the outcome but that wasn\u0092t the entire story. The sense is that many voters are fed up with the accumulative scandals that have plagued this regime and have had enough of their lies and dissembling, are frightened at the incessant dropping job numbers and labor participation rate and constant ideological war on the economy. And they have also had enough of the unfair coverage accorded them by the lapdog media. Recent Rasmussen polls show the public has become cynical of the press and media and are less inclined to rely on them.\n\nFinally, there is a feeling that government is getting too big, too intrusive, that we are being robbed of our freedoms, of our independence. The malaise is not so much about Obamacare and all the scandals, \u0093Fast & Furious\u0094 gun running, the IRS, the spying on Associated Press and Washington reporter James Rosen, the NSA surveillance case. Rather, as so many commentators are suggesting, they are symbolic of a breakdown of our country as we\u0092ve known it, and Obamacare is merely the last straw, the one that\u0092s breaking the camel\u0092s back. Oh, it\u0092s a major one for certain, flawed beyond repair, but in Florida the vote is saying \u0093ENOUGH\u0094 not so much to Obamacare per se but rather to big government; this is going too far, we have to put a stop to it before it further metastasizes.\n\nAnd many are saying, this is what the Democrats are likely facing in the fall, a sort of perfect storm, an accumulated anger over five plus years of lies and dissembling, the scandals, a blatantly unfair and overbearing media, Obamacare (which was undemocratically shoved down the electorates throats creating seething bitterness), and finally the reality that this is a leviathan government out of control.\n\nJOHN de CARVILLE\n\nChester County\n\nCheers to a healthy spring\n\nAfter several months of crippling snowstorms and flooding, I really look forward to spring weather, green grass, and flowers in bloom.\n\nThe advent of spring is also a great opportunity to turn over a new leaf on our dietary and exercise habits. In fact, I\u0092ve been told that hundreds of communities celebrate the advent of spring with something called the Great American Meatout.\n\nLocal health advocates host educational events, where they ask visitors to get a fresh start this spring with a healthy diet of vegetables, fresh fruits, legumes, and whole grains. For those who need a little encouragement, their website provides useful information and a chance to pledge a healthy diet for one day or more.\n\nWES KOGEL\n\nWest Chester", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Letters, Letters news, West Chester Letters news, PA Letters news, US Letters news, world Letters news.", "title": "No need for university to break away from PASSHE", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20140320/OPINION02/140329993", "image": {"width": "363px", "identifier": "http://www.dailylocal.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DL/20140320/OPINION02/140329993/AR/0/AR-140329993.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "330px"}, "type": "article", "title": "No need for university to break away from PASSHE"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailylocal.com", "description": "The recent editorial in the Daily Local that seems to favor of West Chester University\u0092s secession from the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) does not represent the views of all WCU faculty and other campus citizens who care about", "title": "No need for university to break away from PASSHE", "url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20140320/OPINION02/140329993", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailylocal.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DL/20140320/OPINION02/140329993/AR/0/AR-140329993.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@wcdailylocal", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563329788", "iphone": "id525116294", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.dailylocalnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Letters, Letters news, West Chester Letters news, PA Letters news, US Letters news, world Letters news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The recent editorial in the Daily Local that seems to favor of West Chester University\u0092s secession from the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) does not represent the views of all WCU faculty and other campus citizens who care about"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dd4\"", "article_summary": "However, if WCU becomes a state-related institution, the first year tuition hike for one of WCU\u0092s students is estimated to be about $550 or 9 percent.\nThe faculty union, APSCUF (Association for the PA State College and University Faculty), has shown that PASSHE campuses contribute $6 to their local economies for every $1 invested by the state appropriation.\nWCU is the only reasonable option for students of limited means to obtain four-year degrees in the greater Philadelphia area.\nWCU is in excellent financial shape at present and has no need to split from the state system in order to survive.\nHowever, many of us worry that that is indeed what would happen if WCU leaves PASSHE."}
