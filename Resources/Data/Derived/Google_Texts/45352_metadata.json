Nonetheless, because considerable federal dollars are tied to complete adoption, many hospitals \u2014 especially small rural ones \u2014 could forfeit millions as key deadlines approach.\n\nFrom the high level view, the researchers concluded that the outcomes seen so far are somewhat the expected ones: large players are doing fairly well while smaller ones are struggling. Resources have a lot to do with the outcomes.\n\nThe struggle to comply by small rural hospitals has \u201cimportant implications for the work of Regional Extension Centers \u2014 whose primary purpose is to help small institutions, particularly critical-access hospitals, adopt and use EHRs \u2014 as well as for other initiatives that target rural providers and care settings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaken together, these findings represent continuing progress on the part of hospitals in response to the federal incentives. The results also offer clear indicators of where additional efforts are needed,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThese findings may be surprising given the broad reliance on the Internet and information sharing in other sectors of the economy. However, the strict privacy concerns related to health information and the complexity of the data create operational challenges for interoperability. Hospitals have added other challenging features such as physician notes and electronic prescribing. Nonetheless, they appear to be struggling with online access and transmittal of patients\u2019 health information and with sending information to the next provider of care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Dan Cook", "description": "Already, some hospitals have failed to meet meaningful-use guidelines by the July 1, 2014 deadline.", "og": {"url": "http://www.benefitspro.com/2014/08/11/small-hospitals-may-lose-billions-by-missing-ehr-d", "image": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/08/11/ehr.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Already, some hospitals have failed to meet meaningful-use guidelines by the July 1, 2014 deadline.", "title": "Small hospitals may lose billions by missing EHR deadline"}, "twitter": {"description": "Already, some hospitals have failed to meet meaningful-use guidelines by the July 1, 2014 deadline.", "creator": "@Benefits_Pro", "image": {"src": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/08/11/ehr-crop-120x120.jpg"}, "title": "Small hospitals may lose billions by missing EHR deadline", "site": "@Benefits_Pro", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-11", "keywords": "Core/Group, Regulatory, the University of Michigan, American Hospital Association, online access, Julia Adler-Milstein", "sailthru.tags": "benefitspro, article, 53e8eed2150ba0147d8b46d9, In-Depth, Core/Group,Regulatory", "sniply-options": "block", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/08/11/ehr.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd03f\"", "article_summary": "Nonetheless, because considerable federal dollars are tied to complete adoption, many hospitals \u2014 especially small rural ones \u2014 could forfeit millions as key deadlines approach.\nHowever, the strict privacy concerns related to health information and the complexity of the data create operational challenges for interoperability.\nNonetheless, they appear to be struggling with online access and transmittal of patients\u2019 health information and with sending information to the next provider of care.\u201d\nA large-scale review of data related to hospital compliance with federal electronic health records mandates reveals that most U.S. hospitals have made substantial progress toward EHR adoption .\n\u201cThese findings may be surprising given the broad reliance on the Internet and information sharing in other sectors of the economy."}
