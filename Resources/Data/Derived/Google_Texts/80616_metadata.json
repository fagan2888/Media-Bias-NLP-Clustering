At Livongo Health, which launched today. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is the consumerization of healthcare.\u201d\n\nNow, thanks to the products on offer from Tullman\u2019s Livongo, Matthew Cooper\u2019s Carmenta Bioscience, and Peter Hames\u2019 Big Health, healthcare is becoming more about a conversation between a patient and their doctors, even if the patient isn\u2019t aware of it.\n\nThe companies all tackle different ailments. With Cooper\u2019s Carmenta Bioscience focused on diagnostic testing for pre-eclampsia; Livongo tackling diabetes; and Big Health looking initially to solve the problem of sleep disorders, but all share a belief that diagnostic monitoring and increased communication with physicians and a broader healthcare community can reshape treatment for those with chronic and acute conditions.\n\n\u201cThe standard of care is that you see your doctor once every six months,\u201d says Tullman. It\u2019s a practice that all three startups call into question.\n\n\u201cWhy is it the gold standard, this medieval model? It\u2019s like going to see the blacksmith,\u201d says Big Health chief executive Peter Hames. \u201cWhat we tried to do with Sleepio [the company\u2019s first product] is automate [treatment].\u201d\n\nHames\u2019 product takes evidence-based intervention treatment, filters it through a delivery mechanism. \u201cWe start to make behavioral medicine scalable, affordable, and evidence based,\u201d says Hames.\n\nScalability is a key component of the modern healthcare solution, according to all three executives. The big idea is to leverage mobile technologies and the power of modern computing to create better testing and analysis that can be readily communicated to doctors.\n\nThis transformation of medical diagnostics and treatment is even more important given the new standards for reimbursement created by the Affordable Care Act. The ACA flips the emphasis from reimbursement for procedures to reimbursement for results. A requirement which means physicians need to monitor their patients\u2019 health more closely to engage in preventative medicine rather than reactive medicine.\n\n\u201cWe call it understanding your body\u2019s vital narrative,\u201d says Tullman.\n\nFor Matthew Cooper, detection is the key to good and affordable treatment. \u201cThe answer is driven by better diagnostic testing,\u201d Cooper says.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/jonathan-shieber/\" title=\"Posts by Jonathan Shieber\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Jonathan Shieber</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jshieber\" rel=\"external\">@jshieber</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "p": {"domain_verify": "6189ff68ce30e30f12b40b3b40873027"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Theranos on Monday to a panel of esteemed startup chief executives on Wednesday, the discussion around healthcare at this year\u2019s Disrupt has been about the ways in which new diagnostic\u2026", "title": "Executives At Disrupt Say The Future Of Healthcare Depends On\u2026", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/executives-at-disrupt-say-the-future-of-healthcare-depends-on-testing-sensing-and-communication/", "image": {"src": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/e-health1.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1"}, "site": "@techcrunch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "object_type": "post", "excerpt": "From Theranos on Monday to a panel of esteemed startup chief executives on Wednesday, the discussion around healthcare at this year\u2019s Disrupt has been about the ways in which new diagnostic and communication tools are transforming delivery and accessibility for patients.\n\u201cHealthcare is something that\u2019s been done to us,\u201d Livongo chief executive (and former Allscripts CEO)\u2026", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "tag": "Disrupt SF 2014", "sailthru.tags": "Disrupt SF 2014", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://techcrunch.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d9ea925a71f82f06a1e6224298f7fe80?s=16", "category": "TC", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Jonathan Shieber", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-10 15:52:59", "sailthru.title": "Executives At Disrupt Say The Future Of Healthcare Depends On Testing, Sensing And\u00a0Communication", "content": "From Theranos on Monday to a panel of esteemed startup chief executives on Wednesday, the discussion around healthcare at this year's Disrupt has been about the ways in which new diagnostic and communication tools are transforming delivery and accessibility for patients. \"Healthcare is something that's been done to us,\" Livongo chief executive (and former Allscripts CEO) Glen Tullman told TechCrunch's own Sarah Buhr onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2014.
