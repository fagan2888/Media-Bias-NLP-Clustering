I am editor and publisher of PolyMontana.com and I will reveal the truth about Chuck Baldwin and correct his lies about Ryan Zinke.\n\nBaldwin writes Republican Ryan Zinke is \u201ca big-government, pro-war, pro-Police State Neocon\u201d but provides no evidence to support his claims.\n\nI know Ryan Zinke very well. Zinke is for small government, anti-war except when necessary to defend America, anti-police state, and not a neocon.\n\nIf Baldwin were concerned about truth, he would have attended the noon meeting of the Kalispell Pachyderm Club on October 3, 2014, and asked Zinke questions. But Baldwin is not concerned about truth.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center claims Baldwin is \u201ca leader in the anti-government Patriot movement\u201d but Baldwin\u2019s actions favoring Democrats suggest he is a leader in the \u201cpro-government anti-Patriot\u201d movement.\n\nSince moving to Montana in 2010, Baldwin has regularly attacked Republican candidates and promoted the Voting Mantra that helps elect Democrats.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s diatribe against Ryan Zinke boils down to three claims that I define for reference:\n\n1. The Voting Mantra: \u201cA vote for the lesser of two evils is still a vote for evil.\u201d\n\n2. The Moron Mantra: \u201cRepublicans are as bad as Democrats.\u201d\n\n3. The Voting Decision: Democrat John Lewis is the better candidate for US Congress than Republican Ryan Zinke.\n\nThe False Voting Mantra\n\nBaldwin confuses the Voting Mantra with Republican Party politics. They are separate.\n\nPhilosopher Kempis rejected the Voting Mantra and recommended its opposite in the 15th century in his The Imitation of Christ, where he wrote \u201cOf two evils we should always choose the less.\u201d\n\nPhilosopher St. Thomas Aquinas confirmed Kempis\u2019s conclusion in his Summa Theologica, where he tells us our moral duty is to vote to achieve the most possible good and cautions we cannot achieve good by voting for a candidate who cannot win.\n\nPhilosopher Pope John Paul II agreed with Kempis and Aquinas in his Evangelium Vitae (The Encyclicals of John Paul II and The Genius of John Paul II). He wrote circumstances can create compelling reasons to vote for the so-called \u201clesser of two evils\u201d if we can help prevent worse evils from occurring. In the example of abortion, he wrote we should vote for a more restrictive abortion law, or the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d, over a less restrictive abortion law:\n\n\u201cThis does not in fact represent an illicit cooperation with an unjust law, but rather a legitimate and proper attempt to limit its evil aspects, in order to prevent worse legislation from being adopted.\u201d\n\nThe clear statements of Kempis, Aquinas, Pope John Paul II, and others, let us formulate the True Voting Principle:\n\nTrue Voting Principle: \u201cOur moral duty is to vote to achieve the mostpossible good, which eliminates voting for candidates who cannot win.\u201d\n\nThe Protestant Revolution did not reject the historical Catholic position on voting. All major Christian religions accept the True Voting Principle.\n\nThe True Voting Principle requires us not set mandatory conditions for a candidate to get our vote because that would conflict with our compromise necessary to achieve the most possible good.\n\nThe True Voting Principle leaves to each person the decision of how to vote to achieve the most possible good.\n\nSome evangelicals believe they cannot vote for a candidate who is not 100 percent anti-abortion. Their belief is immoral because not voting cannot achieve the greater good.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Founding Fathers used the True Voting Principle to create our Constitution. Had they set mandatory conditions we would not have our Constitution.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s Moral Errors\n\nBaldwin\u2019s first moral error is adopting the Voting Mantra cult which conflicts with all major religions. The 1960\u2019s progressives started it.Third-parties adopted it. But it never worked and progressives abandoned it after their loss to Bush in 2000.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s second moral error is setting mandatory conditions for his vote, which makes impossible the political compromise necessary to achieve the most possible good.\n\nOath Keepers National Chaplain Baldwin, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, and the John Birch Society moved to Montana in 2010 and infiltrated Montana\u2019s tea parties. They preach the Voting Mantra, deceive tea party voters to vote Libertarian, and thereby helped elect Democrats Tester as US Senator and Steve Bullock as Governor. George Soros could not have been happier.\n\nBaldwin claims \u201cRepublicans are as bad as Democrats\u201d. In 2012, Baldwin attacked Mitt Romney and helped Barack Obama:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Romney-Ryan administration will do nothing to change the downward spiral of the nation. They will continue the fanatical interventionist, preemptive war policies of Obama and Bush. They will also continue to build and construct the Orwellian domestic Police State \u2026\u201d\n\nBaldwin ignores that Obama is the first Alinsky-trained, progressive US President who hates America and whose goal is to make America a second-rate country. Hillary, the other Alinsky-trained progressive, is in line to put the last nail in America\u2019s coffin.\n\nTop US Generals say Obama killing America say Obama and his staff are dumbest national security leaders America has ever had, they have put America in grave danger, Obama changed the US position from fighting terrorism to aiding and comforting terrorism, Obama may cause a Constitutional Crisis if he continues to refuse to protect the American people from the threat of ISIS and radical Islam, and, if this occurs, it may be necessary for the US Military to remove Obama from office.\n\nObama appointed 2 Supreme Court judges. One more and Obama will swing the present conservative-liberal balance from 5-4 to 4-5.\n\nObama plans to change our electoral system to reflect popular vote by executive order, which will make America a one-party system.\n\nThe Republican Platform is much more conservative than the Democrat Platform.\n\nGOP resolutions oppose Democrats in securing our borders, immigration, religious freedom in the military, common core education, marriage and children, accountability of DHS, support for a strong space program, exposing UN Agenda 21, opposing UN global taxes, Federal Reserve transparency, protecting our Second Amendment from UN interference, stopping Obama\u2019s plan to bypass the Electoral College, and rejection of cap-and-trade.\n\nDemocrat votes with zero Republicans passed Obamacare and its tax increases. 46 Democrats vote against Second Amendment. 47 Democrats vote against First Amendment.\n\nRepublicans support,and Democrats do not support,CFACT\u2019s \u201cClimate Truth File\u201d and \u201cEnergy & Environment Truth File\u201d.\n\nIf you are conservative, you will favor Republicans.\n\nThe Voting Decision\n\nRepublican Ryan Zinke has an MBA in Finance, an MS in Global Leadership, and a BS in Geology. He was a Commander of Special Forces in Kosovo and Iraq, and the Dean of Special Forces Training and Education. He saw combat in Bosnia/Kosovo and Iraq, and earned two Bronze Stars in Iraq.\n\nOath Keepers National Chaplain Chuck Baldwin tells us to vote for the Democrat John Lewis over Republican Navy Commander Ryan Zinke, using arguments that could not pass muster in the third grade.\n\nBaldwin regurgitates Miller\u2019s claims against Zinke but Baldwin did not disclose Miller was helping Rosendale\u2019s primary campaign against Zinke, and Miller had ethics claims against him in his 2012 run for governor. Baldwin regurgitates Larry Bailey\u2019s claims against Zinke but Baldwin did not disclose Ryan Zinke\u2019s reply that shows Bailey\u2019s claims are invalid.\n\nBaldwin claims military officer experience is of no value in Congress but he has no military experience so how would he know? The fact is basic college ROTC training, like I had at Caltech, is invaluable to understanding our military\u2019s role in defending America. Everyone in Congress should have this basic education. So should preachers.\n\nHere\u2019s a factual comparison of Ryan Zinke to John Walsh.\n\nHere are debate videos showing Zinke demolishing Lewis.\n\nVoter\u2019s Edge writes:\n\n\u2022 John Lewis has no political experience or political accomplishments.\n\n\u2022 John Lewis has never had a real job. His only employment was as an assistant to Montana Democratic Senator Max Baucus from 2003 to 2013.\n\n\u2022 John Lewis\u2019 education is limited to a BA degree in political science, Western Washington University\n\nJohnLewis4Congress.com writes \u201cJohn Lewis is bad for Montana\u201d:\n\n\u2022 After more than a decade working under Baucus, John Lewis has pocketed over $568,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\n\u2022 Lewis has been laying the groundwork for his campaign by visiting every county in Montana on the taxpayers\u2019 dime.\n\n\u2022 Lewis has spent nearly 12 years working under Baucus and was a top aide to the \u201cchief architect\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nJohn Lewis is a global-warming eco-freak who will help Obama shut down American energy production because he believes our carbon dioxide emissions are destroying the planet.\n\nI have spent many hours talking to Ryan Zinke. He is the most honest, intellectual political candidate I have ever known. He is sincere and truthful. He has children who are in the military. He has seen war and he does not support war except when necessary to defend America.\n\nPersonally, I cannot imagine having a better representative in Congress than Navy Commander, Seal Team Leader, Ryan Zinke. He is humble and sincere. He cares about people. He listens to you. He never boasts.\n\nHere are some facts about Ryan Zinke where the percent scores come from VoteSmart:\n\nZinke is prolife. NARAL scored Zinke 0% because he was the only candidate to carry the \u201cAssault on Unborn Victims\u201d bill in the Montana Senate. Montana Family Foundation scored Zinke 90%, the Montana Women\u2019s lobby 20%, and the Human Rights Network 25%, which are excellent pro-life scores. Zinke is endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee.\n\nZinke supports local control of education. MEA-MFT, which is about union control rather, scored Zinke 25% for not voting in its favor. Zinke wrote,\u201cI firmly believe we must ensure more local control of our schools and give parents a stronger voice.\u201d Download Zinke\u2019s \u201cExcelling in Education\u201d.\n\nZinke strongly supports our Second Amendment. Montana Shooting Sports Association (MSSA) scored Zinke 69% and Lewis 0%. Zinke scored 100%on his 2014 reply to MSSA but returned it too late to be logged.\n\nZinke protects private property. United Property Owners of Montana scored Zinke 90%.\n\nZinke strongly supports a peacetime balanced budget amendment and a dramatic reduction in the size and scope of government. He wants government to get out of the way of business and cut burdensome regulation. Montana Chamber of Commerce rated Zinke 92%. Download Zinke\u2019s \u201cBringing high-tech jobs to Montana\u201d.\n\nZinke believes coal, oil, and gas energy development is critical to growing America\u2019s economy and energy independence. He supports renewable energy provided it competes on the open market without subsidies. Download Zinke\u2019s \u201cEnergy Plan \u2013 Powering our Economy\u201d.\n\nZinke believes Obamacare is reckless and will lead to higher costs with less medical care. He supports the alternative Republican US Congress healthcare plan.\n\nZinke supports a strong national defense. He calls for action against ISIS and for action to save our US Marine held hostage in Mexico.\n\nDemocrats promote United Nations Agenda 21. Republicans oppose Agenda 21.\n\nDemocrats want the feds to own our land and water. Ryan Zinke will keep Montana\u2019s land and water under Montana control.\n\nFor more information, read Ryan Zinke\u2019s America and click here and here.\n\nLibertarians should vote for Ryan Zinke because he scores 100% in The Daily Signal\u2019s three areas where conservatives and libertarians share the same values: (1) Preference for small government, (2) Support for \u201creligious liberty\u201d, (3) Belief in a strong, stable family structure.\n\nConclusions\n\nBaldwin\u2019s Voting Mantra conflicts with all major religions.\n\nBy promoting Lewis over Zinke, Baldwin is not a \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d.\n\nMontanans are very concerned about the Federal government taking control of Montana\u2019s water. Ryan Zinke is the only candidate who will ensure Montana\u2019s water remains under the ownership and control of the State of Montana.\n\nRyan Zinke is clearly the best choice for all Montanans, conservatives, Libertarians, and tea party voters.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Edwin X Berry, PhD \u2013 All Rights Reserved", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "I am editor and publisher of PolyMontana.com and I will reveal the truth about Chuck Baldwin and correct his lies about Ryan Zinke.\nBaldwin writes Republican Ryan Zinke is \u201ca big-government, pro-war, pro-Police State Neocon\u201d but provides no evidence to support his claims.\nCHUCK BALDWIN WRONG ABOUT RYAN ZINKEBy Dr. Ed Berry, Ph.DOctober 18, 2014NewsWithViews.comPastor Chuck Baldwin\u2019s \u201cRyan Zinke: The Greater Evil\u201d rejects accepted Christian theology, supports Alinsky-trained Obama\u2019s plan for America, and tells you to vote for an unqualified Democrat rather than for highly-qualified Navy Seal Commander Ryan Zinke for Montana\u2019s sole seat in the US Congress.\nRyan Zinke is clearly the best choice for all Montanans, conservatives, Libertarians, and tea party voters.\nPersonally, I cannot imagine having a better representative in Congress than Navy Commander, Seal Team Leader, Ryan Zinke."}
