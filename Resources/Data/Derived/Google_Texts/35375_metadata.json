The setting is Marine One, and it features a modest cast of five. Valerie Jarrett, dressed in a suit of blazing pink, is staring at her cell phone. Barack Obama, twisted around in his seat, is listening to a conversation between his then\u2013body guy, Reggie Love, and Patrick Gaspard, one of his then\u2013top advisers. Obama\u2019s former deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, is looking on too, with just the mildest hint of a grin on his face.\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s a banal shot \u2014 just another photo for the White House Instagram feed, showing the president and his aides busily attending to matters of state. Stare at it a second longer, though, and a subtle distinction comes into focus: Everyone onboard is black. \u201cWe joked that it was Soul Plane,\u201d says Burton. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve often joked about it since \u2014 that it was the first time in history only black people were on that helicopter.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories 53 Historians Weigh In on Barack Obama\u2019s Legacy\n\nSouza snapped that shot on August 9, 2010, but it didn\u2019t make any prominent appearances in the mainstream press until mid-2012, when it appeared in The New York Times Magazine. The following summer, July 2013, the president had a group of civil-rights leaders come visit him in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, and the optics, as they like to say in politics, were similar: An all-star cast of minorities (African-American and Latino this time) gathered in a historic place to which the barriers to entry were once insuperably high.\n\nBut this was not a meeting the participants laughed about afterward. When Obama opened up the floor, everyone spoke about what they\u2019d witnessed in the 2012 election: how states that limited voter-registration drives and early-voting initiatives had left many African-Americans off the rolls; how strict new laws concerning IDs had prevented many minorities from voting and created hours-long lines at the polls. The answer was clear: legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court had just overturned a key provision of the landmark civil-rights legislation the month before.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s response was equally clear: Nothing could be done. Not in this political climate, not under these circumstances. Congress would never allow it.\n\nThe group was stunned. As they\u2019d stumped for Obama, one of the many talking points they\u2019d used to turn out the black vote was the threat of disenfranchisement, the possibility that the Voting Rights Act was in jeopardy. Yet here was Obama telling them that a bill addressing this vital issue didn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nThese proximal events \u2014 the publication of a historic photo in a major news outlet, a demoralizing discussion about the prospects of amending our voting laws \u2014 may seem unrelated. But to many who\u2019ve watched this White House for the last six and three-quarter years, particularly with an eye toward race, the two events are finely intertwined. They would more likely say: One cannot have that photo without a massive reaction to that photo. In a country whose basic genetic blueprint includes the same crooked mutations that made slavery and Jim Crow possible, it is not possible to have a black president surrounded by black aides on Marine One without paying a price. And the price that Obama has had to pay \u2014 and, more important, that African-Americans have had to pay \u2014 is one of caution, moderation, and at times compromised policies: The first black president could do only so much, and say only so much, on behalf of other African-Americans. That is the bittersweet irony of the first black presidency.\n\n\u201c I too would have liked to see the Obama years do more. But Barack Obama never gave us a bill that hurt us. \u201d Al Sharpton, minister and activist\n\nBut now, as Obama\u2019s presidency draws to a close, African-American intellectuals and civil-rights leaders have grown increasingly vocal in their discontents. They frame them, for the most part, with love and respect. But current events have broken their hearts and stretched their patience. A proliferation of videos documenting the murders of unarmed black men and women \u2014 by the very people charged with their safety \u2014 has given rise to a whole movement defined by three words and a hashtag: #BlackLivesMatter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the fundamental paradoxes of Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 that we have the Black Lives Matter movement under a black president,\u201d says Fredrick Harris, a political scientist at Columbia University. \u201cYour man is in office, and you have this whole movement around criminal-justice reform asserting black people\u2019s humanity?\u201d\n\nObama is hardly uncomprehending of these concerns. One can hear it in his rhetoric on race these days, which has become much more lyrical, personal, explicit. \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d he sang in Charleston. \u201cRacism, we are not cured of,\u201d he told Marc Maron, \u201cand it\u2019s not just a matter of it not being polite to say \u2018n-----\u2019 in public,\u201d using the full word. This summer, Obama visited a prison, the first president to do so, and commuted the sentences of 46 nonviolent drug offenders. Last year, he started the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative, which zeros in on programs within federal agencies that can help young men of color. He is now trying, with the improbable cooperation of congressional Republicans, to pass a bill on criminal-justice reform.\n\nStill, the question many African-American leaders are now asking is what his efforts will amount to, and whether they\u2019re sufficient. At a panel about African-American millennials in August, the journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault made note of Obama\u2019s recent emphasis on race matters and asked the group if it was \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d Their responses, not surprisingly, were mixed. At the Aspen Ideas Festival this summer, Jarrett fielded a similar question from Walter Isaacson, the writer and head of the Aspen Institute. He noted that some Americans thought Obama publicly engaged with issues of race only \u201chalfway.\u201d Her reply was swift, pointed, and poignant. \u201cI think you have to ask yourself: Why is that all on him?\u201d\n\nJust after November 5, 2008, there was, in this country, a brief spell of racial euphoria. The streets on Election Eve were filled with jubilant strangers hugging and kissing one another. The word postracial got tossed around a lot (by whites, it must be said, far more than blacks). A Gallup poll released two days after Obama\u2019s victory declared that two-thirds of Americans said \u201ca solution to relations between blacks and whites will eventually be worked out,\u201d the highest percentage Gallup has measured on this question.\n\nGoing into the Oval Office, Obama had given one of the most extraordinary speeches about race this country had ever heard from a politician. Granted, he\u2019d had no choice: His former pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, had preached a sermon in 2003 that included the words \u201cGod damn America,\u201d which were inconveniently caught on videotape. But Obama\u2019s response \u2014 a 37-minute speech in Philadelphia that patiently put these words in historical context \u2014 was risky, audacious, possibly even contraindicated. \u201cThere were many cowardly ways to handle that situation,\u201d says Van Jones, Obama\u2019s former special adviser for green jobs, \u201cbut he chose the most courageous one.\u201d The speech got 1.2 million hits within the first 24 hours of being posted on YouTube.\n\n\u201c I understood the tightrope from the beginning. He\u2019s the president of all people. But sometimes it felt like he was president of everyone except black people. \u201d Van Jones, Obama\u2019s former special adviser on green jobs\n\nWhat one says as a candidate is one thing; what one says as president is another. Six months into Obama\u2019s tenure, a reporter asked the president what he thought of the arrest of Harvard\u2019s Henry Louis Gates Jr., one of the most famous African-American intellectuals in the United States, who had been taken into custody for trying to unstick the stubborn front door of his own home. Obama replied that although he didn\u2019t have all the facts, he thought the Cambridge police had \u201cacted stupidly.\u201d Within minutes, the world seemed to come off its hinges, with Fox and its cousins \u2014 even some of its in-laws in the mainstream press \u2014 \u00addeclaiming that Obama had insufficient respect for law enforcement. Obama dialed back his comments, proposing that Gates and the police officer meet at the White House over beers.\n\n\u201cThere was the president of the United States,\u201d says Jones, \u201cescorted by the white vice-president, sitting at a little table with an arguably racist white beat cop from Boston, like some little kid in time-out in a kindergarten class.\u201d The incident would subsequently become known as \u201cthe beer summit.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has really tried to think through the harm that that whole incident inflicted on the country,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe courageous president we had voted for disappeared.\u201d Jones says that a number of White House staffers, particularly those of color, wished the president hadn\u2019t done it. \u201cI wish he had gone out and said, \u2018I want to clarify what I said about the police behaving foolishly. What I meant was: They behaved damn foolishly. I\u2019m going back to work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that Obama\u2019s brain trust \u2014 at least in the beginning \u2014 seemed to be made extremely uncomfortable by race matters. \u201cSometimes liberals think, Because I\u2019m fair-minded, I know how to handle race relations,\u201d says Marc Morial, the head of the National Urban League. \u201cNo. Handling race relations means knowing how to handle alligators and crocodiles. Apart from Valerie Jarrett, there weren\u2019t a lot of African-American advisers in there who were experienced in dealing with race.\u201d He thinks for a moment. \u201cOr white advisers,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere are lots of white advisers who have experience in dealing with race relations. But I think the David Axelrod\u2013Rahm Emanuel axis didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d Barbara Arnwine, the recently retired executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, says people would refer to Obama\u2019s advisers as \u201cthe Great White Wall.\u201d She adds: \u201cDuring his first term, I thought Bill Clinton was more directly engaged with the black and civil-rights community on policy matters than Obama was \u2014 and a lot less defensive.\u201d\n\nThe beer summit was the last the public heard from Obama about race for quite some time. Daniel Q. Gillion, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, later analyzed the record of the president\u2019s public comments and found he\u2019d spoken less about race in his first two years than any Democratic president since JFK. \u201cWhenever I gave an interview, I felt the pressure to say, \u2018All Americans, all Americans,\u2019 \u201d says Jones, who resigned from the White House in September 2009 after revelations about his previous political affiliations and beliefs, which were more radical than the White House would have liked. \u201cThere was this anxiety that we shouldn\u2019t look too concerned about blacks. I understood the tightrope from the beginning. He\u2019s the president of all people. But sometimes it felt like he was president of everyone except black people.\u201d\n\nOne can argue that Obama\u2019s hands were tied from the very beginning. This country is still a vexed mess when it comes to race. Even during the first campaign, Obama\u2019s advisers were painfully aware of the electorate\u2019s misgivings. They were hard to miss, if you were in the polling business. The Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg tells an illustrative tale: When his firm surveyed hundreds of likely voters in Macomb County, Michigan (fabled for its dense concentration of Reagan Democrats), \u201cthey were acutely conscious that Obama was African-American. What they said was, \u2018Is he going to govern for everybody? Or is he going to govern for his people?\u2019 That was the critical, pivotal question for them.\u201d These crucial voters wanted to see Obama as a symbol of progress, of how far we\u2019d come. Yes, we can. They didn\u2019t want to see him as a symbol of disaffection, of how far we had to go. \u201cI am sure the campaign was conscious of it,\u201d says Greenberg, \u201cand he had to deal with it if he was going to sustain their support \u2014 governing not for a particular group, but for everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201c Too often, he uses these occasions not to push for greater accountability within law enforcement but to push a narrative that black people should behave more responsibly. \u201d Alicia Garza, co-creator of #BlackLivesMatter\n\nThese same reservations were evident \u2014 maybe even intensified \u2014 in the immediate aftermath of the election. That Gallup survey that trumpeted our optimism? It also found deep streaks of pessimism. Only 32 percent of McCain voters felt proud of Obama. More than half, 56 percent, felt \u201cafraid.\u201d By 2010, the tea party was ascendant, peddling racist imagery. \u201cNo one expected the pictures of him eating watermelon, the pictures making him look like a monkey, the Sambos,\u201d says Arnwine. \u201cThe racism was so base.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s election brought out not just the best of the country, in other words, but its worst. \u201cPortions of white America have literally had a nervous breakdown over a black man being in the White House,\u201d says Anthea Butler, a religious-studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cI mean, here people are, acting so surprised about Donald Trump\u2019s popularity. Hello? He\u2019s the one who asked Obama for a birth certificate!\u201d\n\nWriting in The Atlantic in 2012, Ta-Nehisi Coates tried to show, brick by brick, how the Republican rhetoric of the Obama years has been racialized in ways both subtle and explicit. He noted that Obamacare was framed as \u201creparations.\u201d (Bill Clinton\u2019s stab at universal health care, meanwhile, was generally framed as an excess of \u201cbig government.\u201d) In January 2012, Newt Gingrich declared that \u201cmore people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in history,\u201d when in fact that distinction goes to George W. Bush. When Obama criticized Arizona\u2019s draconian immigration laws, Iowa congressman Steve King said Obama \u201chas a default mechanism in him \u2026 that favors the black person.\u201d And in response to the Gates incident, Glenn Beck said that Obama \u201chas a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.\u201d\n\nThis was the media, Congress, and electorate that Obama had to contend with. How much, realistically, could he explicitly say or do for African-Americans under such circumstances? \u201cI\u2019m deeply conflicted over this fact,\u201d Coates told James Bennet, editor of The Atlantic, in a public discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s smart politics for him not to talk about race.\u201d\n\nNo one contests that Obama is navigating rather treacherous political narrows, but his critics still believe he could have done things differently. \u201cAll presidents bear burdens of some sort,\u201d says Fredrick Harris, the political scientist at Columbia. \u201cRace was one with Obama. But from my perspective, why should black constituents bear the burden of his risk aversion when it comes to issues of race?\u201d\n\nIndeed, some civil-rights leaders see the Black Lives Matter movement (and its abiding impact on the 2016 campaign) as a rebuke to Obama, a symptom of his inability thus far to satisfactorily address racial inequality in this country. \u201cBy now, it\u2019s safe to say that black people have wanted Obama to do more,\u201d says Alicia Garza, one of the movement\u2019s co-founders. \u201cFor the last eight years, everything and nothing has been about race.\u201d She looks at the deaths of young black men and women we\u2019ve recently witnessed \u2014 children, some of them, with Skittles in their pockets \u2014 and feels deep disappointment in Obama\u2019s reactions to them. \u201cToo often,\u201d she says, \u201che uses these occasions not to push for greater accountability within law enforcement, but to push a narrative that black people should behave more responsibly.\u201d She understands that law enforcement is a constituency the president cannot afford to alienate. \u201cBut that assumption erases the power dynamic in this country,\u201d she says, \u201cand it places the responsibility on black people, who are without economic power, political power, and social power to impact their own conditions.\u201d\n\nThese law-enforcement excesses are set against the larger backdrop of an incarceration pandemic: If you are an African-American male, you stand a one in three chance of cycling through prison at some point. But the president\u2019s record on this matter has been mixed. Yes, it was under Obama that Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, which reduced the disparities in punishments for crack- and powder-cocaine possession. But the law did not apply retroactively. After the law passed, thousands still languished in confinement though they no longer met the criteria of such harsh sentences, and Obama, who had the unique power of clemency to set them free, wasn\u2019t doing so. \u201cThe administration could have acted much more boldly to commute the sentences of the thousands of people still serving time under the old, unfair crack law,\u201d says Jeremy Haile, federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.\n\n\u201c Obama has a famous swag. It\u2019s a signal he sends with his walk that says, \u2018I got this.\u2019 He had it with trade, immigration, health care. But he doesn\u2019t have it when he talks about race. \u201d Paul Butler, professor, Georgetown Law School\n\nThe other policy disappointment \u2014 not unrelated \u2014 that inevitably comes up is the issue of African-American unemployment. Talk to black lawmakers, and this is the first thing they mention: How they wish Obama had made extra efforts to strengthen job-creation programs in their struggling districts, where some of those high-profile murders were taking place. The White House would usually respond to this complaint with \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d The answer always left Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who ranks third in the House, underwhelmed. \u201cIf a boat has several holes in the bottom,\u201d he told me, \u201cit ain\u2019t lifting.\u201d\n\nBut the most wrenching reactions to Obama centered on how he did or did not respond to the numerous highly visible acts of violence and injustice against African-Americans during his tenure. Charles Coleman Jr., a civil-rights attorney in New York, talked about two critical moments in Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cSo, George Zimmerman is acquitted,\u201d he says about the man who killed Trayvon Martin. \u201cThere is a significant faction of the country that\u2019s at a loss: How do we have a dialogue on this? And the president delivers an incredible speech.\u201d Extemporaneously, from the looks of it. He said Trayvon could have been him 35 years ago. \u201cIt represented the pinnacle of where he\u2019s been on race. It was an example of the president speaking to black America as a black American, from within our community. He made us feel like he really does get it.\u201d\n\nThen there was Ferguson. Even by Obama standards, the president seemed to react to the shooting of an unarmed black man and the subsequent anger with unusual caution. Obama expressed his distress about the incident, but he also pleaded for calm and chastised those who rioted \u2014 a reaction that devastated many African-Americans, who thought he was emphasizing the stereotype of black lawlessness. \u201cIt delegitimized the frustrations of black people and the reasons for their frustration,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cIt fed into the narrative of, \u2018These are angry black people in the streets.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJon Favreau, the president\u2019s former head speechwriter, understands this point of view but believes the president had little choice. \u201cAn American city was on fire,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s the president. He doesn\u2019t want to further incite violence or instability.\u201d He says people often fail to grasp this: how a few words from the president can crater the stock market or exacerbate a conflict.\n\nAs for the overall arc of Obama\u2019s rhetoric on race, Favreau rejects the conventional wisdom: \u201cThere\u2019s this view that he was courageous to speak out about race before he got to the White House, then he was quiet, and then, after the 2014 midterms, he was free to speak again,\u201d he says. \u201cI never bought into that theory. He had to take on events as they came. There was a financial crisis. An oil spill. Afghanistan. Bin Laden. Health care.\u201d Then came a visible succession of killings of young, unarmed African-Americans. And Obama addressed those too. \u201cI find it frustrating when people say he\u2019s finding his voice and that he\u2019s finally comfortable\u201d discussing race, agrees Jarrett. \u201cHe has always felt perfectly comfortable speaking out when he thought it could make a difference.\u201d\n\nPaul Butler, who worked at the Department of Justice under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, says much of the frustration African-Americans were expressing post-Ferguson was the culmination of many years\u2019 worth of irritation, not over Obama\u2019s caution, necessarily, but his penchant for \u201crespectability politics.\u201d (\u201cBrothers should pull up their pants\u201d was one of his more memorable lines during the campaign.) That a man with the power to address structural inequality would instead talk about behavior really rankled, Butler says, echoing Garza. He cites Obama\u2019s commencement speech at Morehouse College in 2013, in which the president said, \u201cNobody cares if you suffered some discrimination.\u201d\n\n\u201c Every black person has this job whether they want it or not \u2014 and he\u2019s the president. History is going to think it\u2019s his job. \u201d Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies, University of Pennsylvania\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible imagining Hillary going to Wellesley or Smith and saying, \u2018Stop whining about the patriarchy and the glass ceiling. Nobody cares,\u2019 \u201d says Butler, who now teaches at Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cShe would not say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, she would!\u201d protests Jarrett. \u201cShe\u2019d talk about resilience! If you read the whole speech, it was to strengthen them, to make them feel resilient.\u201d\n\nButler disagrees. \u201cObama has a famous swag,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal he sends to us with his walk that says, \u2018I got this.\u2019 He had it with trade, with immigration, with health care. But he doesn\u2019t have it when he talks about race.\u201d\n\nHow does he look then? I ask.\n\n\u201cHe looks tired,\u201d says Butler. \u201cHe looks weary. It\u2019s almost like he suffers from the racial fatigue whites say they suffer from.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring that first election season,\u201d says Nicole Austin-Hillery, the director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Washington, D.C., office, \u201cmy husband and I would go to dinner parties in lovely homes with all these super-well-educated African-Americans, and so many of them talked about how, \u2018Oh, Obama\u2019s going to do this on race, he\u2019s going to do this for black America.\u2019 And my husband and I were the only two who said he has to govern the way he ran \u2014 and he didn\u2019t run on racial-justice issues or reform issues.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible \u2014 reasonable to assume, even \u2014 that Obama never wanted to initiate a huge national conversation about race. Maybe he simply wanted to be a great president, defining \u201cgreat\u201d however he wished. In The Price of the Ticket: Barack Obama and the Rise and Decline of Black Politics, Fredrick Harris notes that Obama didn\u2019t really speak about racial inequality during his first presidential campaign unless he had to. His most impassioned speech on the subject, back in June 2007, came after he\u2019d spent a quarter of the year trailing Hillary Clinton among black supporters. \u201cIt grew stronger when he needed black support to shore up his viability as a candidate,\u201d writes Harris. \u201cIt grew dimmer after black supporters got behind his candidacy en masse.\u201d\n\nEven in his speeches about race, Obama often pushes a more universalist message. In his commemorative remarks in Selma this spring, for instance, he turned the marchers\u2019 struggle into a metaphor for all struggles of the disempowered in the United States: \u201cThe American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge, that\u2019s the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. It\u2019s the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande; the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot, workers to organize against an unjust status quo; the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of a black Reagan,\u201d says Anthea Butler. \u201cHe likes to believe in big, lofty things.\u201d\n\nIn his work, Gates has examined \u201cthe burden of representation,\u201d which he once defined as \u201cthe homely notion that you represent your race, thus that your actions can betray your race or honor it.\u201d It is why Obama is being asked repeatedly whether he\u2019s done enough for black America. It is why Jarrett answers repeatedly that she is not sure why it\u2019s his job. And it is why Anthea Butler ruefully responds, in turn: \u201cEvery black person has this job whether they want it or not \u2014 and he\u2019s the president. History is going to think it\u2019s his job. We\u2019re going to talk about him for the next 500 years.\u201d\n\nBut as Coleman points out, there is no consensus on how to do this job. \u201cThe enigma of President Obama on race,\u201d he explains, \u201cmay be reflective of a larger question of how black Americans engage the conversation of race themselves. We are not a monolithic group, as anyone with a brain can figure out.\u201d To take some crude examples from public life: Jesse Jackson is not Colin Powell is not Ben Carson. \u201cThere are those of us who feel like we don\u2019t have to make it always about race,\u201d he says, \u201cand then there are those for whom it\u2019s the opposite: Race accounts for everything and anything.\u201d Coleman then turns to the question of Obama. \u201cThe difficulty with the president is that I\u2019m not sure I know where he stands.\u201d\n\n\u201c Why should black constituents bear the burden of his risk aversion when it comes to issues of race? \u201d Fredrick Harris, director of the Center on African American Politics and Society, Columbia University\n\nBut this, of course, is what being human is: reconciling contradictions in our muddled identities, containing multitudes. This, in fact, is what Obama is known for \u2014 he sees things on one hand and then on the other, he empathizes with all points of view. At its heart, Obama\u2019s autobiography, Dreams From My Father, was about reckoning with the basic question of who he was. This summer, he revisited his adolescent confusion when speaking to Marc Maron. Noting that Maron\u2019s studio wasn\u2019t far from his old stomping grounds at Occidental College, the president mentioned that those years raised a lot of questions for him, like: \u201cWho am I really? A lot of that revolved around issues of race.\u201d He then elaborated on those issues, channeling the inner dialogue of his younger self: \u201cI am an African-American, but not grounded in a place with a lot of African-American culture\u201d \u2014 Hawaii, he meant. \u201cSo I\u2019m trying to figure out: All right, I\u2019m seen and viewed and understood as a black man in America. What does that mean?\u201d\n\nBack in 2006, I interviewed Obama for this magazine. I asked him if he\u2019d ever read Gates\u2019s essay in The New Yorker about Colin Powell. He hadn\u2019t, though he loved Gates\u2019s work. I mentioned a critical distinction that Gates made: Jackson wanted to be the first black president. Powell, if he were to run, wanted to be the first president who happened to be black.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that those two are necessarily opposing,\u201d Obama told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to pretend I\u2019m not black or that it\u2019s somehow not relevant. But ultimately, I\u2019d want to be a really great president, you know? And then I\u2019d worry about all the other stuff. Because there are a lot of mediocre or poor presidents.\u201d\n\nTo borrow a favorite phrase of the president\u2019s, let me be clear: Obama is tremendously popular with African-Americans. Right now, his approval rate is 91 percent among them, and he\u2019s rarely fallen below 80 percent. Even his critics in this story are still his supporters. Van Jones is his dogged defender on television. Jim Clyburn notes repeatedly that Obama rescued us during a recession, pulled us out of Iraq. Paul Butler, from Georgetown University Law Center, has an Obama action figure sitting on his kitchen table. Whenever he discovers it\u2019s been knocked over, he makes a point of standing it back on its feet.\n\nAnthea Butler notes that there\u2019s a generation of black Americans who don\u2019t just love the president but wish badly to protect him \u2014 not just psychologically but physically. \u201cIf you talk to an older black person,\u201d she tells me, \u201csomebody who\u2019s 70 or older, they\u2019re gonna be like, \u2018Honestly, we just want him to get out alive.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAl Sharpton, one of Obama\u2019s staunchest defenders and a sometime adviser, argues that there is much to be grateful for in this presidency. \u201cYou know how many black people tell me, \u2018I didn\u2019t have health insurance until now\u2019?\u201d The Affordable Care Act is projected to give an estimated 2.9 million more African-Americans coverage by 2016, significantly narrowing the coverage gap between blacks and whites. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely strange to hear people question President Obama who never questioned Bill Clinton,\u201d he continues. \u201cUnder Bill Clinton, we got the crime bill that gave us three strikes and you\u2019re out, and the welfare-reform bill. I too would have liked to see the Obama years do more. I agree with that. But Barack Obama never gave us a bill that hurt us.\u201d\n\nSharpton has gotten a lot of grief for his support of Obama. Cornel West, whose manifold political objections to the president are at this point hard to separate from his personal ones, went so far as to call the reverend \u201cthe bona fide house Negro of the Barack Obama plantation.\u201d But Sharpton says he\u2019s come by his support for the president through some hard-won local lessons. \u201cWhen I sat in New York with the first and only black mayor,\u201d he tells me, referring to David Dinkins, \u201cwe tried to push him on various issues.\u201d Dinkins kept trying to push back, saying he had to govern for all New Yorkers. It was the same defense as Obama\u2019s. \u201cSo we started calling him names,\u201d says Sharpton, \u201cand we started saying, \u2018You shoulda done this that and the other.\u2019 \u201d He pauses. \u201cAnd we ended up with 20 years of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.\u201d\n\n\u201c I think you have to ask yourself: Why is that all on him? \u201d Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the president\n\nObama\u2019s supporters can point to a number of his accomplishments with regard to race. His attorney general Eric Holder rebuilt the civil-rights division within the DOJ; in 2013, Holder also announced the Smart on Crime initiative, which instructs federal prosecutors to avoid bringing charges that would trigger mandatory minimum penalties in the case of certain low-level crimes. Then there is the possibility of the criminal-justice-reform bill. \u201cIf he can sign a bipartisan bill by Christmas,\u201d says Jones, \u201cit\u2019ll make up for the frustrations of the middle years.\u201d\n\nIn February 2014, the White House started the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative, a public-private effort that both partners with communities and helps nourish existing federal programs that boost the prospects of young men of color. (This summer, for instance, the new attorney general, Loretta Lynch, announced a pilot program that would give Pell grants to prisoners.) It won\u2019t end when Obama leaves the White House. This May, Obama announced the formation of the My Brother\u2019s Keeper Alliance, a nonprofit powered by an all-star advisory board (John Legend, Colin Powell, Shaq) and millions of corporate dollars that will attempt to close the opportunity gap for young men of color.\n\n\u201cThis will remain a mission for me and Michelle not just for the rest of my presidency,\u201d he said when announcing the program, \u201cbut for the rest of my life.\u201d How large a role it will play in Obama\u2019s post\u00adpresidential life has yet to be determined. But its conception is entirely consistent with the president\u2019s ideals and modus operandi. It turns him into a community organizer again \u2014 but, this time, with millions of dollars and the Rolodex of a former president of the United States.\n\nThese accomplishments may not be as epic as some have wished. But even the presidency has its limitations. When Jarrett told the audience in Aspen that it isn\u2019t Obama\u2019s responsibility to change race relations in the United States, it may have seemed like a punt. He is, after all, the man with the electoral mandate, the bully pulpit, the veto pen, the executive order, and, for his first two years, the Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress. But her response also had the effect of lobbing the question right back to her mostly white audience. Because here\u2019s how she followed up: \u201cThe question is: What are we gonna do? It\u2019s a collective responsibility. This is not something where suddenly, because the country elected him president, our history just evaporates. It has to happen family by family.\u201d\n\nThe hardest part, for those who root for Obama, is that before long, these issues will no longer be his responsibility at all, at least as commander-in-chief. Sharpton believes African-Americans will sorely miss the simple image of a black family going in and out of the White House each day. Obama\u2019s triumph, as far as he\u2019s concerned, was a mute, daily reminder of the possibility of black ascendancy, an invisible psychological superstructure onto which a whole generation of black children could unconsciously graft their aspirations. \u201cWhen all the smoke clears and Barack Obama\u2019s gone,\u201d says Sharpton, \u201ca white president will succeed a black president. We\u2019ve never been here before. And what will that do emotionally and otherwise in the black community that is already up in arms? When we don\u2019t even have the symbolic charge of seeing a black man and woman, two girls, on the news every night?\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, there is, to borrow another Obama trope, still possibility for change. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a lot of things happen in this last 15 months, and he\u2019s going to go all out to address the problems he\u2019s been reluctant to give extensive statements about,\u201d says Elijah Cummings, who represents Baltimore and was head of the Congressional Black Caucus when Obama first ran for Senate. \u201cI just do.\u201d\n\nHe tells a story about the night of Obama\u2019s first inauguration. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget: My wife and I were at the White House with him, after he finished all the parties. And he said, \u2018Elijah, I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019m going to be able to do. But I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to make the world a better place for the community you\u2019re in.\u2019 \u201d Whatever disappointments there have been in the years since, he believes that is still Obama\u2019s goal. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Cummings, \u201che\u2019s just doing things quietly.\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the October 5, 2015 issue of New York Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "As the historic administration nears its final year, African-American leaders debate: Did\u00a0Barack Obama do enough for his own community?", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "As the historic administration nears its final year, African-American leaders debate: Did\u00a0Barack Obama do enough for his own community?", "title": "The Paradox of the First Black President", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/paradox-of-the-first-black-president.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/02/magazine/05-obama.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@intelligencer", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/02/magazine/05-obama.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "description": "As the historic administration nears its final year, African-American leaders debate: Did\u00a0Barack Obama do enough for his own community?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Paradox of the First Black President"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "barack obama, legacies, new york magazine, politics, obama administration, race", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "barack obama,legacies,new york magazine,politics,obama administration,race", "published_time": "2015-10-07T10:00:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, barack obama, legacies, new york magazine, politics, obama administration, race", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen all the smoke clears and Barack Obama\u2019s gone,\u201d says Sharpton, \u201ca white president will succeed a black president.\nThe Paradox of the First Black President As the historic administration nears its final year, African-American leaders debate: Did Barack Obama do enough for his own community?\nI mentioned a critical distinction that Gates made: Jackson wanted to be the first black president.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the fundamental paradoxes of Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 that we have the Black Lives Matter movement under a black president,\u201d says Fredrick Harris, a political scientist at Columbia University.\nIn a country whose basic genetic blueprint includes the same crooked mutations that made slavery and Jim Crow possible, it is not possible to have a black president surrounded by black aides on Marine One without paying a price."}
