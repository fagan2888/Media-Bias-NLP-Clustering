The troops would be for emergency response in case of infiltration on nearby islands or for missile defense.\n\nIshigaki has jurisdiction over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, which China also claims and calls the Diaoyu islands.\n\nJapan has stepped up its defense readiness, especially on islands in the country\u2019s southwestern region, amid China\u2019s military buildup and its frequent patrols near the disputed islands. China and North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons ambitions top Japan\u2019s security concerns.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s hawkish government enacted new security laws in September despite widespread criticism that they violate Japan\u2019s war-renouncing constitution.\n\nJapan is already constructing a base on the nearby island of Yonaguni to deploy 150 coastal monitoring troops, and plans to deploy hundreds more each on Miyako and Amamioshima islands by 2018.\n\nJapanese coast guard statistics show that Chinese government vessels have entered Japanese-claimed territorial waters surrounding the disputed islands between four and 28 times a month, and approached those waters nearly every day since Japan nationalized some of the disputed islands in September 2012.\n\nRelations between the nations, which have the world\u2019s second- and third-largest economies, are also strained over their World War II history, development of undersea gas deposits in areas near the disputed islands, and other issues.\n\nJapan and China are to hold maritime security talks in Xiamen next month to discuss some of the outstanding issues and ways to avoid security mishaps, according to Japanese media reports.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at twitter.com/mariyamaguchi .
