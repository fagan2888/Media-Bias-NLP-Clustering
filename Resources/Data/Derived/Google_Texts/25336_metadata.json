And in rural states like Iowa, Americans whom many would consider wealthy are taking advantage of this \u201cloophole\u201d and enrolling in coverage paid for by taxpayers.\n\nJesse Patton, an insurance broker living in Iowa, has had clients with net worths ranging from $2 million to $5 million, which often stem from farmland or assets from divorce settlements. And those clients, he said, are enrolled in Medicaid in expansion states like Iowa.\n\n\u201cIt was designed to help the lower-income population,\u201d Patton told the Daily Signal of Medicaid. \u201cBut without the asset test, there are folks that have the financial means and assets there that are good at figuring out how to work the system and capture a benefit they\u2019re entitled to.\u201dSign Up\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states that opted to expand Medicaid did away with an asset test, which was previously used to determine eligibility in regular Medicaid. To qualify for the program, the government considered a combination of income and net worth.\n\nNow, under the law, eligibility in states that did and did not expand Medicaid is linked solely to modified adjusted gross income, keeping it in line with the tax code.\n\n\u201cThis was a move to standardize as much as possible, so you\u2019re bringing in more people, but you\u2019re not complicating the system to where you can\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Joy Wilson, director of health and human services policy at the National Conference of State Legislatures, told the Daily Signal.\n\nThough changing the requirements for Medicaid eligibility put the program in line with the tax code, it also created a \u201cloophole\u201d for those many would consider wealthy to enroll in the government-sponsored program.\n\n\u201cWhen you get into the Midwest and states with an agriculture market, you can have several million [dollars] in farm ground that you\u2019re not reporting with income,\u201d Patton said.\n\nPatton said he\u2019s encountered Iowans whose net worths top $1 million, and they\u2019ve had no problem enrolling in Medicaid because their annual incomes are below 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or $16,000 for an individual\u2014the new income threshold to qualify for Medicaid in states that expanded the program.\n\nThe Iowa broker specifically recalled the case of one woman who had $1.5 million in land and received another $500,000 from a divorce settlement. The land and cash settlements, which went into a trust, were not reported as income, so the woman was able to enroll in the government-run health care program.\n\n\u201cIn our market, we\u2019ve got quite a few people who are either farmers or have gone through divorce settlements where they received considerable amounts of money, but it\u2019s not showing up as income to them at this point in time,\u201d Patton said.\n\nWilson said that though it\u2019s likely there are some worth millions who are enrolling in Medicaid, they represent a small share of the overall Medicaid population.\n\n\u201cWith every system there are issues, and there are always some people trying to help someone who might have a workaround,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I would hope that\u2019s not a large number of people, and I suspect if it became big enough, they would have to go and amend the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say the bulk of the individuals who qualify by income don\u2019t have a lot of assets,\u201d Wilson continued. \u201cThere\u2019s always an exception to the rule, maybe someone\u2019s parents died and they got a $1 million house. But that\u2019s not your typical person coming in at the poverty level.\u201d\n\nBut those who are asset-rich, like enrollees who own large amounts of land, are not the only population who can qualify for Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nEd Haislmaier, a senior fellow in health policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, said that graduate students may find themselves eligible for the program, as many likely qualify for Medicaid based solely on their incomes.\n\nSuch was the case for Hartford, Conn., student Brendan Mahoney, who signed up for health care through Connecticut\u2019s exchange when it opened in 2013 and learned he was eligible for Medicaid. Mahoney, a third-year law student at the University of Connecticut, had a school-sponsored health plan prior to Obamacare\u2019s implementation but found he could enroll in Medicaid instead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s distorting the program away from those whom it was designed to help who are most vulnerable and don\u2019t have other options,\u201d Haislmaier said. \u201cUnlike the farmer or divorc\u00e9e who could cover it out of dipping into their substantial assets, or the graduate student who could cover it through student loans or a part-time job, the poor kid or the disabled adult, don\u2019t have those options. They\u2019re the ones whom Medicaid was set up for.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act with the intention of expanding coverage for low-income Americans. Under the law\u2014and in the 31 states and the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid\u2014adults who earn below 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or around $16,000, can enroll in the program.\n\nThe federal government will cover all the costs of Medicaid expansion until the end of this year. Participating states are required by cover 10 percent of the costs by 2022.\n\nHaislmaier warned that wealthy Americans who can dip into their assets to pay for health insurance are taking advantage of a program designed for people who don\u2019t share the same lifestyle.\n\nPages", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Under the Affordable Care Act, states that opted to expand Medicaid did away with an asset test.", "dcterms.title": "Revealed: Millionaires Are Qualifying for Medicaid Under Obamacare", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "\u00a91991\u20132014 The National Interest", "og": {"site_name": "The National Interest", "description": "Under the Affordable Care Act, states that opted to expand Medicaid did away with an asset test.", "title": "Revealed: Millionaires Are Qualifying for Medicaid Under Obamacare", "url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/revealed-millionaires-are-qualifying-medicaid-under-15181", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/Obama_7.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "dcterms.subject": "Politics, , Obamacare, Medicaid, Health Care, entitlements, Affordable Care Act", "abstract": "Under the Affordable Care Act, states that opted to expand Medicaid did away with an asset test.", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "revisit-after": "1 day", "dcterms.creator": "Melissa Quinn", "MobileOptimized": "width", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Politics, , Obamacare, Medicaid, Health Care, entitlements, Affordable Care Act", "news_keywords": "Politics, , Obamacare, Medicaid, Health Care, entitlements, Affordable Care Act", "dcterms.publisher": "The Center for the National Interest", "twitter": {"description": "Under the Affordable Care Act, states that opted to expand Medicaid did away with an asset test.", "title": "Revealed: Millionaires Are Qualifying for Medicaid Under Obamacare", "url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/revealed-millionaires-are-qualifying-medicaid-under-15181", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/Obama_7.jpg", "site": "@thenatlinterest", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, width=device-width", "description": "Under the Affordable Care Act, states that opted to expand Medicaid did away with an asset test."}, "article_summary": "In states that expanded Medicaid, people with high net worths and low monthly incomes qualify for Medicaid because of loosened eligibility requirements implemented under Obamacare.\nMillionaires living in states that expanded Medicaid are benefiting from government-sponsored health insurance, and taxpayers are footing the bill for it.\nThey\u2019re the ones whom Medicaid was set up for.\u201dThe Obama administration expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act with the intention of expanding coverage for low-income Americans.\nAnd those clients, he said, are enrolled in Medicaid in expansion states like Iowa.\nWilson said that though it\u2019s likely there are some worth millions who are enrolling in Medicaid, they represent a small share of the overall Medicaid population."}
