Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said Friday that President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran was \u201cnot black and white,\u201d and she did not know if she would vote for it.\n\nMrs. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s refusal to commit to the deal challenged Mr. Obama\u2019s assertion that lawmakers face a stark choice between the deal or war. A day earlier, Sen. Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat poised to lead Senate Democrats in 2017, announced he would not support it.\n\n\u201cThis is not black and white. It\u2019s not a no-brainer,\u201d Mrs. Wasserman Schultz, Florida Democrat, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Chuck Schumer breaks with Obama, opposes Iran deal\n\n\u201cI know Chuck\u2019s decision was based on what he personally concluded was the most likely way of preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the choice that I\u2019m going to have to make after I go home and talk to my constituents as well.\u201d\n\nShe predicted the deal would ultimately survive Congress because there would not be enough votes to override Mr. Obama\u2019s veto of a resolution of disapproval.\n\n\u201cIt is troubling and difficult for the deal to lose as prominent senator like Chuck Schumer, but it\u2019s absolutely completely still possible and probably likely that this is a deal that will go through,\u201d Mrs. Wasserman Schultz said. \u201cAt the end of the day Republicans will have the votes to override his veto.\u201d\n\nDespite opposition from top Democrats such as Mr. Schumer, she said that Republicans \u201cwere the ones who were irresponsible with an immediate knee-jerk reaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans have not carefully evaluated this deal, Democrats are and that\u2019s one of the big differences between our parties,\u201d Mrs. Wasserman Schultz said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
