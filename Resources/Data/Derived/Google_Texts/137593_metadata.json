She was 17. The Porter Ranch teen\u2019s story drew nationwide attention because the liver transplant she needed was denied by her family\u2019s health insurer, CIGNA.\n\nSince then, her family established the Nataline Sarkisyan Foundation and has organized an annual fashion show to raise scholarship funds for students interested in the arts and medicine. The seventh annual show is scheduled for Saturday in Calabasas.\n\nIt is for the family\u2019s ongoing community service and activism that the plaque is being dedicated, said Rotary Club member and sponsor Jake Parunyan.\n\n\u201cHer mom\u2019s been working so hard to change our insurance system,\u201d Parunyan said.\n\nParunyan, who owns several dry cleaning businesses, said he has worked to revitalize Veterans Memorial Park at the corner of Zelzah Avenue and Chatsworth Street for the last five years.\n\nThe park features hundreds of bricks on a walkway with the names of veterans and other loved ones and a statue of a young boy holding an American flag. Parunyan said he purchased that statue himself to honor his parents who came to the United States from Turkey.\n\n\u201cMy father and mother\u2019s dream was to come to America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was time for me to thank the United States, to honor the veterans and my mother and father.\u201d\n\nNataline\u2019s mother, Hilda Sarkisyan, said she is honored that her daughter\u2019s memory will continue at the park, where heroes are remembered.\n\nThe Sarkisyans have been working to repeal a provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that protects insurance companies from being sued for lack of coverage. It was that provision that prevented the family from suing CIGNA for deeming Nataline\u2019s transplant medically unnecessary.\n\nThe provision is so tightly ingrained into the way health insurance works that it is untouchable even under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBelow Nataline\u2019s photograph on the memorial tile are the words \u201cTogether we can make change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more people know about Nataline\u2019s story, the more people will say we have to change the laws,\u201d Hilda Sarkisyan said. \u201cInnocent kids are dying. Now she\u2019s an angel. She\u2019s helping me to be an angel for others.\u201d\n\nThe free, public unveiling of the plaque will be held at 7 p.m. Thursday at Veterans Memorial Park in Granada Hills, at the corner of Zelzah Avenue and Chatsworth Street.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A plaque in honor of a teenager whose death sparked a nationwide outcry for health care reform will be unveiled Thursday night at Veterans Memorial Park in Granada Hills.The Rotary Club", "title": "Memorial plaque of Nataline Sarkisyan to be unveiled in Granada Hills park", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140709/memorial-plaque-of-nataline-sarkisyan-to-be-unveiled-in-granada-hills-park", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Memorial plaque of Nataline Sarkisyan to be unveiled in Granada Hills park"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "A plaque in honor of a teenager whose death sparked a nationwide outcry for health care reform will be unveiled Thursday night at Veterans Memorial Park in Granada Hills.The Rotary Club", "title": "Memorial plaque of Nataline Sarkisyan to be unveiled in Granada Hills park", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140709/memorial-plaque-of-nataline-sarkisyan-to-be-unveiled-in-granada-hills-park", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "news, Breaking teaking News, LA Daily News Top Story", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "news, Breaking teaking News, LA Daily News Top Story"}, "article_summary": "A plaque in honor of a teenager whose death sparked a nationwide outcry for health care reform will be unveiled Thursday night at Veterans Memorial Park in Granada Hills.\nParunyan, who owns several dry cleaning businesses, said he has worked to revitalize Veterans Memorial Park at the corner of Zelzah Avenue and Chatsworth Street for the last five years.\nShe\u2019s helping me to be an angel for others.\u201dThe free, public unveiling of the plaque will be held at 7 p.m. Thursday at Veterans Memorial Park in Granada Hills, at the corner of Zelzah Avenue and Chatsworth Street.\nThe Rotary Club of Granada Hills will unveil a granite plaque that displays an etched image of Nataline Sarkisyan, who died on Dec. 20, 2007.\nThe provision is so tightly ingrained into the way health insurance works that it is untouchable even under the Affordable Care Act."}
