He said the movement to increase it further needs to be careful not to reduce jobs or increase prices of products.\n\n\u201cThere are two concerns. How does that affect small businesses and their decisions to hire people or lay them off if minimum wage goes up too fast? We don\u2019t want to create a situation where we reduce the number of jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second issue associated with that is concern about the prices of products increasing and those customers having to pay a higher cost for services or goods.\u201d\n\nReichert thinks the minimum wage should be handled in a thoughtful way with consideration and input from small businesses.\n\n\u201cIn Snoqualmie we have a lot of small businesses operating and you want to keep those healthy, you want to keep them vibrant,\u201d he said.\n\nReichert said he was excited to see bipartisan support for small businesses. Now he is trying to make the Section 179 deduction of the IRS tax code permanent. Section 179 lets business owners fully deduct the price of equipment or software during the tax year, in order to get businesses to invest in themselves.\n\nHe also has plans for two small business bills.\n\n\u201cOne, allowing employees to be able to participate in a business by investing their money into the small business they work for, the other one is allowing small businesses to have access to certain revenue sooner. Past law has been \u2018in 10 years you have access to this revenue.\u2019 It\u2019s been changed to seven years, we want to get it down to five years.\u201c he said.\n\nBuilding on the small business question, Reichert then addressed the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He said there are many aspects of the act that Republicans like, but some they want changed. The employer mandate, which requires businesses with 51 to 100 employees to supply health insurance or face a fine, is one of those things.\n\nHe explained that sometime in 2016 Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, will propose a single Republican healthcare plan.\n\n\u201cOur alternative is that we want to give more choice back to the patient, we want to build that opportunity for patients and doctors to build that personal relationship without having the government engaged or involved,\u201d he said.\n\nReichert was also asked about the Alpine Lakes, officially designated a wilderness area in December 2014, seven years after he first sponsored the bill to do so. He reported that the bill was one of the last bills of the 2014 session to pass, adding 22,000 acres to the area.\n\nThe Congressman also spoke about education, stating that he is working on a bill that will help states craft an education that best fits them instead of overwhelming kids with standardized tests.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the bill is to try and put the responsibility back on the parents, the teachers, the superintendents, the principals, and the local communities,\u201d he said. \u201cEach community and school is different, it creates an atmosphere where education needs to be molded and modeled for that community and I think that\u2019s where we want to go with this legislation.\u201d\n\nAlthough he was not directly asked about it, Reichert also spoke to the growing distrust of police in the country and the divide between the police and the communities they serve.\n\n\u201cI asked the speaker to put a task force together to look at how we got to this separation and I\u2019m looking for some of the answers to how we can bring the police and communities back together,\u201d Reichert said.\n\n\u201cThe community cannot keep the community safe alone, and the police cannot keep the community safe alone, they need to be working with them.\u201d\n\nValley representatives meeting with District 8 U.S. Representative Dave Reichert Thursday, are, from left: School Board Director Carolyn Simpson, Snoqualmie Valley Hospital CEO Rodger McCollum, future Snoqualmie City Councilman Brad Toft, Rep.
