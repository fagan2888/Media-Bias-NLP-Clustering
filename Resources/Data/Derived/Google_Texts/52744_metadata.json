Or a dog.\n\nToday, he never works without them, although the guns are real and Patriot isn\u2019t your typical family pet. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird,\u201d he says, still smiling.\n\nEnglish, 36, and Patriot, a 6-year-old German shepherd from \u2014 yes, Germany \u2014 form the latest K-9 unit in the Keene Police Department, an invaluable resource on many levels. From tracking down suspects and lost individuals to nosing out narcotics, the pair follow a line of K-9 teams in Keene that have enhanced law-enforcement capabilities and officer safety.\n\nLately, Patriot has been called upon to investigate a string of shoplifting incidents in the area, and he\u2019s often front and center in rooting out the escalating, and alarming, influx of heroin. English says heroin is actually one of the easiest drugs for a dog to identify because of its strong odor, comparable to cat urine.\n\nPatriot is especially valuable in tracking down a suspect. \u201cIf the bad guy is in a building and Patriot finds him, he\u2019ll bark and let us know he\u2019s hiding,\u201d English says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go in the building and risk our safety; we can stand outside and call the suspect to us.\u201d\n\nOn patrol Thursday night, Patriot wasn\u2019t needed, although, as always, he was alert the entire shift. Typically, he got some exercise and played fetch at an abandoned parking lot, but because of a long overtime shift the night before, English says he\u2019s a little off. Still, Patriot isn\u2019t about to let anyone get too close to him without a menacing bark from his kennel in back.\n\nAlmost all black, Patriot is difficult to see in the car\u2019s black interior, especially at night. The back is his domain, the backseat taken out and modified for a police dog. It\u2019s equipped with a regulated temperature system monitored by a computer. Training is so precise that Patriot always enters and exits on the driver\u2019s side, except when duty calls and the push of a button on English\u2019s uniform releases him out the passenger door.\n\nOtherwise, Patriot is the ideal rider, never whining \u2014 bathroom breaks come when they come \u2014 \u201ckind of like us,\u201d English chuckles.\n\nPatriot lives with English and his wife, Jen, and their young children, Tyler and Dayna (and a third on the way). While he\u2019s always up for a game of fetch or hide-and-seek with Tyler, Patriot isn\u2019t the cuddling type. Rather than curl up on the couch, he patrols the house, for that\u2019s the way he\u2019s wired and trained.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a working dog and a pet dog is huge, like the difference between a high school athlete and an Olympic athlete,\u201d English says.\n\nPatriot arrived in Keene in 2010, the successor to the K-9 team comprised of officer Steven Tenney and Laika. Before that, officer Brian Costa, now Keene\u2019s police chief, had a seven-year run with Niko. (An aside: Don\u2019t miss Costa\u2019s emotional reflections on Niko in the online video that accompanies this article.)\n\nWatching Laika and Niko track through the years, English says he developed a keen interest in the K-9 unit and its unique skills. \u201cYou\u2019d be looking for somebody and think by looking at a (barren) area, there\u2019s no way someone came through here. Sure enough, they\u2019d pick up a scent. That impressed me so much,\u201d he says.\n\nPatriot came to Keene through a $5,000 grant from the Working Dog Foundation. English, Costa and Tenney picked him up late at night on May 8, 2010, at Logan International Airport in Boston. He was accompanied by two other dogs and Andy Schaeffer, a captain in the German Police Department who has worked closely with the foundation since it was established in New Hampshire in 1995.\n\nPatriot lived in Germany his first 18 months, and responded to commands in his native language; thus, English had to learn some German. He still remembers that first night he brought Patriot home.\n\n\u201cI got home about 1, 2 in the morning, brought him inside and he woke my wife up,\u201d English says. \u201cIt was pretty much bonding the first couple of weeks before training started.\u201d\n\nEnglish didn\u2019t name Patriot; his original name was Milo, coincidentally the same name as the English family\u2019s pet Labrador retriever. His name was given by Air Force Staff Sgt. Bernard E.J. Reed shortly before he deployed to Iraq for a second tour.\n\nReed donated the $5,000 to the foundation with the intent it be earmarked for Keene\u2019s police dog. He requested it be named Patriot in honor of those who serve in the armed forces \u2014 and because he loves the New England Patriots.\n\nThe team went through vigorous training at the N.H. Police K-9 Academy at the Pease Air National Guard base in Portsmouth, and still does today. English and Patriot travel there once a week, as the certification process encompassing obedience, apprehension and narcotics is demanding. They just went through three certification exams this spring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerve-wracking still, and I\u2019ve done four of them,\u201d English says of the exams, adding, \u201cAs I look back on it, it amazes me I was able to get it all together and we have the product that we do.\u201d\n\nEnglish spends hours on his own training with Patriot, sometimes having Tyler hide so Patriot can seek. While the game gives father-and-son bonding time, it\u2019s also serious training for Patriot. In addition to his own shifts, the team is on call and invariably family functions are interrupted. English and Patriot also make numerous appearances at local schools and public events.\n\nHe says Costa and Tenney have given him plenty of advice through experiences gained with their dogs, advice he leans on. And his colleagues are supportive. \u201cWithout the cooperation of my co-workers, we would not be where we are today,\u201d English says. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t interested, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to progress to this level.\u201d\n\nThe praise is twofold: Costa says English is an extremely knowledgeable and effective handler and Patriot has developed into an exceptional working dog.\n\nEnglish is a native of Southbury, Conn., a town of about 20,000 in the southern part of the state, which explains the New York Yankees floor mat in his cruiser. Although his mother didn\u2019t allow pets or toy guns in the house, he grins and says he still loved playing cops and robbers with kids in the neighborhood.\n\nHe went to Keene State College, graduating in 2001 with a safety and occupational health degree, though he says he only half-heartedly looked for jobs in that field. He was on the swim team, specializing in sprints, and in the rugby club. He met his wife at Keene State. And he served in the Marine Corps Reserves.\n\nThe busy schedule \u201ckept me out of trouble at school. May have been a good thing. Missed some of the rowdier parties,\u201d he quips.\n\nHis Reserves unit was activated as the war in Iraq ramped up, and that led to a stint in Zamboanga City in the southern Philippines in 2003-04, where it guarded the city\u2019s air strip. He and Jen were already engaged, and with some help from priests at St. Joseph\u2019s Church in Walpole, hurriedly got married before he was deployed.\n\nHis interest in law enforcement had also been enhanced through his in-laws, who worked part-time in the Vermont Sheriffs\u2019 Association. That steered him to the Cheshire County Sheriff\u2019s Office, preceded by a short spell at Bergeron Construction, and he found his calling.\n\n\u201cThree or four former Marines were in the department. It was a great group of guys, a mixture of young and old. I felt very comfortable with (then-Sheriff Dick Foote\u2019s) leadership style,\u201d English says.\n\nHe put down roots in Keene and his jump to the police department was all but inevitable.\n\nAlthough this Thursday night was relatively quiet, the team never knows what it may face shift to shift. In last October\u2019s tension-filled riots during the Keene Pumpkin Festival, the pair patrolled for hours just behind the police lines with Patriot discouraging those who breached the wall from heading downtown.\n\nPatriot has about two to three years of active duty left, depending on his health, and so far he\u2019s held up well. Police dogs retire at about 9 years old, and live out their lives with their handlers. English can see himself getting another K-9, though he says, \u201cOutside of having kids, this is probably the hardest job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nAnd one of the most rewarding.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "Sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his patrol car, Patriot contently slurping water in back, Josh English smiles and says his mother wouldn\u2019t allow even toy guns in the house when he was a kid.
