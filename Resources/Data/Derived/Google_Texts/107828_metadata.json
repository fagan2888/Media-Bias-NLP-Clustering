British Airways has launched its newest form of in-flight Paws & Relax channel based on research that has shown the fuzzy little creatures can calm a nervous flier.\n\nWhen the company discovered animals can relax a stressed person, they teamed up with Battersea Dogs & Cats Home in London for a photo shoot to promote their new channel, along with the animal rescue foundation. The videos for long flights will feature Simon\u2019s Cat in Pawtrait, the BBC\u2019s The Secret Life of Cats, and America\u2019s Cutest Dog. A few of the pets starred on the channel are homeless pets up for adoption at Battersea, and they include Alfie the Pug, Sky the Siberian Husky, Angelica the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, along with kittens Karma, Knight, and Karis.\n\n\u201cIt might sound barking, but there\u2019s lots of research to suggest that watching pets can enhance overall well-being,\u201d Richard D\u2019Cruze, British Airways\u2019 in-flight entertainment manager, told The Telegraph. \u201cWe have sniffed out some fantastic content that is cute, comforting and sure to appeal to travelers of all ages.\u201d\n\nFear of flying is actually a complex psychological issue that could stem from the fear or heights, being over water, fear of the unknown, concerns of terrorist attacks, airline accidents, loss of control, fear of crowded spaces, and a number of other concerns, according to Anxiety and Depression Association of America. The anxiety disorder usually occurs expectantly while the passenger is inflight and panic sets in. Having videos to calm the nerves and distract the individual can help decrease phobia triggers and lessen the person\u2019s overall fear.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "british, airways, launches, cute, animal, tv, channel, calm, passengers, paws, and, relax", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cute animals help flight passengers calm down and reduces their anxiety.", "title": "Cute Animal Channel Launched To Relax Anxious Plane Passengers [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/british-airways-launches-cute-animal-tv-channel-calm-passengers-paws-and-relax-302722", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/11/cute-cuddly-animal-channel-launched-during-flight.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cute animals help flight passengers calm down and reduces their anxiety.", "title": "Cute Animal Channel Launched To Relax Anxious Plane Passengers [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/british-airways-launches-cute-animal-tv-channel-calm-passengers-paws-and-relax-302722", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/11/cute-cuddly-animal-channel-launched-during-flight.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/11/cute-cuddly-animal-channel-launched-during-flight.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-11T17:29:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T11:27:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Cute animals help flight passengers calm down and reduces their anxiety."}, "article_summary": "British Airways has launched its newest form of in-flight Paws & Relax channel based on research that has shown the fuzzy little creatures can calm a nervous flier.\n\u201cIt might sound barking, but there\u2019s lots of research to suggest that watching pets can enhance overall well-being,\u201d Richard D\u2019Cruze, British Airways\u2019 in-flight entertainment manager, told The Telegraph.\nHaving videos to calm the nerves and distract the individual can help decrease phobia triggers and lessen the person\u2019s overall fear.\nThe videos for long flights will feature Simon\u2019s Cat in Pawtrait, the BBC\u2019s The Secret Life of Cats, and America\u2019s Cutest Dog.\nCats and dogs are adorable to most, but for many watching their little paws sway and tails wag as they jump and play can relax and calm people who become stressed out on airplanes."}
