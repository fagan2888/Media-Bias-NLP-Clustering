In 2003, when Gallup did a survey to determine what the public thought of various federal agencies, the CDC topped the list, with 66 percent of respondents describing it as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d\n\nLast year, a similar Gallup poll showed that the CDC\u2019s approval rating had dropped to 60 percent, which was still better than any other agency. The CDC has seen the country through SARS and the swine flu virus. The general perception was not only that it did important, apolitical work, but that it was highly competent.\n\nAnd then came Ebola.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak is not exactly enhancing the CDC\u2019s reputation for competence. At first, the agency reassured the public that American hospitals were ready for anything. That has turned out not to be the case. When Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas, the CDC did not immediately fly in an expert team \u2014 something that the CDC director, Tom Frieden, now says it should have done. Most recently, the CDC appears to have allowed one of the Dallas nurses who helped Duncan to take a flight from Ohio to Texas even though she had a slightly raised temperature. When it became clear that she had contracted the virus \u2014 the second nurse to do so \u2014 Frieden was forced to admit that letting her on the plane was a mistake.\n\nMeanwhile, Frieden, a highly respected public health expert, had to walk back some of his remarks. Congress \u2014 including Democrats \u2014 appears dismayed. Perhaps the biggest mistake the CDC made was that its voluntary guidelines for treating Ebola patients were too lax.\n\nAre there extenuating circumstances? To hear infectious disease specialists tell it, the answer is yes. Like all federal agencies, the CDC saw significant cuts to its funding thanks to sequestration. Another expert, Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health, told me that because the chances of Ebola being imported to the U.S. were considered low, preparing for it was not considered a good use of scarce public money.\n\nIn addition, the CDC, like many federal agencies, had its mission transformed after 9/11. Julie Gerberding, an appointee of the Bush administration, changed its emphasis to bioterrorism and other potential security threats.\n\n\u201cShe also brought in efficiency experts who were anathema to scientists,\u201d said Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of the seminal 1994 book, The Coming Plague.\n\nMorale plummeted, and many of its best scientists fled.\n\nFair enough. But it is also true that the CDC was too hubristic in its approach to Ebola, and the consequence is that its staff now looks like bumblers.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s unfortunate habit of saying things as if they were certainties only to have to acknowledge that its judgment was questionable, \u201ccan cause people to lose faith in the public health system,\u201d said Dr. Richard Wenzel, an infectious disease specialist at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nWhen you think about it, many of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cscandals\u201d have been failures of competence. The Secret Service let a man leap over the White House fence and get into the White House. The Veterans Health Administration covered up unconscionable delays in treating veterans. The error-ridden rollout of the Obamacare website was a nightmare for people trying to sign up for health insurance. The Republican right takes it as an article of faith that the national government can\u2019t do anything right. Problems like these only help promote that idea.\n\nAnd now comes the CDC, thrust in a role for which it was designed: advising us and protecting us from a potential contagion. With every new mistake, it becomes, in the public eye, just another federal agency that can\u2019t get it right.\n\nJoe Nocera is a New York Times columnist and may be contacted through nytimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The CDC used to be an agency we had faith in, but Ebola has changed that, the columnist says.", "og": {"description": "The CDC used to be an agency we had faith in, but Ebola has changed that, the columnist says.", "title": "Joe Nocera: With every new mistake, CDC becomes just another agency that can't get it right", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20141019-joe-nocera-with-every-new-mistake-cdc-becomes-just-another-agency-that-can-t-get-it-right.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20141019-obama_ebola_politics_40355483.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/OBAMA_EBOLA_POLITICS_40355483.JPG", "height": 447}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-10-20T14:29:40Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-10-20T01:15:29Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Joe Nocera: With every new mistake, CDC becomes just another agency that can't get it right\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20141019-joe-nocera-with-every-new-mistake-cdc-becomes-just-another-agency-that-can-t-get-it-right.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20141019-obama_ebola_politics_40355483.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/OBAMA_EBOLA_POLITICS_40355483.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1991301\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-20T01:15:29Z\", \"section\": \"Latest Columns\", \"author\": \"JOE NOCERA\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20141019-obama_ebola_politics_40355483.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/OBAMA_EBOLA_POLITICS_40355483.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-10-20T01:15:29Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd4f\"", "article_summary": "With every new mistake, it becomes, in the public eye, just another federal agency that can\u2019t get it right.\nMeanwhile, Frieden, a highly respected public health expert, had to walk back some of his remarks.\nThe Republican right takes it as an article of faith that the national government can\u2019t do anything right.\nFor years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been the most trusted agency in the federal government.\nPerhaps the biggest mistake the CDC made was that its voluntary guidelines for treating Ebola patients were too lax."}
