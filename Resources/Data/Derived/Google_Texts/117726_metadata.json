And doubts.\n\n\u201cJanet Yellen is much more influential than anybody right now,\u201d says Kotlikoff, who clocked in at number 19 on the Economist magazine\u2019s top-25 list. Yet the Federal Reserve chairwoman (and Kotlikoff\u2019s former professor) was not on the list, which deliberately excluded current central bankers, perhaps because the magazine felt they\u2019d have a leg up based on its criteria: the number of quotes in media, social media, and blogs during the 90 days ending December 11, 2014.\n\nA 30-year BU veteran, Kotlikoff is a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor and a College of Arts & Sciences professor of economics. He says it\u2019s unlikely that he would have put himself on the list, but he\u2019s glad that the Economist did. He joins powerhouses like Nobel winner Paul Krugman (#3), ex\u2013Fed chairs Ben Bernanke (#5) and Alan Greenspan (#9) (former central bankers were recognized), and best-selling Capital in the Twenty-First Century author Thomas Piketty (#13). He\u2019s also pleased that the honor reflects well on BU, which is \u201ca great kind of Horatio Alger story,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of pulled itself up by its bootstraps\u201d and now boasts a world-class economics department.\n\nDuring the time frame studied by the Economist, Kotlikoff\u2019s media utterances included a debate with Piketty; his regular column for PBS NewsHour; and a radio interview (along with Ralph Nader) on the question \u201cIs Capitalism Working?\u201d\n\nCritics pounced on the Economist\u2019s list, noting that while omitting Yellen\u2014and all other women\u2014it did not exclude presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks. The magazine also admitted that the economist rated number one, MIT\u2019s Jonathan Gruber, wouldn\u2019t have cracked the rankings had it not been for all the media attention given last fall to his public blunder about Obamacare. (An architect of the health reform law, Gruber said \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d helped pass it.) \u201cThat isn\u2019t influence\u2014that\u2019s a gaffe,\u201d objected a writer for the website FiveThirtyEight.\n\nKotlikoff\u2019s research interests include public finance and accounting, health care, and banking. \u201cI\u2019m like a lot of economists. I work on a whole range of fields,\u201d he says. \u201cAcademically, I try and work on big issues. Like, I\u2019ve written a paper about robots\u201d with economists from other schools.\n\nLess known to professional colleagues, he says, is his interest in personal finance. He has a financial planning software company, and his coauthored book Get What\u2019s Yours, published this month, is about maximizing Social Security benefits\u2014\u201cwhich seems like it should be straightforward, but it\u2019s incredibly complicated.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times once dubbed Kotlikoff a \u201cliberal economist,\u201d a description he shuns. \u201cThe Republicans think I\u2019m a Democrat; the Democrats think I\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m apolitical. I think that politicians are, in general, lower life-forms.\u201d He advised former US senator Mike Gravel, who unsuccessfully sought both the Democratic and Libertarian presidential nominations in 2008, and he does cop to a friendly relationship with former Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan.\n\nKotlikoff himself launched a short-lived independent run for president in 2012. His platform of \u201cPurple Plans,\u201d so called because he thought they\u2019d appeal to red and blue states, included new, progressive consumption and inheritance taxes, a voucher-based health care system, and a mandatory private-savings system for future retirees.\n\nThe crescent-shaped desk in Kotlikoff\u2019s office spans four windows with a great view of the Charles River, and its corner is littered with photos of the economist hugging and playing with his two sons as young boys (they\u2019re now 24 and 17). Did he tell them when he made the Economist\u2019s list?\n\nHis answer reflects either modesty or a list skeptic\u2019s bemusement: \u201cI think I might have spared them this one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BU Today", "description": "<em>Economist</em> honoree is pleased\u2014and disbelieving", "title": "BU\u2019s Kotlikoff One of Most Influential Economists | BU Today | Boston University", "url": "http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/bus-kotlikoff-one-of-most-influential-economists-magazine-says/", "image": "http://www.bu.edu/today/files/2010/06/Kotlikoff_t.jpg", "type": "article"}, "last-updated": "2015-02-27T09:03:43-05:00", "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "Copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Boston University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd359f\"", "article_summary": "BU\u2019s Kotlikoff One of Most Influential Economists Economist honoree is pleased\u2014and disbelievingBeing ranked among the world\u2019s most influential economists is an honor that BU\u2019s Laurence Kotlikoff welcomes.\n\u201cThe Republicans think I\u2019m a Democrat; the Democrats think I\u2019m a Republican.\nDid he tell them when he made the Economist\u2019s list?\n\u201cJanet Yellen is much more influential than anybody right now,\u201d says Kotlikoff, who clocked in at number 19 on the Economist magazine\u2019s top-25 list.\nA 30-year BU veteran, Kotlikoff is a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor and a College of Arts & Sciences professor of economics."}
