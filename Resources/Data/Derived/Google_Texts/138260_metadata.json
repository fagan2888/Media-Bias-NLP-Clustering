But this Obama lie is particularly egregious. As the Wall Street Journal notes, the 529 plan\u2013introduced as part of the Bush tax cuts\u2013has allowed millions of middle-class American families to invest in their children\u2019s education.\n\nFew of these families can afford to invest in the market themselves, but through their 529 plans, their children have been able to take advantage of Wall Street\u2019s prosperity.\n\nThe administration counters that its new proposed education tax credits would help make up the shortfall\u2013i.e. would be compensation for what the government taxes away from the gains in 529 accounts, or would somehow compete with those gains.\n\nThat\u2019s a ludicrous\u2013and risky\u2013bet against the stock market over the long term. And it will discourage savings and investment, when the right solution to rising college costs is to tackle the student-loan racket the federal government runs.\n\nWhat Obama is proposing is the equivalent of Obamacare for education: taxing away plans people like, to replace them with inferior, government-run plans the left would prefer people (except themselves) to choose. It punishes responsible parents and high-achieving students.\n\nClosing loopholes makes sense\u2013but only in the context of broader reform.\n\nFor now, Obama is proposing to take away kids\u2019 college savings\u2013to give them \u201cfree\u201d education. And they cheer. Wise up, kids.\n\nSenior Editor-at-Large Joel B.
