With President Obama celebrating two monumental victories from the past week, Obamacare and gay marriage legalization, Jon Stewart couldn’t help but notice that conservative pundits were boasting a few victories of their own in energy and lethal injection.

Stewart explained on Tuesday’s “Daily Show” that the Supreme Court’s decision to allow for the continued use of a controversial drug for lethal injections and scrap EPA rules to eliminate air pollutants had conservatives grinning from ear to ear. Major triumph!

“Congratulations. What a great victory,” Stewart said. “Yes, gay people have the right to marry, and poor people have the right to insurance, but on the bright side, American’s can still kill prisoners painfully and everyone else slowly.”
