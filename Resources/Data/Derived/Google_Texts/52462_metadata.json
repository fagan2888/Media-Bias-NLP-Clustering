Corroded plumbing can be found in an older home\u2019s pipes or those that connect the house to a main water pipe in the street. Such exposure can be dangerous. High levels of lead in the bloodstream can significantly affect mental and physical development in children.\n\nRelated: After Flint, Here\u2019s How to Test Your Water for Lead\n\nThe only way to find out if your water is contaminated is to have it tested, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your water has lead levels above 15 parts per billion, then the EPA says you must take action.\n\nOne way to immediately protect yourself and your family is to use certified filters that can remove lead from water. The solution is also being implemented in Flint, where so far it has been successful.\n\nThe water filters certified by NSF International, an organization that sets public health and safety standards, are only recommended if lead levels don\u2019t exceed 150 parts per billion. However, some reports from Flint show that filters are working in houses that reported much higher levels.\n\nRelated: Flint\u2019s Drinking Water Crisis Just Got More Toxic with Legionnaire\u2019s Disease\n\nThe EPA still recommends that those most vulnerable to lead, such as pregnant women, breastfeeding women and children under 6, should drink only bottled water even after filters are installed. To keep filters in tip-top shape, they should be installed as instructed and replaced before they expire. Faucet aerators should also be cleaned regularly. Just unscrew the aerator at the top of the faucet and remove any debris it has collected.\n\nNSF International has put out a lead filtration guide and a list of certified water filters that remove lead. The Fiscal Times cross-checked NSF International\u2019s list of certified filters with water filters recommended by Consumer Reports to come up with the following list of best water filters for lead removal.\n\nFaucet-mounted filters\n\nCulligan FM-15A\n\n$20\n\nCulligan FM-25\n\n$25\n\nCountertop water filters\n\nAmway eSpring 10-0188\n\n$1000\n\nShaklee BestWater MTS2000 #82300\n\n$260\n\nUndersink water filters\n\nMulti-Pure MP750SB water filter\n\n$430\n\nAqua-Pure by Cuno AP-DWS1000 water filter\n\n$300\n\nAmerican Plumber WLCS-1000 water filter\n\n$200\n\nReverse osmosis water filters\n\nEcowater ERO-375 water filter\n\n$675\n\nCulligan Aqua-Cleer water filter\n\n$1000\n\nWhirlpool WHER25 water filter\n\n$287\n\nKenmore Elite 38556 water filter\n\n$255\n\nKenmore 38156 water filter\n\n$170", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The only way to find out if your water is contaminated is to have it tested, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
