The legislator asked for a review of Wellmark's reserves.\n\nThe Des Moines-based health insurer provides coverage for more than 2 million policyholders in Iowa and South Dakota and pays out approximately $5 billion in claims annually. Wellmark\u2019s reserves at the end of 2012 were approximately $1.3 billion, which would pay about three months of claims.\n\n\u201cThis review confirms that Wellmark is running our business in the best interest of our members,\u201d Wellmark Chief Financial Officer David Brown said in a release. The Iowa Insurance Division commissioned a similar review of Wellmark\u2019s reserves in 2011, which found that the insurer\u2019s reserves were proper, or possibly too low, given the expectation of the federal health care overhaul.\n\nWellmark targets an operating margin of between zero and 3 percent each year, adjusting that figure for how much it figures it needs to add to maintain an adequate level of reserves. The insurer incurred a significant operating loss in 2009 when investment markets plummeted and the company\u2019s actual medical losses were higher than expected, which led the insurer to target a 3 percent operating margin for the past few years to rebuild reserves.\n\nIn July 2013, Sen. Jack Hatch, a Des Moines Democrat who is running for governor, wrote a letter to Gerhart seeking a review of Wellmark\u2019s reserves. http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/724920-letter-on-wellmark-reserves.html#document/p1 Hatch said Wellmark\u2019s decision last year to delay participating in the health insurance marketplace until 2015 mitigated a major premise that higher reserves were necessary to pay higher health care costs expected under the new health insurance law.\n\nHatch, who could not be immediately reached for comment, has sponsored a bill that would give the insurance commissioner authority to order health insurers to refund excess reserves to policyholders.\n\nWellmark has garnered support for maintaining its reserve levels from both business and health industry leaders, among them Bankers Trust CEO Suku Radia and Ed Brown, CEO of The Iowa Clinic.\n\n\u201cWith consolidation in the health insurance industry, it is important that we have a local health insurance company that has the financial stability to weather these uncertainties and still adapt to reflect our state\u2019s provider and consumer market issues,\u201d The Iowa Clinic's Brown said in a release from Wellmark.\n\nRadia said the health insurance industry, like the banking industry, is in the midst of unprecedented change.\n\n\u201cMembers from each of our organizations want to be reassured that the company in which they have placed their trust, money, and health, has the resources needed to ensure their future safety and security,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://businessrecord.com/Images/Settings/827.png", "site_name": "Business Record"}, "google-site-verification": "c8V-aEwqyiHGPzjBxZYz03_hszJ_s28VLA81yb6BY7U", "fb": {"app_id": 747923588594301}, "description": "Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s $1.3 billion in reserves are \u201creasonable and prudent,\u201d according to the results of an independent review"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31ad\"", "article_summary": "Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s $1.3 billion in reserves are \u201creasonable and prudent,\u201d according to the results of an independent review released this morning by the Iowa Insurance Division.\nRadia said the health insurance industry, like the banking industry, is in the midst of unprecedented change.\nWellmark\u2019s reserves at the end of 2012 were approximately $1.3 billion, which would pay about three months of claims.\nThe legislator asked for a review of Wellmark's reserves.\nIn July 2013, Sen.
