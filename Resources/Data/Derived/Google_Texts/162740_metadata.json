Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.)],\u201d Klein tells ITK, who blamed an unfortunately timed check of his BlackBerry.\n\nByrd, who died in 2010, \u201cteetered for a moment before I grabbed him by the shoulders and averted tragedy.\u201d\n\nKlein is likely used to juggling his phone, along with his numerous roles with ABC and his job as dad to two young sons. When he finishes up a day at work, which includes co-hosting the political webcast \u201cTop Line,\u201d the Princeton grad is busy brushing up on his \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d knowledge with his kids.\n\nAnd although he\u2019s all grown up now, the 37-year-old journalist still has a penchant for his childhood hobby of collecting baseball cards \u2014 he even admits to a \u201ctinge of jealousy\u201d that another network correspondent appeared on his own card.\n\nWe wanted to know more about the politics pro, so we asked Klein these questions.\n\nGrew up in: Babylon, N.Y. It\u2019s on Long Island \u2014 Suffolk County, South Shore. If you know the LIRR, it comes at the end of a long sentence that starts with \u201cJamaica\u201d and ends with \u201cAmityville, Copiague, Lindenhurst and\u2026\u201d\n\nCollege attended: Princeton University. I was editor of The Daily Princetonian, but I had a little more fun broadcasting basketball, football and lacrosse games for the student radio station.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were a kid? A lawyer. I like to think I ended up with a more interesting job than my childhood ambition forecast.\n\nFavorite hobby/activity: Collecting baseball cards. I collected as a kid, of course, and I\u2019ve really gotten back into it in the last few years. I\u2019ll admit to more than a tinge of jealousy when I saw Chuck Todd appear on his own card in a recent Topps release.\n\nAfter work, you\u2019ll find me: Racing home for bedtime with the boys \u2014 Jack, who\u2019s going on 5, and Max, who\u2019ll be 3 in the fall. The \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d have been quite busy over the past quarter century, it turns out, so we have lots of catching up to do.\n\nFavorite/most hated food: I can always go for Mexican or Greek, especially spanakopita. There\u2019s little I won\u2019t eat, except for asparagus. My mom, who grows her own in the backyard, reports that I\u2019ve been calling it a \u201cvile weed\u201d since about age 10.\n\nMost embarrassing moment/Most memorable moment: My worst D.C. moment was the time I almost killed Sen. Robert Byrd, in front of a crowd of fellow reporters. I was new to the Capitol Hill beat, and The Boston Globe had just bought me one of these newfangled BlackBerrys.\n\nI finished covering an event Senate Democrats held on the steps of the Capitol, when I started fiddling with my device while heading up the stairs. I ran square into a frail Sen. Byrd, who teetered for a moment before I grabbed him by the shoulders and averted tragedy.\n\nAs for memorable, the hours I spent anchoring election-year coverage alongside Sam Donaldson for ABC News digital platforms in 2008, provided more than enough, if only because I never knew what Sam was going to say next. We had Ted Koppel on at the Democratic National Convention, so in one frame was Donaldson, Koppel and \u2026 Klein. I stopped smiling long enough to literally pinch myself \u2014 you can check the show tape.\n\nFavorite band: Billy Joel is the soundtrack of my life.\n\nWhat you like/dislike about D.C.: I like the intimacy, that you can go to just about any restaurant in town and see somebody you know, or run into friends and colleagues running errands. It\u2019s like a big college campus, with better parks for kids and dogs. But I will never forgive D.C. for its lack of diners and solid Jewish deli options.\n\nIf I had a theme song, it would be: \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d would be my batting music. Mostly because I want to own every at-bat the way [the \u201cArrested Development\u201d character] Gob Bluth owned his illusions.\n\nMy celebrity crush is: Amy Smart.\n\nMy dream interview is: Derek Jeter, not that I think I\u2019m good enough to coax the Captain into saying something interesting.\n\nSomething that few know about you: I was big into drama club in high school. I played Tevye in \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d under the stage name Ricky Klein.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rick Klein is used to being the journalist behind the big headlines as ABC News\u2019s political director and an on-air political analyst for the network.", "description": "Rick Klein is used to being the journalist behind the big headlines as ABC News\u2019s political director and an on-air political analyst for the network.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "In The Know"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Rick Klein is used to being the journalist behind the big headlines as ABC News\u2019s political director and an on-air political analyst for the network.", "title": "ABC\u2019s Rick Klein: Baseball card collector and Billy Joel fan who almost mowed down a senator", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/214424-abcs-rick-klein-baseball-card-collector-and-billy-joel-fan-who", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/rickklein_courtesyofabcnews_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/214424-abcs-rick-klein-baseball-card-collector-and-billy-joel-fan-who", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-06T12:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Judy Kurtz", "author": "Judy Kurtz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-06T12:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/214424-abcs-rick-klein-baseball-card-collector-and-billy-joel-fan-who", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Rick Klein is used to being the journalist behind the big headlines as ABC News\u2019s political director and an on-air political analyst for the network.", "card": "summary", "title": "ABC\u2019s Rick Klein: Baseball card collector and Billy Joel fan who almost mowed down a senator"}, "dcterms.title": "ABC\u2019s Rick Klein: Baseball card collector and Billy Joel fan who almost mowed down a senator"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI ran square into a frail [Sen.
