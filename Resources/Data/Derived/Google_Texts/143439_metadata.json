The Islamic refugee issue is no different. They have no intention of actually stopping it, despite the fact that they could destroy the Democrats in the upcoming election on this issue alone. They will pass phony legislation, but will never defund it.\n\nWhile Ryan\u2019s decision has sparked the ire of conservatives, his decision has won the praise of Democrats like Harry Reid who said: \u201cI think Speaker Ryan has the right idea\u2026 to leave any refugee legislation separate and apart from the omnibus.\n\nSome conservative lawmakers, however, have suggested that they will not settle for a mere show-vote. In recent days, an increasing number of conservatives lawmakers have called\u2014 not just for moratorium on Muslim refugees\u2014 but for a reduction or temporary suspension of visa issuances to terror-prone nations in general.\n\nPresidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul, as Breitbart News has previously reported, has called for stopping visa issuances from nations that have significant jihadist movements, or roughly 30 countries. \u201cI say from the Middle East, we don\u2019t need any more immigrants\u2026students or refugees or otherwise,\u201d Paul declared on a Monday conference call with reporters.\n\n\u201cMy message not only to the leadership, but to the country is if we want to defend ourselves, we have to defend ourselves and the first way to do it is to bar people from coming to your country who would attack you,\u201d Paul told Breitbart. \u201cThe interesting thing about this is people are talking about world-wide war to stop this and you would think the first thing you would do is stop people from coming to our country.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Congressman Brian Babin\u2014 who led the charge on halting the importation of Muslim refugees and introduced legislation to stop refugee resettlement months before the Paris attack\u2014 expressed his support for Sen. Paul\u2019s initiative:\n\nI support every plan, including Senator Paul\u2019s effort, that would protect Americans from radical jihads infiltrating this country.\n\nBabin told Breitbart that a mere show vote from the House Speaker on this matter would not be acceptable. \u201cThe last thing we need is a show vote. As an elected official I swore an oath to protect the safety and security of the American people,\u201d Babin declared. \u201cWe cannot allow this to happen on our watch and anything that fails to have real teeth should be rejected.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s panel of \u201cConversations With Conservatives,\u201d Congressman Randy Weber, Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis, and Congressman Dave Brat all similarly expressed their support for reducing or suspending visa issuances from Muslim countries.\n\nWeber told the panel that in the last year alone the Senate Immigration Subcommittee Chaired by Jeff Sessions has found 26 foreign-born individuals implicated in terror activity.\n\n\u201cI would also add my take on this,\u201d Weber said.\n\nFirst of all, Jeff Sessions chairs the Subcommittee on Immigration and National Interest\u2014they have identified 26 foreign-born individuals in the United States in the last year alone charged with and/or convicted of terrorism. That\u2019s 26 in the last year alone. What did it take in Paris? Only eight\u2026 And let me just say, that there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about sancturary cities. Under the adminsitration\u2019s current foreign policy initiative of bringing in Syrian-born refugees [that we can\u2019t vet]\u2026 we\u2019ve already got sanctuary cities, we are in danger in America of, let\u2019s just call it, becoming a sanctuary country if you will at this rate without being able to test the backgrounds of those individuals, and why should American citizens like Kate Steinle pay the ultimate price with their life for an ill-conceived, ill-advised immigration policy? It\u2019s foolishness.\n\nCongressman Steve King tells Breitbart that he too would support suspending or reducing annual Muslim immigration.\n\n\u201cI would be willing to support that,\u201d King tsays.\n\nI think it\u2019s the right thing to do. We should be looking at this thing culturally. And where is all of this venom coming from? It\u2019s coming from people who are migrating in from the Middle East and 90-something percent of them are Muslim and if you look at a map of the world on where there have been terrorist attacks, you can look around Europe and see and find people who are committing terrorist attacks, they\u2019re almost exclusively Muslim.\n\nAccording to Pew, 92 percent of the Republican electorate wants to see future immigration growth reduced. However, Congressman Raul Labrador, who has a history of pushing to expand immigration levels, refused to answer Breitbart News\u2019 question about whether he would support Paul\u2019s initiative to reduce or suspend visa issuances to Muslim nations. According to Rasmussen, 65 percent of conservative voters say the correct number of refugees from all Middle Eastern countries to allow into the country is zero.\n\nAs a member of the House Freedom Caucus, Labrador played a critical role in helping to elect Paul Ryan as House Speaker. The Daily Caller\u2018s Matt Lewis has said that Labrador\u2019s agreement with Paul Ryan on the issue of immigration may explain why Labrador helped install the Wisconsin Congressman with a long history of promoting large-scale immigration into the Speaker\u2019s office.\n\nEvery year the United States admits 280,000 migrants from predominantly Muslim countries. This includes more than 100,000 migrants who were permanently resettled on green cards, more than a 100,000 temporary guest workers and students, and nearly 40,000 refugees and asylees. This means that every year the U.S. admits two Muslim migrants for every one Raul Labrador voter in Idaho\u2019s first Congressional District. Equality Now recently issued a report documenting how, as a result of unbridled Muslim migration, half a million U.S. girls are at risk of Female Genital Mutilation. Arabic and Urdu \u2013 Pakistan\u2019s national language\u2013 are the fastest-growing foreign languages spoken at home, according to U.S. Census data analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies. According to a separate report based on census data, Muslim immigration is the fastest growing bloc of new immigrants.\n\nReports have documented how large-scale Muslim migration has posed some difficulties for assimilation.\n\nMinnesota, for instance, which has the largest Somali population in the country, has struggled to stem terror recruiting. The Minneapolis Star Tribune recently reported that six men from Minnesota were arrested and charged attempting to fight alongside ISIS. The Star Tribune writes: \u201cDuring the last two years, more than 20 Somali-Americans from Minnesota have left to fight alongside terrorists under the banner of ISIL, according to the FBI. Another four, also arrested while trying to leave, face federal prosecution in the Twin Cities under charges that they intended to fight for ISIL or the Al-Shabab terrorist brigade in Somalia.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, as National Review has reported, \u201cDearborn, Michigan is home to just under 100,000 people, about 40 percent of whom are Muslim. In 2013, a leaked government document revealed that more people from Dearborn were on the federal terrorist watch list than from any other city except New York.\u201d\n\nPew Research has estimated that immigration will cause the population of U.S. Muslims to more than double over the next two decades\u2014from 2.6 million in 2010 to 6.2 million in 2030. This demographic change is almost entirely the product of legal admissions\u2013 that is, it is a formal policy of the federal government adopted by Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressman Steve King, for example, tells Breitbart that he too would support suspending or reducing annual Muslim immigration", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Congressman Steve King, for example, tells Breitbart that he too would support suspending or reducing annual Muslim immigration", "title": "GOP Lawmakers Call For Curbs, Freeze On Muslim Migration To U.S. - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Ryan-indoors-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/18/gop-lawmakers-call-curbs-freeze-muslim-migration-u-s/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congressman Steve King, for example, tells Breitbart that he too would support suspending or reducing annual Muslim immigration", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Ryan-indoors-Getty.jpg", "title": "GOP Lawmakers Call For Curbs, Freeze On Muslim Migration To U.S. - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Immigration,Muslim", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-11-18T10:33:05-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "According to a separate report based on census data, Muslim immigration is the fastest growing bloc of new immigrants.\nCongressman Steve King tells Breitbart that he too would support suspending or reducing annual Muslim immigration.\nIn recent days, an increasing number of conservatives lawmakers have called\u2014 not just for moratorium on Muslim refugees\u2014 but for a reduction or temporary suspension of visa issuances to terror-prone nations in general.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs Speaker Paul Ryan prepares a show vote on the nation\u2019s importation of Muslim refugees, a growing group of Congressional conservatives are calling for a reduction or suspension of visa issuances to Muslim nations with jihadist movements.\nPresidential candidate Sen.
