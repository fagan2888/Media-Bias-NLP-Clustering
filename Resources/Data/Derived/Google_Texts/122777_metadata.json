In both Maine and Seattle, voters approved ballot measures to implement or strengthen public financing, an important reform that can increase the diversity of the donor pool and reduce the power of big money in politics. In Maine, the ballot initiative would boost funds for qualifying candidates and require more disclosure of some political spending. In Seattle, Initiative 122 implements a first of its kind voucher program, which gives each voter $25 vouchers that they can give to their preferred candidate for mayor, city council and city attorney. The initiative also bars contribution from companies or individuals that have large contracts with the city.\n\nWhy do these programs matter? A recent study from the Institute for Southern Studies of North Carolina shows that the donor class is overwhelmingly white, far whiter than the general public. Alex Kotch, author of the report, writes, \u201c95 percent of the largest North Carolina donors to key federal races in the 2014-2016 election cycles were white, while non-Hispanic whites make up 65 percent of the state population.\u201d A study of Seattle\u2019s 2013 election suggests that while Seattle is 67 percent non-Hispanic white, the neighborhoods from which more than half of contributions came from were 80 percent white.\n\nThere is evidence that public financing would increase the diversity of the donor base. A study of New York City\u2019s 2009 municipal election finds that \u201cdonors giving $10 or less live in neighborhoods that are more racially diverse than the city as a whole.\u201d Research suggests that the city\u2019s public matching system (which uses public funds to match small donations) increased the diversity of the city\u2019s donor pool. Other research suggests that the small donor pool tends to be more racially diverse than the large donor pool and that donors as a whole tend to be whiter than the general population.\n\nThe donor pool also has differing preferences from the general population. As I\u2019ve noted several times, there is ample evidence that donors are pulling the nation to the right on economic issues, exacerbating rising inequality. Donors of all stripes tend to be more economically conservative as the chart below, made with data from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study shows.\n\nA study by Didi Kuo and Nolan McCarty finds, \u201cDonors are also more supportive of low taxes and freer trade. Donors were slightly less supportive of the Affordable Care Act, which overhauled the American health care system to promote universal coverage.\u201d One study by a group of scholars spearheaded by Wesley Joe of the Campaign Finance Institute finds, \u201cLarge donors are more likely than small donors to give in the interest of advancing their own narrow economic concerns, as distinct from a more general concern about the economy.\u201d The chart below shows this. Large donors are far more likely to report donating for \u201cmaterial\u201d reasons (advancing their own material interests), while small donors tend to donate for \u201cpurposive reasons\u201d (ideological alignment and which candidate they feel would be better for the economy). Their study also finds that small donors are closer to the opinions of non-donors than large donors, with large donors being more economically conservative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Voters in Maine and Seattle authorized measures this week that strike an important blow against the 1 percent", "author": "Sean McElwee", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Voters in Maine and Seattle authorized measures this week that strike an important blow against the 1 percent", "title": "America\u2019s plutocrats should be very afraid: The one simple thing that can win back democracy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/05/americas_plutocrats_should_be_very_afraid_the_one_simple_thing_that_win_back_democracy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/koch_adelson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Voters in Maine and Seattle authorized measures this week that strike an important blow against the 1 percent", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/koch_adelson.jpg", "title": "America\u2019s plutocrats should be very afraid: The one simple thing that can win back democracy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "America\u2019s plutocrats should be very afraid: The one simple thing that can win back democracy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Campaign Finance, Democracy, election reform, elections, The 1 Percent", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe280b\"", "article_summary": "Their study also finds that small donors are closer to the opinions of non-donors than large donors, with large donors being more economically conservative.\nDonors of all stripes tend to be more economically conservative as the chart below, made with data from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study shows.\nOther research suggests that the small donor pool tends to be more racially diverse than the large donor pool and that donors as a whole tend to be whiter than the general population.\nThe donor pool also has differing preferences from the general population.\nLarge donors are far more likely to report donating for \u201cmaterial\u201d reasons (advancing their own material interests), while small donors tend to donate for \u201cpurposive reasons\u201d (ideological alignment and which candidate they feel would be better for the economy)."}
