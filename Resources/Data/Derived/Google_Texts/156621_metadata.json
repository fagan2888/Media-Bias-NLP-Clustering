For free.\n\nThe concept, developed by two Minneapolis artists, started as pop-ups across the country, ranging from an event at a North Carolina artists\u2019 space to a waterfront fundraiser in Chicago to a four-month run at an art museum in Arkansas.\n\nThey\u2019ve been such a hit that Colin Kloecker and Shanai Matteson are preparing to open a storefront Water Bar in northeast Minneapolis, a taproom serving pints of city water plus limited-edition pours from other communities. Visitors will get to taste and compare, but the goal is bigger: connecting the public with the scientists, utility employees, environmentalists and activists who will serve as bartenders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about opening up a conversation with the idea that \u2018Water is all we have,\u2019 which is our tagline, because that\u2019s all we\u2019re serving,\u201d Matteson said. \u201cAnd then the conversation goes from there.\u201d\n\nThe timing is opportune with the widespread attention on lead-tainted water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton making water issues a personal priority for the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nThe storefront Water Bar, which is slated to open to the public in May, won\u2019t serve pricey boutique \u201cartisanal water\u201d as has been tried elsewhere \u2014 just plain-old tap water. Its funding will come from various sources, such as a neighborhood association and a crowdfunding website, as well as money from ongoing pop-up events. Any tips for the bartenders will go toward supporting allied organizations and providing seed funding for community projects.\n\n\u201cWhat Water Bar does is let communities and experts come together and talk to each other about, \u2018What are the issues here? Have you thought about where your water comes from? What are you concerned about when it comes to water?'\u201d said Kate Brauman, lead scientist for the Global Water Initiative at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Institute on the Environment.\n\nBrauman worked the bar at a sustainability event on campus last year. It was so popular they ran out of cups.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Minneapolis, bellying up for \u2026 tap water", "author": "Steve Karnowski", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Minneapolis, bellying up for \u2026 tap water", "title": "In Minneapolis, bellying up for \u2026 tap water", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/20/in_minneapolis_bellying_up_for_tap_water/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/water-bar.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Minneapolis, bellying up for \u2026 tap water", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/water-bar.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "In Minneapolis, bellying up for \u2026 tap water", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "In Minneapolis, bellying up for \u2026 tap water", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The storefront Water Bar, which is slated to open to the public in May, won\u2019t serve pricey boutique \u201cartisanal water\u201d as has been tried elsewhere \u2014 just plain-old tap water.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a bar that serves nothing but tap water.\n\u201cWhat Water Bar does is let communities and experts come together and talk to each other about, \u2018What are the issues here?\nThey\u2019ve been such a hit that Colin Kloecker and Shanai Matteson are preparing to open a storefront Water Bar in northeast Minneapolis, a taproom serving pints of city water plus limited-edition pours from other communities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about opening up a conversation with the idea that \u2018Water is all we have,\u2019 which is our tagline, because that\u2019s all we\u2019re serving,\u201d Matteson said."}
