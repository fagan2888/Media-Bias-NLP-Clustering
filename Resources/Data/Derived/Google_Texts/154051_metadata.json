Simington won a battle of undefeated defending state champions with a 12-6 decision. ( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nJOHNSTOWN \u2014 In a field where half of the 12 teams in attendance at the Roosevelt Invitational were ranked \u2014 bringing a host of standout wrestlers in the process \u2014 Thompson Valley planned on having a strong showing Saturday afternoon.\n\nHeck, even head coach Dave Juergensen didn't show up until the finals (he was making sure a junior varsity tournament ran well at the school). By the time he arrived, the Eagles had already sewed up the team title \u2014 they finished with 223.5 points, well ahead of runner-up Valley with 155.5, placing 10 wrestlers overall, eight of them reaching the finals.\n\nNot that the Eagles were ready to call it a day, because despite dominating the finals in numbers, the team was looking to do the same on the mat. Which they did, winning seven of those eight appearances, some of them quite dynamic matchups.\n\n\"From watching them last night to watching them there in the finals, it seemed like they were at a different speed,\" Juergensen said. \"They were a lot quicker, a lot more aggressive. (Assistant coach) Steve (Gerrard) and I were just talking about it. A few years ago, we'd get kids in the finals but we weren't closing. Now the guys are maturing and finding a way to get it done in the finals.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the process, the Eagles won a battle of undefeated wrestlers (Vlad Kazakov's 5-0 decision of Andrew Jaramillo of Platte Valley), avenged a lone loss on the season (Ben Hewson's 7-5 win over Roman Ortiz at 152) and knocked off another undefeated foe in the process (David Eusea's escape of a headlock for a 14-8 decision over Fort Morgan's Alex Mai). But the jewel of the bunch came from Parker Simington at 160 pounds.\n\nThompson Valley's Ben Hewson, left, squares off against Rocky Mountain's Roman Ortiz during their 152-pound finals match at the Roosevelt Invitational on Saturday. Hewson won, 7-5. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nHe took on Brendan Gonzales of Valley, pitting a pair of undefeated state champions for a great early season test. Simington proved to be just too good on his feet, taking a 12-6 decision. Even when it looked like Gonzales would use a Simington shot against him, Simington came out the better for the scramble.\n\nWhile it was a good win, it was better because it showed the junior where he still needs to work.\n\n\"It's definitely a confidence booster,\" Simington said. \"It was a really tough match and he wrestled great. It really took some gut. I got tired there in the second period, and it showed that I need to work on some things, my conditioning being one. I pushed through, and that definitely gives me confidence.\"\n\nThe other Eagles to win in the finals were Morgan Fogg (113), Zach Kinnison (126) and Mike Berg (170). Berg posted the only pin in the finals for the team, and it came at the expense of Loveland's Jimmy Preciado. The two had met less than 24 hours prior, with Berg winning a 3-2 decision. This time around, Berg was a bit more aggressive, getting the ref to slap the mat before the clock could end the first period, the fall coming at 1:59.\n\nBerg originally wasn't going to wrestle this season, but with some \"encouragement\" from his teammates, he's back and makes the Eagles an even stronger team.\n\n\"When I got the news, I almost took it as a joke, it was so unbelievable,\" Simington said. \"I'm really glad he's back. We did what we could to convince him to come out, but overall, it's his choice. He did have a choice, but there was definitely a better choice, and that was to wrestle.\"\n\nLoveland did pick up a finals win as Charles Dunkelman pinned Platte Valley's Jeremiah Land in 2:42 at 220 to help LHS finish sixth with 72 points. It was the first tournament championship for Dunkelman, who feels the experience he gained last year is the biggest key to his quality start.\n\n\"When I'm about to start the match and I go in, I basically see how he is, then I get my thought of what I'm going to do,\" Dunkelman said. \"How his stance is and how he's opening up. Last year, I didn't really have that. This year I do.\"\n\nRoosevelt had two finalists, but both Dustin Hayden (145) and Nathan Putullaz (285) dropped decisions. The Riders finished ninth, and first-year coach Brandon Montoya feels his team needs to have a little more go in its matches.\n\n\"For the most part, we've just got to move our feet,\" Montoya said. \"We didn't move too well on our feet, creating any motion. We've got to have more of an offense. We waited too much, waited for them to shoot, reacted, instead of kind of pushing our pace, getting on the guy and us dictating the match instead of seeing what they were going to do to us.\"\n\nThe one final the Eagles did lose came at 182, where Patton Graff lost 16-6 to Rocky Mountain's top-ranked an unbeaten Konnor Schmidt.\n\nMatt Berg (145) took third for the Eagles, while Omar Portales (220) took fourth, as did Quentin Cole (182) while wrestling unattached.\n\nLoveland's Seth Abreo (113) took third, while Roosevelt's Logan Newcomb (132) was fourth.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/RHpreps\n\nRoosevelt Invitational\n\nAt Johnstown\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Thompson Valley 223.5, Valley 155.5, Rocky Mountain 119.5, Prairie View 83, Discovery Canyon 75.5, Loveland 72, Castle View 68.5, Platte Valley 65.5, Roosevelt 61.5, Fort Morgan 65, Montrose 61, Holy Family 61.\n\nChampionship matches\n\n106 \u2014 Malik Heinselman, CV, d.
