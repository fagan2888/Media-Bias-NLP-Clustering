I\u2019ve got a list of things a mile long.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Denise Kivi\n\n\u201cContinued growth. With the growth that\u2019s happening up north with the oil, I want the peninsula to keep becoming more prosperous.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Diane Hurst\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting rid of the grocery tax.

I\u2019m anxious to see what happens with new legislature, new governor and his administration. I want to tackle health care. From a mayoral perspective I want to start looking at things that require long-term planning because three years goes by really quick.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mike Navarre, Kenai\n\n\u201cGetter better, healthwise. We\u2019re Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and we\u2019re looking to go ahead and go on a missionary (trip), even though we\u2019re in our 70s.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steve Ratey, Kenai\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to more work opportunities.
