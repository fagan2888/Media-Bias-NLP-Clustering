The Republican National Committee is on war footing as the competitive gleam in chairman Reince Priebus\u2018 eye grows ever brighter. All the proper political weaponry of the age is appearing: prowess in social media, a feisty presence online and in broadcast, strategic information gathering, image-crafting, brand-burnishing, merchandising.\n\nConsider the committee\u2019s new Para Bellum Lab, a data-driven Internet attack-squad, poised, they say, for a \u201cpolitical hackathon.\u201d The name itself means \u201cready for war\u201d in Latin. \u201cInnovate or die,\u201d declares Chuck DeFeo, the newly named GOP digital data officer.\n\nNow comes another push, this one borrowed from the relentless tea party playbook, or perhaps the libertarian quest for untapped voter interest. It\u2019s a Republican presidential straw poll. But of course. The 32 names on this poll, however, are proof that GOP management is ready to rumble, push the envelope, open the big tent, engage all-comers and get folks talking. And both \u201cPauls\u201d are among the choices.\n\nBehold the candidate cornucopia to consider: Sarah Palin, Ron Paul, John Bolton, Allen West, Herman Cain, Ben Carson, Rick Santorum, Jeb Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Haley Barbour, Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee, Tim Pawlenty and Mitch Daniels.\n\nAmong U.S. Senators: Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Tim Scott of South Carolina, John Thune of South Dakota and Rob Portman of Ohio; plus Reps. Peter T. King of New York and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\n\nThen there\u2019s Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, John Kasich of Ohio, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Mike Pence of Indiana, Rick Perry of Texas and Scott Walker of Wisconsin. There is also a write-in option, which should prove interesting.\n\n\u201cWho would you like to see as the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election?\u201d the poll asks.

But the whining rolls on, with gusto.\n\nNew to Twitter: @SochiProblems, an unsavory gathering spot and compendium for all those complaints which has accrued 116,000 followers in a matter of hours. The vexed and/or amused horde of journalists continue to chart their woes \u2014 from oddly configured toilets to public signs that say, \u201cliver pancakes\u201d and \u201celevator is the equipment of increased danger.\u201d\n\nAnd as the organizers of @SochiProblems advise, \u201cWelcome to Soch-e-e-e-e!\u201d\n\nOBAMACARE MYSTERY CONTINUES\n\nWell, so much for the taxpayer-funded, $684 million public relations outreach for the one, the only Affordable Care Act, also known by its stage name of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAmericans\u2019 familiarity with the Affordable Care Act has remained static since last August, even after new provisions of the law have taken effect and the Obama administration has tried to promote understanding of it,\u201d reports Gallup analyst Andrew Dugan, who says that one-third of the public \u2014 32 percent \u2014 still does not get Obamacare.\n\nIt has lingered at this level for six months, despite often raucous attempts to publicize the health care law, including female models parading through the streets wearing nothing but underwear marked \u201care you covered?\u201d\n\nYeah, well. There were website glitches, the famous \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it,\u201d the individual mandate. \u201cThe health care law has been the center of attention for some time,\u201d Mr. Dugan says.\n\n\u201cBut this has not translated into more Americans saying they are familiar with the ACA. This watershed legislation that will change the face of the U.S. health care system, for better or worse, remains somewhat of a mystery for a significant portion of the nation,\u201d he adds.\n\nA TRUE TARGET AUDIENCE\n\nThis represents a slow and steady shift in the media tastes of the nation. American Rifleman, a publication of the National Rifle Association, has knocked Maxim \u2014 an edgy young male lifestyle monthly \u2014 right off the top-25 list of the most popular magazines in the U.S. \u201cMaxim is out, a gun magazine is in,\u201d noted Ad Age in an analysis.\n\nIndeed, American Rifleman enjoyed a 29.3 percent circulation increase last year, says the Alliance for Audited Media, which tracks the details. Translation: American Rifleman is now included on the coveted roster of the most-read magazines.\n\nIt\u2019s all due to \u201cthe Obama effect,\u201d says Emily Miller, senior opinion writer at The Washington Times, author of the telling book \u201cEmily Gets Her Gun,\u201d and a kind Friend-of-Beltway.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s second term effort to get Americans to hate guns has backfired. Not only did firearm sales in 2013 blow out all records, interest in learning more about Second Amendment issues has risen dramatically,\u201d Miss Miller says. \u201cWe are a nation built on the belief that an armed citizenry prevents a tyrannical government. So the new NRA members and readers of \u2018American Rifleman\u2019 are telling Mr. Obama that they will not be disarmed.\u201d\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale: George Washington Lodge No. 23, located in Pembroke, Maine.

CARVILLE\n\nSpeaking of big tent thinking, the Fox News Channel has hired longtime, outspoken somewhat notorious Democratic strategist James Carville as a contributor, as of Thursday.\n\n\u201cJames\u2019 successful and storied career in politics over several decades is an enormous asset to Fox News. We are privileged to have him lend his breadth of experience, wit and dynamic perspective on the network,\u201d says Bill Shine, executive vice president of programming for the network.\n\nHe notes that Mr. Carville \u2014 spouse of the ever-ebullient Republican strategist and commentator Mary Matalin \u2014 will appear on a cross section of Fox programming. Mr. Carville ended his 10-year association with CNN last year.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 53 percent of Russians say their nation did \u201cthe right thing\u201d bidding for the Winter Olympics.\n\n\u2022 47 percent say they blame \u201ccorruption\u201d for cost overruns that placed the final cost of the games at $50 billion.\n\n\u2022 38 percent say the Winter Olympics were a good way for Russian officials to take funds from the games budget.\n\n\u2022 34 percent blamed the $50 billion cost on \u201cgreedy contractors,\u201d 19 percent blamed \u201cpoor government oversight\u201d.\n\n\u2022 29 percent said President Obama and other Western leaders would not attend opening ceremonies because of \u201cdislike of Russian leadership.\u201d\n\n\u2022 23 percent say the games would help bring their nation together.\n\n\u2022 17 percent said the games would boost the image of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u2022 15 percent said the games would help revamp the host city of Sochi and increase tourism.\n\nSource: A Levada-Center poll of 1,603 Russian adults conducted Jan. 24-27 and released Wednesday.\n\n\u2022 Go ahead, chime in.
