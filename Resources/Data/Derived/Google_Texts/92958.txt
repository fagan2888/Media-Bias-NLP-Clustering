Some of our local young athletes sharpened their skills on the diamond Saturday morning.

Coaches and instructors from Cal Ripken Baseball were at the Callaway Recreation Complex for a camp. The camp was free for the 61 players that came out, thanks to Chevrolet sponsoring the clinic.

The instructors taught players, ranging from age 4-11 years old, some fundamentals of the game in hitting, fielding and throwing.

This is the fourth year the camp has come to Callaway and the instructors say they continue to see improvement in the young players.

"We had a couple parents and kids come up and say they've been here every year, explained Brett Curll, Director of Baseball Operations for Ripken Baseball. "You can definitely see the progression. They remember the drills, the kind of know the terminology which is really neat to see that year by year and get a little bit better each time we come back."
