The keeper was injured while attempting to escape and used pepper spray as a last resort, said spokeswoman Laurie Holloway.\n\nThe keeper is being treated at an area hospital for a bite on the back of his shoulder and scratches on his chest. The injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.\n\nA second keeper was behind a separate set of locked doors and helped distract the lion while the other keeper got away.\n\n\u201cOne of our experienced keepers made a mistake by not following procedures, and that will be addressed,\u201d said Gregg Hudson, president and chief executive officer of the Dallas Zoo in a prepared statement. \u201cWe have detailed protocols and procedures in place, but unfortunately, when humans are involved, mistakes can occur. We are thankful that there wasn\u2019t a more serious injury.\u201d\n\nThe lion was sedated and moved to a secure area. She will not be punished or euthanized as she was \u201csimply being a wild animal\u201d and will return to the exhibit with the three other lions, Holloway said.\n\nGuests were not in danger, but were temporarily ushered out of area near the lion habitat, Holloway said.\n\nThe lion habitat will be open Sunday.\n\nThe incident is the first problem reported involving the zoo\u2019s lions since November 2013, when a male lion killed a 5-year-old lioness in full view of visitors.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA4L3pvb2tlZXBlci1iaXR0ZW4tc2NyYXRjaGVkLWJ5LWxpb24tYXQtZGFsbGFzLXpvby5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
