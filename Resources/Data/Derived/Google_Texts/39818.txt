The outlook remains stable. SUMMARY RATING RATIONALE The affirmation of the A2 issuer rating with a stable outlook reflects our expectations that GRMC will continue to benefit from its strong relationship with Georgia Regents University (GRU, A1 senior most rating) and the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia (Aa2 senior most rating) and favorable market position for high-end services in a broad service area. The rating also incorporates expectations of continued stable, if modest, adjusted operating margins and adequate debt coverage. STRENGTHS *Strong integration with GRU, which is a component unit of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, the dominant provider of higher education for the Aaa-rated State of Georgia. *Strong presence in a broad service area as a tertiary/quaternary referral academic medical center (AMC) with the region's only children's hospital continues to drive market demand. GRMC provides a very high acuity mix of services with a Medicare case mix index of 2.0 in FY 2014. *GRMC's capital spending plans over the next two or three years are manageable. GRMC's average age of plant measured a very low 5.5 years at FYE 2014. GRMC does not have near-term new money debt plans. CHALLENGES *GRMC's adjusted operating cash flow margin is modest at the A2 rating level (7.2% in FY 2014), although margins are stable and GRMC is consistently profitable. *GRMC's debt structure is somewhat aggressive. At FYE 2014, approximately 62% of GRMC's debt was in variable rate mode and monthly liquidity-to-demand debt measured a modest 160% (A2 median is 480%). This is offset in part by conservative investment allocation, as GRMC's unrestricted cash and investments are allocated to 81% cash and fixed income securities, and 100% of cash and investments are available on a monthly basis (based on management data). *GRMC's liquidity position is modest at the A2 rating level. At FYE 2014, the medical center's adjusted cash on hand measured 140 days as compared to the A2 median of 219 days. *Competitive service area with multiple inpatient acute care providers in Augusta, GA and Aiken County, SC. *Significant reliance on Georgia Indigent Care Trust Fund (ICTF), Upper Payment Limit (UPL), special state appropriations, and South Carolina disproportionate share (DSH) subsidies for cash flow. While these demonstrate significant public policy support, we view these revenues as potentially at risk and any contraction of funds, as expected under the Affordable Care Act, will require commensurate cost reductions. *In the next three-to-five years, GRMC may issue new money debt to support the possible construction of a new inpatient hospital in Columbia County. GRMC recently received certificate of need (CON) approval from the state for the project, but the CON is being appealed. OUTLOOK The stable outlook reflects our expectation that GRMC will continue to benefit from its strong relationship with GRU and market position for high-end services in a broad service area to generate stable operating margins and adequate debt coverage. WHAT COULD CHANGE THE RATING UP An upgrade may be considered if GRMC sustains significant improvement in operating margins leading to stronger debt coverage ratios. Also, noticeable strengthening of liquidity ratios and material market share gain could be factors in an upgrade. WHAT COULD CHANGE THE RATING DOWN A downgrade may be considered if GRMC's operating margins deteriorate noticeably leading to thinner debt and liquidity ratios. Also, material market share loss (particularly for high-end services) or a material increase in debt without commensurate increase in cash and cash flow generation could contribute to a downgrade.
