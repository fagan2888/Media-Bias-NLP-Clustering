One theory is that attackers did not target systems that jeopardized lives,\u201d said a new report on ransomware, from the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology. \u201cRecently, that mentality has changed for at least the group operating the Locky ransomware,\u201d the Washington-based organization noted.\n\nLocky seems to be a new outgrowth of Dridex, malware with roots in the Russian underworld. Dridex has historically targeted the financial industry, but healthcare data is proving to be more valuable than financial records.\n\nHollywood Presbyterian ended up paying a $17,000 ransom to get back online after 10 days. That was previously unheard of in the healthcare industry.\n\n\u201cRansomware is unique among cyber-crime because in order for the attack to succeed, it requires the victim to become a willing accomplice after the fact,\u201d according to the report. \u201cIn order for ransomware criminals to profit, they again must rely on exploiting human nature rather than technical sophistication. Humans, like electricity, prefer the path of least resistance.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the hackers got money out of one hospital bodes ill for the healthcare industry.\n\n\u201cHealthcare organizations were not a primary target for ransomware attacks prior to 2016; but, the success of the Hollywood Presbyterian attack and the media coverage will ensure that attackers focus on the healthcare sector in the future.\u201d ICIT said.\n\nIndeed, the same week as the Hollywood Presbyterian attack, hackers infected five Los Angeles County Department of Public Health computers with a Locky variant, according to the report. Two hospitals in Germany also got attacked with last month.\n\nUnlike Hollywood Presbyterian, though, L.A. County and the German hospitals chose to restore their IT systems from backups rather than pay a ransom, ICIT said.\n\nAnd despite what the Los Angeles hospital said \u2014 patient care \u201chas not been compromised in any way\u201d \u2014 a hijacking of a hospital system can put lives at stake, according to the report. That\u2019s changing the mentality of never paying a ransom under any circumstances.\n\nPhoto: Bigstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fact that the hackers got money out of one hospital bodes ill for the healthcare industry, according to the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The fact that the hackers got money out of one hospital bodes ill for the healthcare industry, according to the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology.", "title": "Report: Ransomware attacks change health IT security", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-Security-18289241.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-17T14:35:24-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/03/ransomware-health-it-security/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-Security-18289241.jpg", "title": "Report: Ransomware attacks change health IT security", "description": "The fact that the hackers got money out of one hospital bodes ill for the healthcare industry, according to the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@nversel"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Washington D.C.", "published_time": "2016-03-17T14:34:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T14:35:24-04:00"}, "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,cybersecurity, Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, ransomware, Washington D.C., , MedCity News", "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4a69\"", "article_summary": "Last month\u2019s ransomware attack on Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles may have changed the game in healthcare cybersecurity.\n\u201cThe healthcare sector was not a traditional target for ransomware attacks.\nIndeed, the same week as the Hollywood Presbyterian attack, hackers infected five Los Angeles County Department of Public Health computers with a Locky variant, according to the report.\nHollywood Presbyterian ended up paying a $17,000 ransom to get back online after 10 days.\nOne theory is that attackers did not target systems that jeopardized lives,\u201d said a new report on ransomware, from the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology."}
