Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) helped lead a group of seven female Democrats across the Capitol hoping to crash one of the most exclusive clubs in America, a closed-door luncheon of Senate Democrats.\n\nThe country was in the midst of a great political skirmish over sexual harassment, set off by the accusations of misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.\n\nShe and the other women were denied entry into that lunch in October 1991, and were unable to deliver in person their objections to how the matter was being handled. But they helped compel the Senate into a heated set of confirmation hearings that gave the issue an international profile.\n\nA year later, in what became know as the Year of the Woman, Boxer won a Senate seat as part of a sweeping new group of female lawmakers that went to the Capitol. Together, they put Congress on a slow but steady course of change in how it considered laws that had a disproportionate impact on women.\n\nRelated: Why Elizabeth Warren Trumps Obama's Economic Message\n\nBoxer, now one of 20 female senators, announced Thursday that she would not seek reelection in 2016. The news was expected, given that she had barely raised any campaign money in a state that requires tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate campaign.\n\nBut the announcement by Boxer, 74, signaled that members of this historically important generation of female lawmakers is approaching careers\u2019 end, and a new generation must step forward on women\u2019s issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of another member of the Senate who is as strong an advocate for women\u2019s rights, at so many different levels. On the issue of choice, she is the first up and the leader of the battle,\u201d said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), one of Boxer\u2019s closest friends who entered the House with her in 1983.\n\nHer departure will also end nearly a quarter-century of stability in the California\u2019s delegation to the Senate, where Boxer and fellow member of the class of 1992, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D), have racked up nearly 50 years of combined experience, chairing several critical committees.\n\nRelated: Sen. Barbara Boxer Will Not Seek Reelection\n\nIn line behind them are nearly a dozen Democrats who have been waiting for a chance at a Senate seat. Boxer\u2019s departure has set off a wild race to see who will succeed her. The seat is most likely to stay in Democratic hands \u2014 in her video announcement Boxer said one of her last goals was to assure a \u201cprogressive\u201d replaces her \u2014 but the state\u2019s odd, relatively new \u201cjungle primary\u201d system could allow a wealthy independent from Silicon Valley or from Southern California to make it into the November general election.\n\nThe \u201cjungle primary\u201d dispenses with party affiliation; primary voters can cast their ballot for any candidate of any party in the summer primary, sending the two top vote-getters into the November general election. So in a state with a lot of pent-up Democratic ambition, Democratic voters could split their votes, sending a non-Democratic into the general.\n\nAfter more than two decades without an open seat, the race could attract a lot of candidates and a lot of money, likely costing more than $100 million among all the candidates and outside groups.\n\nThe two most watched figures at the moment are Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Attorney General Kamala Harris, two Democrats who have already won statewide office and might have the connections to raise enough money to compete in a state where grassroots campaigning doesn\u2019t reach enough voters.\n\nRelated: Senate's Promise to Work Fridays Is Broken by Thursday\n\nOn Thursday, one senior Democratic operative suggested that both Harris and Newsom would not run because of their close political ties and that, at the moment, \u201cKamala will have a head start.\u201d Feinstein, 81, may not run for reelection in 2018, when Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s term will be up, setting up the possibility of three blockbuster statewide races within two years.\n\nOther potential Democratic candidates include former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, state Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, state Treasurer John Chiang, former congresswoman Jane Harman and Rep. Karen Bass.\n\nLiving up to Boxer\u2019s liberal legacy will be a challenge for the Democratic aspirants, although recent polls have suggested that her staunch ideology had left her unpopular in the vast rural regions of the state. She has previously been the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, overseeing climate policy and also highway funding.\n\nFor the last eight years she has also chaired the Ethics Committee, a post that at times has brought her face-to-face with the sort of sexual misconduct allegations that propelled her into the Senate after a decade in the House.\n\nRelated: Democrats Are Going Their Homework on GOP Presidential Wannabes\n\nBack in 1991, Boxer\u2019s campaign seemed like a longshot. There were just two female senators. Boxer went to Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) for advice about the race, and Mikulski encouraged her to jump in. On the night in June 1992 when she won the primary, over another congressman and the sitting lieutenant governor, she declared what kind of senator she would be: \u201cThey want a fighter in the Senate, don\u2019t they? They want someone who will shake up the Senate, don\u2019t they? I will be a fighter in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBoxer narrowly won the general election, part of a group of four women \u2014 Boxer and Feinstein, along with Patty Murray of Washington and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois \u2014 to join the Senate that year. In each case it was the first time their state had elected a woman to the Senate. That same election increased the number of women in the House from 28 to 47.\n\nMost of those new female lawmakers were Democrats, and the Thomas hearings for the Supreme Court played a galvanizing role in inspiring women\u2019s votes and inspiring female candidates. Thomas had been accused by University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill of inappropriate sexual conduct dating back to when they worked together at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nBoxer and other House Democrats, including Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), helped push Hill\u2019s allegations into a higher profile after a private interview of Hill by the FBI had not received attention from the all-male Judiciary Committee.\n\nRelated: Why More Millionaires Want Hillary for President\n\nIn the early years in office Boxer, Feinstein and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) set a tone that their colleagues would have to behave differently, and soon after the chamber\u2019s ethics committee was investigating sexual misconduct by then-Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.). He eventually resigned.\n\nBoxer\u2019s style, often seemed inspired by her last name, could grate on Republican colleagues who sometimes felt as if she wanted a fight more than a legislative result. \u201cI\u2019ve been ringside with the Boxer battles for many years. I just have so much affection and admiration for her,\u201d Mikulski recalled Thursday.\n\n\u201cShe certainly has been an effective voice for liberal causes in this country, and believes passionately in her views, and she will leave a void on that side of the aisle,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who won election in 1996 and is now the most senior female Republican senator.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s, the number of female senators inched upward but the Senate could still be a lonely place. Collins became chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee in the early days of George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI remember looking out one day, because Donald Rumsfeld was testifying before us on some personnel issues, and seeing this mass of men, and then looking to my left and to my right on the panel, all men. And how it has changed,\u201d said Collins, who noted that last year every Senate committee had at least one female member.\n\nBoxer is ready for one last major political fight: She declared Thursday that she would be a champion for Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s likely presidential campaign. She broke her retirement news in a well-produced video in which her grandson \u2014 Zach Rodham, who is also the nephew of Clinton \u2014 interviewed Boxer and asked what her remaining goals were.\n\n\u201cI want to help our Democratic candidate for president make history,\u201d Boxer responded.\n\nAaron Blake and Ed O\u2019Keefe contributed to this report, which originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more from The Washington Post:\n\nHow Much Each State Relies on the Federal Government for Revenue\n\nAre Black or White Offenders More Likely to Kill Police?\n\nFrench Authorities Grapple with Two Hostage Situations", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nearly 24 years ago then-Rep.", "title": "The Race to Replace Barbara Boxer May Cost Over $100 Million", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/09/Race-Replace-Barbara-Boxer-May-Cost-Over-100-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Barbara_Boxer_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/09/Race-Replace-Barbara-Boxer-May-Cost-Over-100-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Barbara_Boxer_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Nearly 24 years ago then-Rep.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf586\"", "article_summary": "And how it has changed,\u201d said Collins, who noted that last year every Senate committee had at least one female member.\nNearly 24 years ago then-Rep.
