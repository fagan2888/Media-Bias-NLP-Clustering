Seconds later, Anderson, an afterthought on a pass play, made a tough catch and broke out of five tackles and zigged, zagged and zipped for 51 yards and a touchdown that would transform a tense state of affairs into a stampede.\n\nWild, wild horses, the Rolling Stones sang.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I play for, to make the big plays and help us win,\u201d Roby said.\n\nThe initial guy, C.J., said: \u201cI feel blessed. This is what I\u2019ve prepared hard for. We all want to be like Peyton (Manning) and Wes (Welker) someday.\u201d\n\nThis day.\n\nThe first-round cornerback of 2014 and the free-agent running back from 2013 \u2014 neither 18 hands high \u2014 are now joined at the tip and standing tall.\n\nManning called Anderson\u2019s reception and run \u201cas fine a play as I\u2019ve seen so far this season. \u2026 It could have easily been a catch for minus-2 yards or something. The next thing you know, he breaks the tackle. I don\u2019t know how many guys he made miss. Truly an incredible effort play.\u201d\n\nAnd Roby\u2019s effort on the interception was equally remarkable. The pass from Oakland\u2019s young quarterback was a Carr wreck. Derek\u2019s ball fluttered and flapped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was tipped or wobbly, but I mistimed my jump and had to try to stay in the air long enough and reach back past my shoulder. That\u2019s a pick I\u2019ve got to make,\u201d Roby said.\n\nGreat hang time, I said.\n\n\u201cYeah, I like that description,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m athletic. You have to be an athlete to play in the secondary.\u201d\n\nBut cornerbacks would be wide receivers if they could catch the ball better.\n\n\u201cWide receivers would be cornerbacks if they could defend and tackle,\u201d Roby replied. \u201cWe must be better than receivers.\u201d\n\nUp until Roby\u2019s interception, the Broncos looked as sorry as the Raiders, who haven\u2019t won in their past 15 games. The Broncos were in hangover mode after the loss at New England.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver Broncos vs. Oakland Raiders\n\nRoby was beaten by Brice Butler for a touchdown early in the second quarter, and the Broncos were behind 10-6. Uh-oh.\n\nBut Roby made his third big play of the season. He deflected the pass on the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 final play in the season opener. He intercepted a pass by Tom Brady a week ago.\n\n\u201cThe Broncos showed so much faith by drafting me, and I\u2019m doing everything I can to prove they made the right decision,\u201d he said.\n\nAnderson wasn\u2019t drafted by anybody last year. He impressed everybody in Denver, though, in the exhibitions before getting hurt. This year he had virtually fallen off the radar. He was fourth on the depth chart until injuries to others gave him a chance.\n\n\u201cI practice every day as if I\u2019m going to get a chance. I thought I might play some on third down in this game,\u201d he said.\n\nFor that reason, he bought 40 tickets for family and friends in his town of Vallejo, Calif., 25 miles up Interstate 80. The folks from back home were in for a shock.\n\nAnderson was inserted early and often and finished with 13 carries for 90 yards and seven catches for 73 yards, including that touchdown you normally only see in high school highlights.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the speed of Ronnie (Hillman) or the size of the other guys, but I make the best of what I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.\n\nHe runs hard and fast, like a bronco.\n\nOn the reception he thought, because the linebackers had deepened, Manning might check down to him, but he hadn\u2019t finished his route when the ball was on him like a mortgage payment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to miss that one,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear the crowd. I wasn\u2019t thinking about anything except just keep running and hang on.\u201d\n\n\u201cC.J. was sensational,\u201d Roby said.\n\nAt the other end of the locker room, Anderson said his touchdown \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened if Bradley hadn\u2019t made such a great interception.\u201d\n\nReciprocal admiration from two bright, clever, gifted players.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 future was present Sunday.\n\nC.J. and Bradley, Anderson and Roby, are grown-up Broncos now.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: C.J.
