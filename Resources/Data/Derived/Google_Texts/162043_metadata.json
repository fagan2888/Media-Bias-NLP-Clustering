The Senate soon followed suit, with just two Democrats \u2014 Rosalyn R. Dance (Petersburg) and Kenneth C. Alexander (Norfolk) \u2014 joining Republicans to support her.\n\nIn previous sessions, the House had twice approved Ketron for the judgeship, which she already held on an interim basis. Last year, the House voted 99 to 0 for her appointment. But the Senate had always refused to appoint her to a full, six-year term while her father served in the chamber, citing an anti-nepotism policy.\n\nHer father, Phillip P. Puckett (Russell) stepped down in June, in part, he said, to clear the way for her appointment. But the timing of his exit infuriated fellow Democrats and triggered a six-month federal investigation that concluded last month without charges. And that made Ketron\u2019s appointment a partisan battle \u2014 albeit one fought out quietly.\n\nIn keeping with tradition in a Capitol that prides itself on civility, those opposed to the nominee chose to abstain rather than to cast a vote against her. There were no floor speeches against the appointment, although Democrats complained afterward that the appointment had been tainted by the circumstances surrounding Puckett\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cPeople were just upset at the way it all went down,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax).\n\nPuckett resigned in the middle of a protracted partisan standoff over whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. His exit threw control of the evenly divided Senate to the GOP, helping to doom Medicaid expansion, Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s top legislative priority.\n\nPuckett also left as he was discussing a job for himself with the Republican-controlled state tobacco commission. Democrats accused him of trading his Senate seat for jobs for himself and his daughter.\n\nPuckett has said there was no quid pro quo. His service in the Senate had been a well-known impediment to the appointment of his daughter, who had the support of local Circuit Court judges and bipartisan backing in the House, which does not share the Senate\u2019s anti-nepotism policy. He also said that his talks with the tobacco commission did not begin until after he had decided to step down.\n\nThe episode also ensnared some high-powered Virginia Democrats who had tried to dissuade Puckett from resigning. U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner and Paul Reagan, chief of staff to McAuliffe, both discussed potential jobs for Ketron as a way of keeping Puckett from quitting.\n\nReagan suggested that she might head a state agency if Puckett remained in the Senate.\n\nWarner called Puckett\u2019s son, Joseph, and discussed potential jobs for the state senator\u2019s daughter, including a federal judgeship and private-sector work.\n\nWarner has acknowledged \u201cbrainstorming\u201d about potential jobs but denied making any explicit job offers to dissuade Puckett from leaving. His actions became an issue in his bid for reelection in November. Warner won a closer-than-expected race over Republican Ed Gillespie.\n\nA federal prosecutor in June launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Puckett\u2019s departure. He announced last month that no charges would be filed.\n\nOn Friday, the Republican Party of Virginia filed a formal ethics complaint against Warner. Pat Mullins, chairman of the state GOP, urged the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee to probe Warner\u2019s actions in connection with Puckett\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201c[I]f Warner offered to use his influence to land a job for anyone based simply on political considerations, he has violated Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which is punishable up to 15 years in prison,\u201d Mullins wrote to the committee.\n\nWarner spokesman Kevin Hall has dismissed Mullins\u2019s letter as a politically motivated effort to keep the Puckett saga alive.\n\nRachel Weiner contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House and Senate approved a judicial appointment for the daughter of former senator Phillip P.
