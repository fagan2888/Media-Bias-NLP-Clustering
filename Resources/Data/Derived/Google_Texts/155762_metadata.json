That would be Nardfest 2, the largest all-local music festival of 2014, happening Saturday at the Majestic Ventura Theater. It\u2019s all in celebration of 30-plus years of punk rock straight out of Oxnard.\n\nThe most populous city in Ventura County was originally known for Henry T. Oxnard\u2019s expansive sugar beet fields on the coastal plain where the topsoil is 40 feet deep, making it a prime component of Ventura County\u2019s booming agriculture industry. But over the last few decades, Oxnard has been known for paving some of the best farmland in the world for no apparent reason. The last election has hopefully reversed that sorry situation and just as there are no more orange groves in Orange County, tuned in local politicians might perhaps prevent a future Strawberry Festival that would be forced to honor pictures of strawberries on the walls of a museum.\n\nSo while Oxnard has farmed and Oxnard has paved, Oxnard has also rocked. Hard. Since the \u201980s, Oxnard has been the home of Nardcore \u2014 Oxnard + hardcore \u2014 and despite its typical omission from all those punk rock documentaries, the Oxnard scene is alive and well and the Ramones are mostly still dead, despite the fact that they sell more T-shirts than ever.\n\nNardfest 2 The second annual concert celebrating Oxnard\u2019s punk scene will take place at 3 p.m. Saturday at the Majestic Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura. Agression member \u201cBig Bob\u201d Clark will kick things off by getting married onstage at 3:30 p.m. The Boxheads perform at 4:15 p.m., followed by Last Priority (5 p.m.), Circle One (5:45 p.m.), Burning Dog (6:30 p.m.), Agression (7:15 p.m.), False Confession (8 p.m.), Stalag 13 (8:45 p.m.), In Control (9:40 p.m.) and Ill Repute (10:35 p.m.). Tickets are $22.50 advance, $27 at the door. Call 653-0721 or visit venturatheater.net or facebook.com/nardfest.\n\nLast year\u2019s Nardfest was a standing room-only hit. At this weekend\u2019s Nardfest II, \u201cBig Bob\u201d Clark, one of the surviving members of Agression, is kicking things off by getting married on stage. Ill Repute, the most successful of the Nardcore bands, is the headliner and they\u2019ll be selling a video and a book recounting their long and loud career.\n\nCore values\n\nThe Nardcore scene burst forth three decades ago \u2014 before the Internet, smartphones and Facebook, Iraq, Afghanistan and 9/11 and before millions of Muslims wanted us dead. Punk rock took off in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, fueled by kids who weren\u2019t feeling the slightest bit groovy. They hated disco, any sort of authority figures and especially dreaded the notion of Ronald Reagan in 1984. Those kids, just like any generation, were convinced that what is supposed to be cool is actually totally lame, so they went about creating something of their own.\n\nEnter the DIY (do-it-yourself) mentality and punk rock. The Sex Pistols from Scary Olde England upset many but inspired even more. CBGB\u2019s was the place to be in NYC, Bad Brains came blasting out of D.C., and El Lay had plenty of gnarly punk bands such as the Germs, the Dils, Black Flag, Fear and the Weirdos. From behind the Orange Curtain, TSOL, Agent Orange and the Adolescents weren\u2019t playing any slow ones.\n\nIn the beginning up here in the 805, there were four local bands sharing the blame for all this and three of them \u2014 Stalag 13, Ill Repute and Agression \u2014 are playing Nardfest on Saturday. Only Dr. Know is knowingly sitting this one out. The Big Three will be ably assisted by the likes of Lost Priority, Burning Dog, In Control, False Confession, Circle One and the Boxheads, who will play a tribute to RKL and the Rat Pack.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the music that first put Oxnard on the map outside the 805, it was the Hernandez brothers. Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez created \u201cLove and Rockets,\u201d an underground comic that made its debut in 1981 and was a smash hit and predated the band of the same name. Before that, however, they made Nardcore band flyers.\n\nFlyers like these helped raise Nardcore's profile in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cEveryone skipped over us \u2014 \u201cThe Decline of Western Civilization\u201d and all those hard-core movies. It always seemed like it went New York, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles. It went everywhere and it went right by us,\u201d recalled Stalag 13 drummer Larry White. \u201cThe first real recognition I noticed of the Oxnard scene was a book about the art behind the flyers from the \u201980s (the title of which we can\u2019t repeat in a family newspaper). What was unique is that they have a section with Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez\u2019s artwork. So, Oxnard had its artists who were putting out those great flyers. So we\u2019re thankful for that because that artwork has outlived anything that I can think of and it was recognized as an art form.\u201d\n\nLucky 13\n\nAs for the music, a revitalized Stalag 13 is still pounding out authentic Nardcore riffs\n\nNot to be confused with the gnarly World War II flick \u201cStalag 17,\u201d for which William Holden won an Oscar, Stalag 13 the band is not so serious. While almost as loud as WWII, the group got its name from the POW camp in the 1960s sitcom \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes\u201d (still running on MeTV).\n\nStalag 13 has lasted five times longer than World War II and, with plenty of breaks, they\u2019re back with four of the five original guys \u2014 White on drums, Blake Cruz and Dave Casillas on guitars and John Morris on bass \u2014 and an able replacement rather than a really long extension chord.\n\n\u201cYeah, man \u2014 we\u2019re back,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe took some time off and then we were only able to do certain shows because Ron (Baird), the singer, lives in Australia \u2014 halfway around the world. We were doing a few little things like the Gnarmageddon Fest a few years ago. He flew out for that. But it just got to be a little too much for him being so far away. Ron is definitely our singer and always will be and when he can come out, his microphone is always waiting for him.\u201d\n\nSo, just as Dave\u2019s not here, neither is Ron, but he wanted to be. Baird almost made it to Nardfest last year, but he\u2019s definitely a no-show this weekend. So a band without a singer is, by default, an instrumental band, right? Never even an option with Stalag.\n\nFor last year\u2019s Nardfest, they drafted Ryan Fredette from In Control to handle the vocal chores. Fredette turned out to be a one-gig wonder.\n\n\u201cRyan from In Control was just dynamite,\u201d at last year\u2019s Nardfest, White said. \u201cWhen we were rehearsing he was a fit like a glass slipper. After that show we had this huge amount of steam behind us \u2026 but Ryan had a lot of stuff going in his personal life and so we went dormant again. Then John Crerar from the Missing 23rd came along and Blake said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna trip out \u2014 I think he\u2019s the right guy.\u2019 So he comes in and he tries on both glass slippers and they fit.\u201d\n\nCrerar will wield the mic on Saturday. So is Stalag back? Sort of. But after Nardfest, stay tuned.\n\n\u201cWe did a bunch of shows this year,\u201d said White, Stalag\u2019s loquacious, busy and self-proclaimed \u201cdrum whore.\u201d \u201cWe did Punk Rock Bowling, and we played with Gang Green, and now we\u2019ve got John with us. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be another change. John will be our guy, with of course, the blessings of Ron. So now we\u2019re just gonna run with it. We\u2019ve done some shows \u2014 maybe not as many as some would like \u2014 but we don\u2019t want to overplay our welcome. I see a lot of bands playing right now that are from the \u201980s and good for them, but we all have careers. I have a career in the motion picture industry and I\u2019d love to commit more time to the band right now, but it\u2019s fun when it\u2019s not so frequent. That\u2019s kind of where we are with this.\u201d\n\n\u2018This crazy journey\u2019\n\nThirty years ago, a bunch of kid bands were playing for a bunch of kids, and now the kids of those kids will be coming out for Nardfest. Time really does fly.\n\n\u201cI had just turned 14 and I was still in junior high,\u201d said Cruz, reflecting on the early days of Stalag 13. \u201cI showed up at E.O. Green Junior High School with a mohawk and an Agression symbol and the school kind of tripped out a little bit. I was asked to join the band \u2014 I think they were getting ready go do some shows \u2014 so I kind of bailed out of E.O. Green and started hitting the road with Stalag. That\u2019s where this crazy journey all began. Crap, man, that was \u201982? Somewhere in there \u2014 a long time ago.\u201d\n\nStalag\u2019s first show must\u2019ve been a classic \u2014 one of those \u201cyou had to be there\u201d affairs.\n\n\u201cOur first gig was at Camarillo High School,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt was in the gym and they made everybody take their shoes off. Everybody was slipping and sliding in their socks and the school was tripping out. It was Agression, Ill Repute, Dr. Know and Stalag 13 \u2014 it was almost like the first Nardfest. It was way back in \u201983 or something like that. I remember people started slamming and scuffing up the gym floor, so they made everyone take their shoes off. And then it got real interesting.\u2019\u2019\n\nStalag 13's debut album, \"In Control,\" was released in 1984. AllMusic.com calls it a \"time capsule of post-hardcore, pre-grunge punk rock.\n\nPunk rock back in the day seems to be inextricably connected to angry bald people exchanging elbows in the manic mosh pits. There were lots of fights. And why not? Everyone was mad about something. Whenever the Oxnard punks took a road trip south to Hell-A, they had to prove that they were nuttier than the southers, which they did time and again. But that was then and this is now. So what\u2019s the biggest bummer these days? The smartphone needs a charge? It\u2019s all kinder, gentler these days, according to Cruz.\n\n``What was the craziest gig? Man, there were so many that it\u2019s hard to say which one was the craziest,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then, it was a little different and definitely not what it is today. The kids today, you know, they\u2019re into it but it\u2019s a little different \u2014 it\u2019s not as crazy. Back then, it was a different lifestyle, you know? It\u2019s not like it used to be. The hippies used to get beat up left and right when they\u2019d go out there. It\u2019s not like anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, here\u2019s a crazy one,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe played on the front lawn of the Federal Building in Los Angeles. I don\u2019t think you can do that today, but we do have a good video of that one.\u201d\n\nPunk rock rocked up here in the 805 in Oxnard at the Casa Tropical, a once upon a time Quonset hut down on Fifth Street by the airport, but also at other places such as the Alano Club, or over in Ventura at the Mayfair Theatre and Mogz and up the coast at La Casa de la Raza, the Anaconda and the Goleta Valley Community Center and all the rest of those places that aren\u2019t there anymore \u2014 mainly due to the One Knucklehead Who Always Screws It Up. Then there were the countless (and short) house parties: one song, then the cops show up.\n\n\u201cYou know, the place I miss the most would have to be the Casa Tropical down on Fifth Street \u2014 that little Quonset hut,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThat was a good one that is no longer around.\u2019\u2019\n\nNardcore lives\n\nPlaying for one\u2019s friends and now one\u2019s friend\u2019s kids has helped to perpetuate the legacy of Nardcore. Most of the original bands are still around and succeeding generations of groups kept sprouting up. On any given day at any high school in the Oxnard Unified District, a couple of kids will be wearing a Nardcore band T-shirt.\n\n\u201cWhen I did the first recordings with Agression,\u2019\u2019 White said, \u201cNardcore hadn\u2019t really formed yet. It kind of started around \u201984 or \u201985. That\u2019s when we started first seeing the diamond shape with the \u201cx\u201d through it. I think Ismael Hernandez of Dr. Know came up with the name \u2018Nardcore,\u2019 so then that symbol took on a whole new meaning. Punk rock never died in Oxnard. It went dormant in a lot of cities but not in Oxnard for some reason. It never slowed down. There was just such a pride in the music and the bands coming out of Oxnard, and I just think people saw there was a scene that would survive and they supported each other. I think the Nardcore scene is stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nCruz is stoked about the reception Stalag 13\u2019s receives now.\n\n\u201cWhen we go up to San Francisco or wherever we\u2019re at there\u2019s all these kids who weren\u2019t even born when we started,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut you can hear them singing louder than the singer, and here they are knowing every word \u2014 more than I do, even. It\u2019s pretty funny and it\u2019s pretty cool, man, that all that is still going on.\u201d\n\nThe legacy of Nardcore and Stalag 13 seems secure but is there a future for these local icons? You betcha. In addition to the usual 25 songs in the band\u2019s repertoire, the well-rested guys in Stalag may be up for some new music.\n\nContributed photo\n\nThe members of Stalag 13 pose for a recent shot. Clockwise from top left are drummer Larry White, singer Ron Baird, bassist John Morris and guitarists Blake Cruz and Dave Casillas.\n\n``We did some recording last time Ron was here about two years ago and we\u2019ve been wondering what to do with it,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe need to mix that thing down and take it to Dr. Strange Records and we\u2019ll have them release it. So we have that in the works and maybe what we\u2019ll do is keep that and write some new material with John on it and come out with a flip side CD.\u201d\n\nAnd with a new album, we all know what that means, right? Another of those endless, mindless, senseless (and darn fun) road trips.\n\n\u201cThe goal now is to take it over to Europe, man, maybe next year or the year after that,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf Stalag 13 gets over there maybe we can meet Ron \u2014 maybe he can come halfway.\u201d\n\nThese days, the Nardcore scene is like a big, loud high school reunion with a bunch of old pals busy creating some new good old days.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cool about this Nardfest thing is that it\u2019s all just one big family,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been around for a while and been able to still play some music. Besides Agression losing a bunch of their guys (Mark Hickey and Henry Knowles have died), everyone else seems to be still going pretty strong. Ill Repute has really taken off, you know? They\u2019ve got a good little thing going on. It\u2019s just good to be with all these bands again.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s Nardcore 2 all about? Plenty of loud and fast music and a chance to take some pride in your local musicians who will be more than happy so sell you an affordable T-shirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the bands are great and I think it\u2019s going to be another fun night,\u201d White said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Hear the roar of Nardcore on Saturday", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/entertainment/music/hear-the-roar-of-nardcore-on-saturday-ep-553795685-351162451.html", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/stalag13drum_7367876_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Local group\u2019s banding together to celebrate Oxnard\u2019s blistering brand of punk at Nardfest 2", "title": "Hear the roar of Nardcore on Saturday"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/stalag13drum_7367876_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Hear the roar of Nardcore on Saturday", "description": "Local group\u2019s banding together to celebrate Oxnard\u2019s blistering brand of punk at Nardfest 2", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3ac9\"", "article_summary": "Ill Repute, the most successful of the Nardcore bands, is the headliner and they\u2019ll be selling a video and a book recounting their long and loud career.\nSHARE \u00a9 Nick Filoso Larry White, decked out in an \u201cIn Control\u201d T-shirt, pounds the drums at a Stalag 13 gig.\nContributed photo The members of Stalag 13 pose for a recent shot.\nI think the Nardcore scene is stronger than ever.\u201dCruz is stoked about the reception Stalag 13\u2019s receives now.\n\u201cRyan from In Control was just dynamite,\u201d at last year\u2019s Nardfest, White said."}
