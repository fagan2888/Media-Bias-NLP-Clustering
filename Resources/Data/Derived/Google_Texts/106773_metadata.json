John Kasich demanded fiscal responsibility and defended his Obamacare Medicaid expansion during a recent speech before the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cPeople, ya know, there\u2019s all this thing about Republicans don\u2019t wanna spend and Democrats do. Conservatives on the Republican side say, \u2018We want smaller government.\u2019 Well, go and talk to them about how much smaller government they really want,\u201d Kasich told the year-end gathering of Ohio Chamber members on Dec. 18.\n\n\u201cYa know, it\u2019s great in theory. But then when you start gettin\u2019 down to makin\u2019 the changes, it gets to be pretty hard,\u201d the Republican governor said. \u201cIn our state, I think \u2014 I know \u2014 that there\u2019s no way we woulda wiped out that $8 billion hole had we not been required to.\u201d\n\nKasich, who is promoting a federal Balanced Budget Amendment, came into office in 2011 facing a deficit estimated by Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, the former state auditor, at $8 billion.\n\nPointing to the $18 trillion national debt, Kasich asked attendees at the Ohio Chamber event, \u201cAt what point do things start falling apart? I mean, you can\u2019t keep spending what you don\u2019t have and get away with it.\u201d\n\nMoments later in response to a question about his Obamacare expansion, which has put more than 450,000 Ohioans on Medicaid, Kasich said, \u201cYa know, I was the first really big-state governor to push this. And now what I find is all these other states are sneakin\u2019 around tryin\u2019 to figure out how to cash in.\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is funded by new federal spending. Ohio soon will exhaust $2.5 billion in Obamacare money appropriated by the Ohio Controlling Board after the Kasich administration warned the state Medicaid program would go bankrupt without it.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen as a result of this: saved lives, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Kasich said.\n\n\u201cNow the overall Medicaid issue in this country, because we\u2019ve expanded, other states expand, how\u2019s the government afford it? Well, all these entitlements need to be reformed, but in the middle of reforming them you just don\u2019t cut off your nose to spite your face and make some declarative statement and then people can\u2019t get any help.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "He worries about spending, but still defends the medicaid expansion.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He worries about spending, but still defends the medicaid expansion.", "title": "Kasich Defends Medicaid Expansion in Ohio", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/krtphotoslive569591.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-07T13:00:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wc6gSN"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He worries about spending, but still defends the medicaid expansion.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/krtphotoslive569591.jpg"}, "title": "Kasich Defends Medicaid Expansion in Ohio", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "medicaid", "published_time": "2015-01-07T03:01:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-07T13:00:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "John Kasich, Obamacare, Medicaid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffc3\"", "article_summary": "John Kasich demanded fiscal responsibility and defended his Obamacare Medicaid expansion during a recent speech before the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.\nOhio soon will exhaust $2.5 billion in Obamacare money appropriated by the Ohio Controlling Board after the Kasich administration warned the state Medicaid program would go bankrupt without it.\nPointing to the $18 trillion national debt, Kasich asked attendees at the Ohio Chamber event, \u201cAt what point do things start falling apart?\nAnd now what I find is all these other states are sneakin\u2019 around tryin\u2019 to figure out how to cash in.\u201dObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is funded by new federal spending.\n\u201cPeople, ya know, there\u2019s all this thing about Republicans don\u2019t wanna spend and Democrats do."}
