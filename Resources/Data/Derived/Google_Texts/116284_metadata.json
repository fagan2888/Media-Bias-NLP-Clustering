The Daily Show, at the peak of its relevance due to the second Iraq War and the contentious 2004 election, was on the verge of losing its second right-hand man, Stephen Colbert. The previous year had seen the show part with Steve Carrell, and the network was concerned about bleeding talent to Hollywood.\n\nColbert, contrary to popular belief, actually preceded Stewart\u2019s stint on TDS, having been hired during Craig Kilborn\u2019s tenure. Like many comedians, he did his time in Chicago\u2019s Second City, before joining Amy Sedaris in the wonderfully bizarre sketch comedy show Exit 57 and the now legendary writing staff of The Dana Carvey Show. He gained underground appeal both through his work with Carell of \u201cThe Ambiguously Gay Duo\u201d on SNL and on Sedaris\u2019 cult classic \u201cStrangers with Candy.\u201d But it was really under Stewart that he came of age.\n\nHis occasional stints behind the desk (particularly during Stewart\u2019s wife\u2019s pregnancy) were memorable and suggested that should Stewart ever leave, the show would be in good hands. But after 7 years, the network was keen to tie Colbert down. \u201cThe Report\u201d had run a few times as a brief segment on The Daily Show, obviously lampooning Bill O\u2019Reilly, and when the network asked him for a pitch, \u201cThe Report\u201d was what he wanted.\n\nSlideshow: The 10 Best-Selling Video Games of 2014\n\nThere were some immediate concerns. Whether or not it\u2019s true, there is a sense that the person we see behind the desk 4 nights a week on TDS is Jon Stewart. Whereas \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d is obviously not Stephen Colbert. There were concerns about the sustainability of the performance; that what worked as 3-4 minutes of parody within a deeper show might not be able to hold 23 minutes. And what would he do about interviews? Would he interview guests as the character? Wouldn\u2019t this shtick wear thin?\n\nAs it turns out, the concerns were unfounded. The Colbert Report worked in part because of Colbert\u2019s brilliance, and in part because the subjects he parodied continued to become more ridiculous themselves. (If Andrea Tantaros\u2019 recent \u201cAmerica is Awesome\u201d moment, for instance, had appeared as a sketch on the show, critics would have thought it over the top.)\n\nWhen Colbert departs on Thursday, he will be dearly missed.\n\nColbert and his writing staff were able to create segments that became almost instant classics from The Word, to Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger, to The Threat Down, to Better Know a District (which finished in style last week).\n\n\n\nColbert was an agile entertainer who allowed bits of his own ridiculous personality to seep through in a way that both fit the show and allowed us to see the real man. His honest, devoted Catholicism was a surprising touchstone on the show, as was his love of bourbon and South Carolina BBQ (and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he really hated bears). He was unabashedly nerdy, long before it was fashionable, with an almost disturbing love of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nIf anything, the show finishes stronger than ever, especially when it comes to politics. Viewers will remember Colbert during Bush 43\u2019s presidency, his barbs at Fox News\u2019 half-decade long temper-tantrum regarding the election of President Obama, and his mocking skits of a clueless Mitt Romney.\n\nRelated: Dave Grohl\u2019s HBO Show Is Great\u2026Except for Dave Grohl\n\nThe interviews that had the network so concerned were often Colbert\u2019s finest moments. He was rarely bested (admittedly at his own game) and was happy to pounce on an oblivious power player, a smug talking head, or someone he thought was being disingenuous. But he could just as easily be gentle with a less media savvy guest. He knew that he could seem like a legitimate bully, and not a parody of one. Like Stewart he could be a gentlemanly flirt with the right guest, but where Stewart tends to spark to sassy ing\u00e9nues, Colbert likes a sparring partner. Kirsten Gillibrand, Doris Kearns Godwin, and particularly Slate\u2019s legal expert Emily Bazelon all had multiple memorable appearances.\n\nHe was never shy in taunting his heroes or playing devil\u2019s advocate with those he agreed with. He once put notoriously press shy, serious and stubbornly anti-corporate Radiohead in a series of chairs loudly branded as \u201cThe Dr. Pepper Fun Zone.\u201d He pushed Barney Frank to the point he simply stopped participating in the interview. It says a lot that Bill O\u2019Reilly considers Colbert\u2019s show flattering.\n\n\n\nWhile he could be amazingly political (his super-PAC cast the most devastating criticism on Citizens United imaginable,, his stint as host of The White House correspondent dinner has become the stuff of legends). Colbert himself seems far more interested in calling out the hypocrisy of the media than the double standards of politicians.\n\nNow, as curtain is drawn on his show, it\u2019s the weirder moments that stand out. His many LotR tributes, his guitar hero dual, his \u201cfeud\u201d with Conan O\u2019Brien\u2026the man wrestled a Minotaur for heaven\u2019s sake.\n\n\n\nSo what will Colbert\u2019s version of The Late Show look like? Will we meet a new non-Colbert Colbert? For those concerned that he\u2019ll falter, it should be pointed out that many people had the same reservations about the cranky and condescending Letterman himself stepping into the 11:30 slot; and that worked out just fine. With his mix of super-smarts, Southern charm and Irish Blarney, Stephen Colbert should do just fine.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Stephen Colbert enters into the final week of his land mark television series, he leaves behind a legacy as one of televisions finest satirists.", "title": "Stephen Colbert: 9 Years of Epic \u2018Truthiness\u2019 Comes to an End", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/15/Stephen-Colbert-9-Years-Epic-Truthiness-Comes-End", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05102012_Stephen_Colbert_CC_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/15/Stephen-Colbert-9-Years-Epic-Truthiness-Comes-End", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05102012_Stephen_Colbert_CC_article.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As Stephen Colbert enters into the final week of his land mark television series, he leaves behind a legacy as one of televisions finest satirists.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcceb4\"", "article_summary": "Whereas \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d is obviously not Stephen Colbert.\nWith his mix of super-smarts, Southern charm and Irish Blarney, Stephen Colbert should do just fine.\nThe Daily Show, at the peak of its relevance due to the second Iraq War and the contentious 2004 election, was on the verge of losing its second right-hand man, Stephen Colbert.\nThe Colbert Report worked in part because of Colbert\u2019s brilliance, and in part because the subjects he parodied continued to become more ridiculous themselves.\nColbert, contrary to popular belief, actually preceded Stewart\u2019s stint on TDS, having been hired during Craig Kilborn\u2019s tenure."}
