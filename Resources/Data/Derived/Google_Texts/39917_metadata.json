A lady with a lighting device was standing over him.\n\nFollowing a workout Thursday at Impact Performance & Fitness, Ware explained he was going through a therapy called \u201ccupping,\u201d an Eastern medicine technique.\n\n\u201cIt is like a jar, and you put a hot fire in there and the heat that\u2019s in there just sucks the skin up in there,\u201d Ware said. \u201cIt keeps your pores open and it sucks that bad blood that\u2019s on the surface of your epidermis. The skin. It helps with blood flow. It helps out a lot.\u201d\n\nAlthough he is two weeks away from turning 32, Ware says he has never felt better. A pass-rushing outside linebacker by trade, he tried to play near 270 pounds \u2014 15 more pounds than usual \u2014 as a defensive end last season when the Dallas Cowboys switched from a 3-4 to a 4-3.\n\nThe Broncos play a 4-3 but there are enough 3-4 principles to where Ware mostly starts from the stand-up position. Working in the offseason with his longtime personal trainer Kevin Kordish, Ware\u2019s weight is down to 250-255 pounds.\n\n\u201cI feel better than I did the last two years going into the season,\u201d Ware said. \u201cStronger, faster. I feel flexible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dallas Cowboys,DeMarcus Ware,Denver Broncos,Offseason,sacks", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "DeMarcus Ware recently sent out an Instagram that showed him laying flat on his stomach and at least 20 jars positioned on his back, part of a recovery effort.", "title": "DeMarcus Ware shares \"cupping\" technique for football recovery", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/18/demarcus-ware-shares-cupping-technique/28195/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/demarcus-ware-denver-broncos-otas.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "DeMarcus Ware recently sent out an Instagram that showed him laying flat on his stomach and at least 20 jars positioned on his back, part of a recovery effort.", "title": "DeMarcus Ware shares \u201ccupping\u201d technique for football recovery", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/18/demarcus-ware-shares-cupping-technique/28195/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/demarcus-ware-denver-broncos-otas.jpg", "creator": "@mikeklis", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "DeMarcus Ware recently sent out an Instagram that showed him laying flat on his stomach and at least 20 jars positioned on his back, part of a recovery effort."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf8a\"", "article_summary": "Following a workout Thursday at Impact Performance & Fitness, Ware explained he was going through a therapy called \u201ccupping,\u201d an Eastern medicine technique.\n\u201cI feel better than I did the last two years going into the season,\u201d Ware said.\nSOUTHLAKE, Texas \u2014 DeMarcus Ware joins the Broncos with 117 career sacks and a wealth of knowledge in how to attain optimum performance.\nThe Broncos play a 4-3 but there are enough 3-4 principles to where Ware mostly starts from the stand-up position.\nIt helps out a lot.\u201dAlthough he is two weeks away from turning 32, Ware says he has never felt better."}
