On Christmas morning, following the instructions of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the journalist entered the Russian embassy in Kiev to renew his visa. There, a young foreign service officer read him this prepared statement:\n\n\u201cThe competent organs have decided that your presence on the territory of the Russian Federation is not desirable. You are banned from entering Russia.\u201d\n\nWithout warning or explanation, Satter had been kicked out of the country, becoming the first correspondent to be expelled since the fall of communism in 1991.\n\nFrom the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev to that of Vladimir Putin, Satter chronicled the transition of the old Soviet Union into the new Russian Federation. Eager to cultivate the appearance of transparency, Russian authorities trumpeted his presence \u201cas an example of just how tolerant they were.\u201d\n\nBut everything changed with the revolution in Ukraine, Satter said.\n\nSatter told The Daily Signal that he interprets his expulsion as an attempt to silence criticism from the outside world and keep the truth from the Russian people. He said Ukrainian unrest triggered an internal shift in the Russian regime, bringing those to power who were eager to hide \u201cthe true meaning of what happened\u201d across the border in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe popular anti-criminal revolution [in Ukraine] sets a horrible precedent from the view of Russia\u2019s criminal leaders,\u201d he said.\n\nSatter said he was identified as a threat by those \u201cadvocating a tighter grip on information,\u201d and summarily kicked out of the country. He called his expulsion a historical \u201charbinger, a kind of sign that something had really changed.\u201d\n\nThe period of relative transparency in Russia is over, he said. Now the regime is attempting to distract Russians\u2019 \u201cattention by doing what they always do\u2014starting a war.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, Satter said, Putin\u2019s gamble appears to be paying off. He enjoys stratospheric approval ratings, and Russians have rallied around the war effort. But it won\u2019t last, he said.\n\n\u201cDespite the chauvinism of the moment,\u201d the Russian people harbor \u201cwidespread discontent at the lawlessness and corruption [in Russia] just as there was in Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nA journalist turned professor who considers himself a lifelong student of Russia, Satter also had sharp words for the conduct of the Obama administration as it relates to Russia.\n\nHe said the Russian Reset policy reflected the \u201ccrass political motivations\u201d and \u201clack of principle\u201d of those in the State Department, \u201cwho should have been qualified to tell the president that you\u2019re completely misinterpreting Russia.\u201d\n\nToday, Russia teeters on the edge of barbarism, Satter said, and his expulsion demonstrates the instability.\n\n\u201cA civilized country should not fear the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my case they made it clear that indeed they do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A reporter kicked out of Russia says Putin's government has grown fearful the backlash against corruption in Ukraine could destabilize Russia as well.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A reporter kicked out of Russia says Putin's government has grown fearful the backlash against corruption in Ukraine could destabilize Russia as well.", "title": "Journalist: \u2019Anti-Criminal Revolution\u2019 in Ukraine Worries Russia", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141014_DavidSatter_Wegmann.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-07T00:39:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1t4lPJD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A reporter kicked out of Russia says Putin's government has grown fearful the backlash against corruption in Ukraine could destabilize Russia as well.", "title": "Journalist: \u2019Anti-Criminal Revolution\u2019 in Ukraine Worries Russia", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141014_DavidSatter_Wegmann.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "conflict,europe", "published_time": "2014-11-07T11:01:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T00:39:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Russia, Ukraine, Putin, Obama, Russian reset, David Satter, London Financial Times, Wall Street Journal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae52\"", "article_summary": "A journalist turned professor who considers himself a lifelong student of Russia, Satter also had sharp words for the conduct of the Obama administration as it relates to Russia.\nEager to cultivate the appearance of transparency, Russian authorities trumpeted his presence \u201cas an example of just how tolerant they were.\u201dBut everything changed with the revolution in Ukraine, Satter said.\n\u201cThe popular anti-criminal revolution [in Ukraine] sets a horrible precedent from the view of Russia\u2019s criminal leaders,\u201d he said.\nOn Christmas morning, following the instructions of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the journalist entered the Russian embassy in Kiev to renew his visa.\nRussian authorities never threatened American journalist David Satter."}
