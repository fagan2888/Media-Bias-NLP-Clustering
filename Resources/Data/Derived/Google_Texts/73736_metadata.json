The president\u2019s handling of the war on Islamic terrorism, the Guantanamo prison, and Syrian refugees are other expected conflict points. Though, there may be more agreement on criminal justice reform and trade treaties.\n\nJoining me now from Washington to look ahead at the agenda on Capitol Hill is NEWSHOUR political director Lisa Desjardins.\n\nSo, Lisa, just had your story in the middle of the week about the \u201cdo something\u201d Congress. We did get some stuff done on highway transportation funding and making some tax cuts permanent. But as we start the New Year, it looks like the repeal of Obamacare will actually land at the president\u2019s desk.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS, NEWSHOUR POLITICAL DIRECTOR: So, that\u2019s right. They\u2019re starting with some contention on one of the biggest political issues but, of course, we expect a veto on that. Republicans, probably, Hari, will try to pass more repeals. It\u2019s good for them in an election year and it\u2019s obviously something they feel strongly about.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: What does it look like in terms of things they do want to get accomplished?\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Here\u2019s the good news. There are some major pieces of legislation to watch this year.\n\nI think the biggest one by far is criminal justice reform. Two reasons I think that we will see major reform this year or that it\u2019s likely, one is that want way our prison system works right now, Hari, about two million prisoners, as you may know are, in American prisons right now. Of those, the vast majority are in state prisons. That\u2019s red states and blue states. They\u2019re paying $20,000 a prisoner, and that\u2019s been crippling state budgets.\n\nRed states have been trying to look for a way to reform the system. All that at the same time as there\u2019s an increasing recognition that all of these Americans in prison has a long-term devastating effect on families and ultimately on the economy, on education.\n\nSo, wrapping all that up, what that gets us to is a place where some staunch Republicans in Congress, like John Cornyn of Texas, and President Obama in the White House, all want to fix the system.\n\nThey\u2019ve proposed a bill, Hari, that does a lot of things. Two big points on it: one, it would roll back that three strikes rule where if you get three strikes drug crimes, you\u2019ll have mandatory life sentence. It cancels that. And the other thing it does is that it will review the sentences for most all federal prisoners and allow some of them to spend a quarter of their sentence at home if they\u2019re thought to be nonviolent.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. And this doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, as you pointed out. This is an election year. How does that affect the legislative agenda?\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Well, actually, I\u2019m going to hold up a little tell here \u2014 a little show-and-tell. This is the House calendar and that is affected by the election year. There are four months the House will be mostly gone, and that\u2019s to run for reelection, most of July, August, much \u2014 almost all of October, and November, lawmakers will not be here. Their primary job this year, as many of them see it, is probably to be re-elected.\n\nI think we will see them raise some issues, especially Republicans, that they think help them, and maybe help their presidential chances. Because, Hari, the Senate is a place that Republicans are a little bit worried. They\u2019re concerned that there\u2019s a chance that if things go Democrats\u2019 way in general, they could lose the Senate.\n\nSo, watch House Speaker Paul Ryan, Hari, speaking to him and his staff, I know he\u2019s going to try to put forth a very serious agenda, perhaps on things like education, health care. I don\u2019t know that things will be passed, but he wants to try and show that Republicans have policy ideas which is something he and I think other leaders are now admitting has been a problem in the past few years.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: What about the prospects for a trade deal that we heard so much about this year?\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: It\u2019s going to be fascinating to watch that, Hari. The president needs a majority vote in both the House and Senate, but already Senate leader Mitch McConnell said he doesn\u2019t think the vote will come before the election. Maybe not until there\u2019s even a new president in office. So, it\u2019s going to be touch and go but we\u2019re going to watch it closely all year.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. The NEWSHOUR\u2019s Lisa Desjardins joining us from Washington \u2014 thanks so much.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.
