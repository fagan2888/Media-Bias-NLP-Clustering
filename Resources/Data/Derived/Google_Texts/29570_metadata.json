In Blackmon, Weiss saw a smart, fast player with power potential and a tireless work ethic.\n\nWhen the Rockies traded Dexter Fowler to Houston during the winter, Weiss figured he already had Fowler\u2019s replacement in hand. Blackmon has proved him right.\n\nBlackmon entered Friday night\u2019s game against the Los Angelese Dodgers with 19 homers and 47 extra-base hits.\n\nFrom the leadoff spot, Blackmon is hitting .288 with 69 RBIs, the most among major-league leadoff men.\n\nTrue, his .333 on-base percentage ranks just fifth among NL qualifiers, but throw in Blackmon\u2019s 28 stolen bases \u2014 the most by a Colorado player since Willy Taveras set a team record with 68 in 2008 \u2014 and he has fulfilled Weiss\u2019 expectations.\n\nRather than bulking up for power during the offseason, Blackmon focused on improving his speed and ability to get a quick jump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s paid off,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s turned into a very good base-stealer. I think it\u2019s about increased confidence. He started thinking like a base-stealer.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s a student of the game. He studies a lot of video of opposing pitchers, so he knows who he can run on. He goes into a game very prepared.\u201d\n\nDickersons expecting. Corey Dickerson\u2019s breakout season with the Rockies is over. He has returned to his native Mississippi to be with his wife, Beth Anne. The couple is expecting their first child.\n\nDickerson hit .312 with a .364 on-base percentage and has a team-high 24 home runs.\n\nThough still not a refined outfielder, he\u2019s made significant strides in left field. He\u2019s improved enough that Weiss recently said he feels comfortable leaving in Dickerson to play left field during the late innings of tight ballgames.\n\nKershaw for MVP. The most recent National League pitcher to win the NL\u2019s MVP award was St. Louis\u2019 Bob Gibson in 1968.\n\nDodgers ace Clayton Kershaw, who no-hit the Rockies in June at Dodger Stadium, is on the verge of matching Gibson\u2019s feat.\n\nHe has earned Weiss\u2019 vote.\n\n\u201cI think in only extreme cases should a pitcher win an MVP, but I think he\u2019s making a case for that with the season he\u2019s put together,\u201d the manager said. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ve witnessed it firsthand. If a guy dominates at the level he has, he has to be in the MVP conversation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an issue with Kershaw being the MVP. I think he\u2019s been that dominate this year.\u201d Patrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Charlie Blackmon has big fan in Colorado Rockies manager Walt Weiss", "title": "Charlie Blackmon has big fan in Colorado Rockies manager Walt Weiss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/26/charlie-blackmon-has-big-fan-in-colorado-rockies-manager-walt-weiss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926_115403_charlie-blackmon.jpg", "height": 503}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926_115403_charlie-blackmon.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T23:56:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:22:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedae\"", "article_summary": "I think he\u2019s been that dominate this year.\u201d Patrick Saunders, The Denver Post\nIn Blackmon, Weiss saw a smart, fast player with power potential and a tireless work ethic.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was about this time last year when Rockies manager Walt Weiss started thinking he had found a starting center fielder and leadoff hitter in Charlie Blackmon.\nWhen the Rockies traded Dexter Fowler to Houston during the winter, Weiss figured he already had Fowler\u2019s replacement in hand.\nFrom the leadoff spot, Blackmon is hitting .288 with 69 RBIs, the most among major-league leadoff men."}
