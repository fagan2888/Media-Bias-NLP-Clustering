The U.S. is facing a massive heroin epidemic, and nowhere is it more evident than in Ohio, where fatal drug overdoses surpassed car crashes as the leading cause of accidental death in 2007, and increased by 60 percent from 2011 to 2012. Addicts in rehabilitation say heroin is the easiest drug to find. State legislators have called for Republican Governor John Kasich to declare the prevalence of heroin a public-health emergency, and in May he agreed to an Obamacare Medicaid expansion largely because the state badly needed the federal help in funding treatment for heroin addiction. Perry, Ohio, is a microcosm of the epidemic, which is now infiltrating upper-middle-class suburbs. Thirty minutes east of Cleveland, the town of 1,500 has a median annual income $31,000 higher than that of Ohio overall, but it also lacks opportunities for young adults to start their lives. With the exception of the technical jobs offered by the nuclear power plant\u2014a definitive feature of the town\u2014those without a college degree travel to neighboring towns to work in retail or service industries, and those with a degree rarely return. When I graduated high school six years ago, most of the people in my class left Perry for college, but many of those who stayed behind eventually turned to heroin to cope with their anxieties about the future. Addiction to the drug is growing most quickly among people between the ages of 18 and 25, like the friends who fell off my Facebook timeline as their lives became absorbed by their addiction. I\u2019m seeing their names pop up for the first time in years, with posts like \"48 hours of sobriety and all I\u2019ve gotten is this lousy t-shirt.\" Over time, I forgot about many of these people as I made new friends and experienced new things, and as my Facebook feed became populated with photos of frat parties and college football games. While I photo-bragged about crazy beer fests or complained about all-nighters at the library, they posted less and less. As they turned away from friends and family in real life for fear of negative feedback, they turned away from Facebook, too. Richard Foster, the executive vice president of treatment programs for Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Pennsylvania, says active addicts are \u201cnot talking to family and friends and they\u2019re not posting on social media about their struggles.\u201d In active addiction, he says, they are still in denial, usually turning back to their friends, family, and social media only when they are in stages of recovery and proud to share it. Now, I\u2019m seeing their names pop up for the first time in years, with posts like \u201c48 hours of sobriety and all I\u2019ve gotten is this lousy t-shirt,\u201d messages of encouragement filling the comments. In contrast to the usual slew of carefully choreographed photos of graduations, vacations, and weddings, the raw honesty of these posts is striking. For heroin addicts, who must cut ties with their communities of users as part of recovery, Facebook is both a support system, connecting them back to relationships they had before their addiction, and a venue that helps others understand the fragility of the recovery process. For some in Perry who struggle with heroin addiction, Facebook is a way to call for help and support. For those of us who have left, their posts are stark reminders of the reality of the problem ravaging our quaint hometown.\n\nIt was a post from a high school class clown named Khari on September 17 that alerted me that a friend had passed away from an overdose that day. Comments like \u201cPlease get healthy!\u201d and \u201cSee? Don\u2019t be messing with that stuff!\u201d came flooding in by the dozens. In high school, through puberty and awkward social changes, Khari was funny, fearless, and blunt. When I called her after seeing her post, she talked about the years since we graduated high school, the times she has been in and out of jail for heroin-related crimes, and the friends and boyfriends who overdosed and died. When I knew her at 19 years old, Khari was against heroin; she says she was \u201cone of those ignorant profiling assholes\u201d that chastised people who did it. But after seeing friends leave town, she started feeling like she was missing out on life and turned to heroin as a way to deal with the pains of the quarter-life crisis. \u201cWhen everybody left Perry, that\u2019s when it went to shit,\u201d she says. Related Story Heroin Addiction's Fraught History She says that after the most recent overdose death in Perry, the most difficult part for her was seeing the online activity of old friends struggling to cope with the pain of loss and the confusion that comes with addiction. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with this on and off for six years, so watching [people] I grew up with go through it was really hard for me,\u201d Khari says. Emma is another Perry kid, one I knew through mutual friends, who turned to heroin after high school. She started smoking weed at age 12; by 15, she and her friends were taking Oxycodone. At 17, her boyfriend taught her how to shoot up heroin, saying that he was protecting her by showing her how to do it safely. When her friends left for college, she moved into her boyfriend\u2019s grandmother\u2019s basement, and she says that\u2019s when things turned for the worse. She felt like she didn\u2019t have anything to look forward to, as if she was doing nothing with her life. \u201cI remember the day all my friends left for college,\u201d she says. \u201cI was stuck in Perry and it just made me want to get high even more.\u201d\n\nFor the next six years, Emma was in and out of relatives\u2019 basements, friends\u2019 couches, and rehab centers in California and Florida for months at a time. Once, on a binge while in treatment in California, she crashed the car of her employer into the car of the owner of the rehab center. She was kicked out, and moved back to Perry to attempt to start her life over \u2026 again. She relapsed in 10 days, spending the next two months getting high and using up the entire $6,000 she had saved. Now seven months sober at a different rehab center in California, she has been posting her progress on Facebook routinely: \u201c90 days sober!\u201d received over 200 likes and comments. \u201cThere\u2019s people [commenting] that I haven\u2019t seen in years, people that knew me from I was little,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mom\u2019s friends are saying \u2018I remember when you were little\u2019 and saying that they are proud of me.\u201d She says seeing people from her childhood showing that they care helps keep her accountable for her sobriety. The feedback confirms that a community cares about her recovery. \u201cIt makes me feel really good, you know?\u201d Foster, the rehab-center executive, says the shield of the screen may make people feel more comfortable admitting they\u2019ve been an addict than they would be in real life. \u201cIt\u2019s safer than going in to a room and saying \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Rich and I\u2019m an addict,\u2019\u201d he says. \"Liking someone\u2019s status about clean time is a good way to remain supportive without too much risk.\" But Angela, another classmate who popped back on my timeline last year with an announcement of newfound sobriety, is more skeptical of the role social media can play in recovery. She says that while the encouragement from Facebook can be uplifting, it doesn\u2019t help people understand the intensity of addiction. \u201cLiking someone\u2019s status about clean time is a good way to remain supportive without too much risk, especially for people you\u2019ve been close to who have been hurt by broken promises and relapse,\u201d she says, but posting about her problems in the throes of addiction would likely scare people away from reaching out. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell people, \u2018I\u2019m so sick, I\u2019m dying, please give me money so I don\u2019t have to go fuck the dope boy or go rob somebody.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Social media can be a support system for people struggling to give up heroin\u2014and a window into what the drug has cost them.", "author": "Stephanie Stark", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Social media can be a support system for people struggling to give up heroin\u2014and a window into what the drug has cost them.", "title": "Watching Friends Recover From Addiction on Facebook", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/10/2636499177_c1c34d7574_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/watching-friends-recover-from-addiction-on-facebook/381611/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf212\"", "article_summary": "For some in Perry who struggle with heroin addiction, Facebook is a way to call for help and support.\nAs they turned away from friends and family in real life for fear of negative feedback, they turned away from Facebook, too.\nEmma is another Perry kid, one I knew through mutual friends, who turned to heroin after high school.\nAddiction to the drug is growing most quickly among people between the ages of 18 and 25, like the friends who fell off my Facebook timeline as their lives became absorbed by their addiction.\nShe says that while the encouragement from Facebook can be uplifting, it doesn\u2019t help people understand the intensity of addiction."}
