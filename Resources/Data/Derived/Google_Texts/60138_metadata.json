Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations health subcommittee, says she is \u201chappy\u201d to include a rider in the spending bill that would limit payments to insurance companies under ObamaCare.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt issue is an ObamaCare program called \u201crisk corridors\u201d meant to shield insurers from heavy losses as the law got up and running. Last year, Republicans were able to secure a rider in the spending bill making the program \u201cbudget neutral,\u201d meaning that the Obama administration could not shift other funds into the program.\n\nRepublicans are pressing for the rider to be included again in this year's funding bill in order to prevent what they've called a \u201cbailout\u201d of insurance companies under the health law.\n\nAnd DeLauro, at least, is not fighting them.\n\n\u201cI'd be happy to have it in there,\u201d she said, noting that it\u2019s better than other ObamaCare riders from her perspective.\n\n\u201cIt's not the rider that talks about defunding the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said.\n\nThe health insurance industry is pushing against the provision and is also pushing for broader changes to boost the risk corridor program.\n\nBut, DeLauro said, \u201cI don't carry a brief for the insurance companies. They do pretty well.\u201d\n\nIn October, the Obama administration announced that not enough money had come into the program and insurers would only be getting 12.6 percent of the $2.87 billion that they requested.\n\nThat left a hole in the budgets of insurance companies and contributed to the closure of several nonprofit co-op health plans set up under the law. Even UnitedHealthcare, the nation's largest insurer, cited the risk corridor shortfall when it said last month that it could exit the ObamaCare marketplaces after 2016.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the insurer trade group, points to the nearly 800,000 people who have to change their coverage after losing it through the closure of co-ops and other plans.\n\n\"There is a growing recognition about the instability facing consumers in the market,\u201d AHIP spokeswoman Clare Krusing said in a statement. \u201cNearly 800,000 Americans have faced coverage disruptions as a result of the significant and unexpected shortfall with the risk corridors program. Congress and the Administration must act to make sure consumers are protected.\u201d\n\nThe spending bill is still being negotiated, and the insurance industry has not seen a specific risk corridor proposal to comment on.\n\nSen.
