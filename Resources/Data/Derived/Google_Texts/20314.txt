President Obama has nominated a longtime Duke University cardiologist to take the helm of the Food and Drug Administration, tapping Dr. Robert Califf to head the agency for the administrationâ€™s final 16 months.

Califf has served as a deputy FDA commissioner since March. He has worked extensively on speeding up the development of medical innovations, a cause that is getting increased support from both the White House and Congress.

Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are working on legislation to accelerate federal approval of new drugs and medical devices, an initiative that is being applauded by medical groups but is viewed warily by many consumer advocates.

A decade ago, Califf founded the Duke Translational Medicine Institute, which has provided money to researchers to develop clinical trials of experimental drugs and to work through the regulatory process.

If confirmed by the Senate, Califf would succeed Dr. Margaret Hamburg, who resigned as FDA commissioner in March.

Hamburg, who held the job for six years, is a former New York City health commissioner.
