Officials said the firearm was found in the 17-year-old's backpack. They're each facing charges of possession of a firearm on school property and possession of a firearm by a minor.\n\n\"That's crazy,\" a student told WESH 2 News.\n\n\n\nWESH 2 News asked the student if the incident made them nervous.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, how many other people are going to bring handguns with them?\" the student said.\n\nThe district praised the student who told the parent about the video.
