Of those, 42 babies were showing symptoms of withdrawal, which can include seizures, excessive crying, fever, sweating and vomiting.\n\nLast year, DHS reported 322 newborns who tested positive for drugs or alcohol. The new data indicates a 16.5 percent increase.\n\nSheree Powell, a DHS spokeswoman, cautioned reading too much into the data. This is just the second year the data has been collected and reported, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect an increase in babies born exposed to drugs or alcohol, she said.\n\n\u201cThere could be an increase in the number of substance exposed newborns. Or, there could be an increase in the reporting of it,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough baseline data to know what to attribute it to.\u201d\n\nThe data is approximate because mothers and newborns aren\u2019t routinely tested. Instead, hospital staff look for certain circumstances such as an expectant mother arriving at a hospital far from home with no explanation, no prenatal care, premature birth or labor, placental abruption (when the placenta detaches from the uterus), self-reported or physical signs of drug abuse or a positive drug test during pregnancy.\n\nThe most reliable way to test a newborn for drugs is through a sample of its meconium, the stool passed soon after birth. Exposure to drugs up to five months before can be detected in meconium.\n\nOf the 375 drug-exposed newborns in the report, DHS substantiated abuse or neglect in 187 cases. In 68 of the cases, the agency recommended removing the child from the home due to drug use.\n\nHospitals report\n\nWhile DHS is required by state law to compile the data on newborns exposed to drugs or alcohol, it is dependent on hospitals to report.\n\nMajor, urban hospitals routinely report the prevalence of positive drug tests in newborns, but rural hospitals still lag in reporting, said Dub Turner, program administrator for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, which works with DHS to reduce the impact of drug-related crimes on children.\n\nAs part of the agencies\u2019 partnership, DHS workers now have access to the state\u2019s online Prescription Monitoring Program, which DHS uses to determine if a caregiver\u2019s use of prescription drugs is excessive. The database compiles patients\u2019 prescription information into one place.\n\nPrescription drug abuse is a growing problem. Among the newborns in the DHS report, 96 babies \u2014 or 21.6 percent \u2014 tested positive for prescription medications, nearly double the number in the 2013 report. The Department of Human Services notes that a positive test for prescription drugs is only considered abuse or neglect if the mother doesn\u2019t have a prescription for that medication and she wasn\u2019t given the drugs at the hospital.\n\n\u2018People can recover\u2019\n\nCare providers should view an expectant mother\u2019s drug addiction as a brain issue, not a moral issue, said Janet Cizek, president of the Oklahoma Substance Abuse Service Alliance.\n\n\u201cPeople can recover. They can certainly have babies born with no drugs in their system and learn to be adequate parents. It\u2019s heartwarming because you can save two lives and not just one,\u201d she said.\n\nThough any residential drug treatment center should be equipped to provide services to a pregnant woman, there are only six in the state that allow women to bring children while they are undergoing treatment, according to the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.\n\nA waiting list of 1,500 exists for residential treatment in Oklahoma, but pregnant women are a top priority, the agency said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest data from the Department of Human Services shows 16.5 percent more newborns tested positive for drugs or alcohol, compared to the previous year.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
