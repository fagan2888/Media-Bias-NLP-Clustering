Researchers from a university in England examined the relationship between perfectionism and burnout, finding that people who try to be perfect at everything create stress and place pressure on their relationships and health \u2014 making them more likely to get burnt out at work or school.\n\nThere are some good things about a perfectionistic attitude, of course. The researchers refer to the good features of perfectionism as \u201cperfectionistic strivings,\u201d or the setting of high personal standards and goals \u2014 and working toward them proactively. Going after your goals instead of standing still will likely make people feel good about themselves, boosting their self-esteem and in turn, their self-care.\n\nBut there\u2019s another side to perfectionism that can be more detrimental. In the study, the researchers refer to the negative aspects as \u201cperfectionistic concerns,\u201d or the fears of making mistakes, disappointing others, or simply failing and not living up to their expectations. Perfectionistic concerns can lead to severe stress, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.\n\n\u201cPerfectionistic concerns capture fears and doubts about personal performance, which creates stress that can lead to burnout when people become cynical and stop caring,\u201d Andrew Hill, lead author of the study and an associate professor of sport psychology at York St. John University in England, said in the press release. \u201cIt also can interfere with relationships and make it difficult to cope with setbacks because every mistake is viewed as a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe researchers examined 43 past studies that had been completed over the past two decades. They found that burnout from perfectionistic concerns was likely to occur in working people because they have less social support than people in school or sports. In addition, workplaces are less likely to offer praise, \u201cgrades,\u201d or proof of achievement compared to academic settings. The lack of a sense of achievement, despite working really hard, can contribute to cynicism and burnout.\n\nIn short, have a perfectionistic attitude when making your goals (reach for the stars), but be kind to yourself when you\u2019re on the long journey to reach them. Worrying and stress can have long-term, negative impacts on the mind and body \u2014 contributing to an increased risk of heart disease, depression, anxiety, aging, and even diabetes and obesity. Here are some tried-and-true ways to fight stress while you work a full-time job.\n\n\u201cPeople need to learn to challenge the irrational beliefs that underlie perfectionistic concerns by setting realistic goals, accepting failure as a learning opportunity, and forgiving themselves when they fail,\u201d Hill said in the press release. \u201cCreating environments where creativity, effort, and perseverance are valued also would help.\u201d\n\nSource: Hill A, Curran T.
