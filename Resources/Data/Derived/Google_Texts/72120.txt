Tensions are rising Wednesday night, for the jury deciding the fate of disgraced OKC cop Daniel Holtzclaw.

Locked down with no decision, time is ticking; the jury is now in night three of deliberating. News 9 was told they should have a verdict by Friday.

This is a long and complicated case.

June 2014, a year and a half ago, the first alleged victim came forward, a 57-year-old grandmother of twelve. She spoke exclusively with News 9 and said she was driving home from a friend's house about 2 a.m. on June 18, near NE 50th and Lincoln. She claimed Holtzclaw pulled her over and made her perform oral sex.

Later that month, Daniel Holtzclaw was placed on leave from the police department while those allegations were investigated.

“It angers us that one of our people, one of our officers that people trust to keep them safe is doing just the opposite,” OKC Police Chief Bill Citty.

Holtzclaw faces 36 felony counts. He’s accused of sexual assaulting 13 women.

In August 2014, Holtzclaw was arrested in the parking lot of Gold's Gym near Penn and Memorial.

Later that August, charges were filed and investigators discovered other alleged victims.

In November 2014, a judge ruled there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial.

Almost one year later to the day, in November 2015, the trial began.

On December 1, the final accuser took the stand. She just 17 at the time of the alleged attack when she said Holtzclaw raped her. DNA evidence was found on his uniform.

Closing arguments were presented December 7.

It’s currently the 33rd hour of deliberations.
