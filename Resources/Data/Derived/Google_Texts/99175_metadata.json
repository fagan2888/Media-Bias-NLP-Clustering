She was taken to a Charlotte County hospital for treatment of minor injuries.\n\nInvestigators say Hess attacked a woman she saw riding on an ATV with her ex-boyfriend. When Rachel tried to step in to stop the fight, Hess allegedly stabbed her with a three-inch pocket knife.\n\nAfter the attack, Hess allegedly said, \"I hope you die.\" The other witnesses didn't know what she meant until they noticed Rachel bleeding.\n\nA witness drove her to a medical station at the venue.\n\n\n\nHess was arrested after she was released from the hospital. She is facing charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\n\nHess' ex said they had broken up about a year ago, and since then Hess has tried to fight any woman she saw him with.\n\n\n\nThe sheriff's office tells us the event has its own security, but they hire off-duty deputies for traffic control. We're told the off-duty deputies were just arriving to the park when the stabbing happened.\n\nVisitor CJ Townsend says it's not a matter of security.\n\n\"It's normally a fun time. We drink a little bit, but nothing too crazy. It's just irresponsible people,\" he said.\n\nIt's not the first time a person has needed to be airlifted. According to an NBC2 Investigation, 14 people have been med-flighted from the park between 2009 and 2012.\n\nAfter digging through 911 records we found out that since just last Friday, there were 37 calls for service to the event and six ambulance transports.\n\nIn the past year, CCSO has responded to calls from the Redneck Yacht Club 331 times. Since February 2013, 65 ambulances have been sent there along with 164 traffic stops.\n\nThe park sent out a statement, but did not want to comment any further on the incident.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "A 22-year-old woman was stabbed multiple times during a fight, while attending a Redneck Yacht Club event Saturday night.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/24674349/woman-stabbed-at-redneck-yacht-club", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A 22-year-old woman was stabbed multiple times during a fight, while attending a Redneck Yacht Club event Saturday night.", "title": "Woman stabbed at Redneck Yacht Club"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wbbh.images.worldnow.com/images/24674349_SA.jpg", "description": "A 22-year-old woman was stabbed multiple times during a fight, while attending a Redneck Yacht Club event Saturday night.", "card": "summary", "title": "Woman stabbed at Redneck Yacht Club"}, "wnreadableurl": "woman-stabbed-at-redneck-yacht-club", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "WBBH", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2014/02/09", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS22"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff72\"", "article_summary": "When Rachel tried to step in to stop the fight, Hess allegedly stabbed her with a three-inch pocket knife.\nA 22-year-old woman was stabbed multiple times during a fight while attending a Redneck Yacht Club event Saturday night.\nHess' ex said they had broken up about a year ago, and since then Hess has tried to fight any woman she saw him with.\nInvestigators say Hess attacked a woman she saw riding on an ATV with her ex-boyfriend.\nAuthorities say the suspect is 19-year-old Jessica Hess, of Riverview, Fla.
