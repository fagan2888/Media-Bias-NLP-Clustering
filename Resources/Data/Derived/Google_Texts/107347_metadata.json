(All photos/AP)\n\nAt year\u2019s end, as I began writing this, there were a dozen good-sized wars raging, a teetering national health care initiative, an out-of-control national debt, historic gridlock in Washington and rising rates of poverty and homelessness.\n\nYet, a gay-bashing duck call salesmen had commandeered the nation\u2019s interest.\n\nIn the text-friendly parlance of the day, WTF?\n\nIn the end it is not a nuclear warhead or terrorist attack that will take us down. It\u2019s the trivial. Swamped by celebrity gossip, friends\u2019 posts about trips to the mall, Rob Ford videos, emails about Obama\u2019s \u201creal birthplace,\u201d baby photos, Miley Cyrus updates, texts, Tweets and trolls, we\u2019ve become willfully detached from reality. It\u2019s as if our minds refuse to deal with anything more serious than the latest story on UpWorthy.\n\nThe world is crazy, we reason, so let us put our minds in neutral and read another list about the best movie quotes from the 1970s on Buzzfeed.\n\nThis month, the fifth season of \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d began and stories containing plot summaries and projected ratings proliferated once again, all citing last month\u2019s controversy. Meanwhile, when that story first broke, it wasn\u2019t the only buffoonery clogging our media channels. Television and the Web were also seething with clips of Fox News anchors decrying the so-called war against Christmas and refuting claims made by some that ol\u2019 St. Nick may not be white (those damn, Santa-hating liberals!). Jon Stewart aptly addressed this nonsense: \u201cWho gives a $#!%?\u201d\n\nThe problem is we do give a $#!%. And that\u2019s troubling.\n\nStudies show that technology changes how we engage with the world and even the ways we think. As our lives moved into the digital realm and gadgets became our new appendages, it should have come as no surprise that we\u2019d become addicted to the stream of trivia that flowed endlessly into our brains. And why not? It\u2019s so much easier to contemplate a pop tart\u2019s naughty parts than to think about why the Affordable Care Act is stumbling, why we allow congressional redistricting that guarantees legislative stalemates, or why when more than half the country thinks certain people shouldn\u2019t have access to guns Congress does nothing to stop them. The world is crazy, we reason, so let us put our minds in neutral and read another list about the best movie quotes from the 1970s on Buzzfeed.\n\nHow did this happen? We used to be smart, on the ball, with IQs soaring. I posed this query to a teenaged relative of mine who recently had his eyes and thumbs surgically removed from his iPhone. Not surprisingly, he just shrugged.\n\nTo me, it all comes down to that dirty little word, content. If your idea of content is \u201cgood stuff free,\u201d clearly you\u2019ve spent way too much time reading Kim Kardashian\u2019s blog (brought to you this week by Sears, the new Hercules movie, ShoeDazzle, the E! Network, Spin Entertainment, Dish and her own signature fragrance). In other words, if you think content is anything less than an adjunct of advertising, I have a bridge to sell you (for details, log on to www.buyjohnsbridge.com).\n\nHere\u2019s my take: The proliferation of media in recent years meant a corresponding jump in the amount of content. It began in earnest with the advent of the 24-hour news cycle in the 1990s. Add to this an explosion of cable channels, the subsequent development of the Internet and millions of websites, and now social media where everyone is a broadcaster and the star of his or her own show, and what you have is an endless parade of digital detritus.\n\nMix in ample doses of our celebrity obsession and rancorous partisan politics, where even a story about a snowstorm results in hours of pabulum from yammering talking heads, and the insignificant fodder, a.k.a. content, would seem to be endless.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve learned of the deaths of family members via online posts. How impersonal. I wondered whether I should give death a thumbs-up, or just add another \u201csorry for your loss\u201d comment and then click back to Gawkr.\n\nThe result is that our lives have been given over to the inconsequential. The danger is that this devaluating effect taints important matters. It reduces friendships to shallow Facebook postings, birthday greetings to texts, and the most critical news of the day to tweets. I know I sound like a crank, but recently I\u2019ve learned of the deaths of family members via online posts. How impersonal. I wondered whether I should give death a thumbs-up, or just add another \u201csorry for your loss\u201d comment and then click back to Gawkr.\n\nWe live in a society where mass communication has become democratized to the point of meaninglessness. TWEET Considering the millions of articles, posts, \u201clikes,\u201d and comments that fly through cyberspace any given second, one might get the impression that we are a nation of individuals with lots of important things to say. We aren\u2019t. Thanks to our runaway media and constantly proliferating social media sites, we are drowning in the flotsam and jetsam of people, places and events that exist to us only on ever-shrinking screens.\n\nFun and harmless, you say? Sure, until the next (pick one) terrorist attack, economic meltdown, civil rights rollback or unnecessary declaration of war catches us with our virtual pants down. Until then, we\u2019ll just continue to hit the thumbs-up icon, circulate videos about twerking pop stars, and spread our neo-illiteracy 140 characters at a time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We live in a society where mass communication has become democratized to the point of meaninglessness.", "og": {"site_name": "cognoscenti", "description": "We live in a society where mass communication has become democratized to the point of meaninglessness.", "title": "The Triumph Of The Trivial", "url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2014/01/23/pop-culture-2013-john-j-winters", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2014/01/Collage-edit-592x323.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2014/01/23/pop-culture-2013-john-j-winters", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2014/01/Collage-edit-592x323.jpg", "site": "@cogwbur", "card": "summary", "title": "The Triumph Of The Trivial"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-23", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23b8\"", "article_summary": "In other words, if you think content is anything less than an adjunct of advertising, I have a bridge to sell you (for details, log on to www.buyjohnsbridge.com).\nIt\u2019s as if our minds refuse to deal with anything more serious than the latest story on UpWorthy.\nIt\u2019s the trivial.\nHere\u2019s my take: The proliferation of media in recent years meant a corresponding jump in the amount of content.\nI know I sound like a crank, but recently I\u2019ve learned of the deaths of family members via online posts."}
