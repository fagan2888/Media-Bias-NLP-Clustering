Holder Jr. said in announcing the indictments.\n\nRelated: U.S. Plays Catch-Up with China on Cyber Warfare\n\nThe indictments, however, aren\u2019t likely to go very far \u2013 former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman called them \u201csymbolic.\u201d But the action does provide a rare peek into the increasingly intense cyber war between China and the United States. And while it reveals the complex hacking culture that exists in China, it also shows that all of those trying to crack codes share two similar traits: They\u2019re all in their 20s or 30s, and their training began when they were young.\n\nThis gives China a distinct advantage over the U.S. Most Chinese hackers begin their training well before U.S. cyber warriors do. They\u2019re taught from a young age how to break into the Department of Defense\u2019s networks, as well as the networks of American companies.\n\nTo catch up in this ongoing war behind the keyboards, the American military apparatus is in the midst of overhauling how it trains cyber warriors in this country. Beginning at the high school level in both military academies and in public schools, potential \u201csoldiers\u201d are being taught the intricacies of computer espionage in the 21st century.\n\nRelated: Armies of Nerds Could Fight the Next Electronic War\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this effort is too little and too late: China has been training its hackers for decades. But the U.S. effort, coordinated by the Pentagon, does represent a concerted attempt to even the playing field between Beijing and Washington.\n\nStarting Young\n\nIn Huntsville, Alabama, Colonel Casey Wardynski (ret.), who served for 16 years as the Army\u2019s top economist and is now the superintendent of the Huntsville city schools, has worked with the Army\u2019s Cyber Command to change the school curriculum to introduce cyber war techniques. West Point is providing the curriculum, along with mentors for the students.\n\nHuntsville is the first city to institute such a program. With help from the Pentagon, it\u2019s also the largest all-digital school district in the country: All 24,000 of its students have a personal computing device that gives them access to the DOD curriculum.\n\nAs for the private military academies, schools like the Sarasota Military Academy in Florida, the Marine Military Academy in Texas, and the Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia, among others, have clubs and classes dedicated to cyber warfare techniques.\n\nRelated: U.S. and China in a Lethal Game of Cyber Chess\n\nTo foster competition among the private military academies and traditional high schools, the Air Force, in cooperation with Northrup Grumman, created CyberPatriot, a cyber contest designed to teach students cyber techniques while encouraging future careers in the military. \u201cKeeping the world secure goes beyond the battlefield,\u201d says Northrup.\n\n\u201cAs a CyberPatriot, you are part of the next generation of cyber defenders critical to our nation\u2019s future security,\u201d it also says in a recruiting flyer for the competition. \u201cWith a career in cyber security at Northrop Grumman, you can be a part of our team in developing systems and solutions that push the envelope across the entire continuum of cyber defense.\"\n\nThen There Are the Critics\n\nThese programs are not without their critics, however. Some people have charged that creating cyber war competitions turns the training into a game and avoids teaching students about real-world consequences in the cyber world.\n\n\u201cThis interweaving of military technology, ideology and money poses a potential risk to students everywhere and should be critically examined by parents and educators alike,\u201d Corey Mead, a professor of English at Baruch College and a researcher on military and video games, wrote in a critique of the programs. \u201cA military career is not a game\u2026 The stealth recruitment and militarization of young minds is not a game, and it should not be treated as such by school officials in charge of guiding our children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Pentagon is attempting to train high school students to fight the next generation of cyber war", "title": "We\u2019re Training High Schoolers to Fight a Cyber War", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/26/We-re-Training-High-Schoolers-Fight-Cyber-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01292013_cyber_hack_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/26/We-re-Training-High-Schoolers-Fight-Cyber-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01292013_cyber_hack_article.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Pentagon is attempting to train high school students to fight the next generation of cyber war", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce92c\"", "article_summary": "Some people have charged that creating cyber war competitions turns the training into a game and avoids teaching students about real-world consequences in the cyber world.\nAmbassador to China Jon Huntsman called them \u201csymbolic.\u201d But the action does provide a rare peek into the increasingly intense cyber war between China and the United States.\nTo catch up in this ongoing war behind the keyboards, the American military apparatus is in the midst of overhauling how it trains cyber warriors in this country.\nPlays Catch-Up with China on Cyber WarfareThe indictments, however, aren\u2019t likely to go very far \u2013 former U.S.\n), who served for 16 years as the Army\u2019s top economist and is now the superintendent of the Huntsville city schools, has worked with the Army\u2019s Cyber Command to change the school curriculum to introduce cyber war techniques."}
