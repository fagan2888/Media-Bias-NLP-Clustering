Right?\n\nIn the wake of Planned Parenthood\u2019s latest scandal, they\u2019d like us to believe that they are necessary and good for us. But here\u2019s why America doesn\u2019t need Planned Parenthood.\n\n1. Their services are limited.\n\nWhy send people to a place like Planned Parenthood when they could go to a different, low-cost clinic that provides more comprehensive care?\n\n2. Community Health Centers and Pregnancy Medical Clinics are equipped to provide for men and women\u2019s reproductive health care needs.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Planned Parenthood is not the only provider of reproductive health care. There are over 8,000 Community Health Centers across the country, and over 2,000 pregnancy help centers compared to around 700 Planned Parenthood Facilities. Pregnancy Medical Clinics are a growing trend, providing for ongoing needs of clients throughout their childbearing years. If we\u2019re talking about \u201caccess\u201d to healthcare, why not support already existing clinics that provide a wide range of services?\n\n3. We have better ways to spend half of a billion dollars.\n\n$528.4 million in the last fiscal year, to be exact.\n\n4. Abortion, contraception, and sterilization are not vital services to maintain a healthy lifestyle, so why are we supporting an organization promoting these?\n\nUnless all elective medical services are covered by insurance and/or the government, we have no reason to cover a select few. We should be supporting organizations that provide more services with less of an agenda.\n\n5. Sex ed can and should be taught by parents or trusted individuals instead of by an organization with an agenda.\n\nMany outraged parents agree that minors don\u2019t need the information Planned Parenthood is giving them.\n\n6. Poor, uninsured women deserve better.\n\nDestiny explains this as someone who\u2019s been there.\n\n7. Planned Parenthood has been accused of participating in illegal activity.\n\nAn organization suspected of engaging in illegal activity should not be supported or promoted by the government, individuals, or other organizations without a thorough investigation into the allegations made in recently released investigative videos.\n\n8. Planned Parenthood\u2019s priorities are not what they say they are.\n\nWhen your number of pregnancy tests falls 89% but abortions rise 17%, the tagline \u201cCare. No matter what,\u201d couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nFrom 2008-2014, Planned Parenthood\u2019s Mar Monte affiliate (largest in the U.S.) increased abortion by 17%, sterilizations by 27%, and contraceptive consultations & services by 1.5%. At the same time, prenatal care fell by 80%, pediatric care by 60%, pregnancy tests by 89%, adult primary care by 23%, and other services by 18%.\n\nWe don\u2019t need Planned Parenthood because other clinics are able to provide care for women without dismembering babies and participating in illegal activity. As a human being, I think you deserve better. We all do.\n\nIf you or someone you know is looking for an alternative health care provider, you can look for a Community Health Center or a Pregnancy Help Center.\n\nIf you or someone you know is looking for hope and healing after abortion, please visit Rachel\u2019s Vineyard, or Project Rachel. Men can look for a Project Joseph ministry in their area.\n\nIf you or someone you know works in the abortion industry and wants to get out, please visit AbortionWorker.com where you can receive confidential support through your transition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We don't need Planned Parenthood because other clinics are able to provide care for women without dismembering babies and participating in illegal activity.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "We don't need Planned Parenthood because other clinics are able to provide care for women without dismembering babies and participating in illegal activity.", "title": "Why we don't need Planned Parenthood | Live Action News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/plannedparenthood109.jpg", "height": 405}, "updated_time": "2015-08-27T17:56:41-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/dont-need-planned-parenthood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We don't need Planned Parenthood because other clinics are able to provide care for women without dismembering babies and participating in illegal activity.", "creator": "@lauramarie4life", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/plannedparenthood109.jpg", "title": "Why we don't need Planned Parenthood | Live Action News", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "sex education", "published_time": "2015-08-24T12:52:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T17:56:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Many outraged parents agree that minors don\u2019t need the information Planned Parenthood is giving them.\nWe don\u2019t need Planned Parenthood because other clinics are able to provide care for women without dismembering babies and participating in illegal activity.\nBut here\u2019s why America doesn\u2019t need Planned Parenthood.\nContrary to popular belief, Planned Parenthood is not the only provider of reproductive health care.\nWhy send people to a place like Planned Parenthood when they could go to a different, low-cost clinic that provides more comprehensive care?"}
