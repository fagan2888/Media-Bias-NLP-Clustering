When it comes to midterm election coverage, CNN uses a "Magic Wall" and Fox News has a "Brain Room." But Stephen Colbert had to sell his soul to the Dark Lord for all eternity to get the fastest results.

During his Tuesday night live edition of "The Colbert Report" -- and the show's last election night -- Colbert mocked the cable news networks' tech'd-out coverage by putting blogger Andrew Sullivan in a "cyber election cafe," and visiting with a demon to find out what Nate Silver thinks about the Alaska Senate race.

"The Colbert Report" airs weeknights at 11:30 p.m. ET on Comedy Central.
