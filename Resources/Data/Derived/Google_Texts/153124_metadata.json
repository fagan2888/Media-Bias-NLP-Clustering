However, according to a string of recent complaints, the company\u2019s sunscreen simply doesn\u2019t work and leaves users burnt and blistered.\n\nConsumers have taken to social media with images of red and blistered skin, all apparently acquired after using The Honest Company\u2019s Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30, BuzzFeed reported. A country-wide investigation by NBC5 in Chicago has suggested that the product\u2019s ineffectiveness may lie in the formula\u2019s low levels of zinc oxide. Most sunscreens are around 18 to 35 percent zinc oxide, but the Honest Company recently reduced the amount of zinc oxide in their product from 20 percent to only 9.3 percent.\n\nZinc oxide is a powdery mineral that, when applied to the skin, helps to filter out harmful UV rays that cause sunburn. The Honest Company claims it added other components to its sunscreen to make up for the lack of zinc, Time reported. However, angry customers insist they are getting burned after just one hour in the sun.\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, the Honest Company has restated its commitment to \u201cproviding safe and effective products\u201d and assures that these complaints \u201cconstitute less than half of one person of all units actually sold at honest.com.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sunscreen, uv rays, sunburn", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Customers are complaining that The Honest Company sunscreen doesn't work and leaves them burnt and blistered after only a short period in the sun.", "title": "Jessica Alba's Honest Company Sunscreen Isn't Quite Working For These Users [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fun-sun-jessica-albas-honest-company-sunscreen-leaves-users-burned-thanks-low-levels-345800", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/03/honest-1.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Customers are complaining that The Honest Company sunscreen doesn't work and leaves them burnt and blistered after only a short period in the sun.", "title": "Jessica Alba's Honest Company Sunscreen Isn't Quite Working For These Users [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fun-sun-jessica-albas-honest-company-sunscreen-leaves-users-burned-thanks-low-levels-345800", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/03/honest-1.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/03/honest-1.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-03T12:09:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T14:45:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Customers are complaining that The Honest Company sunscreen doesn't work and leaves them burnt and blistered after only a short period in the sun."}, "article_summary": "Most sunscreens are around 18 to 35 percent zinc oxide, but the Honest Company recently reduced the amount of zinc oxide in their product from 20 percent to only 9.3 percent.\nThe Honest Company, a business co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, is built on the promise of promoting safe and organic products.\nA country-wide investigation by NBC5 in Chicago has suggested that the product\u2019s ineffectiveness may lie in the formula\u2019s low levels of zinc oxide.\nThe Honest Company claims it added other components to its sunscreen to make up for the lack of zinc, Time reported.\nZinc oxide is a powdery mineral that, when applied to the skin, helps to filter out harmful UV rays that cause sunburn."}
