That is part of an investigation, Jackson said.\n\nCriminal charges are pending, he said.\n\nOne of the suspects was injured, likely in the car crash, but his injuries were not serious, Jackson said. The man was taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\nThe officer was on patrol near 20th and Market streets when a gunshot was fired.\n\n\u201cThe officer called that he was being shot at,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nOfficers on duty for Easter weekend gave chase almost immediately, he said. After a short pursuit, the suspects\u2019 car slammed into a light pole.\n\nTwo of them ran off, with police in close pursuit. The third suspect was arrested at the crash scene. Police officers caught up to the two who fled and arrested them, Jackson said.\n\n\u201cWe have an active investigation,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nMatthew Herrera has an extensive criminal record, including assault in 2011; hit and run, driving under the influence and obstruction of a police officer in 2012; carrying a concealed weapon last year; and possession of a weapon by a previous offender on Feb. 4.\n\nAlexjandro Herrera was charged with being a habitual traffic offender last year and underage possession of alcohol.\n\nSaguilan, who does not have an arrest record, had a birthday Friday.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shot fired: Denver police arrest 3 following crash", "title": "Shot fired: Denver police arrest 3 following crash", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/04/shot-fired-denver-police-arrest-3-following-crash/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T07:52:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-04T07:52:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd975b\"", "article_summary": "The officer, identified only as a veteran Denver officer, was not struck by a bullet.\nAfter a short pursuit, the suspects\u2019 car slammed into a light pole.\nThat is part of an investigation, Jackson said.\n\u201cWe have an active investigation,\u201d Jackson said.\nOne of the suspects was injured, likely in the car crash, but his injuries were not serious, Jackson said."}
