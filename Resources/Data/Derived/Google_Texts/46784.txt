When: There are a few teams that are truly separating themselves early on as being among the NBA’s elite. The Golden State Warriors are one of them, and their superstar — Stephen Curry – is this week’s Post Player of the Week.

What’s up: In four games Curry shot the lights out. What else would we expect? He averaged 27.3 points on 52.2 percent shooting from the field, including 48.6 percent from the 3-point line during the evaluation period of Nov. 22-28. Curry added 6.8 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game in that span. The Warriors won all four games.

Background: There was question as to how Curry — and his Splash Brothers cohort, Klay Thompson — would react to the coaching change that removed a man they’d grown close to, Mark Jackson. He was replaced by Steve Kerr. The result? More wins, more big games and a star in Curry who is not only playing some of the best basketball in the NBA right now, but is lifting his team to the upper crust of the league.

Dempsey’s take: If there’s any part of Curry’s game to nitpick, it’s his penchant to try things that result in turnovers – no look passes, one-handed whip passes in traffic, these kinds of things. But the bottom line is he’s ascended to being one of the NBA’s top talents, an All-Star level point guard that will push for All-NBA First Team inclusion this season. And he’ll deserve every accolade he gets.
