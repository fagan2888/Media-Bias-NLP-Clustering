Or not, whatever. It was easier to get iOS7 than it is to sign up for Obamacare today. (Screenshot: Jake Harris.)\n\n4128559\n\nObamacare technical problems are keeping at least 84,000 Michigan residents from receiving Medicaid benefits.\n\nThe Michigan Medicaid program is still not receiving full data files for residents that applied to Medicaid through HealthCare.gov, and as a result, the state hasn\u2019t been able to process any Medicaid applications yet, almost six months after the federal website\u2019s launch.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why we aren\u2019t getting the complete information,\u201d Angela Minicuci, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Community Health, told The Detroit News. \u201cWe\u2019re receiving the notice, but we\u2019re not receiving enough information on each individual to begin processing those applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther states are also having the same problem,\u201d Minicuci added, \u201cthis isn\u2019t unique to Michigan. This all goes back to the issues the federal exchange has had on a national level.\u201d\n\nHealthCare.gov\u2019s faulty Medicaid files have been causing the states grief for months, but Michigan\u2019s 84,000-strong wait list indicates that the glitch still hasn\u2019t been resolved.\n\nIowa called out the Obama administration in December for its failure to resolve the problem for 10,000 state applicants. West Virginia followed up in early January with the complaint that another 18,000 residents wouldn\u2019t yet receive care due to HealthCare.gov\u2019s incomplete records. (RELATED: Strike Two: 18,000 left without coverage after new Medicaid glitch)\n\nIn all, over 100,000 Americans applying for either Medicaid or CHIP, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, remained without coverage due to HealthCare.gov problems.\n\nMinicuci told The Detroit News that the state is contacting applicants to ask them to apply again, this time directly through the state website \u2014 a laborious tactic White House officials encouraged in January.\n\nWhite House senior communications adviser Tara McGuinness promised that \u201cone hundred percent of those who are having issues are being contacted by us or the states,\u201d but brushed aside the severity of the flaw, which she said \u201cimpacts a small fraction of Americans who will have access to health care from Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe Detroit News notes that in Michigan, the wait time for applicants to the standard Medicaid program has been six months for those that signed up last October.\n\nApplicants to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion should begin to receive coverage April 1, although state officials haven\u2019t yet specified what date care will be available.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
