No other conclusion is possible after his interview with Politico a few days ago.\n\nThe subject was Barack Obama and what the Republican presidential contender sees as the inferior quality of the president\u2019s blackness. \u201cHe\u2019s an \u2018African\u2019 American,\u201d said Carson. \u201cHe was, you know, raised white. I mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but \u2026 he didn\u2019t grow up like I grew up\u2026\u201d\n\nCarson, the son of a struggling single mother who raised him in Detroit, and sometimes relied on food stamps to do so, noted that Obama, by contrast, spent part of his childhood in Indonesia. \u201cSo, for him to claim that he identifies with the experience of black Americans, I think, is a bit of a stretch.\u201d\n\nLord, have mercy.\n\nLet\u2019s not even get into the fact that the man questioning Obama\u2019s racial bona fides once stood before an audience of white conservatives and proclaimed the Affordable Care Act \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this country since slavery.\u201d Let\u2019s deal instead with Carson\u2019s implicit assertion that to be authentically black requires being fatherless and broke, scrabbling for subsistence in the \u2018hood.\n\nIf a white man said that, we\u2019d call it racist. And guess what? It\u2019s also racist when a black man says it. Not to mention, self-hating and self-limiting. Carson denies the very depth and breadth of African-American life.\n\nBy his \u201clogic,\u201d Kobe Bryant, who grew up in Italy, is not black, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who spent part of his childhood in Germany, is not black, Miles Davis and Natalie Cole, who grew up in affluent households, were not black and Martin Luther King Jr., child of middle-class comfort and an intact family, was not black. According to him, they were all \u201craised white.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Carson doesn\u2019t get: What we call \u201crace\u201d is not about neighborhood, class or family status. Though the African hostages upon whose backs this country was built shared certain common approaches to music, faith and art, race ultimately isn\u2019t even about culture. Martin Luther King, for instance, was an opera buff; it\u2019s hard to get further from \u201cblack\u201d culture than \u201cLucia di Lammermoor.\u201d\n\nNo, race is something Europeans invented as a tool of subjugation. The people who came here from England, France and Spain did not initially see themselves as \u201cwhite,\u201d after all. They declared themselves white \u2014 that is, a superior species of humanity \u2014 to justify in their own consciences the evil things they did to the people they took from Africa. Similarly, those Africans knew nothing about \u201cblack.\u201d They saw themselves as Fulani, Mende, Mandinkan or Songhay. \u201cBlack\u201d was an identity forced upon them with every bite of the lash and rattle of the chains.\n\nIn other words, to be black is not to share a common geography, class or family status, but rather, the common experience of being insulted, bullied and oppressed by people who think they are white. Want to know if you\u2019re black? Try to rent a house in Miami. Try to hail a cab in Times Square. Try to win an Oscar in Hollywood. You\u2019ll find out real quick.\n\nAnd there is something spectacularly absurd in the fact of Barack Obama being criticized as \u201cnot black\u201d by a Republican. Think about it: In the unlikely event he somehow managed to live the 47 years before his presidency without being insulted, bullied and oppressed by people who think they are white, Obama has sure made up for it since. Members of Carson\u2019s party have called him \u201cboy,\u201d \u201cuppity\u201d and \u201cape\u201d and have gone to extraordinary and unprecedented lengths to block him from doing \u2026 anything.\n\nSo the good doctor can relax. If Obama wasn\u2019t \u201cblack\u201d before, he certainly is now.\n\n(Leonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald, 1 Herald Plaza, Miami, Fla., 33132.
