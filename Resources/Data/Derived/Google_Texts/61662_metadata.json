The agency proposed tight network adequacy provisions and standardized health plan options in November, which fueled antipathy from the health insurance industry.\n\nMonday\u2019s rule relaxes those aggressive proposals, a move that likely will raise the ire of consumer groups that have pushed for stronger insurance protections for patients. It does, however, include some victories for transparency advocates. The federal government, for example, will now have to publish all changes to premium rates, not just increases that are subject to review.\n\nThe rule addresses several other issues, including surprise medical bills and the 2017 open-enrollment period.\n\nHealth insurers that sell plans on the federal marketplace put pressure on the CMS to scale back some of the policies in the draft version of the regulations. Network adequacy was among the most pressing concerns. Many exchange plans use HMOs or narrow networks of hospitals and doctors as a way to keep premiums lower, which most consumers say is at the top of their minds. However, regulators and consumers were concerned that the plans overly restricted where patients could go to receive care.\n\nThe agency proposed that all ACA plans on the federal exchange in 2017 be required to have networks in which hospitals and doctors were within certain travel times or distances from members. Some medical specialties, under the proposal, were to have minimum provider-to-member ratios to ensure patients had enough access to care.\n\nHospitals, physician groups and consumer groups cheered the CMS\u2019 proposal, though some argued for more specific network adequacy standards.\n\nIn the final rule, the CMS abandons its proposal in favor of giving states time to \u201cactively implement these provisions\u201d through the NAIC\u2018s model law. However, the agency said it \u201cwill revisit this proposal in future rulemaking.\u201d\n\nRead the full story in Modern Healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a major win for the industry, health insurers will not be forced to have minimum hospital and doctor quantitative standards or standardized health plan", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "In a major win for the industry, health insurers will not be forced to have minimum hospital and doctor quantitative standards or standardized health plan options for 2017.", "title": "Administration backs off on Obamacare rules for 2017 health plans", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2016/03/01/administration-backs-off-on-obamacare-rules-for-2017-health-plans/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-01T17:04:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T17:04:42+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "article_summary": "The agency proposed tight network adequacy provisions and standardized health plan options in November, which fueled antipathy from the health insurance industry.\nThe CMS released a sweeping final rule (PDF)Monday afternoon that solidifies the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage policies for 2017.\nHospitals, physician groups and consumer groups cheered the CMS\u2019 proposal, though some argued for more specific network adequacy standards.\nIn a major win for the industry, health insurers will not be forced to have minimum quantitative standards when designing their networks of hospitals and doctors for 2017, nor will they have to offer standardized options for health plans.\nHowever, regulators and consumers were concerned that the plans overly restricted where patients could go to receive care."}
