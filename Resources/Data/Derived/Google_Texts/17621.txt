PITTSBURGH, - GNC Holdings announced Thursday that it is suspending sales of all products manufactured by USPlabs in light of the recent enforcement actions taken against USPlabs and its principals by the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies.

"While none of the recent allegations made against USPlabs relate to the current formulations of any of its products and we have no reason to believe that there are any health and safety issues with respect to any USPlabs products currently sold by GNC, it is in the best interest of our customers to suspend the sale of the company's products pending further review," stated Michael Archbold, GNC CEO. "As an industry leader GNC has always gone above and beyond the minimum requirements in pursuing quality for our consumers, and we will continue to lead the efforts for higher standards with regard to the products we manufacture along with the products manufactured by third parties and carried in our stores."

Sales of USPlabs products by GNC are immaterial, GNC reported.
