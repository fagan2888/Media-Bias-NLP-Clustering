Ray \u2014\n\nAn astonishing report has arrived from the website of the Austrian news journal, Info-Direkt. An anonymous Austrian intelligence source alleges that the United States is funding the hordes of Africans, Gypsies and others overrunning Europe. That means billions of dollars are being poured into a demographic war, annually bringing a million or more foreign invaders to the continent west of Russia. As many as 800,000 are expected in Germany alone this year. With the ostensible \u201casylum seekers\u201d come violent crime, mayhem, an overburdened welfare system and uprisings against the host peoples. A race war is being fomented, and European whites are the target of the intended genocide.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, whom Info-Direkt describes as an employee of the Counter-Intelligence Office (Abwehramt) of the Austrian Federal Army\u2019s intelligence service, findings show that groups in the U.S. pay human traffickers to transport the \u201crefugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraffickers demand horrendous sums [of money], in order to bring refugees to Europe. The conditions [Bedingungen] are often very bad. Nevertheless, transport currently costs between 7,000 and 14,000 euros, varying according to region and trafficking organization,\u201d the informant reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe journal notes that police circles dealing daily with asylum seekers are well-apprised of costs and conditions.\n\nThe article continues, \u201cFew experts are willing to let reliable information seep through; no one wants to go public with his full name.\u201d\n\nStill, the suspicion is expressed frequently that the foreign invasion is part of U.S. geo-strategy.\n\nThe intelligence source continues: \u201cFindings exist, that organizations from the U.S.A. have created a co-financing model and bear major portions of the trafficking costs. Not every refugee from North Africa has 11,000 euros in cash. Doesn\u2019t anyone ask where the money comes from?\u201d\n\nBut a news blockade exists about the whole situation. Even the Austrian Army Intelligence Office (Heeres-Nachrichtenamt), the Counter-Intelligence Office\u2019s sister agency, \u201chas received no information or is not permitted to share it,\u201d says the whistleblower.\n\nIndeed, an August 18 address given by General Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Irish Defense Force would seem to support views alleging U.S. involvement in creating Europe\u2019s massive population upheavals. While he deplored the humanitarian crisis caused by what he says are 60 million refugees throughout the world\u201442,500 families displaced daily\u2014creating \u201cnot just a near-term problem but . . . a generational problem,\u201d Dempsey nevertheless demonized nationalists in dozens of countries who oppose this artificially instigated migration of peoples.\n\nFalsely accusing nationalists of turning \u201cto violent extremism,\u201d America\u2019s top general deplored alleged fringe groups seeking to preserve their nations and borders, who rapidly are gaining representation in parliaments throughout Europe.\n\nDempsey called the situation a 20-year problem: \u201cThis could affect stability and peace on the continent.\u201d\n\nHe thereby places destroying nationalism and its adherents among the goals of the never-ending global \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d calling them a \u201cthreat.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. military thus has a strategy of eliminating patriots throughout the world, because these so-called \u201cextremists\u201d and \u201cfringe groups\u201d represent a danger to the internationalist New World Order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDempsey, however, passed over in silence the fact that it is the U.S. and Israel that have created almost the entire global refugee problem with their constant wars of aggression and government overthrows in countries across three continents, as part of the long-term strategy of establishing not just \u201cGreater Israel,\u201d but \u201cGreater Khazaria,\u201d from North Africa, through the Middle East, to Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nHorrifying reports of the upheavals caused by hundreds of thousands of foreigners are rampant, from Calais, France, to southern Italy and Greece. While the merely softheaded and the malicious both bleat vague generalizations about accepting unlimited numbers of foreigners, regardless of consequences, the truth is far harsher.\n\nRefugees in camps or running loose across the continent overwhelm local and national resources, to the harm of locals. The black and Gypsy invaders are responsible for astronomical increases in thefts, murders and rapes, consuming their hosts\u2019 food and medical care and sometimes even receiving a government stipend. Efforts to escape camps occur daily, presenting safety, health and security risks.\n\nMost tellingly, there are frequent, well-organized public\u2014sometimes violent\u2014demonstrations by the invading hordes, complete with professionally printed signs and banners, demanding \u201crights\u201d for refugees. This has every hallmark of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-backed revolutionary activities for bringing down governments.\n\nInfo-Direkt\u2019s well-informed source is extremely blunt: \u201cIt is the same destroyers [Brandstifter] at work, who a year ago thrust the Ukraine into chaos.\u201d\n\nThe reference is clear. The CIA and its front groups, along with Israel\u2019s Mossad, staged the bloody overthrow of Ukraine\u2019s government and are responsible for the ongoing reign of terror there.\n\nThe survival of the Caucasian race is at stake. But the culture destroyers want whites to respond with force, so that they can impose martial law. Nationalists must regain control of their governments and stop white genocide.\n\nRonald L.
