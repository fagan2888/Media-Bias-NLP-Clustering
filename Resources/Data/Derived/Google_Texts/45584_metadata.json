Jonah would lie on top of my dashboard, and literally not get off.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me, us moms put up with a lot,\u201d Feldstein says. \u201cBut one thing we should never have to put up with is our kid not having health care.\u201d\n\nThe messaging comes ahead of a critical March 31 open enrollment deadline, and at a time when the Obama administration is increasingly turning to comedy to drive Americans to sign up for new health insurance. The White House credited President Barack Obama\u2019s appearance on the Funny or Die series Between two Ferns this week with driving significant traffic to the Healthcare.gov federal insurance exchange website.\n\nThe latest campaign, which includes a message from First Lady Michelle Obama, is targeting the so-called \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d \u2014 younger and healthier Americans whose relatively low health care costs are needed to make insurance affordable for the larger population of uninsured Americans.\n\n\u201cSeriously, do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown?\u201d Feldstein says in the new video. \u201cYou need health insurance, it\u2019s imperative that you have health insurance. Taking care of yourself so you mothers can sleep and have a nice life after all they\u2019ve done for you is not too much to ask in my opinion.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama closes the new video by imploring: \u201cWe nag you because we love you.\u201d\n\nThe new ad campaign was produced with Droga5, the award-winning advertising agency and creators of The Great Schlep, the famous 2008 ad campaign in which comedian Sarah Silverman implored young Jews to go to Florida and convince their grandparents to vote for Obama.\n\nSee the video below:\n\n-with reporting from Mark Halperin", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration aims to get so-called \"young invincibles\" to sign up for health insurance by March 31 with a new video that includes the mothers of celebrities like Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine and Jennifer Lopez", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The Obama administration aims to get so-called \"young invincibles\" to sign up for health insurance by March 31 with a new video that includes the mothers of celebrities like Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine and Jennifer Lopez", "title": "Jonah Hill's Mom Wants You to Get Obamacare", "url": "http://time.com/24473/obamacare-jonah-hill-michelle-obama-jennifer-lopez/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-13-at-11-54-24-pm.png?w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-13-at-11-54-24-pm.png?w=1012"}, "description": "The Obama administration aims to get so-called \"young invincibles\" to sign up for health insurance by March 31 with a new video that includes the mothers of celebrities like Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine and Jennifer Lopez", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jonah Hill's Mom Wants You to Get Obamacare"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "obamacare, health care reform, barack obama, jonah hill, alicia keys, adam levine, jennifer lopez.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, health care reform, barack obama, jonah hill, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine, Jennifer Lopez."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf08\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou need health insurance, it\u2019s imperative that you have health insurance.\n\u201cJonah was a prankster,\u201d Sharon Feldstein, Hill\u2019s mother, says in the video released Friday encouraging Obamacare enrollment, which is branded as part of a campaign called #YourMomCares.\nJonah would lie on top of my dashboard, and literally not get off.\u201d\u201cTrust me, us moms put up with a lot,\u201d Feldstein says.\nThe White House continued its push Friday for Americans to enroll in new health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, with a video featuring the mothers of famous celebrities like Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine and Jennifer Lopez.\n\u201cSeriously, do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown?\u201d Feldstein says in the new video."}
