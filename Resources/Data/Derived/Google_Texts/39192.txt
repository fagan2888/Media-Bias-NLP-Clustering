While national polls show a stable landscape, polls in individual races continue to show some movement. That movement leads us to make a number of changes to our Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call ratings .

Most of the House changes benefit the GOP, while the Senate and governor changes are far more mixed.

Senate Changes:

Georgia (GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss is retiring) from Republican Favored to Leans Republican.

Louisiana Senate (Democratic Sen. Mary L. Landrieu) from Pure Tossup to Tossup/Tilts Republican.
