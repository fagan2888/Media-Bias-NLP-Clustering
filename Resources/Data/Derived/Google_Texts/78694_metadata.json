Instead of bashing us, try supporting us. Sal Decicco\n\nFlushing: The solution to the pothole problem is to develop a cheap, durable and indestructible substance to use on new roadways. In this day of technological advances, we should be able to do this. Dennis Gavarian\n\nBrooklyn: Mayor de Blasio: I am sure that you will be a fine mayor. But as a car-driving New Yorker whose vehicle is taking one heck of a beating this year, please make it one of your early goals to patch up these craters that are plaguing our roads. Jim Shaffer\n\nDear John\n\nManhattan: Poor John Bolton (\u201cObama is weak, clueless and indecisive on Ukraine,\u201d Op-Ed, Feb. 20). His greatest contribution to world diplomacy seems to be criticizing President Obama for the most poorly considered and inane reasons imaginable. Bolton, as we all remember, once criticized the UN by suggesting that the top 10 floors of the UN building be removed. Has he not forgotten his involvement in the most inept presidency in U.S. history, which started two wars and had no clue on how to end them? John Noonan\n\nFallon your sword\n\nClark, N.J.: Now that Jimmy Fallon has taken over for Jay Leno, can the show be referred to as the \u201cGoodnight\u201d show? It\u2019s what a large percentage of its audience will be saying to it. James E. Lukridge\n\nDon\u2019t win friends with salad\n\nBrooklyn: I am a cook for the NYC Dept. of Education. I just can\u2019t understand how salad bars are allowed in schools. They are disgusting. We do so much work preparing, and at the end of the day we find objects, spit and other filthy stuff in them. Salad bars carry many germs and disease and should be removed immediately from all NYC public schools. Mary Ann Greenberg\n\nCold comfort\n\nBronx: I started school back in the 1950s. I don\u2019t remember ever not going to school because of the snow. My brother, sister and I walked a few blocks to the elementary school. Then we walked further for junior high school and took public transportation for high school. Both my mother and father worked and used public transportation. I remember the buses had chains on the wheels and did just fine. I also remember going out to play in the snow. We had so much fun, we didn\u2019t know that we were freezing until we went back home to warm up. It\u2019s sad that the adults of tomorrow won\u2019t have the same memories! Debbie Darmiento\n\nUp in smoke I\n\nLevittown, L.I.: After reading Harry Siegel\u2019s column re: marijuana (\u201cCuomo\u2019s marijuana copout,\u201d Feb. 19), I cannot see the benefit of legalizing this drug \u2014 especially since reading about Colorado and what goes on in San Francisco. I can\u2019t help but think: Do I want my pilot smoking one or two marijuana cigarettes before we take off or my doctor doing the same before a big operation? Winifred Larkin\n\nUp in smoke II\n\nOzone Park: If marijuana is legalized like alcohol, how many more people are going to be killed by stoned drivers? How about mothers forgetting babies in bathtubs? How about young children being influenced by parents who use it casually around the home? Josephine Ambrosio\n\nFirst, do no harm\n\nOakland Gardens: It amazes me how many doctors are refusing to take on new patients since Obamacare\u2019s inception. I don\u2019t blame the doctors and patients for feeling Obama doesn\u2019t care. Sally Waldman\n\nFeeling blue?\n\nBronx: Bill Bratton, you gave up a lot to become police commissioner. Did you know the job required you lying for an incompetent mayor? Linda Ranallo\n\nBlue line\n\nBrooklyn: According to a lawsuit, new NYPD Internal Affairs Chief Joseph Reznick called a cop who accused fellow cops a \u201crat.\u201d Nothing has changed at the NYPD. Charles Haigler\n\nThe needle and the damage\n\nBronx: To Voicer Scott Silverstein, who said that his heroin addiction is a sickness: Let me ask you a question. Did anyone put a gun to your head when you took heroin for the first time? Doris Festante\n\nCollar this mutt\n\nEast Patchogue, L.I.: I would like to get the savage who threw the beautiful dog out of the car window, put him in a cage, drive him to the middle of the desert, leave him there and say \u201cbye.\u201d Catherine Lo Curto\n\nHell in a handbasket\n\nNorth Merrick, L.I.: Re \u201cProud pop takes home tot\u201d (Feb. 17), about Simon Cowell and his girlfriend\u2019s new baby: Not too long ago, news like this would have been swept under the rug. Today, it is a headline. Times have changed. The sixth commandment, \u201cThou shall not commit adultery,\u201d is now obsolete. Alice Furey\n\nBullet points\n\nPleasant Valley, N.Y.: In an establishment the other day, I saw a sign on the wall: a gun with a red line through it, indicating a gun-free zone. I pointed out to the lady that this sign is a clear invitation for a gun nut to come in and shoot up the place, knowing that law-abiding people would not be armed. She said that New York State law requires these signs to be posted in certain buildings. When will liberals realize, as Wayne LaPierre, head of the NRA says, that \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun\u201d? Fred Niessen\n\nThe need for speed\n\nBrooklyn: I would like to go 20 mph on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway instead of the usual 10 mph every morning. When is it going to happen, Bill? Anthony Cerullo\n\nGet it?\n\nLinden, N.J.: Looks like Mayor de Blasio is \u201cde blase\u201d about breaking traffic rules. Ron Jackowski\n\nSticks and stones\n\nGreenlawn, L.I.: If we are going to penalize players for using the N-word, then we should also penalize them for using all other racial slurs. Richard Volino\n\nItinerary for Alec\n\nGlendale: Is this the same Alec Baldwin who threatened to move to Europe if Bush won? Listen, Baldwin \u2014 follow-up on something, will ya? Maybe you and Dennis Rodman could move to North Korea. Michael Slack\n\nGlobal dumbing\n\nMount Sinai, L.I.: Wow! A supposedly \u201ceducated\u201d fellow like Charles Krauthammer can\u2019t believe that heat melts ice (\u201cThe myth of \u2018settled science,\u2019\u201d Feb. 20). His ignorance about climate change is appalling. Karl Bean\n\nThe war after the war\n\nValley Stream, L.I.: Although I support everyone\u2019s right to free speech, I was greatly disappointed to see the Daily News afford a spot to such a bigoted opinion by Voicer Dominick Battaglia. Are you really discriminating against today\u2019s Japanese-American citizens because of what happened 60 years ago? How did your ancestors like it when they, too, probably suffered from racism when they first arrived here, especially with a last name ending in a vowel? This is America, where anyone can come and succeed. And although the national language may be English, America has no official language. While I applaud the unmatched courage and bravery of you and our country\u2019s greatest generation, your bigoted remarks reveal cowardice and fear. Don\u2019t use baseball as a means to propagate your prejudice! Gary Hewitt\n\nMemories of Mike\n\nYorktown Heights, N.Y.: To those of you who thought that Bill de Blasio would be good for New York City and voted for him: Don\u2019t you wish Michael Bloomberg had run for a fourth term? Bloomberg is probably thinking, \u201cDo you miss me yet?\u201d Cue the song: \u201cWho\u2019s Sorry Now?\u201d William J Griggs", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Voice of the People", "twitter": {"description": "Howard Beach: I work for the DOT and, after reading Voicer Irene Goldsmith putting us down, need to respond.
