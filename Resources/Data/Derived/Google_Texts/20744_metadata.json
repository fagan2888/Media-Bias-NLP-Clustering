Gallup has tracked the court\u2019s approval ratings since 2000, and the September 2015 survey marks the court\u2019s worst approval numbers in those fifteen years of polling.\n\n50 percent of American disapprove of the court\u2019s job performance, compared to just 45 percent who approve of the court\u2019s work. Despite the court\u2019s 5 to 4 conservative majority, Republicans hold a much more negative view towards the court than Democrats do. High profile rulings on gay marriage and Obamacare, where the court deviated from its conservative reputation to deliver improbable victories for the Obama administration, ruined the court\u2019s standing with Republicans.\n\nOnly 26 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of the Roberts\u2019 court, compared to 67 percent of Democrats who view the current court favorably. 42 percent of Independents hold a favorable opinion of the Roberts\u2019 court.\n\nPublic opinion has seen a fairly consistent partisan divide in how the Supreme Court is viewed, since Gallup first began tracking the court\u2019s approval rating in 2000. However, which party approves and disapproves of the court has fluctuated based on how the court has ruled on major decisions.\n\nPresidential appointments have also significantly influenced partisan perceptions of the court. Throughout the Bush presidency, Republicans gave the Supreme Court higher marks than Democrats. However, shortly after Barack Obama became president, GOP voters changed their tune, and decided they disliked the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court still ostensibly holds a 5-4 conservative majority, Republicans seem to be dismayed with the addition of thoughtful Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the court. They would much rather see the court packed with right-wing ideologues and right-wing ideologues only.\n\nBy contrast, Democrats seem content with the court having a conservative majority, as long as the court occasionally deviates from right-wing orthodoxy to give liberals and centrists a few victories over the course of its tenure. The ideological rigidity of dogmatic Republicans contrasted with the flexible pragmatism of Democrats, has created a strange dynamic. Democrats approve of the conservative court, despite its many faults, because it has made some good decisions in the past year.\n\nConservatives, on the other hand, despise the court, because it doesn\u2019t give them their way on every single ruling. For Republicans, the conservative Roberts\u2019 court simply isn\u2019t dogmatic enough to protect their fragile right-wing sensibilities from affronts to their dignity, like allowing people to have health insurance and to marry who they love.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gallup reveals that, ironically, Republicans rate the Roberts' court much more poorly than Democrats do.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Keith Brekhus", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Gallup reveals that, ironically, Republicans rate the Roberts' court much more poorly than Democrats do.", "title": "Supreme Court Sinks To 15-Year Low In Popularity, Hits 50 Percent Disapproval Rating", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/10/02/supreme-court-sinks-15-year-popularity-hits-50-percent-disapproval-rating.html", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T18:40:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,U.S. Supreme Court,gallup,Obergefell v.
