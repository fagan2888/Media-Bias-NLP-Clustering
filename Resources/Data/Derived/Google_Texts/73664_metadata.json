The event, designed to raise money for the South Oldham Auxiliary, Supporting Heroes and WHAS Crusade for Children, took runners down a tiki-torch-lit Old La\n\nGrange Road and through the beautiful Yew Dell Botanical Gardens.\n\nHeather Caudill of the Highlands thought the race was wonderful. \"It was very scenic and beautiful,\" said Caudill. \"Everyone was very friendly and very encouraging, cheering everyone along.\"\n\n\"I think it was absolutely awesome,\" said South Oldham Fire Auxiliary President Pamela Dumm. With 120 runners in attendance, the event surpassed its goal, and Dumm felt that the race helped bring the community together, teaching people about what first responders and firefighters really do.\n\nSouth Oldham firefighter Mike Miller ran the race in 65 pounds of firefighter gear alongside his wife, daughter and two sons. Miller hoped that he could help instill an appreciation for exercise, health and wellness in his children. \"I hope that they can see that they can do things like that later in life, or even now,\" Miller stated.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1HGlGJE", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "South Oldham Fire Run 5K Run/Walk", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "South Oldham Fire Run 5K Run/Walk", "title": "South Oldham Fire run/walk surpasses goals", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/05/25/south-oldham-fire-run/27929471/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "South Oldham Fire Run 5K Run/Walk", "title": "South Oldham Fire Run 5K Run/Walk", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc8e59b842c7cd27a5b67d19d9bfd014097dbb8c/c=170-0-853-683&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/25/Louisville/Louisville/635681750803803960-05-23-15-SouthFireRun-13.JPG.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b528a7eac22cc5cd1908eba51a8107fe161d07a/c=256-0-768-683/local/-/media/2015/05/25/Louisville/Louisville/635681750803803960-05-23-15-SouthFireRun-13.JPG.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04b8bec6b09be4c8ec13e127598f748ba87fa9e0/c=170-0-853-683/local/-/media/2015/05/25/Louisville/Louisville/635681750803803960-05-23-15-SouthFireRun-13.JPG.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a365a38238d280539d9927a8c9dc4a4628d130d/c=58-0-966-683/local/-/media/2015/05/25/Louisville/Louisville/635681750803803960-05-23-15-SouthFireRun-13.JPG.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f55cf756624b3a8cc6e1b2af599a6d0acfb7b137/c=0-52-1024-631&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/05/25/Louisville/Louisville/635681750803803960-05-23-15-SouthFireRun-13.JPG.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-05-25T22:16:37.423000-04:00", "shorthed": "S.
