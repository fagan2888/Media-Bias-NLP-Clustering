Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who leads the Senate Budget Committee\u2019s Democrats, called the GOP budget a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d and asked the White House to keep its veto promise.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nRepublican negotiators in the House and Senate announced a deal on a joint budget Wednesday that would cut domestic spending, increase defense spending and open a new door in the quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe deal, which could be approved by the House and the Senate as early as this week, looks like the latest success in a recent flurry of deal\u00admaking in Congress. Unlike the bipartisan deals in recent weeks, this budget is a Republican-only agreement for what they would like to accomplish, not a binding prescription for how Congress should allocate money.\n\nLawmakers must now pass appropriations legislation to actually fund the government \u2014 a process that will require tough compromise if Republicans hope to advance spending bills that President Obama is willing to sign.\n\n\u201cWe hope to complete the budget conference report in the House and the Senate, and get going on the appropriations process,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u201cI\u2019m sure the Democrats will complain that we\u2019re not spending enough on the domestic side, but all of that can be sorted out in the appropriations process.\u201d\n\nThe Republican budget ignores Obama\u2019s threat to veto any funding bills that lock in spending cuts for domestic programs. Instead negotiators opted for deep domestic cuts, nearly $40 billion in additional defense spending from off-book funds and a new attack on the president\u2019s signature health-care bill.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), right, said, \u201cI\u2019m sure the Democrats will complain that we\u2019re not spending enough on the domestic side, but all of that can be sorted out in the appropriations process.\u201d (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nRepublicans chose to use a procedure known as \u201cbudget reconciliation instructions,\u201d which allows the Senate to bypass the typical 60-vote majority needed to bring legislation to the floor. That maneuver would allow a simple majority to overturn the federal health-care law.\n\nThe budget slashes domestic discretionary spending by trimming away at several major priorities for Democrats. The final bill includes a reduction in funding for federal Pell Grants and housing programs for low-income earners, and cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.\n\nThe final deal uses funds from the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, or OCO, which includes defense funds that are not traditionally considered part of the overall budget. Republicans used those funds to boost defense spending to over $563 billion, well beyond the level lawmakers agreed to under the 2011 Budget Control Act, commonly known as sequestration.\n\nRepublicans, including Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), said the additional defense spending drawn from OCO is necessary in light of ongoing military responsibilities in the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Ukraine, ISIS, Syria, Yemen and the whole deal in Iraq, and the president has decided he has to keep more troops in Afghanistan,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cFrankly, I think that justifies more OCO.\u201d\n\nThe compromise scales back some of the deep domestic spending cuts proposed in the House budget but includes a $496 billion decrease in non-defense spending over the next decade.\n\nThe deal hit a hiccup Monday evening after Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) initially refused to sign the final report, citing concerns over the use of an accounting gimmick. The budget allows appropriators to shift $190 billion in unused money from mandatory programs over 10 years to pay for other spending.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like for our budgeting process to do is to rid itself of a lot of the gimmicks that have been used in the past,\u201d Corker said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe proposal is also a handy political document for Democrats looking to reestablish the narrative that Republicans in Congress are attacking low- and middle-class workers by cutting vital programs such as those for health care and education.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to have to do these things on their own,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y. ) said Tuesday. \u201cDemocrats are not going to help you pass appropriations bills that lock in senseless, automatically triggered cuts that hurt the middle class.\u201d\n\nRepublicans must decide whether they are going to pursue spending bills that fall in line with their budget wish list or if they are ready to discuss options for lifting caps on domestic spending to gain the support of Democrats.\n\nAlready, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who leads Senate Budget Committee\u2019s Democrats, is calling on the White House to keep its veto promise and block any such spending bills that are approved in Congress.\n\n\u201cI think this budget is an absolutely disgrace,\u201d Sanders said Monday evening as details of the plan emerged. \u201cClearly my hope is that as this budget moves into the form of appropriations bills that the president will take out his veto pen and make it very clear that he will not support any legislation based on the principles in this budget.\u201d\n\nRepublicans acknowledge that the deal is a largely political document. It breaks down how Republicans would govern in their version of an ideal world. But, Sessions and other Republicans point out that this is the first time Congress has been able to agree on any joint vision since 2008.\n\n\u201cPeople might say this is not real, but the [Democrats] have done one in the last five years,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt does require you to lay out how you\u2019re going to manage the people\u2019s money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP reached a deal on a joint budget to expand defense spending and lock in a health-care repeal vote.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The GOP reached a deal on a joint budget to expand defense spending and lock in a health-care repeal vote.", "title": "Republicans reach budget deal, take aim at Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-reach-budget-deal-take-aim-at-obamacare/2015/04/29/cc19eacc-ee79-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/29/National-Politics/Images/Congress_Budget-0e8c9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kelsey_snell"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-reach-budget-deal-take-aim-at-obamacare/2015/04/29/cc19eacc-ee79-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "cc19eacc-ee79-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fc4\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
