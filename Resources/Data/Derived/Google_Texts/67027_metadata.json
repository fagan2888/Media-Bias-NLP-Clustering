Many said they had trouble getting paid at all.\n\nThey blamed the health plans for subcontracting with Univita and AHCA for failing to prevent it in the program rules.\n\n\u201cI hope they learned a lesson from what they did,\u201d said Robert Junco of Miami\u2019s Pediatric Suppliers Inc.\n\nWhile the home-care vendors said they feel sorry for employees of Univita, who are expected to lose their jobs, they reacted to the AHCA announcement with exultation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having so much fun!\u201d said Ivonne Gonzalez, president and CEO of Health Medical Equipment Inc. in Miami. \u201cI\u2019m having a couple of margaritas!\u201d\n\nGonzalez noted that it was almost exactly a year ago that home-care providers learned they were losing a big chunk of their Medicaid income because almost all the HMOs were subcontracting with Univita to handle their home care.\n\nAs Health News Florida reported at the time, this created a virtual monopoly in the most fragile sector of Medicaid business. It also raised questions of conflict of interest, as Univita was one of the suppliers competing for the Medicaid business.\n\nState Medicaid Director Justin Senior said at the time that while the situation looked bad, there was nothing in the law to prohibit it. He said his team would warn the health plans to make sure that Univita didn\u2019t take unfair advantage or cause problems for patients.\n\nIt is unclear whether the about-face in Florida\u2019s home care contracts this week was instigated by the plans, by Medicaid officials who were tired of complaints, or the company itself deciding it could not make ends meet.\n\nOne home-care organization, the Florida Alliance of Home Care Services, sent a notice to its members Tuesday afternoon suggesting that Univita may be preparing to file for bankruptcy. The federal court bankruptcy files in South Florida offered no listing for Univita as of Tuesday.\n\nMost company officials were unavailable. Robert Alonso, Univita marketing director, said at mid-afternoon that the company would release a statement, but nothing had appeared as of 6:30 p.m.\n\nVendors said their friends who worked at Univita were texting and calling, looking for a job. And it remains unclear who will handle the continued need to authorization services for Medicaid patients and pay the bills \u2013 either the plans or a different subcontractor.\n\nThe Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program was created by Florida\u2019s legislature in hopes of gaining control of Medicaid costs of its 3.5 million residents by ending fee-for-service payments. Proponents argued it would improve quality of care because the state could hold plans accountable.\n\nAHCA chose among the plans that bid for the business, and phased in the program over 2013 and 2014.\n\nHere is the list the state provided that patients and health-care providers can call for more information:\n\nAmerigroup Florida, Inc.
