Mike Segar/Reuters\n\nThe mother of Eric Garner said Monday she would not be voting for Daniel Donovan \u2014 the Staten Island district attorney whose office oversaw the grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in her son\u2019s death \u2014 in his race for Congress.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get my vote,\u201d Ms. Carr said of Mr. Donovan, a Republican who is running to replace former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm in a special election May 5.\n\nMs. Carr made the comments at a news conference Monday where U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries announced the introduction of federal legislation that would make it illegal for law enforcement officials to use chokeholds.\n\nThe bill, called \u201cThe Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act,\u201d would make the use of a chokehold by law enforcement a violation of federal civil rights law.\n\nMr. Jeffries, a Brooklyn congressman and a Democrat, called the chokehold \u201ca poster child for violent police tactics\u201d that has damaged the relationship between police and communities across the country.\n\n\u201cIt is an unreasonable measure. It is an unnecessary measure. It is an uncivilized measure,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said at a news conference outside the New York Police Department headquarters in lower Manhattan Monday.\n\nMr. Garner died last summer after being placed in an apparent chokehold by a police officer on Staten Island during an arrest for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes. Police have said he was resisting arrest.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Donovan declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The mother of Eric Garner said Monday she would not be voting for Daniel Donovan -- the Staten Island district attorney whose office oversaw the grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in her son\u2019s death -- in his race for Congress.", "title": "Eric Garner\u2019s Mom Doesn\u2019t Support Donovan\u2019s Bid for Congress", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/27/eric-garners-mom-doesnt-support-donovans-bid-for-congress/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IC656_NYGARN_P_20150427160711.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Eric Garner\u2019s Mom Doesn\u2019t Support Donovan\u2019s Bid for Congress", "description": "The mother of Eric Garner said Monday she would not be voting for Daniel Donovan -- the Staten Island district attorney whose office oversaw the grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in her son\u2019s death -- in his race for Congress.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Mara Gay", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The mother of Eric Garner said Monday she would not be voting for Daniel Donovan -- the Staten Island district attorney whose office oversaw the grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in her son\u2019s death -- in his race for Congress.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-27T20:13:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/27/eric-garners-mom-doesnt-support-donovans-bid-for-congress/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22997", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The mother of Eric Garner said Monday she would not be voting for Daniel Donovan -- the Staten Island district attorney whose office oversaw the grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in her son\u2019s death -- in his race for Congress.", "title": "Eric Garner\u2019s Mom Doesn\u2019t Support Donovan\u2019s Bid for Congress", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/27/eric-garners-mom-doesnt-support-donovans-bid-for-congress/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IC656_NYGARN_P_20150427160711.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22997", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-27T20:14:03-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8862\"", "article_summary": "It is an uncivilized measure,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said at a news conference outside the New York Police Department headquarters in lower Manhattan Monday.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Donovan declined to comment.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get my vote,\u201d Ms. Carr said of Mr. Donovan, a Republican who is running to replace former U.S. Rep.
