Charlie Rose and three of Barack Obama’s former speechwriters had a good laugh Monday night while joking about the president’s infamous, oft-repeated false promise that under Obamacare, “if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.”

Obama said dozens of times in the run-up to the Affordable Care Act’s signing and enactment that no Americans who liked the insurance plan they had would lose it under the Affordable Care Act. In reality, millions of policies were canceled because of the law’s regulations, and Obama was forced to apologize to the American people. The infamous remark was named 2013’s “Lie of the Year” by PolitiFact.

NewsBusters reported Jon Lovett, Jon Favreau and David Litt all came on Charlie Rose’s eponymous PBS program to gush over Obama’s writing abilities and the art of speechwriting in general. Rose asked if they had significant “impact” on Obama’s more “serious speeches.”

“The joke speech is the most fun part of this, but the things I’m the most proud of were the most serious speeches, I think,” Lovett said. “Health care. Economic speeches.”

“Lovett wrote the line about, ‘If you like your insurance, you can keep it,’” Favreau said.

“How dare you,” Lovett said, as Rose and the three wordsmiths roared with laughter.
