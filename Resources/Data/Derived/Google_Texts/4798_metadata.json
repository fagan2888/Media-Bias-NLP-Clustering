What is so horrific for me is that this poor 12 year-old witnessed what happened. She was sure in her mind that her father was dead and all she wanted to do was be with him,\u201d she said.\n\nThe neighbor says she comforted the victim\u2019s daughter until paramedics and other family members arrived to the scene.\n\n\u201cNo child should ever have to live through that and it\u2019s an image that will stay with her through her entire life. She\u2019ll never be able to shake that. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d added the neighbor.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people here last night. It was lined up all the way from that drive way right there,\u201d said another concerned neighbor who lives on Wanda Street.\n\nBut what concerns those who live by the home even more is how long McLain\u2019s body laid on the front porch.\n\n\u201cThe ambulance took a long time. I guess that\u2019s a part of living in Bennetsville, since there is no hospital here anymore because if someone came sooner he probably would\u2019ve made it\u201d explained the neighbor.\n\nSLED is helping Marlboro County Sheriff\u2019s deputies investigate. MCSO Investigators are interviewing witnesses and more charges may come at a later time.\n\nCount on News 13 to keep you covered as we learn more about this ongoing investigation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"852238\"] BENNETTSVILLE, SC (WBTW) - Marlboro County Sheriff deputies arrested 32-year-old James Zevon Brown Sunday morning for murder and weapons charges.
