A crowdsourced surveillance program? A health insurance Web site that works?\n\nNo, America is building Iron Man.\n\nYou don't have to take my word for it.\n\nFor here the president began by saying that he would be joined by America's finest researchers, digital cloud designers, and important people from the Pentagon.\n\nHe then uttered these words: \"Basically, I'm here to announce that we're building Iron Man.\"\n\nThe journalists in the room erupted with laughter. In an attempt to quiet them, perhaps, the president then explained: \"I'm going to blast off in a second.\"\n\nThat didn't work. So he had to add that this wasn't really a secret project America's been working on for some time. Or maybe it was.\n\n\"It's classified,\" he concluded.\n\nThis may well be, but in a world in which what is classified emerges through the recalcitrance of a 29-year-old with an old USB stick, there might be some truth in this joviality.\n\nWe really need to do something positive with our billionaire techies, whose priorities seem more skewed than a rapper's hat.\n\nWe really ought to co-opt them into saving our culture, rather than let it disappear into the sinkhole of flappy birds and snoopy glasses.\n\nPlease imagine Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg, with iron suits and will, soaring in to save us from our enemies and our own worst excesses.\n\nWe haven't seen all that much of these young men lately. Might they already be in training?", "article_metadata": {"description": "With so much going on, you might have missed it this week.
