That compares to 3.4 million customers who had signed up for coverage on that exchange around the same time in 2015 during open enrollment.

"We're obviously pleased," said Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal agency that oversees Obamacare, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "It's clear now that many people have been waiting to purchase coverage until this enrollment cycle."

HealthCare.gov's tally does not include enrollment numbers from the 13 other Obamacare exchanges that are being run by individual states and the District of Columbia.

"There was an unprecedented amount of traffic at the call center and an incredible amount of activity on HealthCare.gov," in the days leading up to Thursday, which was the deadline for enrolling in coverage that will be effective Jan. 1, said Slavitt.

"Dec. 15 was the busiest day in history," he said. "We signed up 600,000 people in health coverage in just 24 hours."

For many hours on Tuesday, "we were signing up 11 consumers every second" on HealthCare.gov, Slavitt said. And the site's telephone call center fielded 2 million calls on Monday and Tuesday.



He said that in the five days leading up to the deadline "an astounding 48 percent of the 1.8 million consumers who were enrolled were new consumers," and in the last two days, 60 percent of the sign-ups came from new customers.
