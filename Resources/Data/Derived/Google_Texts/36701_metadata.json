Ryan Pace also took over as general manager.\n\nIf the opener is any indication of Fox\u2019s plans for his first season in Chicago, expect a lot of touches for Forte, a controlled, precise passing game and increased emphasis on preventing big plays on defense.\n\nForte had 24 carries and another five receptions. Cutler was 18 for 36 for 225 yards and a touchdown while throwing short and intermediate passes for most of the afternoon.\n\nRodgers managed just 189 yards passing in his lowest total against the Bears since he was knocked out of a 27-20 loss to Chicago on Nov. 4, 2013.\n\n\u201cThis is a process, and this is the first time that myself and this staff have watched this team play a real game,\u201d Fox said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll learn from it and get better from it.\u201d\n\nChicago trailed 17-16 before Green Bay put together a 16-play, 78-yard drive that lasted more than 9 1/2 minutes and culminated in Randall Cobb\u2019s 5-yard touchdown reception with 10:26 left in the game. Cobb, who was hampered by a shoulder injury in the preseason, also had a big 9-yard reception on third-and-8.\n\nThe Bears marched right down the field on the ensuing possession, highlighted by a 50-yard, catch-and-run for Marquess Wilson to the Green Bay 16. But they turned it over on downs after Cutler misfired on three straight passes at the 2.\n\n\u201cPlaying a team like that, you\u2019ve got to play perfect football,\u201d Forte said. \u201cFor us to be not only in the red zone, but inside the 5 and not be able to get it in the end zone for four downs was a huge blow.\u201d\n\nCutler then threw an interception to Clay Matthews on Chicago\u2019s next possession, putting Green Bay in great position with the ball on the Bears 48. A pass interference penalty on Kyle Fuller moved the ball to the 2, and Eddie Lacy rushed in on the next play for the clinching score.\n\n\u201cIt definitely was tough. That\u2019s what we expected,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just expect to come in and run through them, but we kept our composure. The time of possession wasn\u2019t on our side, but we never got down. We just continued to fight.\u201d\n\nCutler found Martellus Bennett for a 24-yard touchdown pass with 34 seconds remaining, but Green Bay (1-0) recovered the ensuing onside kick. Alshon Jeffery also had five receptions for 78 yards for the Bears in his return from a calf injury.\n\nRodgers threw two of his three touchdown passes to James Jones, who signed a one-year deal with Green Bay on Monday after he was cut by the New York Giants last weekend. Rodgers was 18-for-23 passing and has thrown for 15 TDs with just two interceptions in his past four games against Chicago (0-1) \u2014 all victories.\n\n\u201cWe always talk about possessions, like we had to today,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe scored on five out of seven possessions. We had two kneel-downs possessions and two punts. We maximized our possessions today, which was important.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Gould\u2019s first field goal of the day was No. 244 for his career, breaking a tie with Kevin Butler for the franchise record. \u2026 The Bears started two-time Pro Bowl RG Kyle Long at right tackle \u2014 a move that many saw coming after Jordan Mills got released a week earlier. Vladimir Ducasse started at right guard. \u2026 This was Forte\u2019s fourth game with at least 141 yards and his highest output since he ran for 145 against Tampa Bay on Oct. 23, 2011. \u2026 Packers LB Sam Barrington sat out the second half because of an ankle injury. \u2026 Bears DL Cornelius Washington left with a right quad strain.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bears lose 31-23 to Packers in John Fox\u2019s debut", "title": "Bears lose 31-23 to Packers in John Fox\u2019s debut", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/13/bears-lose-31-23-to-packers-in-john-foxs-debut/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913__john-foxp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913__john-foxp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-13T16:57:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:46:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CHICAGO \u2014 Much of the day went according to plan for John Fox and the Chicago Bears.\nForte rushed for 141 yards and Robbie Gould kicked three field goals, but Rodgers threw for three scores to lead the Packers to a 31-23 victory on Sunday.\nMatt Forte touched the ball 29 times, helping the Bears keep Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay\u2019s high-powered offense off the field.\nThe Bears marched right down the field on the ensuing possession, highlighted by a 50-yard, catch-and-run for Marquess Wilson to the Green Bay 16.\nJay Cutler threw a big interception in the final period as Chicago lost for the 10th time in its past 11 games against Green Bay."}
