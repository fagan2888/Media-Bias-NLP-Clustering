One would require all hospitals in 75 metropolitan areas to accept a flat fee for the costs associated with a hip or knee replacement \u2014 including the costs of surgery, medications, the joint implant and rehabilitation. And if the quality of the care is not judged to be good, Medicare will take back some of the money it paid. Another program would increase or decrease payments to home health agencies in nine states, depending on how they perform on certain quality measurements.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services always had the authority to change the amounts it paid for certain services, but before Obamacare, it needed Congress to pass legislation to change the way it paid for them. The agency is asking for public comment on the proposals.\n\nThese changes will allow the administration to reshape the Medicare program. The new payment rules, while guided by existing evidence, are still experimental \u2014 and are likely to anger Obamacare critics and members of Congress who would prefer to see major changes to Medicare enacted through legislation.\n\nThe proposal \u201cdoes raise the question of how much legislative authority can be ceded,\u201d Joseph Antos, a scholar at the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute, said in an email.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere will most likely be other such programs activated before President Obama leaves office. The administration has pledged that a majority of medical payments will include some measure of \u201cvalue\u201d by 2018.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act set up a new office called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Its mandate was to test new ways of paying for medical care that would improve quality and lower costs. Since the health care law passed, the innovation center has begun dozens of voluntary pilot programs, encouraging interested medical providers to test the new payment types.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the law also said that if it finds programs that the Medicare actuary said passed those tests, it could make the changes a permanent part of how Medicare pays for care.\n\nMedicare has been testing similar programs for the last few years among hospitals and home health agencies that chose to sign up. What\u2019s new about these proposed programs is that providers can\u2019t choose whether to participate. Every hospital in the selected markets, which include New York and Miami, will be paid the new way for knee and hip replacements if the surgery proposal is finalized. Every home health agency in the nine selected states will be paid the new way for its services if that proposal goes into effect.\n\nJoshua Seidman, a senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, said he\u2019s been waiting for the administration to start using its power to reshape how Medicare pays doctors, hospitals and other medical services.\n\n\u201cHow are they going to expand these programs and scale them? That\u2019s the question now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously got huge potential to shape how future payment is made.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150710083124, "twitter": {"description": "Two programs would tie some payments to quality of care, and all hospitals in selected areas would get a flat fee for a hip or knee replacement.", "title": "Obamacare Flexes Muscles With New Medicare Payment Plans", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/upshot/obamacare-flexes-muscles-with-new-medicare-payment-plans.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003791446"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "sangerkatz", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/10/upshot/10UP-Medicare/10UP-Medicare-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/upshot/obamacare-flexes-muscles-with-new-medicare-payment-plans.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003791446", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/upshot/obamacare-flexes-muscles-with-new-medicare-payment-plans.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 10, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Prices (Fares  Fees and Rates)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/10/upshot/10UP-Medicare/10UP-Medicare-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Two programs would tie some payments to quality of care, and all hospitals in selected areas would get a flat fee for a hip or knee replacement.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/10/upshot/10UP-Medicare/10UP-Medicare-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Two programs would tie some payments to quality of care, and all hospitals in selected areas would get a flat fee for a hip or knee replacement.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 10, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "published": "2015-07-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "11up-medicare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150824163624, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/upshot/obamacare-flexes-muscles-with-new-medicare-payment-plans.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/10/upshot/10UP-Medicare/10UP-Medicare-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two programs would tie some payments to quality of care, and all hospitals in selected areas would get a flat fee for a hip or knee replacement.", "title": "Obamacare Flexes Muscles With New Medicare Payment Plans"}, "pdate": 20150710, "des": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "articleid": 100000003791446, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obamacare Flexes Muscles With New Medicare Payment Plans", "col": "Public Health", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90a8\"", "article_summary": "Its mandate was to test new ways of paying for medical care that would improve quality and lower costs.\nAnd if the quality of the care is not judged to be good, Medicare will take back some of the money it paid.\nSince the health care law passed, the innovation center has begun dozens of voluntary pilot programs, encouraging interested medical providers to test the new payment types.\nMedicare has been testing similar programs for the last few years among hospitals and home health agencies that chose to sign up.\nThe Affordable Care Act set up a new office called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation."}
