Non-GAAP Financial Measures

EBITDA and adjusted net income per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management as supplemental metrics in evaluating financial performance, financing and business decisions, and in forecasting and planning for future periods. These measures are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

The following table reconciles net income, which the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA:

2015

Outlook(1) Net income $ 132 million Adjustments: Depreciation, and amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software 125 million Interest expense 60 million Income tax expense 168 million EBITDA $ 485 million

The following table reconciles net income per diluted share, which the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net income per diluted share:

2015

Outlook(1) Net income per diluted share $ 2.35 Adjustments, net of tax: Amortization of convertible senior notes and lease financing obligations 0.35 Amortization of intangible assets 0.20 Adjusted net income per diluted share $ 2.90
