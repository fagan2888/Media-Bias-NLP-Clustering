Last summer, I got a letter from a woman named Elizabeth Paredes from Tucson, Arizona. Elizabeth is the mom of a 3-year-old boy, and an assistant manager at a sandwich shop. She earns about $2,000 a month, and she routinely works some 50 hours a week, sometimes even more. But because of outdated overtime regulations, she doesn\u2019t have to be paid a dime of overtime.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018It\u2019s not easy work and requires a lot of time away from my son\u2026 at times I find [it\u2019s] not worth it.\u2019\n\nThings like the 40-hour workweek and overtime are two of the most basic pillars of a middle class life. But for all the changes we\u2019ve seen in our economy, our overtime rules have only been updated once since the 1970s. Just once. In fact, forty years ago, more than 60 percent of workers were eligible for overtime based on their salaries. But today, that number is down to seven percent. Only seven percent of full-time salaried workers are eligible for overtime based on their income.\n\nThat\u2019s why this week, my Administration took a step to help more workers get the overtime pay they\u2019ve earned. The Department of Labor finalized a rule to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans. It\u2019s a move that will boost wages for working Americans by $12 billion over the next 10 years. We\u2019re more than doubling the overtime salary threshold. And what that means is, most salaried workers who earn less than about $47,500 a year will qualify for overtime. Or, their employers can choose to give them a raise so that they earn more than $47,500. Or, if employers don\u2019t want to raise wages, they can let them go home after 40 hours and see their families or train for new jobs. Any way you slice it, it\u2019s a win for working families. And we\u2019re making sure that every three years, there will be an automatic update to this threshold \u2013 so that working families won\u2019t fall through the cracks for decades at a time ever again.\n\nThis is the single biggest step I can take through executive action to raise wages for the American people. It means that millions of hardworking Americans like Elizabeth will either get paid for working more than 40 hours, or they\u2019ll get more time with their families. Either way, they win. The middle class wins. And America wins.\n\nWe still have more work to do to make sure this economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll never stop fighting for as long as I hold this office \u2013 to restore the sense that in America, hard work should be rewarded with the chance to get ahead.\n\nThanks everybody. Have a great weekend.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama: Overtime Pay Rules 'Biggest Step I Can Take Through Executive Action To Raise Wages'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama: Overtime Pay Rules 'Biggest Step I Can Take Through Executive Action To Raise Wages'", "title": "Obama: Overtime Pay Rules 'Biggest Step I Can Take Through Executive Action To Raise Wages' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Obama-521-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/05/21/obama-overtime-pay-rules-biggest-step-i-can-take-through-executive-action-to-raise-wages/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama: Overtime Pay Rules 'Biggest Step I Can Take Through Executive Action To Raise Wages'", "title": "Obama: Overtime Pay Rules 'Biggest Step I Can Take Through Executive Action To Raise Wages' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Obama-521-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Overtime Pay, President Obama,Breitbart TV, Economics,Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "President Obama", "published_time": "2016-05-21T08:00:03-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "This is the single biggest step I can take through executive action to raise wages for the American people.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Obama touted new overtime protection rules that he stated were \u201cthe single biggest step I can take through executive action to raise wages for the American people\u201d during Saturday\u2019s Weekly Address.\nThat\u2019s why this week, my Administration took a step to help more workers get the overtime pay they\u2019ve earned.\nAny way you slice it, it\u2019s a win for working families.\nOr, if employers don\u2019t want to raise wages, they can let them go home after 40 hours and see their families or train for new jobs."}
