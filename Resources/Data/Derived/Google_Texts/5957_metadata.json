I couldn\u2019t believe how many big fish I saw in the water.\u201d\n\nThe Hillsborough County side of the causeway trail opened Aug. 30 to walkers, bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers, said Florida Department of Transportation spokeswoman Kristen Carson. The Pinellas County side will be completed next year.\n\nWhen finished, the path will be a part of a nine-mile scenic trail on the south side of the causeway. At both ends, the trail is expected to link with other pedestrian paths, such as the Ream Wilson Trail in Clearwater and a utility road in the Rocky Point area.\n\nThe $14 million project was built using federal money, and timed to coincide with an asphalt resurfacing project for the causeway, Carson said.\n\nBenches, shaded structures, information kiosks and expanded parking for the pedestrian bridge are in the works.\n\nA grand opening and ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Hillsborough side of the span is scheduled for Nov. 16.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of it,\u201d Carson said.\n\nIt is the sole bridge over Old Tampa Bay dedicated solely to pedestrians since the Friendship Trail Bridge on Gandy Boulevard closed in 2008.\n\nThe pedestrian-friendly Courtney Campbell span, which is 45-feet tall at its apex, has not escaped controversy. Transportation officials decided to ban fishing on the structure, citing safety concerns.\n\nFishermen casting lines, and perhaps leaving chairs, coolers and other items along the path, could injure bicyclists and walkers, Carson said.\n\nThe first day the span was open, fishermen disobeyed the rule, leaving fish hooks and broken bottles near the railings, she said.\n\n\u201cWe knew fishing from the bridge wouldn\u2019t be safe for pedestrians,\u201d Carson said.\n\nGeorge Ingole of Tampa said he was glad fishing isn\u2019t allowed.\n\n\u201cI go under this bridge with a boat almost every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get a hook in my eye.\u201d\n\nKen Chmara, who walked the bridge for the first time Saturday with his wife, Debbie, said it doesn\u2019t bother him that he can\u2019t fish at the top of span.\n\n\u201cI got plenty of other spots,\u201d Ken Chmara of Safety Harbor said. \u201cIt won\u2019t cramp my style.\u201d\n\nHis wife said the bridge, which crosses Old Tampa Bay, has plenty of room for pedestrians, but adding fishermen to the mix would make it too cramped.\n\n\u201cIt would be too dangerous if fishermen were allowed on it, because they\u2019re always throwing out their lines,\u201d Debbie Chmara said.\n\nIngole said when construction began, he took his boat out to watch because he couldn\u2019t wait to walk across it.\n\n\u201cI was here when the first pylon went in the water,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve been here every day since it opened.\u201d\n\nKrista Louden and Justin Fiedler crossed the bridge on foot for the first time Saturday and already were planning a return trip.\n\n\u201cWe heard it was open, so we were like, \u2018Let\u2019s use it,\u2019\u201d Louden said.\n\nFiedler paused at the top, taking in the sky and water.\n\n\u201cLook at this view,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nrreyes@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7920\n\nTwitter@TBORay", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 14 Sep 2013 15:03:39 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 On Saturday morning, Dustin Nash and Grace Pampo decided to go on a stroll.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 On Saturday morning, Dustin Nash and Grace Pampo decided to go on a stroll.", "title": "Outdoor enthusiasts make way to new Courtney Campbell trail", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/all/outdoor-enthusiasts-make-way-to-new-courtney-campbell-trail-20130914/", "image": {"width": 3097, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20130914/ARTICLE/130919469/EP/1/3/EP-130919469.jpg", "height": 2063}, "updated_time": "2013-09-14T18:15:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 On Saturday morning, Dustin Nash and Grace Pampo decided to go on a stroll.", "title": "Outdoor enthusiasts make way to new Courtney Campbell trail", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20130914/ARTICLE/130919469/AR/0/AR-130919469.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-09-14T15:03:39Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-09-14T18:15:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8a3\"", "article_summary": "But instead of walking around their Clearwater neighborhood, the couple headed east to the Courtney Campbell Causeway and the new pedestrian trail and bridge that stretch parallel to the scenic highway.\nThe $14 million project was built using federal money, and timed to coincide with an asphalt resurfacing project for the causeway, Carson said.\nBenches, shaded structures, information kiosks and expanded parking for the pedestrian bridge are in the works.\nIt is the sole bridge over Old Tampa Bay dedicated solely to pedestrians since the Friendship Trail Bridge on Gandy Boulevard closed in 2008.\nWhen finished, the path will be a part of a nine-mile scenic trail on the south side of the causeway."}
