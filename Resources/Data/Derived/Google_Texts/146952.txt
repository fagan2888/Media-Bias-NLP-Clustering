Gregory Saul, 67, has been on the run since the beginning of the year after he failed to show up for a court hearing. Saul was a teacher at Moore Christian Schools back in 2012 and faces 18 felony counts for seducing a 13-year-old student.

Workers at the Wilson County Texas jail confirm Saul was picked up in Floresville, Texas around 10 o'clock Saturday night, for failing to appear on those Oklahoma sex crimes warrants.

The US Marshals office tells News 9 it will be up to Cleveland County Authorities to extradite Saul back to Oklahoma. In the meantime, he is being held in Texas without bond.

And there is no word yet if he is going to fight the process.
