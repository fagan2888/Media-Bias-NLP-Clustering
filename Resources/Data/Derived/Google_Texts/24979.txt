In many states, if an engagement ring is given and the engagement is later terminated, the law requires that the engagement ring be returned.

Virginia, in general, does not require the return of an engagement ring. The Heart Balm Act, ยง8.01-220 of the Code of Virginia, provides that no civil action shall be maintained in Virginia for breach of promise to marry.

The Act has been interpreted to not require the return of an engagement ring. While there are certain circumstances where a ring might be required to be returned based upon some oral or written agreement, in general, Virginia does not require the return of engagement rings.
