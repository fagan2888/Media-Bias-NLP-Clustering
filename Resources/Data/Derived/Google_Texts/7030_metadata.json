Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said Friday night that primary frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is responsible for creating an environment that encourages violence after a Trump rally was cancelled because clashes broke out when protestors entered the event.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Cruz told reporters he \u201cthinks a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment [of violence]. When the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence, to punch people in the face, the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates.\u201d\n\nCruz warned that violence will likely continue to take place at future Trump events, citing an incident in St. Louis earlier that same day when at least 32 people were arrested after attendees at a Trump event clashed with protestors.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how our politics should occur,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is my hope that in 2016 we can appeal to our better angels [and] avoid going down that road once again.\u201d\n\nTrump was supposed to speak at the University of Illinois at Chicago in a pavilion that was filled to capacity, but a large group of protestors entered the venue and disturbed the proceedings.\n\nThe protestors appeared to be supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), a self-declared socialist running in the Democratic primary. They held up pro-Sanders signs and could be heard chanting \u201cBernie, Bernie, Bernie!\u201d\n\nThe situation escalated to the point where fights broke out, and the entire event deteriorated into a chaotic situation. A speaker came to the podium to announce that Trump had met with law enforcement and decided it was better to postpone the event for the safety of those present.\n\nAt least 7,000 people were in the pavilion at the time of the protest, and about 10,000 people had tickets to attend the rally. The protest soon spilt out onto the street, with around 1,000 people remaining.\n\nWhile Trump later said on television he consulted with local law enforcement before making his decision, Anthony Guglielmia, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, denied Trump\u2019s claim, saying that neither the police nor the university recommended cancelling the rally. There was sufficient manpower at the event to handle the situation, according to Guglielmia, who added that the cancellation was decided solely by the campaign.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has had to deal with protestors consistently entering his events and has received criticism for suggesting on multiple occasions that his supporters physically harm them.\n\nCruz also addressed Trump\u2019s policy ideas at his press conference after a reporter asked if the protestors are fueled by the GOP frontrunner\u2019s proposals.\n\n\u201cFinding Donald Trump\u2019s policies is a difficult endeavour,\u201d Cruz responded with a smile. \u201cBecause Donald speaks of problems. He speaks about jobs going overseas, but when asked for a policy to fix it, he has yet to propose one \u2013 other than his magic cure-all of negotiate better deals. \u2018We\u2019ll have better deals to solve every problem.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that is a meaningful solution to the problems we are facing.\u201d\n\nCruz then said the United States needs strong economic policies to bring jobs back to the country and raise wages for workers, adding that his campaign is focused on substantive proposals to make those goals a reality.\n\n\u201cWe fix the economy by lifting the burdens on small businesses because two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd we do that through repealing Obamacare, through pulling back the federal regulators that are making it harder and harder for small businesses to survive. And we do that through passing a simple flat tax and abolishing the IRS. Those are meaningful policies that will bring back jobs and raise wages.\u201d\n\nCruz also said during the press conference that the Republican primary is now a two-man race between him and Trump in an effort to portray himself as the best chance for conservative voters to keep the real estate mogul from the nomination.\n\nTrump is currently leading the Republican presidential race with 459 delegates, which is 99 more than Cruz, who has 360. Rubio is third with 152 delegates.\n\nA candidate needs 1,237 delegates to secure the nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz said Friday that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment encouraging violence after a Trump rally was cancelled.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Sen.
