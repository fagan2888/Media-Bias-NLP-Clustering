So far this year, African countries have sold $7.2 billion of bonds globally, 12% more than a year ago and the most on record at this point in the calendar year, according to data provider Dealogic. About 85% of that cash has been raised since the start of June.\n\n\u201cWe knew the likes of Kenya and Ivory Coast had been planning to issue bonds, but the deals have been larger than expected because of the strong market demand,\u201d said Kevin Daly, an emerging-market fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u201cWith the low-yield environment, it\u2019s a great opportunity for these countries to come to market.\u201d\n\nAverage yields in the region have fallen to about 5% from 5.89% at the start of the year, according to a J.P. Morgan index of emerging-market bonds. Many people had expected these bonds to rise in yield as the U.S. Federal Reserve scaled back its stimulus program. Instead, riskier assets have retained their allure.\n\nEven so, some investors are wary about how cheaply many African countries have been able to borrow given their relatively low credit ratings and higher risk of default.\n\n\u201cThis is the result of massive money printing and will only be resolved once the music finally stops,\u201d said Ben Bennett, a credit strategist at Legal & General Investment Management.\n\nWednesday\u2019s deal comes a week after West African peer Ivory Coast sold $750 million of 10-year bonds at a yield of 5.625%.\n\nMr. Daly said he passed on the Ivory Coast bonds because they were too expensive but is considering buying some of Senegal\u2019s issue as the yield on offer is more attractive.\n\nIn contrast to Ivory Coast, which has already suffered two civil wars and two defaults since the turn of the century, Senegal\u2019s political backdrop has been relatively trouble-free.\n\nThe business landscape is less positive. In 2013, the World Bank ranked Senegal 178th out of 189 countries for ease of doing business. That will continue to weigh on investment and economic growth if there is no improvement, according to credit-rating firm Standard & Poor\u2019s.\n\nStill, Senegal has already received pledges from foreign donors and private investors worth billions of dollars to fund infrastructure projects as part of a wider plan to boost economic growth, S&P noted.\n\nIf that succeeds in helping Senegal double growth rates to about 7%-to-8% of gross domestic product as hoped, \u201cthis is looking like a very strong story,\u201d Aberdeen\u2019s Mr. Daly said.\n\nCitigroup, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Standard Chartered Bank are managing the sale.\n\nSenegal is rated B1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and B+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s.\n\nWrite to Ben Edwards at ben.edwards@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Senegal is poised Wednesday to sell its first dollar bond in a little more than three years amid robust demand for African debt.", "title": "Senegal Jumps on Debt Bandwagon With 10-Year Dollar Bond", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/23/senegal-jumps-on-issuance-bandwagon-with-10-year-dollar-bond/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Senegal Jumps on Debt Bandwagon With 10-Year Dollar Bond", "description": "Senegal is poised Wednesday to sell its first dollar bond in a little more than three years amid robust demand for African debt.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ben Edwards", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Senegal is poised Wednesday to sell its first dollar bond in a little more than three years amid robust demand for African debt.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-23T12:10:52-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/23/senegal-jumps-on-issuance-bandwagon-with-10-year-dollar-bond/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-968", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Senegal is poised Wednesday to sell its first dollar bond in a little more than three years amid robust demand for African debt.", "title": "Senegal Jumps on Debt Bandwagon With 10-Year Dollar Bond", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/23/senegal-jumps-on-issuance-bandwagon-with-10-year-dollar-bond/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-968", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-23T18:59:32-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82a8\"", "article_summary": "Wednesday\u2019s deal comes a week after West African peer Ivory Coast sold $750 million of 10-year bonds at a yield of 5.625%.\nIn contrast to Ivory Coast, which has already suffered two civil wars and two defaults since the turn of the century, Senegal\u2019s political backdrop has been relatively trouble-free.\nSenegal is poised on Wednesday to sell its first dollar bond in a little more than three years, extending the record pace of African bond issuance amid rampant demand for higher-yielding assets.\nThe West African country is set to raise $500 million from the 10-year debt sale at a yield of 6.25%, according to a banker working on the deal.\nMr. Daly said he passed on the Ivory Coast bonds because they were too expensive but is considering buying some of Senegal\u2019s issue as the yield on offer is more attractive."}
