Believe it or not, there are people out there who actually love Rob Ford, even now that any reference to him has to include the qualifier “crack-smoking.” They’re called the “Ford Nation,” and on Tuesday night, Jon Stewart attempted to understand why anyone in their right mind would support this crazy man.

Stewart stared in awe at the latest bout of insanity from Ford, including his comparison between his current situation and the time when Iraq invaded Kuwait. He said, “That last reference may be dated, but in Rob Ford’s defense, it may be one of the last things he remembers.”

Correspondent Jessica Williams even traveled to Toronto herself to find out “who in their right mind” supports this guy and ended up finding one Ford supporter who was, amusingly, unable to discern the difference between quotes from Rob Ford and Charlie Sheen.
