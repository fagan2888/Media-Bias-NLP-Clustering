ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico wasn’t the only health insurer to collect reimbursements from funds intended to offset exceptionally high claims.

Blue Cross received nearly $24 million in payments from two federal programs set up under the Affordable Care Act, but other insurance companies in New Mexico also benefited from the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs. The programs are intended to help compensate insurers, who under the ACA cannot deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

According to a June 30 report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees insurance plans nationwide, Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico received $17.4 million in reinsurance payments. The program provides the money to insurers with higher-risk enrollees to discourage them from charging those customers higher premiums. The CMS report showed Blue Cross also received $6.3 million in risk adjustment payments.

Here’s how the other insurance companies fared from the federal programs;

— Presbyterian Health Plan received $5.5 million in reinsurance payments and paid in $2.4 million to the risk adjustment program,

— New Mexico Health Connections, received $3.2 million in reinsurance payments and paid in $4.8 million to the risk adjustment program.

— Molina Healthcare of New Mexico received $325,293 in reinsurance payments and $685,619 in risk adjustment payments,

Money for the reinsurance program comes from funds collected from all insurers and is paid out to those insurance companies based on their actual claims.

The risk adjustment program redistributes funds from plans with lower-risk customers to those with higher-risk customers. The goal is to stabilize premiums by reducing the incentive to charge high-risk customers higher premiums.

Despite receiving nearly $24 million from the two federal programs, Blue Cross Blue Shield lost $19.2 million on its 35,000 individual plan customers in 2014. Company President Kurt Shipley cited that loss, related to a large number of claims of more than $1 million and one customer with charges of $3.8 million, as key reasons that the company was seeking a 51.6 percent increase rate increase on individual plans.

Blue Cross has the largest number of customers with individual plans, purchased through or outside the health exchange. New Mexico Health Connections has 22,513 and Presbyterian has 19,500. Molina does not release membership numbers by state.

Insurance Superintendent John Franchini denied the Blue Cross request saying that, based on the information the company provided, he could only justify a 24 percent increase.

However, Franchini approved rate increases for Presbyterian ranging from 3 percent to 6 percent, New Mexico Health Connections ranging from 4 percent to 17 percent and an average 2 percent decrease for Molina.
