I don't get angry often,\" a visibly angry Cruz told an NBC reporter during a campaign stop in Wisconsin, the site of the next major GOP primary on April 5. \"But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that'll do it every time.\u201d Then he looked directly into the camera and said forcefully, \u201cDonald you are a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone.\"\n\nThe gambit might have backfired if a story from the National Enquirer published on Friday turns out to be true. It charges that Cruz has been involved in at least five extramarital affairs, which Cruz claims was planted by Donald Trump. The story claims one of the affairs was with Katrina Pierson, a Texas communications specialist and Trump\u2019s official national campaign spokesperson.\n\nPierson went on Twitter to call the situation \u201cstupidity on all levels.\u201d\n\nOf course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!! I only speak to myself, however.\n\n\n\nCarry on... \u2014 Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) March 25, 2016\n\n\u201cThis National Enquirer story is garbage. It is garbage, complete and utter lies,\u201d Cruz said Friday. \u201cIt is a tabloid smear, and it has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.\u201d\n\nRelated: ISIS Propaganda Video Uses Trump Comments to Celebrate Brussels Attacks\n\nRick Tyler, Cruz\u2019s former press secretary who was forced to resign after being accused of committing dirty campaign tricks in early primary states, defended his former boss and suggested that Trump or an ally shopped the story around to several news organizations until David Pecker, an associate of Trump\u2019s and the National Enquirer\u2019s publisher, agreed to print it.\n\nTyler told MSNBC that Cruz is \u201ca man of integrity and a man of decency,\u201d and that he was \u201c100 percent\u201d certain the story is false.\n\nTrump issued a statement on the Enquirer article, saying he had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it and have not, as yet, read it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTed Cruz\u2019s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz,\u201d he added.\n\nThat Cruz must spend time dealing with such controversies -- time that could prove critical before the Wisconsin primary, which is less than two weeks away -- plays right into Trump\u2019s hands. Prior to his statement, the former reality TV star had been virtually non-existent on the campaign trail for much of the week.\n\nRelated: How Clinton\u2019s Speech Capitalized on Disenchantment with Trump-Style GOP Foreign Policy\n\nTrump\u2019s last event was a major speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington on Monday. That was the same day he told The Washington Post editorial board that the U.S. should reconsider its involvement in NATO; the remarks have come under immense scrutiny from both parties following the terror attacks that took place in Brussels on Tuesday.\n\nAnd aside from a few storms, Trump has mostly stayed off Twitter, his preferred method for picking fights with his critics.\n\nTaken together, the episodes give further fuel to the anxieties of GOP leaders that their presumptive nominee, who has been accused of sexism through his campaign, will alienate female voters, including those within their ranks.\n\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, conducted before the war of words over Heidi Cruz, found that 47 percent of Republican women could not see themselves supporting Trump, a number significantly higher than for any other GOP candidate.\n\nAnd a new poll conducted by Emerson College found that the two are running neck and neck in Wisconsin, where Cruz could make his last stand against the billionaire. However, Trump is 10 points underwater among Republican woman, with 50 percent unfavorable to 40 percent favorable.\n\nIronically, it was left to Pierson, Trump\u2019s chief spokesperson and one of the five women implicated in the controversial National Enquirer expose, to defend the billionaire businessman\u2019s standing with women.\n\nPierson said that she and the Trump campaign have been hearing for months that Trump has alienated women voters, and that it is simply not true.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump has been winning women as these elections have occurred, and I think he\u2019s going to continue to win them because women care more about the education of their children, their safety and security and their jobs in this country,\u201d she told MSNBC.\n\nThat could change if Trump becomes the nominee and faces Hillary Clinton, who would be the first female standard-bearer of either major political party.\n\nPolls by Fox News and Bloomberg Politics released earlier this week each showed the former Secretary of State beating Trump by double-digits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Republican nomination battle between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz is starting to rese", "title": "Trump vs. Cruz Is Turning Into a Bare-Knuckled Bar Fight", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/25/Trump-vs-Cruz-Turning-Bare-Knuckled-Bar-Fight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/teddy_and_the_don_16_9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/25/Trump-vs-Cruz-Turning-Bare-Knuckled-Bar-Fight", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/teddy_and_the_don_16_9.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Republican nomination battle between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz is starting to rese", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The gambit might have backfired if a story from the National Enquirer published on Friday turns out to be true.\nPierson went on Twitter to call the situation \u201cstupidity on all levels.\u201dOf course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!!\nPierson said that she and the Trump campaign have been hearing for months that Trump has alienated women voters, and that it is simply not true.\nIt charges that Cruz has been involved in at least five extramarital affairs, which Cruz claims was planted by Donald Trump.\nThe story claims one of the affairs was with Katrina Pierson, a Texas communications specialist and Trump\u2019s official national campaign spokesperson."}
