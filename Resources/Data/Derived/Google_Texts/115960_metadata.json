The unit recovered about $337,000 from 2011 through 2013, but it spent $3.9 million during the same period.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of our findings, OIG is concerned about the unit\u2019s ability to carry out its statutory functions and meet program requirements,\u201d the inspector general said.\n\nHawaii had fewer investigations, indictments, charges and criminal convictions than almost any other state in fiscal year 2014, according to a previous review from the inspector general.\n\nEach state has a Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, funded largely by the federal government, but operating under the state\u2019s attorney general.\n\nHawaii\u2019s previous three biggest fails include:\n\n1. When Hawaii\u2019s State Obamacare Exchange Failed.\n\nHawaii\u2019s state-run Obamacare exchange shut its doors in May after receiving $205 million in federal grants. It cost at least $5,100 for each of the estimated 40,000 people who lost coverage to switch to health care through the federal exchange.\n\nState officials claimed they lacked sufficient funds to keep the Hawaii exchange operating. The exchange\u2019s web site had experienced numerous technical problems.\n\n2. When Hawaii\u2019s Health Department Hoarded Money For Clean Drinking Water\n\nHawaii is still hoarding about $100 million in state and federal grants meant for safe, clean drinking water, according to a recent Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General report.\n\nThe IG said the EPA shouldn\u2019t give Hawaii any more funds for drinking water infrastructure until Hawaii spends the money it already has.\n\n3. When a Hawaii VA Supervisor Manipulated Veteran Wait-Time Data\n\nA U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs supervisor in Honolulu altered data to make it look like veterans had shorter wait times for benefits, according to a March report from the VA Inspector General.\n\nThe supervisor manipulated data to improve the appearance of his team\u2019s progress amid national concerns about the VA\u2019s treatment of veterans. The supervisor in question was allowed to resign, the report said.\n\nFollow Kathryn on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
