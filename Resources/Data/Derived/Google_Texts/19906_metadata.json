I\u2019ve informed Mr. McGruber [sic] that we will not be paying him any further for his part in completing that work.\u201d\n\nFox News reports that the original contract in Vermont was worth $400,000, and that Jonathan Gruber has thus far collected $160,000 of that money.\n\nThe contract termination reveal was made at an info session for Vermont legislators.\n\nGovernor Shumlin was prompted to action by the state\u2019s Senate Minority Leader, Joe Benning.\n\n\u201cI join with my Senate colleague, Sen. Kevin Mullin, in urging the governor to terminate his contract,\u201d Benning, R-Caledonia, said in comments to Vermont Watchdog. \u201cIf the powers that be attempted to trick them like that, then those people should be immediately removed from positions of authority, be they elected officials or hired contractors.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s pay is for \u201cpolicy expertise, research, and economic modeling related to the implementation of Green Mountain Care.\u201d His final report is expected on January 15.\n\nJonathan Gruber has been a sore spot for Democrats still reeling from the Election Night defeat at the hands of Republicans. Obamacare is the signature domestic achievement not only of President Obama, but also the Democratic-led House and Senate.\n\nSince its passage, Democrats have fallen into the minority in the House (in 2010), and on November 4, they lost the Senate. Starting January 1, both houses will be controlled by Republicans for the first time since President George W. Bush.\n\nRepealing Obamacare has been a big motivator for Republicans, and the comments by Gruber as well as the subsequent denial that he had much to do with building the law from both President Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has reignited that desire.\n\nBut what do you think, readers? Is the firing of Jonathan Gruber a sign of things to come for the healthcare law?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jonathan Gruber, the so-called \"Obamacare architect\" and consultant on implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA aka Obamacare), has had his contract terminated", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Jonathan Gruber, the so-called \u201cObamacare architect\u201d and consultant on implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA aka Obamacare), has had his contract terminated", "title": "Jonathan Gruber, \u2018Obamacare Architect,\u2019 Gets Fired By Vermont", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1622862/jonathan-gruber-obamacare-architect-gets-fired-by-vermont/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jonathan-Gruber-Fired-By-Vermont.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-20T02:43:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-22T18:21:53+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jonathan-Gruber-Fired-By-Vermont.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-11-20T02:43:24+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,aca,affordable care act,jonathan gruber,jonathan gruber fired,lawrence miller,obamacare architect,peter shumlin,vermont governor,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jonathan-Gruber-Fired-By-Vermont.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jonathan Gruber, the so-called \u201cObamacare architect\u201d and consultant on implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA aka Obamacare), has had his contract terminated"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9c3\"", "article_summary": "Jonathan Gruber, the so-called \u201cObamacare architect\u201d and consultant on implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA aka Obamacare), has had his contract terminated by the state of Vermont.\nGovernor Shumlin was prompted to action by the state\u2019s Senate Minority Leader, Joe Benning.\nJonathan Gruber has been a sore spot for Democrats still reeling from the Election Night defeat at the hands of Republicans.\nIs the firing of Jonathan Gruber a sign of things to come for the healthcare law?\nObamacare is the signature domestic achievement not only of President Obama, but also the Democratic-led House and Senate."}
