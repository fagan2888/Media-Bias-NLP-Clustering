Back in July, Medical Daily brought you the scoop on the new brunette doll, created by graphic designer Nickolay Lamm. Since then, the Pittsburgh artist has launched a crowd-sourced project to help cover the costs of tooling and molding, but also to meet the manufacturer\u2019s minimum order quantity. Lamm has started taking pre-orders for the first production run of \u201cLammily.\u201d People who order now will receive the doll by November 2014.\n\nLammily has drawn attention for her realistic female body proportions. Modeled after a 19-year-old woman, she\u2019s shorter than Mattel\u2019s Barbie, for one, but she also has a wider waist and hips, a thicker neck and torso, and her head is smaller, in proportion with the rest of her body. She also stands flat on her feet \u2014 since no woman goes through life solely wearing heels. Although fans have sharply contrasted the doll with Mattel\u2019s Barbie, Lamm has, in fact, worked with former Vice President of Manufacturing at Mattel, Robert Rambeau, in selecting a manufacturer.\n\nThe Lammily \u201cExclusive First Edition,\u201d not sold in retail stores, comes with a blouse, denim shorts, white sneakers, and a large \u201cAverage is Beautiful\u201d poster \u2014 to perhaps instill the idea in little girls that impossible physical standards... are just that.\n\nLammily wears minimal makeup. Nickolay Lamm\n\nThe doll with \"normal\" proportions stands flat on her feet and comes with sneakers for her workout gear. Nickolay Lamm\n\nLammily can switch into heels, but it's nice to know she has the option for flats. Nickolay Lamm\n\nLammily has wider hips and waist than Mattel's Barbie.
