Ruff\u2019s (R) ardent opposition to the Medicaid expansion offered to the states under the Affordable Care Act took a new turn on Tuesday. Ruff confirmed to ThinkProgress that he \u201ccompared reliance on promised funds to provide health insurance for thousands of low-income Virginians to a \u2018tar baby,'\u201d a statement that was first reported in the Virginian-Pilot.\n\nRuff told attendees at the Danville Pittsylvania County Chamber of Commerce\u2019s legislative breakfast that Virginia would be stuck if Medicaid expansion became financially disadvantageous in the future, like a \u201ctar baby.\u201d The Virginian-Pilot noted that the term \u201ccomes from the Uncle Remus collection of African American folklore tales published in the post-Reconstruction South and written in the eye dialect of rural blacks of that era,\u201d and is \u201cperceived as a racial slur against African Americans in some circles.\u201d\n\nJohn Gilstrap, a member of the Danville City Council, denounced the comment as \u201cnot a correct statement to make\u201d and \u201coffensive to a couple African Americans in the audience.\u201d Gilstrap told the Pilot that Danville Mayor Sherman Saunders had walked out of the meeting after Ruff\u2019s comparison.\n\nIn an email, Ruff told ThinkProgress, \u201cSpeaking with no prepared remarks I used the term \u2018tar baby\u2019 referring to a sticky situation one time. Never have I ever heard this as a racial term. I called the Mayor yesterday afternoon to clarify that. I consider Sherman a friend and do not expect this to change our working together in the future for all of the people of the region.\u201d\n\nRuff was one of 17 Senate Republicans to vote against accepting billions of dollars in federal funding to expand Medicaid eligibility to roughly 400,000 Virginians. Ruff and other legislative Republicans say they are worried that the promised federal funding will not come through, and thus have voted to effectively let $5 million each day of Virginians\u2019 tax dollars subsidize other states that have opted into the expansion. Though the expansion passed the Democratic Party-controlled Senate (with three Republicans joining all 20 Democrats) and enjoys the strong support of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), the Republican-controlled House of Delegates has, thus far, refused to accept it.\n\nA standoff over this issue prevented agreement on a state budget and a special session has been called for next week. At the breakfast, Ruff expressed hope that Democrats would accept a \u201cclean budget\u201d without the expansion, effectively surrendering their leverage.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Virginia Senator Frank Ruff (R) used what's often perceived as a racial slur to describe a major Obamacare provision.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Virginia Senator Frank Ruff (R) used what's often perceived as a racial slur to describe a major Obamacare provision.", "title": "Virginia Legislator Likens Medicaid Expansion To A \u2018Tar Baby\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/19/3416081/frank-ruff-tar-baby/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/FrankRuff.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Virginia Senator Frank Ruff (R) used what's often perceived as a racial slur to describe a major Obamacare provision.", "creator": "@jeisrael", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/FrankRuff-321x214.jpg", "title": "Virginia Legislator Likens Medicaid Expansion To A \u2018Tar Baby\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/FrankRuff.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/FrankRuff.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-19T11:48:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9834\"", "article_summary": "Health Virginia Legislator Likens Medicaid Expansion To A \u2018Tar Baby\u2019 CREDIT: Virginia State Senator Frank Ruff (R)Virginia State Senator Frank Ruff (R)Virginia State Senator Frank M.
