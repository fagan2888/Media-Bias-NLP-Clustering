His measured, even groggy demeanor, commands attention and respect,\u201d he writes. \u201cHad he decided to dedicate his post-retirement life to promoting STEM education across the country, he would have been a model for the American ideal that anything is possible.\u201d\n\nBut God forbid such an accomplished man run for president as a conservative and potentially get black voters to consider voting for the GOP and think about how failed left-wing policies have impoverished their communities and not given them opportunities to move up the economic ladder. Abdul-Jabbar writes that Carson \u201cchose to run for president of the U.S., and that\u2019s bad for African-Americans.\u201d\n\nAbdul-Jabbar\u2019s op-ed was published on the day a new Quinnipiac poll was released that found Carson with a 10-point lead over Hillary Clinton largely because he gets 19% of the black vote compared to 73% for Clinton. The poll led the African-American publication The Grio to declare that Carson \u201ccould beat the Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in a general election, and it might just be with the help of African-American voters.\u201dCarson even leads Clinton among women voters (45%-44%).\n\nThough Breitbart News Editor-at-Large John Nolte exposed Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s past oppressive views toward women, which prompted Abdul-Jabbar to directly respond and declare that he no longer held those views, Abdul-Jabbar writes that Carson\u2019s \u201crepressive, muddled and pious policies and opinions often run against our Constitution\u2014but his questionable proposals will likely, thankfully, be doomed by his lack of political expertise.\u201d\n\nWriting without any sense of irony regarding President Barack Obama\u2019s many instances of leading from behind, Jabbar writes that a Carson presidency \u201cwould definitely not be good for African Americans to have a president who flounders helplessly in office because it would perpetuate the stereotype that blacks can\u2019t be effective CEOs, quarterbacks and leaders.\u201d\n\nAbdul-Jabbar also takes issue with Carson\u2019s belief that \u201csexual orientation is a choice\u201d and skepticism about global warming. He also says that Carson\u2019s \u201cjudgment as a man of science was also compromised last February when he blamed an outbreak of measles on illegal immigrants from South and Central America\u201d and accuses Carson of perpetuating \u201cthe black stereotype of someone who\u2019s too confused or frightened by all that complicated science so he or she ignores it, clinging to superstitions or religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, white politicians have been making the same buffoonish claims, but they aren\u2019t representative of a minority struggling to achieve equality,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar writes.\n\nHe also takes Carson\u2019s comments about Democrats manipulating blacks and taking their votes for granted out of context, claiming that Carson has referred to \u201cblack Americans as unable to think for themselves because they disagree with him.\u201d Because Carson opposes Obamacare, Abdul-Jabbar says that \u201ca Carson presidency would also be a direct attack on the health of African-Americans.\u201d Responding to Carson\u2019s comparison of Obamacare to slavery, Abdul-Jabbar says that \u201cpoverty is the form of slavery that is most insidious in America, and it is perpetuated by institutional racism, which Ben Carson seems to deny exists.\n\n\u201cThese are the times when all Americans need a champion willing to fight hard to fix the problems that affect people from all walks of life, not deny or ignore them,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar opines. \u201cBen Carson is not that champion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Abdul-Jabbar: Ben Carson Presidency Would Be 'Unmitigated Disaster' for Black Americans", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Abdul-Jabbar: Ben Carson Presidency Would Be 'Unmitigated Disaster' for Black Americans", "title": "Abdul-Jabbar: Ben Carson Presidency Would Be 'Unmitigated Disaster' for Black Americans - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2144, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/kareem-abdul-jabbar-t3033.jpg", "height": 1608}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2015/11/04/abdul-jabbar-ben-carson-presidency-would-be-unmitigated-disaster-for-black-americans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Abdul-Jabbar: Ben Carson Presidency Would Be 'Unmitigated Disaster' for Black Americans", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/kareem-abdul-jabbar-t3033.jpg", "title": "Abdul-Jabbar: Ben Carson Presidency Would Be 'Unmitigated Disaster' for Black Americans - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart Sports,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-11-04T14:12:26-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Sports,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFormer NBA great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar comes out swinging against Dr. Ben Carson, writing that Carson would be a terrible president and an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d for black Americans.\n\u201cBen Carson is not that champion.\u201d\n\u201cThese are the times when all Americans need a champion willing to fight hard to fix the problems that affect people from all walks of life, not deny or ignore them,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar opines.\nHis measured, even groggy demeanor, commands attention and respect,\u201d he writes.\nAbdul-Jabbar writes that Carson \u201cchose to run for president of the U.S., and that\u2019s bad for African-Americans.\u201dAbdul-Jabbar\u2019s op-ed was published on the day a new Quinnipiac poll was released that found Carson with a 10-point lead over Hillary Clinton largely because he gets 19% of the black vote compared to 73% for Clinton."}
