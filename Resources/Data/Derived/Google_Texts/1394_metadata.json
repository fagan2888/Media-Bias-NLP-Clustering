(Mitt Romney received a slight majority of married women voters.)\n\n\"We know there's a gender gap,\" Fiorina said. \"There's a lot of evidence that we have ground to make up.\"\n\nFiorina, who lost a bid in 2010 to unseat Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, decided to start the group after receiving positive feedback on her speech at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference, where she claimed Democrats' attacks \"insult\" women by \"thinking all they care about is reproductive rights.\"\n\n\"The 'long arm of the Republican Party' is not reaching into women's bodies,\" Fiorina said Wednesday, referencing comments made by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, following the Supreme Court's ruling Monday to allow family-owned companies to religiously object to providing contraceptive coverage to employees under Obamacare.\n\n\"It's shameless, baseless, propaganda,\" Fiorina said.\n\nInitial plans call for grassroots outreach in six states with competitive Senate races - Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Virginia - with the help of databases from RNC and other GOP operations.\n\nBut Fiorina also has her eye on making an impact in 2016.\n\n\"We want to make an appreciable difference in 2014,\" Fiorina said. \"Once you have people activated in the political process, they tend to stay that way.\"\n\nFiorina's group is one of several to emerge after 2012 to recalibrate the GOP's image with women: RightNOW PAC works to build support for Republican female candidates, while Project Grow recruits and grooms women to run for office.\n\nRepublicans are also optimistic about their chances of adding more female members to their House conference in 2014, and are focusing on a number of promising female candidates in California, Utah and Virginia.\n\nABC News' John Parkinson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "GOP Fights 'War on Women' Stamp with Battleground States Recruiting Effort", "description": "GOP Fights 'War on Women' Stamp with Battleground States Recruiting Effort", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/07/gop-fights-war-on-women-stamp-with-battleground-states-recruiting-effort/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Carly Fiorina is hitting back against the so-called \"war on women.\"", "title": "GOP Fights 'War on Women' Stamp with Battleground States Recruiting Effort"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, presidential election 2012, republicans, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Unlocking Potential Project will recruit Republican women to reach undecided female voters \"wherever women gather,\" Fiorina said.\nWomen favored the Democratic ticket by 11 percentage points in the 2012 presidential election, including two-thirds of single women, according to the ABC News exit poll.\nMike Theiler/REUTERSCarly Fiorina is hitting back against accusations Republicans have a so-called \"war on women.\"\n\"Whether they're single or married, women are most influenced by women they know.\"\nIn its 2012 election postmortem, the Republican National Committee called for a \"more aggressive response\" to Democrats' claims that Republican positions on women's issues amounted to a \"war on women.\""}
