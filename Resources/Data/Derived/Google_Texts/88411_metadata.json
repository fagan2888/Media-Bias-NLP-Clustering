VA Secretary Eric Shinseki refuses to resign over the scandal \u2014 which has allegedly claimed the lives of dozens of sick veterans \u2014 and the Obama administration has been slow to respond.\n\nThe panel \u2014 with the notable exception of token liberal Bob Beckel \u2014 agreed the scandal is a preview of America\u2019s health system under Obamacare, an argument already used by some Republicans opposed to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Tantaros cautioned Republicans against assuming the president is weakened by the bureaucratic collapse. \u201cI predict President Obama, if he\u2019s really savvy, he\u2019s going to come out and he\u2019s going to say, \u2018Okay, pass the supplemental budget to the VA,'\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna say, \u2018I want it on my desk in 48 hours,\u2019 and the Republicans are going to go, \u2018Gulp!'\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any Republican that doesn\u2019t vote for more money for the VA \u2014 which is not the source of the problem \u2014 is going to have Democrats use it against them in the election cycle,\u201d Tantaros explained. \u201cThey are going to turn it around and make it a political issue.\u201d\n\nBeckel protested, noting Obama has spent double the amount of money on the VA that President George W. Bush did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a money problem though, Bob,\u201d Tantaros pushed back. \u201cIt\u2019s an incentive issue. And the reason it it has no competition, that\u2019s why you have these problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s what Obama will do,\u201d she concluded. \u201cAsk for more money, and it won\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
