The mental toll of never basking in natural light includes lethargy, depression, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n\nThe findings are significant with regard to productivity as it is estimated that one million working hours are lost each year due to SAD in the U.K., according to the charity. \u201cThe common work culture \u2014 especially in London \u2014 where lunch breaks are frowned upon may be contributing to the increasing numbers of those suffering from SAD,\u201d MHRUK\u2019s co-founding trustee, Laura Davidson, stated in a press release. \u201cWe were shocked that nine percent of those participating in the MHRUK survey stated that their workplace had no natural light at all.\"\n\nThe findings of the survey, which asked 1,201 people about light in their workplace, prompted Davidson to remind employers and educational establishments about their responsibility in make sure outdoor breaks and well-lit environments are provided so as to minimize the negative effects of light deprivation on mental health. \u201cWe want to increase awareness of SAD and depression, as well as reduce the stigma attached to mental illness.\u201d\n\nDavidson also went as far as noting that even people\u2019s choice of clothing could have a beneficial effect on people\u2019s frame of mind. \u201cWhile wearing bright colours will not prevent SAD, which is caused by a lack of sunlight, there has been plenty of research linking mood and color,\u201d she explained in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that bright colors are more cheering, and therefore it\u2019s a concern that 15 percent of the men surveyed \u2026 felt it was not appropriate for a man to wear bright colours.\u201d\n\nShe also disputed the perception held by 20 percent of those surveyed that darker colors are more professional. \u201cClearly we need a culture change in the workplace.\u201d To jump start this shift in workplace mood (as well as raise awareness of depression and seasonal affective disorder) MHRUK is organizing a movement called \u2018Blooming Monday\u2019 that will encourage everyone to wear the brightest clothes they have on what is allegedly the most depressing day of the year, January 21st.\n\nSource: Mental Health Research UK.
