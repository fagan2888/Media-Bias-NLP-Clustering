BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) — Imani Boyette scored 18 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead second-seeded Texas to a come-from-behind 72-64 win over UCLA on Saturday in a Bridgeport Regional semifinal.

Brooke McCarty added 15 points for the Longhorns (31-4), who will play in their first regional final since 2003.

Monique Billings scored 20 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for UCLA, which finishes its season at 26-9. Jordin Canada also had 20 points for the third-seeded Bruins.

UCLA led by 10 points in the second quarter, five points at the half and 54-48 after three quarters.

But Texas scored the first 10 points of the fourth to take the lead for good. Texas’ Ariel Atkins made a three-point play, hitting a shot as she falling down in the lane while being fouled, to push the lead to 63-56 and the Longhorns hit their free throws down the stretch.

UCLA missed its last nine shots.

Texas will play UConn in the regional final. The top-seeded Huskies routed Mississippi State 98-38 in Saturday’s first semifinal.

The Longhorns won the game underneath, outrebounding Texas 46-40 and outscoring the Bruins 40-22 in the paint. UCLA had the early advantage in part because Texas’ two big women, the 6-foot-7 Boyette and 6-5 Kelsey Lang each picked up two first-half fouls.

UCLA used a 9-0 run to take a 17-9 lead early in the game and led by six points after a quarter.

The Longhorns used a 7-0 run to cut that deficit to 27-24 before Billings answered with a hook shot from just right of the lane.

Boyette, who averages 11 points and nine rebounds a game, scored seven first-half points, but she had just one rebound at the break, two fewer than her 5-4 teammate McCarty. She picked up her third foul 40 seconds into the second half and finished with four.
