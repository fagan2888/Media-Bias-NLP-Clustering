Did it start in the desolate sands of New Mexico? How about on the upper floors of a Manhattan office building? Maybe on some deserted island? What about New Jersey\u2019s Meadowlands or, going back even further, some dark corner office in the depths of FBI headquarters?\n\nNo, this golden age grew out of a small, tree-ringed town in Washington state. A little place, with damn fine coffee and world famous pie: Twin Peaks.\n\nWith its upcoming Blu-Ray release, \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is being repackaged for a whole new audience that missed out on its April 1990 debut. This might indicate some sort of lingering nostalgia or demand for this premium format. However, this show, influential as it is, seems almost forgotten. Who talks about David Lynch and Mark Frost\u2019s televised masterpiece these days, one of the first water-cooler shows? Almost 25 years old, this short-lived series casts a large shadow on contemporary television.\n\nMany of the defining aspects of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d can seem clich\u00e9d today: Its narrative intricacy, its darkness, its reliance on antiheroes. But that\u2019s just because we are by now so used to the show\u2019s sensibility in our televised diet. What set this show apart has so thoroughly been assimilated that talking about it is like pointing to the sky and calling it blue. But this engaging, surreal and occasionally frustrating, 30-episode series about the hunt for a prom queen\u2019s killer was ahead of its time. Many of today\u2019s modern classics owe it a debt audiences might not be aware of.\n\nFor instance, the show was a pioneer in seeding a dense mythology, complete with flash forwards, dream sequences, extra-dimensional spirits and otherworldly villains. Much like another trailblazing program, the British \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d this gave loyal watchers a sort of inside status and secret knowledge that could be analyzed and debated in small cultlike circles. This quality could be hair-pullingly frustrating, but helped immerse viewers. This aspect was wholly replicated by both Chris Carter\u2019s \u201cX-Files\u201d and Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse\u2019s \u201cLost,\u201d two shows with fan bases full of encyclopedic knowledge.\n\n\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d\u2019 overarching story lines and multi-episode narratives echo in \u201cThe Killing\u201d and \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d The search for Laura Palmer\u2019s killer could be the hunt for Rosie Larsen\u2019s. The two are even killed in the same setting: the Pacific Northwest. Instead of the typical one-and-done detective story, a staple of a \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d contemporary, \u201cMurder She Wrote,\u201d the mystery wore on, eventually webbing to encompass more threads than the sleuth could possibly handle.\n\n\u201cMad Men\u2019s\u201d cast of double-life-leading ad executives also has origins in \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d Don Draper\u2019s upstanding and conformist exterior is contrasted with his tortured, reckless inner self. Much like high school golden girl Laura Palmer, who secretly prostituted herself for vast quantities of cocaine, outside and inside do not match.\n\nOn \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d Walter White\u2019s transformation from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to drug kingpin mimics the extra-dimensional BOB, a metaphor for the darkness inside us all, from \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d who sneaks in and slowly corrupts formerly upstanding members of the town. Loving Leland Palmer, Laura\u2019s father, becomes corrupted to the point where he commits the ultimate crime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Mad Men\" and \"Breaking Bad\" wouldn't exist without David Lynch and Mark Frost's dark, strange, intricate series", "author": "James Orbesen", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Mad Men\" and \"Breaking Bad\" wouldn't exist without David Lynch and Mark Frost's dark, strange, intricate series", "title": "How \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d shaped the entire golden age of TV", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/22/how_twin_peaks_shaped_the_entire_golden_age_of_tv/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/twin_peaks2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Mad Men\" and \"Breaking Bad\" wouldn't exist without David Lynch and Mark Frost's dark, strange, intricate series", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/twin_peaks2.jpg", "title": "How \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d shaped the entire golden age of TV", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d shaped the entire golden age of TV", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Breaking Bad, David Lynch, Editor's Picks, golden age of tv, Mad Men, TV, Twin Peaks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc375\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Breaking Bad, David Lynch, Editor's Picks, golden age of tv, Mad Men, TV, Twin Peaks, Entertainment NewsIf we do indeed live in a golden age of TV, when exactly did this age begin?\nMany of the defining aspects of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d can seem clich\u00e9d today: Its narrative intricacy, its darkness, its reliance on antiheroes.\nWith its upcoming Blu-Ray release, \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is being repackaged for a whole new audience that missed out on its April 1990 debut.\nA little place, with damn fine coffee and world famous pie: Twin Peaks.\n\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d\u2019 overarching story lines and multi-episode narratives echo in \u201cThe Killing\u201d and \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d The search for Laura Palmer\u2019s killer could be the hunt for Rosie Larsen\u2019s."}
