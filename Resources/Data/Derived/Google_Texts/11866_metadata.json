Denying them the freedom to marry imposes \u201ccontinuing pain,\u201d he said, and claims that allowing same-sex marriage would harm heterosexual unions or children, or other state interests, were \u201ctotally implausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur pair of cases is rich in detail but ultimately straightforward to decide,\u201d Judge Posner wrote in the decision striking down bans in Wisconsin and Indiana.\n\n\u201cThe challenged laws discriminate against a minority defined by an immutable characteristic, and the only rationale that the states put forth with any conviction \u2014 that same-sex couples and their children don\u2019t need marriage because same-sex couples can\u2019t produce children, intended or unintended \u2014 is so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling made the Seventh Circuit the third federal appellate court to conclude that state marriage bans violate the Constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 ruling invalidating core provisions of the discriminatory federal Defense of Marriage Act. This latest victory for marriage equality was foreshadowed by some blistering questions and comments during last week\u2019s hearing in the case.\n\nIt was all the more welcome coming just a day after a federal district judge in Louisiana ruled in exactly the opposite direction \u2014 upholding that state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban. The judge\u2019s reasons were as flimsy as the arguments rejected by the Seventh Circuit panel.\n\nThe Louisiana ruling was an outlier, coming after a remarkable winning streak for marriage equality in more than 20 federal decisions and does not erase the near-consensus so far in federal courts. But it is a reminder that this fight is not over, and of the need for a nationwide ruling by the Supreme Court recognizing the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the 2013 U.S. v. Windsor case was based on a conclusion that the federal law against granting benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples violated equal protection and due process guarantees, but did not declare marriage equality a constitutional right across the nation.\n\nPetitions for Supreme Court review of pro-marriage-equality rulings from the Fourth and Tenth Circuits have been filed and are supported by both sides of the issue. There is no reason at this point for the justices to prolong the harm to same-sex couples and their families by waiting for all the remaining state battles to play out.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140904215311, "twitter": {"description": "A federal appellate court offered important reasoning behind its decision to strike down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana.", "title": "A Blunt Defense of Marriage Equality", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/a-blunt-defense-of-marriage-equality.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003093295"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/a-blunt-defense-of-marriage-equality.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003093295", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/a-blunt-defense-of-marriage-equality.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "A Blunt Defense of Marriage Equality", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 4, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-09-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Louisiana", "published": "2014-09-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Same-Sex Marriage  Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships,Indiana,Wisconsin,Supreme Court (US),Homosexuality and Bisexuality,Discrimination,Editorials,Decisions and Verdicts,Constitution (US),Louisiana", "news_keywords": "Indiana,Wisconsin,Discrimination,Editorial,Louisiana", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A federal appellate court offered important reasoning behind its decision to strike down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A federal appellate court offered important reasoning behind its decision to strike down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "org": "Supreme Court (US)", "geo": "Louisiana", "slug": "05fri2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140905115655, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/a-blunt-defense-of-marriage-equality.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A federal appellate court offered important reasoning behind its decision to strike down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana.", "title": "A Blunt Defense of Marriage Equality"}, "pdate": 20140904, "des": "Constitution (US)", "articleid": 100000003093295, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Blunt Defense of Marriage Equality", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "This latest victory for marriage equality was foreshadowed by some blistering questions and comments during last week\u2019s hearing in the case.\nAs important as the federal appeals court ruling was on Thursday declaring same-sex marriage bans in two states to be unconstitutional, the clarity and blunt reasoning behind the decision was equally momentous.\nWriting for a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Judge Richard Posner put the case for equality starkly.\nIt was all the more welcome coming just a day after a federal district judge in Louisiana ruled in exactly the opposite direction \u2014 upholding that state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban.\nPetitions for Supreme Court review of pro-marriage-equality rulings from the Fourth and Tenth Circuits have been filed and are supported by both sides of the issue."}
