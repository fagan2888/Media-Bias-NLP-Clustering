WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) — Iranian artist Parviz Tanavoli has built a successful career around the concept of nothing.

Tanavoli creates sculptures of the word “heech,” which means “nothing” in Persian. The abstract shapes he fashions using Iran’s centuries-old calligraphic nastaliq script have cemented his reputation as the father of modern Iranian art.

Tanavoli’s first solo retrospective in the U.S. opened this week at Wellesley College’s Davis Museum outside Boston and runs through June 7.

The exhibit comprises 175 pieces — including sculptures, paintings, jewelry and ceramics — from his more than five decades as a contemporary artist.

“If one wants to define my work, they cannot separate it from my heritage,” he said. “The richness of Persian culture — it has kept me busy.”

Tanavoli’s sculptures are highly sought-after. In 2008, his bronze work “The Wall” (“Oh, Persepolis”) sold for $2.84 million at Christie’s in Dubai, United Arab Emirates — a record price for a Middle Eastern artist.

Lisa Fischman, director of the Davis Museum and one of the show’s curators, said she’s excited to give Americans a closer look at Tanavoli’s works.

“We wanted to bring U.S. audiences the work of a master who has been under-shown in this country,” she said.

Some of Tanavoli’s 3-D heech sculptures echo works by Andy Warhol, Fred Lichtenstein and Jeff Koons, all of whom made the jump from the art world into mainstream American culture with their vibrant pop art.
