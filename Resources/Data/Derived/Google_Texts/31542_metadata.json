Indeed, a recent New York Times profile termed her book \u201ca primer for millennial women negotiating the path to adulthood,\u201d so we should examine her words closely when she drifts away from the youth habit of talking about her life and shifts to politics.\n\n\n\nUnder the heading \u201cWOMEN ARE WATCHING\u201d we have a picture of Dunham wrapped in a towel with a pack of birth control pills in her mouth, the caption reading \u201cThis is me after I voted in 2012.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the message unfolds in numbered reasons why our celebrity votes, and why the rest of us should, too.\n\nFirst, \u201cWhen you vote, you feel so, so good.\u201d That\u2019s the opening appeal, the personal satisfaction you get when you leave the booth.\n\nSecond, \u201cI find it incredibly, deeply satisfying that every single vote is exactly equal.\u201d She notes that while \u201cpractically everything in the world feels deeply unfair,\u201d the simple democratic vote count is a joy. (That the world feels unfair to someone rich and famous at so tender an age is another topic.)\n\nThird, \u201cThe crazy and depressing truth is that there are people running for office right now who could actually affect your life. PARTICULARLY your sex life. PARTICULARLY if you\u2019re a woman. Yup.\u201d Here we get to the political meat. Colorado Senate candidate Cory Gardner wants to give sexist bosses the power to cut off your birth-control coverage. If he wins, Dunham warns, \u201csuddenly your sex life is ruled by fear.\u201d\n\nFourth, \u201cI vote because the number of backwards, out-of-touch, downright freaking unbelievably anti-women\u2019s heath [sic] politicians out there right now makes by blood boil.\u201d Yes, she\u2019s furious at these Neanderthals, listing Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Dan Sullivan in Alaska, and Joni Ernst in Iowa. If you don\u2019t vote, they will take over and repeal Obamacare, remove birth control benefits, and kill the minimum wage.\n\nThese prospects are beyond imagining, Dunham says: \u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW HOW TO PROCESS THAT.\u201d These politicians aren\u2019t rational, and she admits that they threaten her own rationality. But she has an answer: \u201crather than go deep into a rage spiral, I vote.\u201d\n\nWe end with a call to \u201cget involved.\u201d The whole thing is a remarkable display, and it shows how puerile and desperate the war-on-women motif has become. Forget the politics of the message, and ignore the self-involvement, too\u0097just look at the style, the language, the idiom. The repetitions, the adolescent lexicon, hack metaphors, and CAPS are the mark of stupidity. We know that Dunham isn\u2019t this juvenile, and so we should attribute the style to her estimation of the intelligence of the audience.\n\nLet\u2019s make that subtext explicit: \u201cAll of you dumb girls out there, you\u2019ve got to vote! You don\u2019t care about taxes, budgets, legislation, regulations, and foreign affairs, and you probably couldn\u2019t understand them if you did, but you do care about sex, and there are evil ones who want to stop you. VOTE!\u201d\n\nImage from Wikimedia Commons", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blog devoted to sharing initial thoughts on topics, and daily ramblings, First Thoughts speaks to the latest topics in religion and today\u2019s society.", "og": {"site_name": "First Things", "description": "The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has sent out an email message about the upcoming election from Lena Dunham, creator and star of Girls, author of Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She\u2019s Learned, and representative Twenty-First-Century Young American Female.
