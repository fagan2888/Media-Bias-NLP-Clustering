No money can be exchanged and each person can only carry up to an ounce of weed at a time.\n\n\u201cWhich makes the logistics of this really tricky, but yeah I have lots of people with one ounce on their person,\u201d Mr. Dicenzo told ABC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A nonprofit in Denver, Colorado, gave away thousands of free, pre-rolled marijuana joints to the homeless and anyone else who wanted one on Christmas Eve, in an out-of-the box attempt to raise awareness about homelessness.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A nonprofit in Denver, Colorado, gave away thousands of free, pre-rolled marijuana joints to the homeless and anyone else who wanted one on Christmas Eve, in an out-of-the box attempt to raise awareness about homelessness.", "title": "Charity gives free marijuana joints to homeless in Denver on Christmas Eve", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/26/charity-gives-free-marijuana-joints-to-homeless-in/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/20/68384df3b8e13f11740f6a706700ade3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/20/68384df3b8e13f11740f6a706700ade3.jpg", "description": "A nonprofit in Denver, Colorado, gave away thousands of free, pre-rolled marijuana joints to the homeless and anyone else who wanted one on Christmas Eve, in an out-of-the box attempt to raise awarene", "card": "summary", "title": "Charity gives free marijuana joints to homeless in Denver on Christmas"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Nick Dicenzo, Denver"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019d have so much more opportunity\u2019,\u201d Mr. Dicenzo told ABC.\n\u201d \u2018Cannabis can make a difference,\u2019 is kind of what we\u2019re standing for,\u201d Mr. Dicenzo told ABC.\n\u201cWhich makes the logistics of this really tricky, but yeah I have lots of people with one ounce on their person,\u201d Mr. Dicenzo told ABC.\nA nonprofit in Denver, Colorado, gave away thousands of free, pre-rolled marijuana joints to the homeless and anyone else who wanted one on Christmas Eve, in an out-of-the box attempt to raise awareness about homelessness.\nIn addition to handing out the joints, which Mr. Dicenzo says he grew legally, volunteers passed out fliers and business cards with information on how to donate."}
