Carter: Georgians think ACA 'a mess'

Georgia Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Jason Carter said Thursday he shared in voters’ frustration with Obamacare and is hoping to see a “fix” from President Barack Obama.

“I think folks are feeling like [Obamacare] is a mess and so what I’m hoping to see from the president is some kind of fix, but right now, I think folks are really frustrated, including me,” Carter said on MSNBC’s “Thomas Roberts.”

Carter, currently a state senator and grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, also added that Georgia is at its best “when it stays away from the mess of Washington politics,” which he identified as the source of Georgia’s health care enrollment.

“One of the problems we’ve had with the current governor is they’ve been playing and getting caught up in that same Washington politics,” Carter said. “Georgia undeniably would have done a better job with the exchange than the federal government has done and just because of those Washington politics we ended up not doing it and that’s part of everyone’s frustration.”
