And as the women in the above video note, representation is extraordinarily important. Girls must see that it\u2019s not just men who can make it in these fields \u2014 from being a developer, to starting a company. Entrepreneur Barbie may not be the ideal role model, but she\u2019s at least a visible figure, starting her own vague, make-believe multi-million-dollar company.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They just had to put her in pink?
