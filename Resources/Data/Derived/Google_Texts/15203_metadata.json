The prototype Medicaid expansion lost Cook County $21 million in the first six months of operation \u2014 that\u2019s expected to balloon to $63.5 million by November 30, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nCountyCare was expected to pad the city\u2019s coffers. In 2013, state officials projected that the new system would bring in at least $28 million by November, Crain\u2019s reported. The cost of caring for the influx of Medicaid patients has busted projections partially because the newly insured are seeking pricier medical care than expected.\n\nWhile the program has already failed to meet budget projections this year, the problem is likely to get worse in 2015. Medicaid expansion patients are required to use only CountyCare medical facilities for the first year \u2014 meaning the county will end up reimbursing itself for much of its spending on CountyCare coverage.\n\nIn January, however, CountyCare patients will be allowed to access other health plans and medical providers. That could leave the expanded Medicaid program to cover patients with the most expensive health problems, along with the least ability to pay. If the public health system loses more inexpensive patients next year, the budget crunch will get even worse.\n\nDr. John Jay Shannon, promoted to the top position at the Cook County Health and Hospitals System just weeks ago, is charged with finding $67 million in savings from the program by November. If he\u2019s unable to, Cook County taxpayers will have to pony up to pay for the program.\n\nShannon told Crain\u2019s that the county had \u201cunrealistic expectations\u201d that CountyCare would be \u201csome kind of profit center\u201d for the public health system. But Cook County officials were far from alone in thinking the federal funding would boost.\n\nAdvocates of the Medicaid expansion nationwide regularly castigate states that have decided against expanding the welfare program. The White House recently released a report attempting to shame states for refusing $88 billion in \u201cfree\u201d federal taxpayer funding to expand Medicaid \u2014 but Cook County\u2019s experience suggests states may not be able to count on the programs remaining free.
