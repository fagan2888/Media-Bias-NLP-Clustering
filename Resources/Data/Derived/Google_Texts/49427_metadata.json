A Texas production that will make you hate the movie Frozen . A Democrat taking aim at her opponent\u2019s wheelchair. These are our big (bad) winners.\n\nIt might not be awards season, but we do have a midterm election fast approaching, one in which 60 percent of us who can vote will elect not to do so. That means the moldy cake of our political process is getting an extra layer of frosting in the form of a torrent of political ads, designed to drag our vote, screaming, from the D column to the R, or vice versa. We here at The Daily Beast are defying the entertainment world and holding our own awards show in November, and we\u2019ve got an award for pretty much every genre of candidate-bashing commercial.\n\nTHE AWARDS\n\nGoofiest\n\nThis year\u2019s award is shared between Mitch McConnell and Mitch McConnell. The first is \u201cMcConnell Working for Kentuckians,\u201d an awkward compilation of the Senate minority leader in action\u2014that is, turning toward the camera and meekly smiling. Cue amazing viral creations and a trend, #mcconnelling.\n\nThe second is a kind of metacommercial, a commentary on political ads that is surprisingly sharp and ultimately goofy, as McConnell ends up in a pack of bloodhounds, giggling that he supports this message.\n\nLowest Blow\n\nIf Wendy Davis rose to stardom in the Democratic Party with her filibuster of an anti-abortion bill on the floor of the Texas Senate, her run for governor of that state is her crashing back to earth. Looking to make up some ground in the race, she ran an ad targeting the perceived hypocrisy of her opponent, Greg Abbott. Unfortunately, his disability\u2014he is wheelchair-bound\u2014was also in her crosshairs.\n\nStrangest\n\nThis one, attacking Georgia Democrat John Barrow, is probably touching on a real issue. You\u2019ll hear something about frivolous spending and Washington and John Barrow. But if you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ll probably spend most of the clip wondering if this person realizes there\u2019s a monkey on her shoulder. On TV. \u201cOutrageous\u201d is an apt title.\n\nThe Christopher Knight Award for Worst Production Value\n\nIf you delve down into our fair nation\u2019s more parochial races, you\u2019re bound to find some ads that look like they were shot on a flip phone with graphics out of Microsoft Paint. This year\u2019s winner comes from the comparative big time\u2014it\u2019s an attack ad from Michigan\u2019s Republican Party on U.S. Rep. Gary Peters. As bad as the animation of a shark vomiting up money is, the \u201cLoan Sharknado\u201d theme deserves the highest praise.\n\nCheesiest\n\nSome say a great politician is a guy or gal you\u2019d like to have a beer with. Based on this commercial, Tom Cotton is drinking alone. He seems like a nice enough guy, and Mark Pryor really has said some nasty things about him during the Arkansas Senate campaign, but come on, man!\n\nThe Willie Horton Award\n\nAwarded to the ad that mongers fear most effectively through anecdotes about criminal activity, the 2014 Horton Award goes to Democratic Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska. Though it forgoes the subtle racism of the 1988 Bush spot, it does blame Dan Sullivan, Begich\u2019s opponent, for a clerical error made before he was attorney general. A runner-up for the next award in our list, to be sure.\n\nMost Misleading\n\nThis award is fought over tooth-and-nail each year by political consultants from sea to shining sea. This year\u2019s winner comes from Florida Gov. Rick Scott and says 300,000 Floridians lost their health care under Obamacare, a law Scott\u2019s opponent, Charlie Crist, supports. That is not exactly true, as the Miami Herald explains.\n\nMost Brazenly False\n\nAnother widely coveted prize\u2014the best actor or actress of our little show\u2014is split this year between two ambitiously deceitful ads.\n\nFirst there\u2019s Republican Evan Jenkins, who is challenging Democrat Nick Rahall for his House seat. Jenkins claims Rahall voted for a bill to implement a carbon tax that caused West Virginians\u2019 electricity bills to skyrocket, but no such tax was ever implemented. He also says Rahall made millions off that \u201ccoal-killing\u201d legislation, which is patently false.\n\nSharing the prize is \u201cJulie\u2019s Story,\u201d an ad from the Koch-funded group Americans for Prosperity. In the clip, Julie claims she lost her doctor and her premiums became unaffordable as a result of Obamacare. In reality, she found a plan that allowed her to keep her doctor, and her premiums were cut in half. Not a lot of nuance there.\n\nThe Lifetime Achievement Award", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jackholmes0"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201411031045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "A giggling Mitch McConnell.
