We had two children die under our roof.\u201d\n\nSo you can hardly blame Stinchfield, now director of infection prevention and control and an infectious disease pediatric nurse practitioner at the health system, for becoming extremely passionate when it comes to talking about vaccination and the measles outbreak that is garnering so much attention in the mainstream press and social media.\n\n\u201cI have seen children die of vaccine-preventable disease,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve held parents in my arms who wondered why they didn\u2019t vaccinate their child, or why their provider didn\u2019t tell them they were behind on their vaccination schedule.\u201d\n\nNow, I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that the current uptick in measles \u2014 102 cases in 14 states between Jan. 1 and Jan. 30, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 will reach epidemic proportions, but the rapid spread of any infectious disease is certainly cause for concern and reason for hospital leaders and clinicians to figure out what they should be doing differently.\n\nStinchfield says providers need to \u201cown some of the problem,\u201d suggesting that they\u2019ve been too passive in how they communicate with parents.\n\n\u201cWe ask parents, \u2018How do you feel about vaccines?\u2019 That gives them a way out. You couldn\u2019t imagine a cardiologist saying, \u2018How do you feel about repairing that hole in your child\u2019s heart?\u2019 We have to change so that the conversation is more presumptive. \u2018You are in the clinic because you want the best health for your child and the best health starts with a vaccine.\u2019 If you do that, the acceptance and trust goes way up.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, she says, clinicians need to improve their listening skills and understand where parents are coming from \u2014 perhaps they had a bad reaction to a vaccine, or they have religious objections. Improving those skills will go a long way toward building trust.\n\nThe CDC offers several resources aimed at helping clinicians better communicate and engage with parents and children.\n\n\u201cOne of the mantras we have is that every visit is a vaccine visit,\u201d Stinchfield adds. Clinicians at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota will mend the sprained ankle, but also use that visit as an opportunity to go over the child\u2019s vaccine schedule with the parents. Under Stinchfield\u2019s leadership, the health system several years ago launched the Children's Hospitals and Clinics Immunization Project, an outreach effort that goes into the community to educate parents about the benefits of vaccinations.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to promote better health in our communities,\u201d Stinchfield says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Instead of passive language and conversations with parents, clinicians should be more proactive in detailing the health benefits of immunization.", "csrf-token": "zN9ZdpamiWOsqbPC7lfcF3h6T1zPSFJE++pmhUJJZGw=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/Measles_190x127.jpeg?1448315759", "description": "Instead of passive language in conversations with parents, clinicians should be more proactive in detailing the health benefits of immunization.", "card": "summary", "title": "Providers Can Change the Conversation on Measles, Vaccination"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/Measles_190x127.jpeg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "Instead of passive language in conversations with parents, clinicians should be more proactive in detailing the health benefits of immunization.", "title": "Providers Can Change the Conversation on Measles, Vaccination"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "measles, infection prevention, immunization, vaccination, measles vaccine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4b2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOne of the mantras we have is that every visit is a vaccine visit,\u201d Stinchfield adds.\nPatsy Stinchfield remembers vividly the measles outbreak of 1990 when more than 500 people were infected in Minnesota alone.\nStinchfield says providers need to \u201cown some of the problem,\u201d suggesting that they\u2019ve been too passive in how they communicate with parents.\nThe CDC offers several resources aimed at helping clinicians better communicate and engage with parents and children.\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to promote better health in our communities,\u201d Stinchfield says."}
