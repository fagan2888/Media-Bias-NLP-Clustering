In addition to next year\u2019s request, the Pentagon will roll out the latest Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), the agency\u2019s five-year fiscal blueprint.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know thus far:\n\nWar funding\n\nIn addition to $524 billion in base spending, the Pentagon is asking for another $59 billion for its Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account, commonly known as the war fund. Carter has signaled that the amount, the bare minimum set by the two-year budget agreement hammered out by the White and Congress, could increase.\n\nCapitol Hill defense hawks have already said they will seek potentially tens of billions more for the account, setting up a clash with fiscal conservatives and creating a new headache for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), who wants to present a unified GOP front in a presidential election year.\n\nRussia\n\nThe Pentagon is quadrupling the amount of money it will spend on the U.S. military presence in Europe, setting aside $3.4 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative, which covers training and gear for the U.S. and its European allies, and is aimed directly at countering Russian aggression in the region, especially in Ukraine.\n\nRelated: How to Blast Billions from the DOD Budget\n\nThe boost \u201cis the most important new item\u201d in the budget, according to Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute.\n\nThe surge means 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops will continually rotate throughout NATO countries, so as not to violate the coalition\u2019s charter that prohibits a permanent military presence, he said.\n\nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter\n\nThe fiscal 2017 roadmap is a mixed bag for the F-35. The U.S. Air Force plans to cut down the number of fighters it plans to order from 48 to 43, according to Defense News.\n\nRelated: Why the Pentagon Is Gunning for the Navy\u2019s $23 Billion Combat Ship\n\nWhile still a substantial buy, the reduction puts off the day when the annual production line for the service\u2019s version of the fifth-generation plane becomes cost effective and doesn\u2019t cost more to run than the lines for the Cold War-era jets it was meant to replace, said Thompson.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for a program that has already cost taxpayers about $400 billion to develop, making it the most expensive weapons effort in U.S. history.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy and the Marine Corps will get 13 more of the JSF variants, with a split of 10 and 3, respectively.\n\nIn terms of net impact to the program \u201cit\u2019s fairly modest,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nLittoral Combat Ship\n\nObservers wondered what would happen to the Navy\u2019s $37 billion Littoral Combat Ship effort after Carter fired off a blunt memo to the secretary of the Navy in December basically demanding the service cut its purchase from 52 to 40 ships and cease production of one of the ship\u2019s two designs.\n\nBloomberg reported that push has failed because the service found $300 to $400 million in savings elsewhere. The fiscal 2017 budget submission will include funding for two vessels, one each from manufacturers Lockheed Martin and Austal USA.\n\nRelated: With $8.5 Trillion Unaccounted for, Why Should Congress Increase the Defense Budget?\n\nISIS\n\nPerhaps bowing to bipartisan congressional pressure from Capitol Hill, the Obama administration will seek a major boost in funding for the fight against ISIS with a $7.5 billion request. That doubles the amount from fiscal 2016.\n\nThe proposed budget is a bit of the 800 billion roll of the dice for Carter. President Obama leaves office next year and the conventional wisdom is that he won\u2019t be kept on by a new administration, Democrat or Republican.\n\n\u201cAny guidance Secretary Carter issues that isn\u2019t well received can simply be waited out by the military, Thompson said.\n\nAnd the FYDP \u201cis the least consequential [one] of the Obama years because we are at the end,\u201d he added, noting that in 16 months there will be a new president and a new Pentagon chief. \u201cWho knows how priorities might change?\u2019\n\nThompson said the biggest \u201cquestion mark\u201d about the five-year plan is what it says about the Air Force\u2019s modernization efforts, which experts recently warned could be so expensive that crippling cuts will need to be made elsewhere in the defense budget.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With its fiscal 2017 budget, the Pentagon is looking to spend more taxpayer dollars to", "title": "$583 Billion Defense Budget Covers Russia, China, and ISIS with New Weapons", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/583-Billion-Defense-Budget-Covers-Russia-China-and-ISIS-New-Weapons", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-09-14T195107Z_1_CBRE88D1J5C00_RTROPTP_2_US-PENTAGON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/583-Billion-Defense-Budget-Covers-Russia-China-and-ISIS-New-Weapons", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-09-14T195107Z_1_CBRE88D1J5C00_RTROPTP_2_US-PENTAGON.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With its fiscal 2017 budget, the Pentagon is looking to spend more taxpayer dollars to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4563\"", "article_summary": "Related: With $8.5 Trillion Unaccounted for, Why Should Congress Increase the Defense Budget?\nThe Defense Department released a steady stream of details about how it plans to spends millions of dollars on programs and weapons in its roughly $583 billion budget request for fiscal 2017.\nISISPerhaps bowing to bipartisan congressional pressure from Capitol Hill, the Obama administration will seek a major boost in funding for the fight against ISIS with a $7.5 billion request.\n\u201cAny guidance Secretary Carter issues that isn\u2019t well received can simply be waited out by the military, Thompson said.\nIn addition to next year\u2019s request, the Pentagon will roll out the latest Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), the agency\u2019s five-year fiscal blueprint."}
