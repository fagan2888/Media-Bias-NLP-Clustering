Tech\u2013savvy taxpayers who have honed their online skills at HealthCare.dud can get Internet advice.There the ill\u2013informed will find handy tips on the ways injecting marinade differs from an enema, the reason playing \u201cfind the giblets\u201d should be done before cooking, why putting stuffing inside the carcass may qualify you for a new salmonella study and how the easiest way to take the turkey out of the oven is to reverse the procedure you used to put the bird in the oven.Last year after fielding calls at the punishing rate of eight per hour the exhausted Tryptophan Team made its way home.Before you start getting all misty\u2013eyed thinking about the turkey responder\u2019s sacrifice, consider this.The Aztecs first domesticated turkeys in 800 BC, long before Big Government was a gleam in FDR\u2019s eye. In a reversal of the usual procedure, the Aztecs used turkeys to provide decoration and humans for sacrifice, but evidently the relationship soured because in 1100 AD Anasazi Indians added turkey to the menu.America chewed happily along until about 1981 when the deteriorating state of the nation\u2019s schools combined with the breakup of the family to produce consumers who instead of seeing dinner when they looked at a turkey, beheld a mystery wrapped in skin you weren\u2019t supposed to eat.There were two responses to this culinary dilemma. The first from the USDA (see above) that grew from a single farmer holding a hand\u2013crank telephone into the six\u2013person dynamo it is today. And the second from Butterball and its \u201cTurkey Talk-line.\u201dThe Turkey Talk\u2013line began with six operators and now boasts over 50 experts. Each year the operators talk turkey with over 100,000 callers. Weekday hours are from 9 until 9 and 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. on weekends. As Thanksgiving approaches and the confusion ramps up, the Talk\u2013line hours expand until 11 p.m. On Thanksgiving Day itself, Butterball answers cries for help from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m.The company even has special male operators for men too embarrassed to discuss woman\u2019s work with an actual woman.A comparison between the two outreach efforts reveals once again the private sector is more responsive than sluggish Uncle Sam, although I imagine the operating budget for both is identical. Even better this Butterball turkey telecommunications network \u2014 wait for it \u2014 doesn\u2019t cost taxpayers one thin dime!There is simply no comparison between advice experiences. Calling Butterball can be an impromptu experience, while getting the USDA on the line is like scheduling an appointment with an Obamacare doctor. The one you didn\u2019t want to keep.And if talking to the USDA bureaucrat is anything like a conversation with a census taker, they\u2019ll be asking you questions before answering yours.1. What\u2019s the pay differential between the CEO and the cashier who rang your turkey up?2. Is your turkey kosher, Religion\u2013of\u2013Peace halal, industrial\u2013cruelty or free\u2013range?3. Have you considered donating your meal to a Syrian refugee?4. How many food groups will you be serving?5. How many racial groups will you be serving?6. Do you eat the white meat first or last?7. Do you intend to say grace over the meal? If so, is everyone required to participate?8. Do you plan to allow guests to use salt? Butter? Trans\u2013fats?Still I\u2019m certain that in the avalanche of calls to Butterball and the trickle of inquiries to the USDA, no one is asking the most pertinent question: Why is the federal government spending tax dollars to give advice on how to cook a turkey?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "thanksgiving, turkey, government", "pubdate": "2015-11-27T12:45:41", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Why is the federal government spending tax dollars to give advice on how to cook a turkey?", "title": "Taxes Hard at Work \u2014 Paying Advisers for Turkey Q&A", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/MichaelShannon/thanksgiving-turkey-government/2015/11/27/id/703708/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=c0f500cf-e45c-45d4-91f0-1ac0404b3afa&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/MichaelShannon/thanksgiving-turkey-government/2015/11/27/id/703708/", "title": "Taxes Hard at Work \u2014 Paying Advisers for Turkey Q&A", "description": "Why is the federal government spending tax dollars to give advice on how to cook a turkey?", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1448628341, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "thanksgiving, turkey, government", "article": {"section": "MichaelShannon", "published_time": "2015-11-27T12:45:41"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/MichaelShannon/thanksgiving-turkey-government/2015/11/27/id/703708/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Why is the federal government spending tax dollars to give advice on how to cook a turkey?"}, "article_summary": "On Thanksgiving Day six federal employees were sitting by the phone like the Maytag man, hoping for the United States Dept.\nAnd the second from Butterball and its \u201cTurkey Talk-line.\u201dThe Turkey Talk\u2013line began with six operators and now boasts over 50 experts.\nEven better this Butterball turkey telecommunications network \u2014 wait for it \u2014 doesn\u2019t cost taxpayers one thin dime!There is simply no comparison between advice experiences.\nof Agriculture to spring into action and aid \u201cpeople who need help preparing their Thanksgiving dinner.\u201dAnd on line No.\nEach year the operators talk turkey with over 100,000 callers."}
