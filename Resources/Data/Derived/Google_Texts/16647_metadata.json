Connecticut plays Florida on Saturday, April 5, 2014. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) The Associated Press\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Jim Calhoun is watching the Connecticut Huskies at this Final Four, not coaching them. That's a little bit of a problem.\n\n\"My wife said, 'You don't cheer during games,'\" Calhoun said on the eve of Connecticut's national semifinal against Florida. \"I said, 'I'm not a cheerleader. I'm a coach.'\"\n\nCalhoun won three national titles in four trips to the Final Four, the last coming in 2011. He retired before the start of the 2012-13 season and is now a special assistant to athletic director Warde Manual.\n\nHe won't be on the bench \u2014 that job belongs to Kevin Ollie now \u2014 but it won't make much difference to Calhoun's insides.\n\n\"Do I get nervous before games? My stomach will be flopping,\" Calhoun said. \"Before the game, somewhere around 4 o'clock, I'll get that coach's look, which means miserable, grumpy, whatever word you want.\"\n\nCalhoun seemed to enjoy his new role, though, stopping for interviews several times and never being at a loss for words. He described his hands as \"soaking wet\" during the regional final victory against Michigan State last weekend.\n\n\"A good line I heard one time is by Bill Parcells,\" Calhoun said. \"I see too much, meaning I can see the play coming, I can see the sub coming. I see too much sometimes.\"\n\n\u2014 Schuyler Dixon \u2014 https://twitter.com/apschuyler\n\n___\n\nNCAA Finals Watch follows the Final Four games and all the activities surrounding the event as seen by journalists from The Associated Press in North Texas \u2014 from the big stadium in Arlington where the games will be played to downtown Dallas.
