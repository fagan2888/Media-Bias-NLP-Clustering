And how it shouldn\u2019t be practiced any more.\n\nObama wanted to have a news conference to say farewell to his friend and partner in Common Core, Education Secretary Arne Duncan.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBut Arne exited the stage pretty quickly, clearing it for Obama to tap dance around questions from reporters. At one point, even the master of the teleprompter lost his place. Midway through a rambling answer to a question about Syria, Obama paused and asked, \u201cSo what was the question again?\u201d\n\nThe real question should be: Does President Obama even listen to his own answers?\n\nFor example, he came out strongly against ObamaCare while discussing gun control. \u201cI mean, normally, politicians are responsive to the views of the electorate,\u201d Obama commented. Well, not on ObamaCare. Going all the way back to 2010, it\u2019s always been unpopular with voters, as the handy chart at RCP indicates. Maybe it\u2019s time for politicians, specifically the president, to respond to the electorate.\n\nThe president also stumbled when he tried to help Russian President Vladimir Putin understand the risks of intervening in Syria.\n\n\u201cI would have hoped that we would have learned that from Afghanistan and Iraq, where we have devoted enormous time and effort and resources with the very best people and have given the Afghan people and the Iraqi people an opportunity for democracy,\u201d Obama noted.\n\nWell, the problem with our Middle East policy isn\u2019t that we wasted \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cresources.\u201d We have plenty of both. The problem is Washington\u2019s last two presidents wasted lives \u2014 so many of our best people died in Afghanistan and Iraq, and yet we have little to show for it.\n\nIt\u2019s our policies, designed and implemented by politicians of both parties, including Obama, that haven\u2019t worked. No wonder the polls show voters are hungry for a change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama called a news conference to, supposedly, say farewell to his friend and partner in Common Core, Arne Duncan.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "President Barack Obama called a news conference to, supposedly, say farewell to his friend and partner in Common Core, Arne Duncan.", "title": "Obama Showing Why Outsiders Are Thriving in 2015", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Obama-Newser-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/05/obama-showing-outsiders-thriving-2015/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama called a news conference to, supposedly, say farewell to his friend and partner in Common Core, Arne Duncan.", "creator": "@RichardBTucker", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Obama-Newser-Getty.jpg", "title": "Obama Showing Why Outsiders Are Thriving in 2015", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-10-05T08:22:17-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1852\"", "article_summary": "Midway through a rambling answer to a question about Syria, Obama paused and asked, \u201cSo what was the question again?\u201dThe real question should be: Does President Obama even listen to his own answers?\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn this year of the political outsider, the ultimate political insider \u2014 President Barack Obama \u2014 is reminding us how politics has always been practiced.\nObama wanted to have a news conference to say farewell to his friend and partner in Common Core, Education Secretary Arne Duncan.\nIt\u2019s our policies, designed and implemented by politicians of both parties, including Obama, that haven\u2019t worked.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut Arne exited the stage pretty quickly, clearing it for Obama to tap dance around questions from reporters."}
