Melanoma tumors, in particular, \u201chave gotten some of the best results\u201d with these drugs, Black said. They also cause fewer side effects than more traditional chemotherapy. Carter already has been given one intravenous injection of the drug.\n\nFive years ago, the prognosis for someone with advanced melanoma in the brain and liver would have been very poor, surgical oncologist Jeffrey Gershenwald, medical director of the Melanoma and Skin Center at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told the New York Times. But, he said, \u201cclearly the advances in the last four years are tremendous, so we\u2019re offering new hope to patients like President Carter.\u201d\n\nCarter also is being treated with targeted radiation therapy for his brain tumors, which aims precisely focused radiation beams at the tumor site and avoids radiation of the entire brain, which can damage healthy tissue, Black said. Carter will undergo four radiation treatments at three-week intervals.\n\nMelanoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that give skin its pigment, but as it advances, it typically spreads via the blood to lungs, liver and brain. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and melanoma is its deadliest form. About 9,700 Americans will die from it this year.\n\nThe 39th president said he had been monitoring elections in Guyana in May when he began to feel unwell. He returned to Atlanta and his cancer was discovered during a physical exam. In August, following a promotional tour for his latest book, A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety, he underwent surgery to remove about 10 percent of his liver.\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\nWhen a scan also revealed the brain tumors, Carter initially thought he had \u201cjust a few weeks left.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI was surprisingly at ease. I\u2019ve had a wonderful life, I\u2019ve had thousands of friends, and I\u2019ve had an exciting and adventurous and gratifying existence.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with AARP in June, Carter was similarly sanguine when asked about the future: \u201cI know that there\u2019s going to come a time in the near future when I can\u2019t be so vigorous and travel around the world. So we\u2019re prepared for that \u2014 and we\u2019re obviously prepared, I\u2019d say in a religious way and psychological way, for inevitable death.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Jessica McGowan/Getty Images\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Former president Jimmy Carter, who announced Thursday he has melanoma that had spread to his liver and brain, is being treated with two cutting-edge therapies that offer new hope to the 76,000 Americans diagnosed annually with this type of cancer.
