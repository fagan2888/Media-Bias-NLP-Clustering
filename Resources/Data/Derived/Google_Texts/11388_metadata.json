The two-and-a-half-year conflict is estimated to have killed more than 100,000 people.\n\nThousands of migrants and refugees try to reach Italy's southern shores in summer, when Mediterranean waters are calm enough for smaller boats to make the crossing, usually from Libya or Tunisia.\n\nThough most come from sub-Saharan Africa, this year many are fleeing the Syrian civil war or political turmoil in Egypt and other parts of North Africa.\n\nMany are drawn by hopes of finding work in Europe and often do not remain in Italy.\n\nIllegal migrants intercepted by Italian authorities are taken to state-run immigration centers. Some leave the often lightly guarded buildings to seek work, and those who remain and cannot prove that they are political refugees can be sent home.\n\n(Reporting by Gavin Jones; editing by Mike Collett-White)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of Syrian refugees have been rescued in rough seas and brought to Italy's southern coast in the last 24 hours, the Italian coastguard said on Saturday.", "title": "Hundreds of fleeing Syrian refugees reach Italian coast", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, SYRIA, CRISIS, ITALY", "sailthru.title": "Hundreds of fleeing Syrian refugees reach Italian coast", "keywords": "US,SYRIA,CRISIS,ITALY,Syria,Asylum / Immigration / Refugees,Aid Relief / Humanitarian Agencies,Africa,Western Europe,Europe,Egypt,European Union,Italy,Military Conflicts,Middle East", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;SYRIA;CRISIS;ITALY;Syria;Asylum / Immigration / Refugees;Aid Relief / Humanitarian Agencies;Africa;Western Europe;Europe;Egypt;European Union;Italy;Military Conflicts;Middle East", "WT.cg_n": "World", "sailthru.description": "Hundreds of Syrian refugees have been rescued in rough seas and brought to Italy's southern coast in the last 24 hours, the Italian coastguard said on Saturday.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "sailthru.date": "2013-09-14T13:35:31+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;newsMaps;iraqNews;unitedNations;ford;italy;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Cargill;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;echoActivityStream;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;syria;CFA;trending-hp;samsung;europe;middle-east;newsproHome;cfaglobal;merrilledge;greenpeace;fedex_neg;Intel", "REVISION_DATE": "Sat Sep 14 13:35:31 UTC 2013", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Hundreds+of+fleeing+Syrian+refugees+reach+Italian+coast", "DCSext.ContentID": "USBRE98D06Q20130914", "WT.cg_s": "World", "description": "Hundreds of Syrian refugees have been rescued in rough seas and brought to Italy's southern coast in the last 24 hours, the Italian coastguard said on Saturday.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-worldNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Hundreds of Syrian refugees have been rescued in rough seas and brought to Italy's southern coast in the last 24 hours, the Italian coastguard said on Saturday.", "title": "Hundreds of fleeing Syrian refugees reach Italian coast", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-italy-idUSBRE98D06Q20130914", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,SYRIA,CRISIS,ITALY,Syria,Asylum / Immigration / Refugees,Aid Relief / Humanitarian Agencies,Africa,Western Europe,Europe,Egypt,European Union,Italy,Military Conflicts,Middle East", "published_time": "2013-09-14T13:35:31+0000", "modified_time": "2013-09-14T13:35:31+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "DCSext.ContentID_worldNews": "USBRE98D06Q20130914", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f34\"", "article_summary": "ROME Hundreds of Syrian refugees have been rescued in rough seas and brought to Italy's southern coast in the last 24 hours, the Italian coastguard said on Saturday.\nThe number of Syrian refugees reaching Italy has increased steadily in recent months and the United Nations estimates that 3,300 have arrived since the start of August.\nThough most come from sub-Saharan Africa, this year many are fleeing the Syrian civil war or political turmoil in Egypt and other parts of North Africa.\nOne boat carrying 171 refugees was in difficulty and gradually sinking when it was rescued about 25 miles off Calabria, the coastguard said.\nAll the 359 refugees rescued off Syracuse in Sicily and the 171 rescued off Calabria appeared to be from Syria, the Italian authorities said, while the nationality of those rescued off Lampedusa was not available."}
