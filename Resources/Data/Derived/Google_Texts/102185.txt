Two weeks after the city of Portland gave Uber and Lyft the green light to operate during a 120-day trial period, the ride-hailing companies are now allowed to pick up fares from Portland International Airport.

From USA Today:

The Port of Portland approved the transportation network companies’ permits on April 8, airport officials said. But Uber and Lyft had to wait 30 days before they could pick up fares at the airport. In the meantime, drivers for the ride hailing companies could only drop off fares at PDX.

The 30-day waiting period expired on Friday at 12:01 a.m.

Like traditional taxis, the Port of Portland charges Uber and Lyft $2.00 each time they drop off, or pick up at the airport.

With Uber and Lyft operating at the airport, there are no taxi strongholds left and every rider in Portland has the option of choosing taxis or ride-hailing companies wherever they need a ride.
