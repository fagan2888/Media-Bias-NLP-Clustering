Last summer, another car flew through his garage, and Dubray said both times the main part of his house was left untouched.\n\n\"I'm fortunate they didn't do any more damage than just the fence, you know?\" said Dubray. \"It was a shock, but like I said, five and a half months ago, it happened to my garage. They ran into my garage.\"\n\nDubray said he plans on shopping with his 10- and 12-year-old grandchildren Friday, but the fence is still fresh in his mind.\n\n\"Yea, I'll go ahead and fix it. It's not that much damage,\" Dubray said. \"I gotta get everything out of the road here.\"\n\nThe extent of the officer's injuries were not released, but Sgt. J. M. Paris said the officer was conscious and alert and is expected to be OK.\n\nMiles made his first court appearance Friday afternoon. He's charged with DUI, causing damage to a person or property and not having a driver's license.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
