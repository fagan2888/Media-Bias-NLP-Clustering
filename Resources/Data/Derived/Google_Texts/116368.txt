Colorado wildlife officials are asking for help documenting what's happening to the habitat of animals, insects and flowers across the state.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife is participating in an international program to find out if animals and insects are migrating to different areas because of warmer weather, and if their seasons are changing.

The agency is asking hikers and campers to take pictures with their smartphones and post their findings to iNaturalist.org.

The crowdsourcing effort encompasses other parts of the United States and the world.
