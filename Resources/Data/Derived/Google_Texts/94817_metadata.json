Here are some of their proposals:\n\nAgencies need to find ways to invest more in training and development opportunities for both employees and management, and maximize the return on that investment by identifying more cost-effective options, including better use of technology and greater cross-agency collaboration.\n\nAgencies should continue to reduce costs by sharing services and establishing other collaborative, cross-agency methods for improving how missions are achieved.\n\nSenior managers need to take the lead and be held accountable for reversing the significant decline in employee morale. Leaders at all levels can benefit from studying those agencies that managed to improve employee satisfaction and commitment in 2013 despite facing the same reduced funding, increased workloads and sequestration-related problems as those that fared poorly.\n\nEven in tough times, supervisors and managers can make a positive difference by focusing on effective communication with their employees, particularly by providing realistic and constructive performance feedback that highlights opportunities for growth.\n\nCutbacks in monetary recognition for superior employee performance can be counterbalanced to some degree by greater use of nonmonetary incentives or rewards, including support for employees interested in developmental details or job rotations.\n\nFinally, the CHCOs acknowledged that they need to work together to strengthen and rebuild the capabilities of the HR workforce and to develop an effective strategy to change outdated or ineffective federal HR systems and structures, including those that will require a change in civil service law. At the same time, they placed particular emphasis on making full use of the hiring flexibilities that are now available.\n\nPlease share your thoughts on the state of the federal workforce and workplace, and what can and should be done to improve either or both.
