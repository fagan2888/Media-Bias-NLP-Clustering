Kynect offered five plans last year, but one popular provider \u2014 the Kentucky Health Cooperative \u2014 is no longer available.\n\nAs before, the plans vary widely in cost. To gauge what\u2019s available this year, we ran the numbers for a single woman who lives in Louisville and earns $3,000 a month. Here\u2019s a look at what will be offered through Kynect.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health insurance plans are separated into four categories: bronze, silver, gold or platinum. The plan categories affect the total amount patients will likely spend for health coverage during the year. The percentages the plans will spend, on average, are 60 percent (bronze), 70 percent (silver), 80 percent (gold), and 90 percent (platinum).\n\nThe cost and availability of plans varies depending on where a person lives. But for a single woman in Louisville earning $3,000, these plans came up.\n\nThe bronze plans had cheaper premiums but the deductibles are costly.\n\nAnthem offers a bronze plan with a monthly premium of $174.74 and a $5,000 deductible. The co-pay for a visit with a primary care physician would be $50. Emergency room visits would be $200 after the deductible.\n\nCareSource\u2019s \u201cJust4Me\u201d bronze plan has a monthly premium of $138.26 and a deductible of $6,650. Visits to a primary care physician will cost $40 and a visit to a specialist is $80.\n\nThe silver plan is where Kynect officials say people will get the most out of cost-sharing reductions. An analysis by Kaiser Family Foundation shows that about 15 percent of Kentuckians are eligible for a subsidy to to help pay for the cost of health insurance.\n\nBaptist Health offers various silver plans. One of them has a premium of $189.62 and a $4,500 deductible. A patient\u2019s co-pay for a primary care visit will be $20, while seeing a specialist is double that.\n\nUnited Healthcare has silver plans ranging in premium price from $249.83 to $270.31 \u2014and deductibles of $2,000 to $4,500.\n\nAetna offers one silver plan. It\u2019s $253.12 a month with a $3,900 deductible. Visits to a primary care doctor are $10 under the plan.\n\nWellCare also only offers one plan under the gold tier level. It costs $294.83 with a $1,500 deductible. A doctor\u2019s visit is $20 and a visit to a specialists is $35.\n\nHumana is the only insurer offering platinum plans statewide. There are two options costing $268 and $299. The deductible for both is $500.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We ran the numbers for a single person earning $3,000 a month will find; here's a look at what will be offered through Kynect.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "We ran the numbers for a single person earning $3,000 a month will find; here's a look at what will be offered through Kynect.", "title": "An Early Look At Plans Offered Through Kynect", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1171, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health3-e1441759253968.jpg", "height": 398}, "updated_time": "2015-10-19T07:06:28-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/early-look-plans-offered-kynect/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We ran the numbers for a single person earning $3,000 a month will find; here's a look at what will be offered through Kynect.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health3-e1441759253968.jpg", "title": "An Early Look At Plans Offered Through Kynect", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-10-16T16:48:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T07:06:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17b9\"", "article_summary": "The silver plan is where Kynect officials say people will get the most out of cost-sharing reductions.\nA patient\u2019s co-pay for a primary care visit will be $20, while seeing a specialist is double that.\nKynect offered five plans last year, but one popular provider \u2014 the Kentucky Health Cooperative \u2014 is no longer available.\nUnited Healthcare has silver plans ranging in premium price from $249.83 to $270.31 \u2014and deductibles of $2,000 to $4,500.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health insurance plans are separated into four categories: bronze, silver, gold or platinum."}
