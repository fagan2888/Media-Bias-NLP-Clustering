Yet it\u2019s the taxpayer that has to refund the money.\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t make sense, maybe H&R Block can explain it. For a fee.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anyone wondering why ObamaCare requires enrollees to file ridiculously complex tax forms might just have found their answer.
