The checks will make sure the talents are covered, up to date, and that WWE has the correct information. The WWE mandated that their signed talents maintain their own medical coverage in May of 2011. While WWE handles in-ring related issues, the talents are required to have medical coverage for other situations.

Talents were told to take care of their medical insurance, and that if they don't, they would be moved to the inactive list until they rectified the situation.
