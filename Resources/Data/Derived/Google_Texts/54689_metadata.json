As a nation, we cannot continue to erode non-defense discretionary funding levels and by association the National Institutes of Health budget which, when measured against the rising cost of conducting research, has been slashed by 22 percent between 2003 and 2013. We urge Congress to boost NIH funding to save and improve patient\u2019s lives, increase economic growth and restore our nation\u2019s place as the world leader in biomedical research.\u201d\n\nThe proposed cuts are counterproductive, said Research!America President and CEO Mary Woolley.\n\n\u201cThe House and Senate FY16 budget proposals call into question our nation\u2019s commitment to medical innovation,\u201d said Woolley in a statement. \u201cAre we willing to delay the discovery, development and delivery of lifesaving therapies and cures because of insufficient funding, or will we choose to accelerate the pace of medical progress?\n\n\u201cThe proposed cuts for discretionary programs are counterproductive given health threats like cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, Ebola, mental illness and diabetes afflicting millions of individuals close to home and abroad. Policymakers must work towards lifting sequestration and assigning a higher priority to medical research and innovation. Too many lives hang in the balance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "2015-03-27 16:29:05", "description": "Republican Budgets Propose $5 Trillion Cut, On Top of Sequestration, Through 2025\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nBy Matthew Bin Han Ong\r\nThe Senate passed its 2016 budget early Friday morning in a marathon voting session&mdash;an event called &ldquo;vote-a-rama&rdquo; in Washington-speak&mdash;that split along party lines with a 52-46 Republican margin.\r\nThe Senate budget resolution would slash $5.1 trillion in federal spending over the next decade, mirroring the resolution passed by the House 228 to 199 March 25, which would cut spending by $5.5 trillion over the next nine years.\r\nBoth budgets agree on keeping sequestration cuts in place, and on repealing the Affordable Care Act.\r\nOver the next month, lawmakers would have to negotiate a joint resolution, which would require the Senate and House to reconcile their contradictory plans for Medicare.", "generator": "Subhub - http://www.subhub.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-27 16:29:05", "dcterms.creator": "The Cancer Letter Publications", "dcterms.type": "SubHub Site", "keywords": ",cancer news, the cancer letter, cancer research, oncology news, medical oncology, cancer policy, drug development, cancer, cancer research funding, cancer funding, clinical cancer letter, NIH, NCI, FDA, CMS, Congress, White House", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5c9\"", "article_summary": "Policymakers must work towards lifting sequestration and assigning a higher priority to medical research and innovation.\nIn summary, the Senate budget would cut $4.3 trillion in mandatory spending and $97 billion from discretionary programs.\nThe Senate budget resolution would slash $5.1 trillion in federal spending over the next decade, mirroring the resolution passed by the House 228 to 199 March 25, which would cut spending by $5.5 trillion over the next nine years.\nBoth budgets agree on keeping sequestration cuts in place, and on repealing the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Senate budget supports the White House request to find $430 billion in savings for Medicare; the House resolution proposes partial privatization of Medicare by converting it into a premium support system."}
