Poverty statewide fell from 16.3 percent to 16 percent.\n\nThe uninsured rate dropped from 11.5 percent to 11 percent last year - before Medicaid was expanded this year to more poor people and before federal health exchange plans began. The uninsured rate was 12.3 percent in 2010 when the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, was signed into law.\n\nUse this database to find median income, median home values, and rates for poverty and medical insurance for each large city, county, metro area and state.\n\nThe database includes estimates for all places with a population of at least 65,000. Estimates for smaller places will be released later. Some mobile users may need to use this link instead.\n\n\n\nOhio ranked 32nd highest among states for income. The state's poverty rate was 31st lowest, and the uninsured rate ranked 16th lowest.\n\nWith a median home value of $127,000, Ohio ranked 40th nationally.\n\nHere's a look within some of the new census estimates for places of at least 65,000 people.\n\nPoverty\n\nSix cities nationally, led by Camden, N.J., at 42.6 percent, had poverty rates at 40 percent or above.\n\nThe highest in Ohio was Youngstown, with a poverty rate of 40.2 percent. Worse yet, nearly two-out-of three children in Youngstown (63.3 percent) are living below the poverty level.\n\nCleveland ranked ninth nationally at 36.9 percent, Dayton 19th at 33.8 percent and Canton 21st at 33.3 percent.\n\nTwo counties - McKinley County, N.M., and Apache County, Ariz. - had poverty rates above 40 percent.\n\nThe poverty rates for Ohio counties ranged from 5.8 percent in Medina to 24.6 percent in Scioto, though just 39 of Ohio's 88 counties are large enough to be included in the estimates.\n\nThe poverty level for a single person under age 65 was set at $11,173 in 2013. For a couple with two children, the poverty level was $23,624.\n\nIncome\n\nShowing that government or government-related jobs apparently pay, the top two counties nationally for median household income are in the the Washington, D.C. area - Loudoun County, Va. at $116,848 and Fairfax County at $111,079,\n\nBy comparison, tops in Ohio was Delaware County, just north of Columbus, at $84,159, followed by Warren County near Cincinnati at $73,432, and two from the Cleveland area - Medina County at $66,477 and Geagua County at $66,428.\n\nAmong Ohio's largest counties, median income in Franklin County (Columbus) was $51,460, Hamilton County (Cincinnati) $46,967 and Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) $43,501.\n\nHome values\n\nThe median home value in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View, Calif. was a whopping $852,200 last year, beating out nearby Redwood City ($848,600) for top honors.\n\nIn fact, California was home to seven of the highest-priced cities nationally. Newton, Mass., checked in at eighth, with a median home value of $742,000.\n\nThe median home value in Columbus of $123,700 was highest among the 10 Ohio cities included in the estimates.\n\nCountywide home values in Ohio ranged from $246,200 in Delaware County to $84,000 in Jefferson County, which includes Steubenville. The median home value in Cuyahoga County was $118,800.\n\nUninsured\n\nTexas dominated the list of counties with the largest shares of people without medical insurance, led by Hidalgo County at 36.4 percent and Webb County at 34.5 percent.\n\nFive of the highest seven uninsured rates by county were in Texas, where the statewide uninsured rate was a national-leading 22.1 percent - meaning one out of every five Texans was without health insurance.\n\nMassachusetts, home to a universal health plan adopted in 2006 under former Gov. Mitt Romney, was home to 11 of the 12 counties nationally with the lowest uninsured rates.\n\nBerskshire County, Mass., was No. 1 nationally at just 2.1 percent. Statewide, the Massachusetts uninsured rate was 3.7 percent.\n\nNotes: Separate national estimates were released Tuesday, though they were from a different census survey and not directly comparable.\n\nEstimates for smaller places will be released later. However, they will be for rolling three- and five-year averages, not a single year due to survey sample sizes in the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act, census, health-insurance, home-values, income, obamacare, poverty, news", "title": "Ohio income up; poverty, uninsured rates down; find city, county, state estimates (database)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Ohio income up; poverty, uninsured rates down; find city, county, state estimates (database)\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2014/09/census_income_poverty_uninsure.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/datacentral/photo/15873053-standard.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13940586\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-18T04:02:36Z\", \"author\": \"Rich Exner, cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"@akron\",\"@cleveland\",\"@mobile\",\"@parma\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"census\",\"health-insurance\",\"home-values\",\"income\",\"obamacare\",\"poverty\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/datacentral/photo/15873053-standard.png", "creator": "@richexner", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "New census estimates for states, counties and cities, show high incomes near Washington, D.C., high home values in Silicon Valley and high uninsured rates in Texas.
