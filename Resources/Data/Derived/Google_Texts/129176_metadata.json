But first: The head of CMS hints that the agency will roll out new initiatives to support doctors.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FROM CMS: MORE HELP FOR PHYSICIANS \u2014 That's what CMS acting administrator Andy Slavitt teased in a fireside chat Thursday in Baltimore.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSlavitt said that three core principles \u2014 that CMS needs to simplify physicians' practice, offer more flexibility and pay better for primary care \u2014 are shaping new rules and programs, like the MACRA law and comprehensive primary care (CPC+) demonstration. And those three beliefs will find their way into \"other things this summer\" too, he hinted.\n\nThey're also the \"core elements\" to ensure that small primary care practices remain independent, Slavitt said on Twitter, responding to Farzad Mostashari's assertion on POLITICO's \"Pulse Check\" podcast that Medicare is inadvertently pressuring the independent physician model.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR E-CIG BACKERS: HOPING FOR HELP FROM THE SENATE \u2014 Under Thursday's rule, e-cigarette companies must file an application with the FDA within two years to prove that they don\u2019t present any new public health risks. That's expected to prove costly and could thin the industry, Pro's Brett Norman points out. (More on that below.)\n\nVaping companies have allies in the House \u2014 who have pushed an amendment to exempt e-cigarettes already on the market from FDA\u2019s review \u2014 but any hopes that the Senate may join that effort might be built on fumes. The Senate has shown little interest to date in interfering with FDA oversight of vaping.\n\n'Big Tobacco is getting just what it wanted.' That's according to law professor Jonathan Adler, who writes in the Washington Post's \"Volokh Conspiracy\" blog that the regulation will force many vaping companies out of the market.\n\n\"Even if smaller manufacturers can satisfy the relevant regulatory deadlines, the rules will increase the cost of e-cigs, limiting their cost advantage vis-a-vis traditional cigarettes and inhibit continued product innovation,\" Adler said, arguing it may turn out to be harmful for public health.\n\nRead the post: http://wapo.st/1SSs4hM\n\nCost of compliance\n\nFDA tobacco chief Mitch Zeller estimates the cost of application at \u201cseveral hundred thousand dollars,\" though some e-cig advocates said that\u2019s a low-ball figure and many smaller players couldn\u2019t afford it in any case.\n\nCIGARS MAY BE ANOTHER MATTER? \u2014 A bill in the Senate that would carve out premium cigars from the new FDA regulatory regime has 20 co-sponsors, including Sen. Jerry Moran, who chairs the FDA-Agriculture appropriations subcommittee. The list of co-sponsors: http://1.usa.gov/1TLIpHs\n\nTHANK GOODNESS IT'S FRIDAY PULSE \u2014 Where you're likely to spend more time on Facebook than doing anything else for fun. Tips and pokes to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nWith help from Brett Norman (@BrettNorman)\n\nPOLITICO EVENT - COCKTAILS AND CONVERSATION. Health care and technology leaders discuss the cost of keeping our data safe at \u201cOutside, In: Unhealthy Hacking: Medical Privacy in the Age of Cyber Attacks. Right after Health Datapalooza. Tuesday, May 10 \u2014 Doors at 5:15pm; District Architecture Center - 421 7th St. NW. RSVP: http://bit.ly/1rV7Ldg\n\nAMONG OUR PANELISTS \u2014 Brookings researcher Niam Yaraghi who this week released a provocative report arguing that the \u201calarming\u201d overnight growth of electronic health records \u2014 thanks to the federal meaningful use program \u2014 meant that hospitals probably weren\u2019t ready with the necessary safeguards. And it costs $363 per record to fix a health care data breach, the highest of all industries, Yaraghi writes. Read his report:http://brook.gs/1QTszpv\n\nTHE ERROR IN MEDICAL ERROR COVERAGE \u2014 A much-buzzed about BMJ study that suggested 250,000 Americans die per year from medical errors relied on a \"sensational and possibly inflated figure,\" watchdog Gary Schwitzer warns: http://bit.ly/1WcHRye\n\n\u2014 'Advocacy masquerading as science: Medical Errors Edition.' That's Harvard economist Amitabh Chandra's assessment of the new study, which he thinks relies on made-up numbers.\n\nICYMI: WHERE INSURERS STAND ON OBAMACARE \u2014 With more earnings reports this week, here's PULSE's quick recap of where some of the nation's biggest insurers stand on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nAnthem: In 14 states now and may expand\n\nCigna: In seven states and expects to expand\n\nHumana: In 15 states and pulling out of five-plus states\n\nUnitedHealth: In 34 states now and pulling out of 26-plus states\n\n\u2014 How to read insurers' rate requests. A new brief from Kaiser Family Foundation's Gary Claxton and Larry Levitt says that several core questions can help explain the rates that payers are asking for \u2014 and guide whether regulators will grant those requests, too.\n\nThose questions include\n\n1) Are current premiums adequate?\n\n2) How will enrollment change in 2017?\n\n3) What's the estimated increase in prices and services?\n\n4) Are there significant changes in policy design or network?\n\n5) Are there notable changes in law or regulation?\n\n6) What's the state of competition in the market?\n\nRead the brief: http://kaiserf.am/23teu9x\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Expand seniors\u2019 access to prescription drugs. Right now Medicare drug plans force patients to make long trips for medication or to pay more to use their longtime pharmacy. Let Medicare beneficiaries choose the pharmacy that\u2019s best for them.

However, researchers flagged wide variation between the states.\n\nWhere residents were least likely to have access: Western and Southwestern states\n\n\u00b7 Nevada: 26.7 percent of adults didn't have a usual place for care\n\n\u00b7 Idaho: 26.6 percent\n\n\u00b7 Texas: 25.4 percent\n\nWhere residents were mostly like to have access: Small Northeastern states\n\n\u00b7 Vermont: 2.8 percent of adults didn't have a usual place for care\n\n\u00b7 Delaware: 6.8 percent\n\n\u00b7 Massachusetts: 7.5 percent\n\nVALEANT: WE'RE LAUNCHING A PRICING COMMITTEE \u2014 The troubled pharmaceutical company said its new internal committee of scientists, doctors and other employees is designed to avoid \"mistakes of the past\" that led to price-gouging and congressional scrutiny.\n\n\"This new committee will take a disciplined approach to reviewing the company's pricing of drugs, and will consider the impact on patients, doctors, and our health care industry partners,\" CEO Joseph Papa said in a statement. \"Valeant's number one priority is ensuring patients can access the medicines they need.\"\n\n\u2014 Drugs slated for review: Nitropress, Isuprel, Cuprimine and Syprine\n\nICYMI: WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED ON THE PULSE CHECK PODCAST \u2014 It's been named a \"Noteworthy\" podcast by iTunes and been buzzed about on social media.

Read the story: http://bit.ly/1QTsdz5\n\n\u2014 A loud dissenter: Purdue Pharma pushes back on the Times' investigation, going point-by-point to dispute whether Oxycontin is less effective than advertised and if the company misled doctors and regulators.\n\n\"The LAT\u2019s claims have not only been publicly voiced, they\u2019ve been directly rejected by regulatory authorities,\" Purdue Pharma writes.\n\nNOT THE VIDEO OF THE WEEK \u2014 Siemens this week rebranded its health care business as \"Healthineers,\" a relatively harmless term intended to evoke its spirt as a pioneering workplace, according to a statement.\n\nLess innocuous: This \"Healthineers\" song and dance at a mandatory company event.\n\n\"Can confirm - this killed all productivity at our newly-christened Healthineers office today,\" a commenter wrote on Reddit. \"This is going to be immortalized forever in the annals of horrible marketing mistakes.\"\n\nTHE RUNNING BOOM IS OVER \u2014 And millennials killed it, the Wall Street Journal asserts.

How are different parts of the country responding to the push for value-based payment in the public and private sectors? Why do delivery and payment reforms take root in some markets but not others?

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
