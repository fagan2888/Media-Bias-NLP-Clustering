I’ve met John Boehner. He seems like a nice man. He smells like cigarettes because he smokes all the time but a lot of people do that.

But he’s also a coward. He has a side to him that’s brazen. He can say things like Ted Cruz is Lucifer in the flesh. But it’s easy to confuse bravery with brazenness.

Boehner made the decision to fight Obamacare and talked a lot of talk. But a lot of RNC donors stopped giving money to the RNC. So Boehner told GOP staff to stand down and let Obamacare pass, even though most in the GOP knew it was going to be a disaster. It almost seemed like Boehner himself wanted Obamacare.

And how many people know that when the Tea Party came to D.C. members of Boehner’s senior staff were making inbreeding and “Deliverance” jokes about Tea Party members? And think of all the photos we’ve seen of Boehner “yucking” it up with Obama.

But this guy calls his own party member, who is running for president, the devil in the flesh?

Remember when John Boehner said he was going to fight Obama’s illegal immigration stance? He said he would fight it tooth and nail. And then he gave him $2.5 billion to not enforce immigration laws. But Ted Cruz is Lucifer in the flesh.

It seems he wants to erase his past as a Republican. Is he upset with Cruz because Cruz was the one who exposed why Boehner really resigned?
