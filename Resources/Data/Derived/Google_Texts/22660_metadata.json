But that figure doesn\u2019t factor in cable dollars.\n\nTotal TV advertising \u2014 including network, syndication, spot, and cable TV \u2014 is still far ahead. It amounted to $66 billion in 2013, according to research firm eMarketer.\n\nBut digital advertising continues to make inroads. The growth in mobile advertising is particularly striking: a 110% year-over-year jolt to $7.1 billion, according to IAB. That\u2019s the third year of triple-digit growth for mobile, according to the report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unabated growth,\u201d Sherrill Mane, senior vice president of research at IAB, said of mobile advertising. \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing you reach for in the morning, it\u2019s the last thing you look at at night before you close your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation of kids that barely go on a desktop, occasionally go on a laptop, and are typically connected via their phone or tablet,\u201d said David Silverman, a partner at PwC. \u201cThe revenue is following the eyeballs.\u201d\n\nDigital video notched $2.8 billion in revenue, up 19% from 2012, and Mr. Silverman said that he expects digital revenue to grow in the future as the medium develops. Online video offerings, he said, are in their early stages of development.\n\n\u201cI still have the sense that what we have is just the beginning of that industry of being able to consume video at will on any device from your carrier,\u201d he said.\n\nBrands would be wise to take notice of the growth of digital, according to Ms. Mane.\n\n\u201cYou can no longer sit on the sidelines. You have to put your money into digital media to build your brand,\u201d Ms. Mane said. \u201cIf you are not doing so, lots of the money you are spending is being wasted.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Digital Ad Revenue Skyrockets, But Still Lags TV", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/04/10/internet-ad-revenues-iab/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CG761_0408SA_P_20140408072748.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Digital Ad Revenue Skyrockets, But Still Lags TV", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Steven Perlberg", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-04-10T15:00:56-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/04/10/internet-ad-revenues-iab/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-281", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/04/10/internet-ad-revenues-iab/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CG761_0408SA_P_20140408072748.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article", "title": "Digital Ad Revenue Skyrockets, But Still Lags TV"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-281", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-10T15:00:56-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The IAB boasts that digital ad revenue has for the first time surpassed broadcast television\u2019s revenue of $40.1 billion.\nTotal TV advertising \u2014 including network, syndication, spot, and cable TV \u2014 is still far ahead.\nBut a new report shows just how important online video and mobile advertising have become in competition with traditional TV.\n\u201cThe revenue is following the eyeballs.\u201dDigital video notched $2.8 billion in revenue, up 19% from 2012, and Mr. Silverman said that he expects digital revenue to grow in the future as the medium develops.\nBrands would be wise to take notice of the growth of digital, according to Ms. Mane."}
