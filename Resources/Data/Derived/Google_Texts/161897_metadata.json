NEA\u2019s Wisconsin Education Association Council has lost 30,000 members in the past few years.\n\n\u201cIn December of 2014, 25 Wisconsin school district unions were rejected by their teachers and were actually decertified,\u201d Healy said in an email to Watchdog.org. \u201cPlus, 100 fewer local unions sought recertification in 2014, down to 305.\u201d\n\nThis followed a year when workers represented by 80 of Wisconsin\u2019s public-sector unions \u2014 unions that could previously take mandatory fees from nonmembers \u2014 voted against continued union membership.\n\n\u201cNow that government workers have finally been given a choice to join a union rather than being forced to join, Wisconsinites are voting to keep their hard-earned money instead of handing it over to the labor bosses,\u201d Healy said.\n\nBut NEA still has almost 3 million members, and Stocks relishes his position as a power broker on the political left.\n\n\u201cAs the nation\u2019s largest union, we\u2019re the ones who can bring together progressive allies to create the future we know our students need and deserve,\u201d Stocks said Saturday.\n\nWho does Stocks see as NEA\u2019s \u201cprogressive allies?\u201d Defunct fringe-left protest movement Occupy Wall Street. Union front Fight for $15. Illegal immigrants. Billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s environmentalist group NextGen Climate.\n\nRELATED: Union bosses are lovin\u2019 $15 an hour fast-food protests\n\n\u201cAll of these organizations have at their heart a desire for social, racial, economic and environmental justice, and the real possibility of uniting our nation in a grand alliance,\u201d Stocks said.\n\nLarry Sand, president of the California Teachers Empowerment Network, joked that NEA\u2019s meeting sounded like \u201can early Democratic convention.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEA leadership tends to run far to the left, but clearly the membership is not all far-left,\u201d Sand told Watchdog.org.\n\nCTEN board member Rebecca Friedrichs is a plaintiff in the Supreme Court case Friedrichs vs. California Teachers Association, which could end mandatory union \u201cfair share\u201d fees for public-sector workers in every state.\n\nFriedrichs and other California teachers are forced to pay state and local NEA affiliates \u2014 an arrangement they say is a violation of their First Amendment rights because public-sector unions are inherently political.\n\nSand said he doesn\u2019t expect NEA leaders to moderate their politics prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Friedrichs case, but they should if the plaintiffs win.\n\n\u201cNEA just won\u2019t have a captive audience\u201d if they\u2019re unable to take forced fees, Sand said. \u201cSo I would think that to appeal to a greater body of people they wouldn\u2019t go out and be this left-wing political machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost big companies don\u2019t want to alienate their customers,\u201d Sand added. \u201cI would think NEA would moderate their message. I guess they\u2019re not ready for that yet.\u201d\n\nJudging by the fiery conclusion to the politics-laden speech Stocks gave on July 4, the NEA is not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While most Americans celebrated Independence Day, the National Education Association bemoaned America's lack of \"social justice.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "While most Americans celebrated Independence Day, the National Education Association bemoaned America's lack of \"social justice.\"", "title": "Union boss wants teachers waging war for 'social justice' - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/john-stocks-nea-youtube-2015-07-04.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-06T11:51:37+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/227521/union-social-justice/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "While most Americans celebrated Independence Day, the National Education Association bemoaned America's lack of \"social justice.\"", "title": "Union boss wants teachers waging war for 'social justice' - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/john-stocks-nea-youtube-2015-07-04.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-07-08T04:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T11:51:37+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "social justice, john stocks, nea, national education association, progressive, fight for 15, income inequality, institutional racism, white privilege"}, "article_summary": "Stocks, a white male who was paid $412,398 with teachers union dues last year, blamed the country\u2019s struggles on income inequality and institutional racism.\nWho does Stocks see as NEA\u2019s \u201cprogressive allies?\u201d Defunct fringe-left protest movement Occupy Wall Street.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a part of progressive causes and social justice organizing my entire career,\u201d Stocks said.\n\u201cAmerica is not working for most Americans,\u201d Stocks told several thousand representatives of the union\u2019s state and local affiliates at NEA\u2019s annual meeting.\n\u201cI know what movement moments look like.\u201dBrett Healy, president of Wisconsin\u2019s free-market MacIver Institute, thinks Stocks should take a closer look."}
