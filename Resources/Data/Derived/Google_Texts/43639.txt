• TAXES. AbbVie, a pharmaceutical company under fire for buying a European drugmaker in an effort to reduce its tax bill, signed up two new lobbying firms to work on its behalf, including one run by former Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.). As Congress mulls action on the practice, known as inversions, Lincoln Policy Group and Nixon Peabody will be lobbying for the company on corporate tax policy, according to newly filed disclosure forms. At Nixon Peabody, former Rep. Thomas Reynolds (R-N.Y.) is among the advocates working for AbbVie. The company now has nine firms on retainer.

• IN-HOUSE HELP., the manager of government relations for, will now officially lobby for the group. She will cover several policy bases, including “food and beverage regulation,” intellectual property and issues relating to labor unions, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Affordable Care Act. The National Association of Theatre Owners also has Mercury Strategies on retainer, but the firm has not actively lobbied for the group since last year.

• CONTRACTING. Security equipment manufacturer Rapiscan is enlisting the help of former Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.), now at K&L Gates, after a contract between the company and the country of Albania went sour. A newly elected government in Albania canceled a 15-year deal for security services that had been announced last year. The contract with Rapiscan was worth an estimated $150 million to $250 million. It’s not clear what K&L Gates will be doing for the company, with disclosure forms only saying that lobbyists will be working on “issues pertaining to a contractual dispute concerning the sale of equipment to the government of Albania.”

• HEALTHCARE. Six of the largest drug manufactures registered consulting firm CapitalHill Advisory to help them battle the Australian court system. The Australian offices of AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Pfizer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Merck Sharp & Dohme and Bristol-Myers Squibb all hired lobbyists to fight against litigation by the Australian government involving drug patents. The area of the forms that describes the lobbying activity is marked “privileged & confidential.” The firm and the lobbyist, Nick Campbell, are based in Australia, but the forms also list an address in downtown Washington.
