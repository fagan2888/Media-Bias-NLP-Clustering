Burwell case was heard by the Supreme Court in 2015, and was widely considered to be conservatives\u2019 last chance to overturn Obamacare. At issue was whether the legislation authorized the federal government to apply federal income tax subsidies to individuals residing in states that had not established health care exchanges. While the text of the legislation provided little basis for such authorization, this interpretation would have rendered Obamacare unworkable. If this provision were overturned, it would likely mean the end of Obamacare.\n\nConservatives rallied behind the opportunity to overturn the law. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Mike Lee, and Paul Ryan put aside personal differences to sign an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to rule against the Obama administration. Republican attorneys general representing Oklahoma, Nebraska, South Carolina and other states joined together to submit a similar brief.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, liberals banded together to defend Barack Obama\u2019s takeover of our health care system. Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid led other congressional liberals in submitting a brief that defended Obamacare. Another group of liberals \u2013 21 Democrat attorneys general from across the country \u2013 submitted a brief of their own. Joining them as the lone Republican was North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem.\n\nThese liberals succeeded in persuading the Supreme Court to rewrite the law and save Obamacare. It was an interpretation that the late-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia famously described as \u201cnot merely unnatural; it is unheard of.\u201d It was exactly the interpretation that Stenehjem and his liberal colleagues had pleaded with the court to take.\n\nStenehjem continues to deny that he \u201csupported\u201d Obamacare, even though his actions in the King v. Burwell case clearly demonstrate that he did. Instead of continuing to argue over semantics, perhaps Stenehjem should be asked a different question \u2013 why did he decide that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan were wrong, but Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Barack Obama were right?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,letters", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "West Fargo Pioneer", "description": "While it may be politically inconvenient now that he\u2019s decided to seek higher office, the fact of the matter is Wayne Stenehjem indisputably supported Obamacare.
