CNN reported that, according to an official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the company never obtained permission to sell the device.\n\nOlympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to CNN, which attributed the information to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs.\n\n\"Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,\" Riley told CNN.\n\nOlympus, as the market leader for such scopes, has drawn the most scrutiny but the concerns also apply to the company's main rivals, Pentax Medical and Fujifilm.\n\nOlympus could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. But the company has said it gave customers detailed cleaning instructions, and is working closely with regulators, doctors and hospitals to address any concerns about patient safety.\n\nOlympus Corp. of the Americas relocated from Long Island, N.Y., to Upper Saucon Township in 2006 and has 950 employees.\n\nIn recent years, the company added more powerful tools at the tip of the scopes, which can cost as much as $40,000 apiece. These include extra guide wires, for instance, that can carry tiny stents and tubes to clear infections or blockages in the digestive tract.\n\nBut the extra grooves and channels added to the surface of the scope also can trap antibiotic-resistant superbugs that are difficult to remove and can be passed to other patients.\n\nDespite those risks, the Food and Drug Administration and the specialists who use Olympus scopes say there aren't any viable alternatives and the scopes are too vital to do without.\n\n\"Olympus is almost like a bank that's too big to fail now,\" said hospital safety consultant Lawrence Muscarella, an expert on endoscopes who works near Olympus' U.S. headquarters in Center Valley. \"They're brilliant, but I think they took too many risks.\"\n\nUCLA patient Antonia Torres Cerda may have paid a heavy price for that.\n\nThe 48-year-old liver transplant patient and mother of four daughters died Nov. 8 at UCLA after becoming infected from a contaminated Olympus scope, according to a lawsuit her family filed last week against the company.\n\nHer 18-year-old daughter, Cynthia, said her mother was feeling better after the transplant when suddenly the infection hit and there were no antibiotics to stop it. Her family lives in Corcoran, Calif., where her father, Armando, is a farmworker.\n\n\"It was irresponsible of the company to have equipment contaminated with bacteria that killed people,\" said Cynthia, a freshman at the University of California Santa Cruz. \"I have a little sister who is 7 years old. Our mom is gone.\"\n\nThe deadly outbreaks came after years of red flags. And government officials now concede that the problem may be even worse because many scope-related infections have gone undetected or unreported.\n\nSince 2007, ECRI Institute, a nonprofit group that evaluates medical devices for hospitals and other organizations, has listed the risk of contaminated endoscopes and other surgical instruments among its top 10 health hazards.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged that endoscopes be redesigned so they don't represent a \"potential source of infectious agents.\"\n\nLast year, the Joint Commission, which accredits and inspects hospitals, raised alarms about tainted endoscopes and other equipment posing an immediate threat to patients' lives.\n\nThe FDA said it has received 75 reports of contaminated scopes causing possible infections in 135 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP, from January 2013 to December 2014.\n\n\"These infections and complications from ERCP have been widely known for a long time and widely ignored,\" said Helen Haskell, founder of Mothers Against Medical Error in Columbia, S.C. Her son, Lewis, died in 2000 after undergoing a minimally invasive surgery.\n\n\"This should have been taken care of years ago,\" she said.\n\nOlympus said it has told customers that its TJF-Q180V scope \"requires careful attention to cleaning and reprocessing steps, including meticulous manual cleaning.\"\n\nIn an alert to customers after the UCLA outbreak became public, Olympus said it was aware of 95 complaints about that duodenoscope related to patient infections.\n\nAs the outbreaks continued to unfold, Olympus executives have made presentations to medical professionals emphasizing that infections from reusable scopes are rare if cleaning instructions are followed.\n\nThe company's manager of infection control was a featured speaker at a conference in Las Vegas the week before news broke about the UCLA infections. Her topic: \"How to Avoid Superbugs and Lawsuits in Your GI Lab.\"\n\n\"Endoscopes reprocessed appropriately pose virtually no risk of patient-borne or environmental organisms,\" Mary Ann Drosnock, manager of infection control for Olympus America, told the gathered health care professionals.\n\nSome have suggested that hospitals must bear some of the blame for not adequately cleaning these reusable devices.\n\nBut CDC officials and other public health departments say they have generally found that hospitals involved in outbreaks were following the manufacturers' cleaning directions.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Olympus under scrutiny for role in 'superbug' outbreak", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "Three years ago, Japanese electronics giant Olympus Corp. was in crisis amid a massive accounting scandal and plunging sales of its signature cameras.", "title": "Olympus under scrutiny for role in 'superbug' outbreak", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-olympus-scopes-super-bug-20150304-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54f77a6b/turbine/mc-olympus-scopes-super-bug-20150304", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Olympus superbug scope outbreak", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/82972433", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-04", "Description": "Olympus under scrutiny for role company's scope had in spread of deadly superbug at UCLA and other hospitals.", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Olympus superbug scope outbreak"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd081\"", "article_summary": "The company's manager of infection control was a featured speaker at a conference in Las Vegas the week before news broke about the UCLA infections.\nDespite those risks, the Food and Drug Administration and the specialists who use Olympus scopes say there aren't any viable alternatives and the scopes are too vital to do without.\nOlympus, as the market leader for such scopes, has drawn the most scrutiny but the concerns also apply to the company's main rivals, Pentax Medical and Fujifilm.\nIn an alert to customers after the UCLA outbreak became public, Olympus said it was aware of 95 complaints about that duodenoscope related to patient infections.\nOlympus Corp. of the Americas relocated from Long Island, N.Y., to Upper Saucon Township in 2006 and has 950 employees."}
