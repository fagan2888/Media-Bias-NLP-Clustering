Despite speed bumps, her efforts to position herself as President Obama\u2019s heir apparent seem to be paying off. That brings with it some challenges, which we can study in the presidencies of two previous \u201cheirs\u201d: George H.W. Bush, arguably elected to continue the Reagan Revolution, and Harry Truman, who became president when FDR died and was expected to continue and expand the New Deal\u2019s liberalism.\n\nCan the \u201cheir apparent\u201d win a general election?\n\nThe first challenge, of course, is getting elected. It\u2019s not easy for a party to win again after holding the presidency for two consecutive terms. Neither Al Gore, Bill Clinton\u2019s heir apparent, nor Hubert Humphrey, who was Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s, managed it. To win as Obama\u2019s heir apparent, Clinton must reassemble the electoral coalition that put him in the White House.\n\n[In 6 graphs, here\u2019s why young women don\u2019t support Hillary Clinton as much as older women do]\n\nUsually, an heir apparent finds that difficult. If elected, it\u2019s by a smaller margin than the predecessor\u2019s. We can see that in Clinton\u2019s struggles to win over one of Obama\u2019s key constituencies: younger voters. The possibility of Donald Trump as her Republican opponent may give Clinton the opportunity to reach out to some voters who did not support Obama, but her top priority must first be reassembling her predecessor\u2019s coalition.\n\nThe potential heir usually takes that position by promising continuity. After a lethargic start to the 1988 campaign, George H.W. Bush found his voice as Reagan\u2019s heir apparent by vowing to protect Reagan\u2019s historic tax cuts from the Democratic lords of Capitol Hill. Bush didn\u2019t emphasize new tax cuts; he promised to protect Reagan\u2019s hard-won gains. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected from an heir apparent: defend the predecessor\u2019s achievements, instead of launching new political revolutions. Clinton is promising that continuity, as opposed to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s promised \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d\n\nHow closely would Clinton hold to Obama\u2019s policies?\n\nIf elected, an heir\u2019s next challenge comes in how to relate to her predecessor\u2019s approach. Clinton will probably promise a great deal of continuity in the general-election campaign. But if she reaches the White House, she \u2014 like preceding heirs \u2014 will probably alternate among three approaches: continuity, expansion and correction.\n\nContinuity. Clinton will surely promise to preserve, protect and defend \u2014 with her veto pen if necessary \u2014 a variety of Obama administration initiatives from the Affordable Care Act to the Dodd-Frank financial regulation. Right now, according to the Charlie Cook Political Report and similar sources, it looks as if Republicans will maintain control of one or both chambers of Congress and most statehouses in the 2016 elections. As a result, a Democratic president would face a lot of resistance.\n\nTruman practiced continuity when he vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. This law was enacted by a Republican Congress and was intended to weaken organized labor. Taft-Hartley barred the \u201cclosed shop,\u201d a workplace where only union members can be hired. And it enabled states to choose to pass \u201cright to work\u201d laws, which enables anyone to refuse to join a union, even if that union negotiated the operating contract. Truman vetoed it because he believed it would weaken the National Labor Relations Act, a key piece of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal agenda. Congress overrode Truman\u2019s veto.\n\nExpansion. But all presidents want to have their own achievements. Truman tried to both extend FDR\u2019s New Deal and make his own mark through a legislative program he called the Fair Deal, which met with mixed success in Congress. Truman expanded on New Deal commitments by winning a higher minimum wage, increased Social Security benefits and a major new housing initiative. His proposals on national health insurance and repeal of Taft-Hartley went nowhere.\n\nTruman also began fusing the New Deal\u2019s commitments to economic justice with the cause of civil rights. His legislative proposals on civil rights stalled in Congress, but Truman was able to use executive orders to integrate the armed forces.\n\nClinton is likely to propose finishing Obama policy goals, like comprehensive immigration reform, legislative action on climate change, free community college and expanding the Affordable Care Act to help the millions not yet covered by this legislation.\n\nClinton has vowed to protect the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulates the financial industry, and to \u201cfight for tough new rules, stronger enforcement and more accountability that go well beyond\u201d that legislation. In addition to promising a rigorous enforcement of Dodd-Frank, Clinton may call for stricter standards upon executives and financial institutions. Republican opposition to all these is likely to be very strong, forcing Clinton to make many compromises and choose her battles accordingly. This is what she is hinting at when she calls herself \u201ca progressive who likes to get things done.\u201d\n\n[How Wall Street became a big chunk of the U.S. economy \u2014 and when the Democrats signed on]\n\nAgain, we can learn from the past. Various aspects of Truman\u2019s ambitious domestic agenda were defeated or trimmed by a coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans. Bush was surrounded by an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, but he could follow his predecessor\u2019s footsteps by signing into law the Immigration Act of 1990, which largely built from the reforms of Reagan\u2019s 1986 immigration legislation. Far more often, however, Bush was forced into the corrective stance.\n\nCorrection. Sometimes an heir has to take a new direction \u2014 whether by choice, political necessity, or problems in the predecessor\u2019s policies.\n\nBudget deficits grew steadily in the 1980s, reaching more than $220 billion by 1990. Faced with skyrocketing budget deficits and an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, Bush had to move from continuity to correction on taxes. He abandoned his well-known campaign promise \u2014 \u201cRead my lips. No new taxes\u201d \u2014 and agreed to a package of tax increases. Fellow Republicans were angry.\n\nBush also had to clean up the mess left by Reagan\u2019s deregulation of the savings and loan industry. Once rigorous regulations were moved, these financial institutions handled deposits recklessly and criminally, for years. Once they failed, Bush\u2019s administration had to bail out depositors, costing taxpayers billions.\n\nThe elder Bush was challenged from the right in the 1992 Republican primary; while he easily beat Patrick Buchanan for the nomination, he did not win a second term.\n\nIf elected, Clinton, too, will most certainly have to correct something in Obama\u2019s policy legacy, either because it\u2019s malfunctioning or unpopular.\n\n[Hillary Clinton was a more effective lawmaker than Bernie Sanders]\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, for example, contains a deeply unpopular \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on expensive health-insurance policies, scheduled to go into effect in 2020. A future president Clinton would face enormous pressure to delay or repeal the tax. The problem is that the budget \u2014 and the ACA \u2014 depend on that revenue. How would she make it up?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a Republican Congress is likely to keep challenging the ACA and may force her to weaken some of its important regulations, whether the individual insurance mandate or the contraception mandate. Or Clinton could refine and adjust Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\n\nWhichever one of these corrections she undertakes, Clinton \u2014 like her heir predecessors \u2014 will be in a thankless position, as was Bush 41. Her Republican critics would give her little credit for changing course. Her Democratic allies would probably claim that she lacks the spine for a fight or that she is \u201cbetraying\u201d Obama\u2019s progressivism, or \u2014 in the TPP case \u2014 would be unmollified that she\u2019s holding to it at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s the takeaway?\n\nAny heir apparent president after a comparatively popular or successful two-term president will probably face a stronger opposition party and a weaker and more divided governing party than did her or his predecessor. And no matter what he or she does \u2014 continuity, expansion or correction \u2014 that successor will be accused of lacking ideological coherence and core principles.\n\nBush was defeated in 1992. Truman left office very unpopular. Three other \u201csuccessor\u201d presidents \u2014 John Adams, Martin Van Buren and William Howard Taft \u2014 left office under similar circumstances. If she makes it to the Oval Office, Clinton can be a successful president. But she\u2019ll face constraints that Obama did not.\n\nDonald A.
