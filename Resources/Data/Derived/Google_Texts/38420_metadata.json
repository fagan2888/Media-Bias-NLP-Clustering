My idea is to bring a Tesla factory.\"\n\nThe outspoken minister, who has courted controversy before with off-the-cuff statements, said she had mentioned the idea to Musk himself and would see Tesla's management in 10 days.\n\n\"I said to him: 'I have a place for you, Fessenheim'. He didn't say no,\" Royal said. \"Who dares, wins,\" she said.\n\nRoyal's staff did not return a request from Reuters for comment.\n\nsays it employs 850 people at the Fessenheim site and 250 contractors. France has been a big supporter of electric cars, offering a bonus of up to 10,000 euros ($11,000) for the purchase of such cars and making the country the biggest market in Europe. Royal herself invested public funds in a now-defunct electric car maker when she was head of a French region. Tesla's Musk said he wanted to build a factory in Europe and mentioned Alsace in a video published by the specialist car website Automobile Propre in February. \"This is idle speculation, but maybe we could put a factory in Alsace, it's like half in Germany, half in France, something like that,\" Musk said in the video.
