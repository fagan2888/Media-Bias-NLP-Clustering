Obama on Monday defended his problem-plagued health reform plan, declaring at a White House event that, despite numerous glitches, the program is already helping many uninsured Americans. \"Let me remind everybody that the Affordable Care Act is not just a website,\" Obama said, after the troubled online rollout of the plan. \"It's much more...You may not know it, but you're already benefiting from these provisions in the law.\" AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n3921606\n\nOf the 13 people who flanked President Obama during his speech defending Obamacare in the Rose Garden Monday, just three had successfully registered for the new Obamacare exchanges.\n\nA list of the people who joined Obama on stage provided by the White House included people who have or \u201cwill\u201d benefit from Obamacare, small business owners, representatives from \u201cpartner organizations,\u201d and new registrants.\n\nThe three people who were able to register included: Janice Baker, who introduced the president and as of last week was the only person to have successfully enrolled in health care coverage through Delaware\u2019s state exchange; David Hall, an IT consultant who signed up for health care through the DC Health Link; and Zohre Abolfazli, who was able to register through healthcare.gov last night and still needs to shop for her \u201cbest plan.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has not released official numbers on how many people actually have enrolled in Obamacare, and with the main Obamacare web portal plagued by glitches, some have speculated that the administration might not be able to meet its enrollment goals.\n\nThe full list, via the White House:\n\nJanice Baker (Introducer), New ACA Registrant\n\nJanice Baker, a small business owner, was the first woman to enroll in the Delaware exchange. She and her husband are the owners of the Heavenly Hound Hotel, a boarding and grooming kennel for Dogs in Selbyville, DE. They have owned and operated it for 24 years. Prior to enrolling through the new Marketplaces, Baker had been turned down for individual insurance three times due to a minor pre-existing condition. On her new insurance plan, Baker is saving $150 a month.\n\nGinger Gutting, CVS Pharmacy Supervisor\n\nGinger Gutting is a pharmacist and current pharmacy supervisor for CVS in the Northern Virginia area. Ginger overseas many stores in the Washington Metro area. In this role, she has seen the impact that ACA has had on her customers and store pharmacists. Ginger has been a CVS colleague and pharmacist since 2002 and is a registered pharmacist in the state of Virginia.\n\nWalt Rowen, Small Business Owner\n\nWalt Rowen is the owner of the Susquehanna Glass Company, a small business in Columbia, Pennsylvania started by Rowen\u2019s grandfather in 1910. The company, which has grown to 35 full-time employees, has benefitted from the ACA\u2019s Medical Loss Ratio provision which requires at least 80 percent of small groups\u2019 premium dollars be spent on patient care instead of administrative costs. A few years ago Rowen was quoted a 130 percent increase to his premiums \u2014 this year his premiums increased by only 7 percent.\n\nDavid Hall, New ACA Registrant\n\nDavid Hall, a self-employed IT Consultant and Web Designer, signed up for health insurance through DC Health Link, the District of Columbia\u2019s online health insurance marketplace, on October 1, 2013.

Ugalde\u2019s mother was relieved her daughter could receive coverage and Jessica is very grateful to the ACA for this benefit.\n\nMike Brey, Small Business Owner\n\nMike Brey is the owner of Hobby Works, a small business that has expanded to five locations throughout Maryland and Virginia since it opened in 1992. While Brey\u2019s business has been successful, he feels that his ability to keep his workers feeling secure by providing health insurance coverage has eroded over time. The company health plan once cost $100 per person, most of which was covered by the company. Over the years the premium has tripled and his employees have seen their costs increase five times as they pay more of the premium and face a higher deductible. Brey believes that the Affordable Care Act was the first thing in years that gave him hope that this spiral of escalating costs and depreciating quality of coverage might finally end. Brey has said that \u201cas an employer in Maryland with fewer than 50 full-time- equivalent employees, I\u2019ll be able to use our state\u2019s exchange next year to purchase coverage. This is huge.\u201d\n\nMalik Hassan, Prospective ACA Beneficiary\n\nMalik Hassan works at a restaurant in Philadelphia. Hassan, who does not receive coverage through his employer, is looking forward to enrolling for health coverage this fall. He recently used Healthcare.gov to process his application and is waiting for the options for potential plans in Philadelphia.\n\nEzra Salop, Small Business Owner & ACA Beneficiary\n\nEzra Salop, 25 years old, runs his own catering business in the Washington, DC area. Salop is currently receiving insurance coverage through his parents\u2019 plan and is looking forward to enrolling on the ACA exchanges so he can continue growing his small business.\n\nKarmel Allison, Prospective ACA Beneficiary\n\nKarmel Allison was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when she was nine years old. She has stayed on the same insurance ever since, despite constantly rising costs, for fear she would not be able to find a plan that would cover her due to her pre-existing condition. Allison recently began researching her options on CoveredCA and has publically described her experience as finally feeling equal to others, including her young and healthy husband, when it comes to access to coverage.\n\nZohre Abolfazli, New ACA Registrant\n\nZohre Abolfazli has owned a small business outside of Nashville, Tennessee for almost twenty-five years. Even though she has been able to maintain her health insurance over the years, it has been a challenge to find affordable, comprehensive health insurance in the individual market place. Last night, Abolfalzi was able to register throughHealthCare.gov and now plans to comparison shop for the best plan that meets her budget and needs.\n\nJasmine Jennings, ACA Beneficiary\n\nJasmine Jennings was diagnosed with thyroid cancer when she was in college. Due to the ACA, Jennings no longer has to worry about health insurance companies denying her coverage due to her preexisting condition. She is currently on her parents\u2019 insurance plan, which has given her peace of mind as she settles into her career and finishes grad school. Without having to worry about how to pay for health insurance, Jennings has been able to accept a part-time curatorial fellowship and start a small business. She has said that \u201cthese educational and entrepreneurial experiences are enriching my life every day and without the ACA, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do either.\u201d\n\nLaJuanna Russell, Small Business Owner\n\nLaJuanna Russell is the owner of Business Management Associates, a consulting company in Alexandria, Virginia.
