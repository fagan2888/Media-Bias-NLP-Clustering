Now, it\u2019s culminating in the highest of expectations.\n\nTwo years ago, the Broncos were about to end the 2011 season on a three-game losing skid behind a quarterback who\u2019s now out of the NFL. When they lost to the Chiefs on Jan. 1, 2012, they were 8-8, an record identical to the Raiders\u2019 and Chargers\u2019. Even so, Denver backed into the AFC West title by virtue of tiebreakers, and the Tim Tebow Show made it all the way to the playoffs, where the Broncos defeated Pittsburgh in overtime before getting crushed at New England.\n\nIn many ways, it was an end: the end of the Broncos\u2019 season, the end of Tebow\u2019s magical run, really the end of Tebow as any kind of factor in the NFL. Little did the Broncos know, though, it also was a beginning.\n\nTwo years later, the team has locked up its third consecutive division title under coach John Fox, marking the first time the Broncos have had a three-peat at the top of the AFC West. That might sound like a long time to go without three consecutive division titles, but consider this: Since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, 14 teams have yet to accomplish such a feat, and only nine teams have managed it more than once.\n\n\u201cI think they are all completely different,\u201d Fox said of his three division titles. \u201cThe first one was unique. Last year, from where we started to where we finished, was unique. We had higher expectations coming into this season. I think everybody in our city, state and region did as well.\u201d\n\nNow, the Broncos are the favorite to emerge from the AFC and make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nFox had never won three consecutive division titles as a head coach until coming to the Broncos, yet by virtue of such a high turnover rate in the NFL, he already has more career playoff berths than most head coaches. This will be his sixth playoff appearance in 12 years. Only Wade Phillips, Andy Reid, Bill Belichick, Tom Coughlin, Jeff Fisher and Mike Shanahan have more playoff berths among active head coaches in the league.\n\nAs far as three years in a row atop their divisions, the list of active coaches is even smaller. John Harbaugh had an opportunity to do so this season with the Ravens, but he won\u2019t, as did the Packers\u2019 Mike McCarthy and the 49ers\u2019 Jim Harbaugh, both of whom still have a shot with a game to go. Reid won the NFC East with Philadelphia four years in a row, from 2001-04, and Belichick topped the AFC East with the Patriots for two five-year stints, from 2003-07 and now from 2009-13. Even Shanahan, who led the Broncos to back-to-back Super Bowl victories, never accomplished a division three-peat; in 1997, leading up to Denver\u2019s first NFL championship, the Broncos finished second in the AFC West, behind the 13-3 Chiefs.\n\nAfter winning the division last weekend, though, the Broncos aren\u2019t quite ready to celebrate. They have plenty of reasons to \u2014 Peyton Manning\u2019s NFL season touchdown passing record, for one \u2014 but the focus still is on the regular-season finale Sunday at Oakland and on locking up home-field advantage for the AFC playoffs, which requires a Denver win or a New England loss this weekend.\n\n\u201cOne thing this team has done a good job of all year is just focusing on the opponent and the task at hand,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s a division game. I think that has served us well \u2014 that philosophy. It\u2019s a crazy last week of the season.\u201d\n\nAs usual, Manning is focused on the next game, the next win, not any records. But when forced to acknowledge the big picture last weekend, he was more interested in the team\u2019s slot in the AFC standings than his 51 touchdown passes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a special thing when it\u2019s come at the same time as winning games,\u201d Manning said of the record. \u201cIf we were 3-12, it would not have been a unique or special accomplishment for the team because it didn\u2019t help you win games.\u201d\n\nFox also has noticed where his quarterback\u2019s outlook lies, on the team and the playoffs more than the record book. This will be an era in Broncos history to remember, from the surprise run to a division title in Fox\u2019s first year and dominating runs of No. 2 and No. 3. It\u2019s not a time to look back, though, not yet.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Oakland, for home field, for the Broncos to finish what they started in July.\n\nDivision dominance\n\nActive NFL head coaches who have won three or more consecutive division titles:\n\nCoach, team \u2026 Years\n\nAndy Reid, Eagles \u2026 2001-04\n\nBill Belichick, Patriots \u2026 2003-07\n\nBill Belichick, Patriots \u2026 2009-13\n\nJohn Fox, Broncos \u2026 2011-13\n\nJoan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joanniesen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 AFC West three-peat powered by John Fox\u2019s trot", "title": "Broncos\u2019 AFC West three-peat powered by John Fox\u2019s trot", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/26/broncos-afc-west-three-peat-powered-by-john-foxs-trot/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131128_072644_john-fox-1.jpg", "height": 487}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131128_072644_john-fox-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-26T20:52:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:32:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Two years later, the team has locked up its third consecutive division title under coach John Fox, marking the first time the Broncos have had a three-peat at the top of the AFC West.\nIn many ways, it was an end: the end of the Broncos\u2019 season, the end of Tebow\u2019s magical run, really the end of Tebow as any kind of factor in the NFL.\nDivision dominanceActive NFL head coaches who have won three or more consecutive division titles:Coach, team \u2026 YearsAndy Reid, Eagles \u2026 2001-04Bill Belichick, Patriots \u2026 2003-07Bill Belichick, Patriots \u2026 2009-13John Fox, Broncos \u2026 2011-13Joan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joanniesen\nTwo years ago, the Broncos were about to end the 2011 season on a three-game losing skid behind a quarterback who\u2019s now out of the NFL.\nWhen they lost to the Chiefs on Jan. 1, 2012, they were 8-8, an record identical to the Raiders\u2019 and Chargers\u2019."}
