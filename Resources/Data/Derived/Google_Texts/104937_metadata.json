For many of the estimated 3.2 million U.S. residents with chronic hepatitis C, relief from the disease\u2019s highly elevated risk of long-term effects \u2014 such as liver damage, cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer \u2014 was now just 84 days away. Noting that previous treatments lasted 24 to 48 weeks, had a lower cure rate and often came with serious side effects, such as anemia and depression, many individuals with hep C and providers celebrated the development.\n\nThen they saw the price tag: $84,000, or $1,000 per pill. Cue the outrage.\n\nIndustry analysts argued that the cost was unreasonable. Lawmakers got involved, with Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and two other Democrats and the Senate Finance Committee writing letters to Gilead\u2019s CEO, asking him to explain the price. Meanwhile, high-profile payers \u2014 like Aetna, CVS Caremark and Express Scripts \u2014 balked at the price and questioned whether they would cover it.\n\nThe better part of a year later, the dialogue on the drug\u2019s price continues, but stakeholders who want to see the price drop still have no concrete answer on how to do just that.\n\nHow Can the ACA Help?\n\nAt this point, you might be saying, \u201cWait just a minute, surely the Affordable Care Act can do something about the high cost of Sovaldi, right?\u201d Fairly or unfairly, many U.S. residents view the ACA as a salve for all that ails the nation\u2019s health care system. So what does the ACA do to hold down what some would call exorbitant prices for prescription drugs?\n\nTechnically, nothing.\n\nThe ACA does have several provisions that seek to control costs, but none of them relate to prescription drug pricing. And while lawmakers for years have suggested that the federal government be allowed to negotiate prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, no such provision made it into the ACA.\n\nCompromising Affordability?\n\nIn fact, the ACA might actually work to make certain drugs less affordable for some people. While all exchange plans must cover prescription drugs, insurers are permitted to use a tiered system of coverage. The highest tier \u2014 for \u201cspecialty medicines,\u201d which typically are costly, brand-name drugs \u2014 can feature comparatively large copayments and, in some cases, a separate deductible. As a result, consumers can be required to pay 100% of a drug\u2019s cost until the deductible is met, and those deductibles can vary by thousands of dollars.\n\nA number of patient advocacy groups already are alleging that insurers are giving wide berth to the letter of the law and discriminating against people with chronic illnesses by forcing them to pay more out of pocket for their treatments. The National Health Law Program, the AIDS Institute and other patient advocacy groups have filed a discrimination claim with HHS, and the department is in the process of developing a response.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans has responded to the claims, noting that consumers have the option to pick the plan best suited to them. Insurers have pointed to the high cost of new specialty drugs and say they are merely trying to control costs. The drug that they point to as an example of out-of-control prescription drug prices? Yep, Sovaldi.\n\nJust What the ACA Ordered\n\nIronically, a treatment like Sovaldi might just be exactly what the ACA had in mind.\n\nRemember those cost-control provisions in the the law? A major one is facilitating preventive care, in the hopes that investing in care now will hold down long-term costs for major illnesses. While the five-figure price tag for one round of Sovaldi is eye-popping to some, many observers note that it pales in comparison to the cost of treating the long-term effects of hepatitis C.\n\nAs University of Southern California\u2019s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics Executive Director Dana Goldman told Vox.com, \u201cWould I rather be spending $600,000 for a liver transplant and living a restricted life afterwards, or would I rather pay $80,000 up front and guarantee I never have to go through that?\u201d\n\nAround the Nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at several other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nLosing its power: Are Republicans backing away from using the ACA as a criticism against Democratic opponents? It appears so, according to Bloomberg\u2018s Heidi Przybyla. The Washington Post\u2018s \u201cMorning Plum\u201d evaluates Przybyla\u2019s claim.\n\nAn ACA alternative: Avik Roy, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and a former health care policy adviser to Mitt Romney, recently introduced his own plan to replace the ACA. He describes the plan in a post on his Forbes blog, \u201cThe Apothecary.\u201d Writing at the same blog, fellow Forbes contributor Yevgeniy Feyman evaluates the numbers on Roy\u2019s plan.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with CHIP?: Billy Wynne, a lawyer and founder and CEO of Healthcare Lighthouse, writing in a Health Affairs blog post examines the ACA\u2019s effect on CHIP and what will happen to the program in the coming years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many Americans believe the ACA should act as a salve for all things that ail the nation's health care system.
