Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Trump\u2019s \u201centire campaign is built on a lie\u201d because Trump has been \u201cenmeshed in the corruption.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCruz said, \u201cListen, every time Donald gets scared, he begins lashing out, attacking. he begins insulting, yelling. often begins cursing. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t curse in that particular riff. that will change. and, you know, I will say this. Donald\u2019s campaign, his entire campaign is built on a lie. I understand the people who are supporting him \u2026 Let me explain. I understand the people supporting Donald. They are frustrated with Washington. With politicians in both parties that have been lying to us that make promises and go to Washington and do the exact opposite of what they said. But if you are fed up with Washington, with the corruption of Washington, then it doesn\u2019t make any sense to support Donald Trump who has been enmeshed in the corruption of Washington. The lie behind Donald\u2019s campaign is that he\u2019ll stand up to Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is the system,\u201d he continued. \u201cDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton are flip sides of the same coin. Donald Trump has made billions buying influence in Washington. Hillary Clinton has made millions selling influence in Washington. Donald Trump has supported liberal Democratic politicians for 40 years from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid and Hillary Clinton as a presidential campaign, and Donald Trump has enriched himself using government power. And in every instance, Donald believes government is the solution. Whether it was supporting the Wall Street bailout, which he did. He supported Obama\u2019s bailout, supporting the Obama stimulus plan, or using eminent domain to take the homes of little old ladies or to try to do so in order to build a parking lot for his casinos.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz: Trump's 'Entire Campaign Is Built On A Lie'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz: Trump's 'Entire Campaign Is Built On A Lie'", "title": "Cruz: Trump's 'Entire Campaign Is Built On A Lie' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/cruz-5.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/21/cruz-trumps-entire-campaign-is-built-on-a-lie/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz: Trump's 'Entire Campaign Is Built On A Lie'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/cruz-5.jpg", "title": "Cruz: Trump's 'Entire Campaign Is Built On A Lie' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2016-03-21T18:29:57-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15a2\"", "article_summary": "Donald\u2019s campaign, his entire campaign is built on a lie.\n\u201cDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton are flip sides of the same coin.\nThe lie behind Donald\u2019s campaign is that he\u2019ll stand up to Washington.\u201d\u201cHe is the system,\u201d he continued.\nI understand the people supporting Donald.\nDonald Trump has made billions buying influence in Washington."}
