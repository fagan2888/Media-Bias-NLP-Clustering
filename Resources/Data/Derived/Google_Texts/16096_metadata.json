Plus, a new clip from the movie reveals a rape joke \u2014 something proud feminist Joss Whedon should know better than doing. But is the fuss about these things worthwhile?\n\nWell, yes. Words have meaning. And the words chosen by Renner, Evans, and Whedon in these situations happen to be words that demean women. When Black Widow is routinely left out of Age of Ultron merchandise, the fact that major players in the movie chose these words is extra uncomfortable.\n\nRenner and Evans\u2019 statements came during their press junket, in response to an interviewer asking them about fans \u201cshipping\u201d Black Widow with their characters while it seems she is involved with Bruce in this film. Renner immediately said, \u201cshe\u2019s a slut\u201d while Evans laughed and admitted he was going to say something similar, and then said, \u201cwhore.\u201d Renner went on to make derogatory comments about the character having a prosthetic leg. You can see the exchange at the beginning of this video:\n\nIn response to the furor, Evans released this statement:\n\nYesterday we were asked about the rumors that Black Widow wanted to be in a relationship with both Hawkeye and Captain America. We answered in a very juvenile and offensive way that rightfully angered some fans. I regret it and sincerely apologize.\n\nWhile Renner said:\n\nI am sorry that this tasteless joke about a fictional character offended anyone. It was not meant to be serious in any way. Just poking fun during an exhausting and tedious press tour.\n\nEvans\u2019 apology seems more heartfelt, while Renner\u2019s is one of those lovely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re offended\u201d apologies. It\u2019s hard to say if either one of them learned about why people were upset.\n\nMeanwhile, in the new clip, Iron Man makes a joke about reinstating Prima Nocta, which was a custom (best known to many from Braveheart) where a nobleman had the right to take the virginity of a peasant woman on her wedding night in place of her husband.\n\nSo, all of these statements are distasteful, certainly, but they\u2019re also all said in the context of a joke. I like jokes. I watch a lot of comedy. In case Whedon needs some help for future rape jokes, might I point him to Amy Schumer\u2019s recent sketch about football players and rape? Hilarious.\n\nThe biggest problem with all of these things is that while, yes, they\u2019re statements about fictional characters in a fictional world, they\u2019re also reflections of the things that people think are okay to say about women in real life.\n\nThink about the world where Prima Nocta was a real thing, and how it would\u2019ve been seen as a noble\u2019s due to rape any woman he wanted on her wedding night. And then think about the fact that there are a lot of men who don\u2019t think rape is rape or think that everyone else is a rapist too. That\u2019s in the real world. So it might be a throwaway joke to Whedon, but isn\u2019t he supposed to be this great feminist voice of our time? He\u2019s outspoken about any number of issues relating to women, so it seems very odd that he wouldn\u2019t know why this is tasteless \u2014 and unnecessary. It\u2019s not like the Prima Nocta thing was a really important part of the plot or necessary for some sort of character establishment.\n\nAnd in regards to the \u201cslut\u201d and \u201cwhore\u201d comments, Renner and Evans are real people who spoke off the cuff, and while that has less weight than a comment in a film that\u2019s been reviewed probably how many thousands of times between writing and release, those comments still have negative implications. Let\u2019s imagine a world where someone asked Scarlett Johansson about the Prima Nocta joke, and she laughingly referred to Tony Stark as a \u201crapist.\u201d People would probably be mad, right? Regardless of if it\u2019s a fictional character or not, people have feelings about how he\u2019s portrayed and what his character is. And commentary like that has real-world implications, as it portrays someone who makes a joke about rape as being equivalent to a rapist.\n\nWell, it\u2019s the same for female characters, weirdly enough. People have feelings about how they are portrayed and what their characters are. Black Widow isn\u2019t on a lot of merchandise and is already treated like a second-tier character in the movie universe. An offhand comment that a character like Black Widow is a \u201cslut\u201d or \u201cwhore\u201d because fans have shipped her with multiple characters has implications beyond just commentary on that character. It says that any woman, including real women, who dare to have multiple partners are \u201csluts\u201d or \u201cwhores.\u201d And I think we all know by now that guys who dare to have multiple partners are \u201cstuds,\u201d or at worst, \u201cplayers.\u201d\n\nEven in 2015, women cannot enjoy the same freedoms as men when it comes to dating or sex. This is true everywhere and that includes the comics industry. I\u2019ve listened to dozens of conversations among women comics professionals about how they navigate dating in our industry and how even a close friendship with a man, or leaving a bar at the wrong time, can lead to rumors and a negative reputation. This is a real concern that real women have in comics. Heck, I, a married, monogamous woman, was called a slut on social media when I was pleased about the Affordable Care Act covering birth control. When that\u2019s the world we live in, the use of derogatory terms like slut and whore aren\u2019t just simple jokes. They reinforce the way people \u2014 the way men \u2014 view and treat women.\n\nIt\u2019s great that Evans and Renner apologized. I hope Evans really is genuinely apologetic, and I hope that someone explains to Renner how his apology is lacking. Plus, Renner owes an additional apology for his ableist comments, which were also offensive. Hopefully they will learn not just, \u201coh, I can\u2019t say the things I want to say on press tours,\u201d but, \u201coh, words I use casually can still hurt people.\u201d That\u2019s true for everyone.\n\nAs for Whedon and the Prima Nocta joke, well. Just because someone fights on the right team doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not capable of a major screw-up. Over the years, Whedon has had his share of missteps as a feminist ally and supporter of women, so he should already know better. Words have meaning, and when women are still struggling for a lot of things, including acceptance in the comics community, it\u2019s salt in the wound to see language like this used so casually.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://screencrush.com/files/2015/02/avengers-2-black-widow1.jpg", "sailthru.author": "janelleasselin", "description": "Lots of missteps in the final days of the publicity rush for Avengers: Age of Ultron.
