The woman\u2019s lawyer, Andrew Laskin, is calling on the state of New York to revoke the medical license of Raj, who has settled at least one other malpractice suit in the past.\n\n\u201cHe knew she was in agony and that her skin was dying, layer by layer by layer \u2014 yet he chose to lie and cover it up. That is what a fraudster does, not a medical doctor,\u201d Laskin told reporters. \u201cFor that he will pay, and out of his own pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore he does this to someone else, [the state] must act to revoke his license to practice,\u201d he added.\n\nThe 26-year-old woman reportedly came to the gynecologist\u2019s upper Manhattan offices in 2011 with the hopes of trimming some of the excess stomach fat she had put on after her pregnancy. The procedure \u2013 which, according to court documents, was interrupted at least once when Raj left the room to sign for an order of Chinese food \u2013 was described as a minimally-invasive, four-hour long laser liposuction. At the end of the procedure, Raj bandaged the woman and sent her home with medication.\n\nA day later, the 26-year-old returned to Raj\u2019s practice with excruciating abdominal pain and swelling to her lower back. The gynecologist assured her that the wounds were not burns, and that there was no reason to go to the emergency room. Then, a few days later, the woman collapsed from unbearable pain and was rushed to the hospital.\n\nStanding by his dubious diagnosis, Raj told the woman over the phone that she still did not need emergency treatment and that she should return to his office right away. When she came back, he gave her a burn ointment and told her that she looked much better.\n\nA few days later, the woman went to another doctor to get a second opinion. She was immediately sent to New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center to undergo severe burn treatment and skin grafting surgery.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Daily News, Adriana Martino of Skinney Medspa said that the laser procedure is widely known as a no-risk, in-and-out alternative to traditional liposuction. Although the $150,000 equipment is typically used by plastic surgeons and dermatologists, it can be sold to any practicing physician.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to regulate what kind of doctor can operate it,\u201d Martino said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more about the consumer being smart and reading about it.\u201d\n\nThe court has not yet determined how much damages Raj will have to pay for the botched procedure.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "muraga raj liposuction, laser liposuction third degree burns, attorney andrew laskin, adriana martino skinney medspa", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 26-year-old woman was left deformed and severely scarred by a laser liposuction preformed by upper Manhattan OB/GYN Dr. Muraga Raj.", "title": "Manhattan OB/GYN Gives Patient Third-Degree Burns, Tells Her To Stay Away From Emergency Room", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/manhattan-obgyn-gives-patient-third-degree-burns-tells-her-stay-away-emergency-room-muraga-raj-56", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/16/hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 26-year-old woman was left deformed and severely scarred by a laser liposuction preformed by upper Manhattan OB/GYN Dr. Muraga Raj.", "title": "Manhattan OB/GYN Gives Patient Third-Degree Burns, Tells Her To Stay Away From Emergency Room", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/manhattan-obgyn-gives-patient-third-degree-burns-tells-her-stay-away-emergency-room-muraga-raj-56", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/16/hospital.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/16/hospital.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-16T19:54:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-16T20:37:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 26-year-old woman was left deformed and severely scarred by a laser liposuction preformed by upper Manhattan OB/GYN Dr. Muraga Raj."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda5ba\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe knew she was in agony and that her skin was dying, layer by layer by layer \u2014 yet he chose to lie and cover it up.\nAt the end of the procedure, Raj bandaged the woman and sent her home with medication.\nStanding by his dubious diagnosis, Raj told the woman over the phone that she still did not need emergency treatment and that she should return to his office right away.\nA New York City OB/GYN was found liable for medical malpractice after he tried to prevent a female patient from seeking care for the severe burns he accidentally inflicted on her stomach during a laser liposuction procedure.\nThen, a few days later, the woman collapsed from unbearable pain and was rushed to the hospital."}
