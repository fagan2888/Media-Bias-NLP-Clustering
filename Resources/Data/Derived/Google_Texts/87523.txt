ANALYSIS/OPINION:

It was President Woodrow Wilson who issued a presidential proclamation on May 9, 1914, officially establishing the first national Mother’s Day holiday - “as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of country.” He suggested that American flags be raised on the day as well.

The day has a complicated heritage. Historical accounts indicate that both Julia Ward Howe and Anna Jarvis were credited with the idea of Mother’s Day - as a day of peace and family times. Jarvis was not happy a decade in the aftermath, when the day took on commercial frills. But it was Wilson who ultimately lobbied Congress to set the second Sunday in March as Mothers Day.

The document itself was hand typed and signed by Wilson, bears an official seal and a date stamp - and is now part of the National Archives collection, where you can view the entire document. The day still appeals in a big way to Americans, who now spend $21.2 billion celebrating it.

“We all owe our mothers so much gratitude for their selfless love and support throughout our lives. This is a day to honor and celebrate our mothers for the sacrifices they made for us. I’m also especially mindful of the mothers who can’t be with their children today, particularly those who are serving our nation overseas or whose children are serving. They are always in our prayers.” says Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus.
