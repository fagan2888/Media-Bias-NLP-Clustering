His expletives have sideswiped even the deeply revered pope.\n\nDespite such brazen talk, Rodrigo Duterte has emerged as a top contender in Philippine presidential elections on May 9 in an impressive political rise that has been likened to Donald Trump\u2019s. The tough-talking mayor finds the comparison offensive and draws the line.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a bigot, I am not,\u201d Duterte told The Associated Press, referring to Trump\u2019s proposals to ban Muslims entering the U.S and erect a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nDuterte, 70, built a political name with his iron-fist approach to fighting crime in southern Davao city, where he has served as mayor for 22 years. He has been credited for turning the vast port region of about 1.5 million people from a Marxist insurgency-wracked murder capital in the 1980s to one of a few Philippine cities with a reputation for law and order and economic vibrancy.\n\nA lawyer, former government prosecutor and congressman, Duterte is the son of a former Davao provincial governor who grew up in a middle-class family that valued integrity. He has a penchant for mischief and recalls his mother, a school teacher, often punished him for misconduct by ordering him to kneel with hands extended sideways in front of a statue of Jesus Christ. He was once kicked out of high school for involvement in a brawl.\n\nIn Davao, Duterte has patrolled streets at night on a Harley Davidson and at times driven a taxi to try to catch robbers preying on drivers. He banned smoking and reportedly once forced a foreigner to chew a cigarette stick for violating the ordinance. Firecrackers, which kill and injure hundreds in the country during New Year\u2019s revelries, are prohibited and a nighttime curfew for minors has eased juvenile delinquency.\n\nWhat sets Duterte apart from other politicians is his devil-may-care way with expletives, often uttered in public in the local Tagalog language, when he lets off steam over criminality, corruption and government incompetence.\n\nIn his most infamous outburst, Duterte used an expletive on Pope Francis to express his disgust over a huge traffic jam caused by a papal visit to Manila last year that trapped the mayor for hours. Filipino bishops were shocked and he later apologized.\n\nNowadays, Duterte\u2019s cusses come with his trademark campaign battle cry to \u201ckill all\u201d criminals, fueling longstanding suspicions of his involvement in many unsolved killings of suspected criminals that authorities blame on vigilantes.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Duterte has offered to replicate his record in Davao to the rest of a Southeast Asian nation long weary of crime, rebellions and widespread corruption. He portrays himself as the \u201clast card\u201d of the people.\n\nJumping from mayor to president is a big leap in a country where leaders have traditionally risen from a national office, mostly as senators. Duterte\u2019s bold pledge to eradicate crime, especially drug trafficking and kidnappings, as well as corruption in three to six months has resonated with the public, but also sparked alarm and doubts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Philippine mayor guns for presidency on crime kill campaign", "title": "Philippine mayor guns for presidency on crime kill campaign", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Philippine mayor guns for presidency on crime kill campaign", "title": "Philippine mayor guns for presidency on crime kill campaign", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/27/philippine_mayor_guns_for_presidency_on_crime_kill_campaign/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/philippines-elections-dirty-harry.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Philippine mayor guns for presidency on crime kill campaign", "title": "Philippine mayor guns for presidency on crime kill campaign", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/philippines-elections-dirty-harry.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Gomez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In Davao, Duterte has patrolled streets at night on a Harley Davidson and at times driven a taxi to try to catch robbers preying on drivers.\nDuterte, 70, built a political name with his iron-fist approach to fighting crime in southern Davao city, where he has served as mayor for 22 years.\nOn the campaign trail, Duterte has offered to replicate his record in Davao to the rest of a Southeast Asian nation long weary of crime, rebellions and widespread corruption.\nJumping from mayor to president is a big leap in a country where leaders have traditionally risen from a national office, mostly as senators.\nThe tough-talking mayor finds the comparison offensive and draws the line."}
