A Virginia state representative recently told a webinar that nursing homes have orchestrated \u201cmass opt outs\u201d from the demo. An Illinois representative talked about resistance by durable medical equipment suppliers.\n\nWellPoint's Efforts\n\nLike Monson, WellPoint Vice President Lisa B. Wagamon also blamed provider opposition on a lack of understanding about the demonstration.\n\nWellPoint is working on demonstrations in California and Virginia\u2014as well as in Texas and New York\u2014which are to begin in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhat we're finding, in the Virginia market especially, that it's not the medical community that is asking members to disenroll,\u201d Wagamon said, but the long-term care facilities.\n\nThe facilities are concerned that the MMPs will deny care, give them orders and not reimburse them, according to Wagamon who is in charge of provider solutions for Medicare Medicaid duals. One health system told her \u201cwe don't want you in here looking under our covers.\u201d\n\nShe said that one nursing home in Virginia took the letters that had been sent out alerting residents that they had been passively enrolled in an MMP and sent them back to WellPoint unopened in one large envelope \u201cto let us know that they had all opted out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe try to explain to them that it's a partnership\u201d Wagamon said, and to alert them to the services and care coordination that beneficiaries are entitled to as members.\n\nNo Information Released\n\nAdult day care centers have been problematic when managed care companies need help locating a beneficiary that has been assigned to the demo, she said.\n\nWhen the managed care company observes a report that indicates a member has gone to a day care center, the MMP will contact the center to get a phone number or address. However, the centers have refused to divulge the information, she said.\n\nThe medical community, on the other hand, lacks understanding about who and what is a dual-eligible beneficiary. She said the doctors view members only as Medicare beneficiaries, in part because members may be \u201cembarrassed\u201d to tell the doctor they are dually eligible, which makes it difficult to encourage the doctors to join the managed care network.\n\nIn addition to the mass training that is given to providers by the states, WellPoint is \u201cgoing out to each office that will let us in,\u201d Wagamon said. Company reps will ask the doctors, for example, how the MMP's care coordinators can help them with some of their problematic patients, such as those who don't show up for appointments. Results have been mixed, she said.\n\nCalifornia's Issues\n\nIn California, disenrollment has been a particular problem. About 40 percent have opted out in the five counties that have the program operational, with almost 50 percent in Los Angeles County, according to a state report.\n\nProvider influence on enrollment is a big problem, particularly in Los Angeles, Diane Sargent, senior director of dual eligible product management and program implementation at Health Net Inc., told the conference.\n\nHigh levels of opt-out rates have been found in certain ethnic neighborhoods, particularly in areas with community providers who don't accept managed care, she said.\n\nFor example, a You Tube video posted in Armenian by one provider warns beneficiaries not to join the demo. High levels of opt outs also have been found in Korean neighborhoods, she said.\n\nA beneficiary who receives a \u201cconfusing notice\u201d about enrollment is \u201clikely to go to a trusted adviser\u201d who is a fee-for-service physician, Sargent said.\n\nIn addition, she added, beneficiary advocates in the state haven't been \u201cpleased with the passive enrollment process.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mindy Yochelson in Washington at myochelson@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ward Pimley at wpimley@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/demonstration-project-faces-n17179917946/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Nov. 19 - Attempts to educate health-care providers about the merits of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service's demonstration for dual eligibles has been one of the top challenges...", "title": "Demonstration Project Faces Challenges\u2014Misunderstanding, Bias"}, "csrf-token": "v4x0Kb1aOVi5qA5yN1otSHUhd4DHJ2N8wWNSTcFOXAVjB5DspsTZKlcy1bfCvTSxdmTBz1jBjrYuMlL_D2hgMOx5vK_TfzfXhuvNkB4s1PI1:OPYaLBIC8p4cOVXIQkGMMXnHs-VZqsXdghg6whe8h6f0OBBrYj8cPoyxHCNRP4F7zvYNF9RsHCJQhe5zoSphFBqrlDl9HjvCTN6ZtnK5Dv81", "description": "Nov", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36fa\"", "article_summary": "Providers, particularly nursing homes, have encouraged opt-outs because they don't understand the product, Monson said during a summit on the demonstration sponsored by World Congress.\nNo Information ReleasedAdult day care centers have been problematic when managed care companies need help locating a beneficiary that has been assigned to the demo, she said.\nStates also have complained about provider influence, particularly nursing facilities.\nWellPoint's EffortsLike Monson, WellPoint Vice President Lisa B.
