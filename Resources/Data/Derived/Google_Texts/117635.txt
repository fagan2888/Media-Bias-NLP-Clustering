Senator Orrin Hatch spoke recently at the Federalist Society’s annual conference and had some tough words (from a politician, anyway) for his ideological opponents, laughing as he called progressives just “straight old dumbass liberals.”

Hatch touted how the midterm voters “delivered a decisive blow” to President Obama, as well as “his progressive agenda.” And here, Hatch went off-the-cuff, remarking, “I get a big kick out of them using the word ‘progressive.’ My gosh, they’re just straight old dumbass liberals anyway.”

The crowd, of course, loved it.

And this seems to be Hatch’s favorite off-color word to use in public, seeing as how back in 2011 he called Obamacare a “stupid, dumbass program.”
