And it is incumbent on us in this Christmas season to tell the truth about that. Recently A&E suspended Phil Robertson, the patriarch of its hit show, \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d for making incredibly homophobic statements in a GQ magazine interview. In typical fashion, he affirmed his evangelical belief that homosexuality is a sin, but went even further, comparing gay people\u2019s sexual behavior to bestiality, and declaring emphatically that they would not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nLiberal-minded folk, some Christians included, have been outraged at his homophobia, while conservative Christians of all races jumped to defend his right to free speech. Many of these Christians feel particularly threatened by what they call \u201ccensorship\u201d of Robertson, because the belief that homosexuality is a sin, and the right to declare that belief freely without recourse, has become for many of these people a defining marker of their identity as Christians.\n\nA reluctant evangelical, I reject conservative theological teachings on homosexuality; the violence that the Church does to gay people in the name of God is indeed one of the primary reasons for my reluctance. But I am also ambivalent about the Church because of its continued subjugation of women and its failure to be forthright about its continuing racism problem.\n\nI grew up in a black baptist church, in a small town in North Central Louisiana, about 30 miles west of where \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d is filmed. I made my first \u201cprofession of faith\u201d in Jesus Christ while at a white baptist church I had visited with my childhood best friend, Amanda, when I was about 7 years old. I was baptized at the age of 13.\n\nAt 33 years of age, my disillusionment with the church \u2014 which has come to full bloom in the last five years or so \u2014 is the thing that perhaps most solidly marks me as a member of the Millennial generation. Though I am often ambivalent about that label, too, I still get why Millennials, fed up with the vile homophobia of the church \u2014 as particularly evidenced by the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d episode \u2014 are leaving the institution in droves. But in the fervor and closing of ranks over Robertson\u2019s homophobia, many Christians, white and Black, old and young alike, have missed the racist remarks he made in that same interview. Millennials, it turns out, haven\u2019t proven themselves to be fundamentally better on race, despite post-racial proclamations to the contrary.\n\nApparently, according to Robertson, 1950s and 60s Louisiana \u2014 the Louisiana of his childhood \u2014 was a happy heavenly place where Black people hoed cotton and eschewed the blues:\n\n\u201cI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I\u2019m with the blacks, because we\u2019re white trash. We\u2019re going across the field. \u2026 They\u2019re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, \u2018I tell you what: These doggone white people\u2019 \u2014 not a word! \u2026 Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\u201d\n\nI have several aunts and uncles and a grandparent who would beg to differ with Robertson\u2019s account of events. In 1956, several hundred African Americans were purged from the voter registration rolls in Monroe, and spent years struggling to be re-enfranchised.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many people of faith have rushed to denounce Phil Robertson's homophobia \u2014\u00a0but his racism is a different story", "title": "Evangelical church\u2019s ugly truth: \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d and Christian racists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Many people of faith have rushed to denounce Phil Robertson's homophobia \u2014\u00a0but his racism is a different story", "title": "Evangelical church\u2019s ugly truth: \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d and Christian racists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/24/evangelical_churchs_ugly_truth_duck_dynasty_and_christian_racists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/duck_dynasty.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many people of faith have rushed to denounce Phil Robertson's homophobia \u2014\u00a0but his racism is a different story", "title": "Evangelical church\u2019s ugly truth: \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d and Christian racists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/duck_dynasty.jpg", "creator": "@professorcrunk", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brittney Cooper", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Christianity, duck dynasty, Editor's Picks, Evangelical Christianity, Jesus Christ, phil robertson, Racism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Christianity, duck dynasty, Editor's Picks, Evangelical Christianity, Jesus Christ, phil robertson, Racism, Media News, News, Politics NewsThe Evangelical Church has a racism problem.\nRecently A&E suspended Phil Robertson, the patriarch of its hit show, \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d for making incredibly homophobic statements in a GQ magazine interview.\nI grew up in a black baptist church, in a small town in North Central Louisiana, about 30 miles west of where \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d is filmed.\nBut in the fervor and closing of ranks over Robertson\u2019s homophobia, many Christians, white and Black, old and young alike, have missed the racist remarks he made in that same interview.\nThough I am often ambivalent about that label, too, I still get why Millennials, fed up with the vile homophobia of the church \u2014 as particularly evidenced by the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d episode \u2014 are leaving the institution in droves."}
