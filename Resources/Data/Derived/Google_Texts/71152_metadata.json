Specifically, he was blamed for the incendiary remarks he had made at previous events encouraging violence against some protestors. For example, he announced that he would pay the legal bills to defend a man who punched an anti-Trump protestor as he was being escorted out of a Trump event (while extending his middle finger to the crowd).\n\nThat those comments were incendiary is incontrovertible. In my last column, I listed many additional reasons for my opposition to Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, when the left levels the charge of \u201cincendiary,\u201d it betrays a lack of self-awareness that is a marvel to behold. When it comes to incendiary statements in American life, the left has close to a monopoly. And these statements are not made by one individual whose affiliation with the left is new and tenuous \u2014 as Trump\u2019s affiliation with Republicans and conservatives is \u2014 but by the most distinguished politicians, artists, writers, academics and journalists on the left.\n\nSuch comments are made so often that most folks on the left do not consider them incendiary \u2014 just everyday truths.\n\nThe president of the United States has contributed to a level of racial tension unlike any we have seen in a generation. Black anger at America has actually increased since Barack Obama was elected. Perhaps this was inevitable given how many hopes most Black Americans placed on having a Black president. But incendiary statements by the president have exacerbated this tension.\n\nThe most egregious and damaging has been the president\u2019s reiteration of the term \u201cFerguson,\u201d as if the killing of Michael Brown by a white police officer in that Missouri city was an act of wanton \u2014 and race-based \u2014 murder. That is incendiary, because it is a lie. Blacks who witnessed that incident and who have no love for the police testified to how legitimate the white officer\u2019s actions were.\n\nNearly every Democratic leader and liberal columnist has stated that much of the Republican criticism of Barack Obama is due to racism \u2014 as if Republicans were easier on Bill Clinton or will be on Hillary Clinton because they are white.\n\nWriting during the debate over the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote that Republicans are \u201cprobably reacting less to what Mr. Obama is doing, or even to what they\u2019ve heard about what he\u2019s doing, than to who he is.\u201d It\u2019s not Obamacare the Republicans opposed, he suggests, it\u2019s largely Obama\u2019s race. \u201cThe driving force,\u201d he continued \u201cis probably ... cultural and racial anxiety.\u201d\n\nIs that incendiary?\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter: \u201cI think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a Black man, that he\u2019s African-American.\u201d\n\nIs that incendiary?\n\nNew York Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal: \u201cThere has been a racist undertone to many of the Republican attacks leveled against President Obama for the last three years.\u201d\n\nIs that incendiary?\n\nWhat about the \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d doctrine that the left uses in almost every college to indoctrinate students against whites? Or the notion close to universally held among left-wing academics that only whites can be racist?\n\nAre those incendiary?\n\nThe left labels every white who opposes race-based affirmative action a racist, and labels every Black who opposes it an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d\n\nIs that incendiary?\n\nWhile Donald Trump\u2019s provocative comment that he\u2019d like to punch the nose of a protester who disrupted one of his rallies may have led to one man being punched at a different rally, the left\u2019s drumbeat of incendiary anti-police rhetoric has led directly to police and innumerable others being killed. So many police have disengaged from proactive policing in Black neighborhoods because of the \u201cFerguson Effect,\u201d that the number of murders in cities such as Chicago has increased dramatically.\n\nBut the left\u2019s incendiary comments are hardly confined to charges of racism.\n\nLeft-wing professors at virtually every American university regularly call Israel an \u201capartheid state.\u201d In my debate at the venerable Oxford Union in 2014, one of my opponents, a left-wing Ph.D. from Berkeley, said that Israel is doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to the Jews. And during the last Israel-Hamas war, actors Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, and director Pedro Almodovar labeled Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and a \u201cwar of extermination.\u201d\n\nAre these left-wing libels of Israel incendiary?\n\nFor that matter, recall the left-wing reactions to my completely respectful column in the Jewish Journal on the Torah teaching the importance of maintaining the male-female distinction. I was accused of cruelty, intolerance, bigotry, hate, publicly humiliating someone, being like a murderer, ignorance, and much more by left-wing rabbis and other left-wing Jews in leadership positions.\n\nIs that incendiary?\n\nThe left labels every American who believes that marriage should remain defined as the union of a man and a woman a hater, a bigot, and, of course, a homophobe.\n\nIs that incendiary?\n\nThe left labels Americans troubled by the influx of many millions of illegal immigrants \u201cxenophobic,\u201d \u201cnativist\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nIs that incendiary?\n\nHere\u2019s a difference between conservatives and liberals one might ponder. Virtually every major Republican and conservative, myself included, has called Donald Trump\u2019s statements incendiary. Yet there isn\u2019t a left-wing voice of which I am aware that has labeled any of the above incendiary.\n\nConservatives criticize their own. The left only criticizes the right.\n\nDennis Prager\u2019s nationally syndicated radio talk show is heard in Los Angeles from 9 a.m. to noon on KRLA (AM 870).
