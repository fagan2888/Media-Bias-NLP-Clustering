His skin cancer was discovered after a small mass on his liver was removed and biopsied earlier this month, revealing a diagnosis of melanoma, reports CNN. Tiny spots of melanoma were also found in the former president\u2019s brain.\n\nCarter, 90, will be undergoing treatment for his advanced melanoma from doctors at Emory University.\n\nThe Cost of Melanoma Treatment and Radiation Therapy for Jimmy Carter\n\nCarter will undergo radiation treatment that will target the cancerous spots. Radiation therapy can cost between $10,000 and $50,000 for patients not covered by health insurance, according to CostHelper.com. Of course, the cost depends on the type of cancer and the number of treatments, among other factors.\n\nThe drug Pembrolizumab, known as Keytruda in the U.S., was approved by the FDA in September 2014. The drug is used when melanoma cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. It costs $12,500 for monthly treatments, reports the Wall Street Journal. Carter is set to receive four treatments of this drug at three-week intervals, according to CNN.\n\nIn all, Carter\u2019s melanoma treatment will likely be expensive. Former presidents could be entitled to health insurance coverage and medical care under the Former Presidents Act. However, \u201cJimmy Carter served a single presidential term, and, therefore, does not qualify for federally funded health benefits,\u201d according to a report from the Congressional Research Service. Carter likely still has health insurance coverage of some kind and probably won\u2019t have to cover his medical costs out-of-pocket.\n\nJimmy Carter\u2019s Skin Cancer Puts Book Tour on Hold\n\nJimmy Carter\u2019s skin cancer diagnosis forced him to put a book tour on hold and rearrange his schedule. The former president was promoting his latest memoir, \u201cA Full Life: Reflections at Ninety.\u201d Putting the book tour on hold could possibly curb earnings for Carter, but it\u2019s a sacrifice that needed to be made to get the former president the treatment he needs.\n\nCarter\u2019s finances hopefully won\u2019t be hurt too much by this missed opportunity, especially with his already-sizable fortune. Jimmy Carter\u2019s net worth of $5 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth, is still an impressive amount.\n\nKeep reading: From JFK to Abraham Lincoln: The 10 Richest and Poorest U.S. Presidents\n\nWatch: Jimmy Carter\u2019s Legacy\n\nJimmy Carter served as the president of the United States from 1977 and 1981.
