As you can see, it's dropped once again, from 11.9 percent last quarter to 11.4 percent this quarter. In case that seems a little bloodless, that means that over a million Americans are now insured who weren't last quarter. For the entire year, nearly 4 million people are newly insured. Since the peak just before Obamacare went into effect, 16 million Americans have gained health insurance. And if Republican-controlled states hadn't thrown a collective temper tantrum and refused to accept Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, the total number would be more like 20 million.\n\nNot bad. Still a lot of work to do, but not a bad start.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/07/chart-day-obamacare-keeps-working", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Chart of the day: Obamacare keeps on working"}, "twitter": {"title": "Chart of the day: Obamacare keeps on working", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/07/chart-day-obamacare-keeps-working", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "I got distracted on Friday and failed to pass along the latest Gallup poll of health insurance coverage in the US.\nSince the peak just before Obamacare went into effect, 16 million Americans have gained health insurance.\nIn case that seems a little bloodless, that means that over a million Americans are now insured who weren't last quarter.\nAs you can see, it's dropped once again, from 11.9 percent last quarter to 11.4 percent this quarter.\nStill a lot of work to do, but not a bad start."}
