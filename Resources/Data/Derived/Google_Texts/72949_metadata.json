Soon after the box they arrive in is pried opened, each piece of white truffle is carefully unloaded and analyzed for flaws. Then they are individually wrapped in paper towels and placed on a scale to ensure the total weight matches the amount the Italian eatery purchased. \u201cI\u2019m not shy to [immediately] tell the vendor that provided us with truffles that there is something wrong with the product,\u201d Trabocchi said. \u201cTechnology helps us a lot nowadays because we can shoot them a picture within three seconds.\u201d The rare bulbous ingredient, which is found buried among roots in select patches of Italy\u2019s hillside oak and hazelnut groves, cannot be cultivated like its black winter counterpart. Foragers traverse the soil carefully with dogs trained to sniff out and dig up the pungent tuber, and then pass it along a series of hyper-competitive and, at times, secretive market channels before it lands on plates overseas. As in the luxury art and jewelry worlds, only the most reliable connoisseurs are trusted as sellers.\n\nDepending on quality and availability, Fiola features white truffles on menus from September to January, roughly when the hunting season back in Italy has finished. Between October and March, Trabocchi offers black winter truffles, which grow in the wild and can be cultivated on plantations in Italy and, most famously, near P\u00e9rigord, France. During the short seasons, a coterie of the world\u2019s gourmet chefs, celebrities, and business moguls compete over a limited supply, which has grown scarcer over the years because of the increases in temperature and reductions in rainfall that climate change has brought to the world\u2019s best truffle-growing regions. The schemes span continents and truffle types, but all of them boil down to scarcity and cash. Trabocchi works exclusively with suppliers he\u2019s developed a relationship with over the years, and even then, he subjects them to a certain amount of interrogation. \u201cI always ask the source of the truffles. I always ask when they landed into the United States,\u201d Trabocchi said. But both producers and buyers who do not exercise the same caution are vulnerable. The high-end industry has spawned a shadowy underworld, where tax evasion, nighttime heists, counterfeits, and sabotage are not uncommon. The schemes span continents and truffle types, but all of them boil down to scarcity and cash. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a short season. And for some people that make their profit within very tiny windows of the span of an entire 12 months, it\u2019s very important that they\u2019re making the best out of it,\u201d Trabocchi said. \u201cTherefore, sometimes, maybe [cash motivates] people to do things that are not completely legitimate.\u201d According to Bruno Capanna, the president of the truffle foraging association in Acqualagna (one of Italy\u2019s most productive truffle-growing areas), white truffles typically retail for between \u20ac2,000 and \u20ac5,000 per kilogram (or between $2,753 and $6,883). Top black winter truffles go for between \u20ac1,500 to \u20ac3,000 per kilogram. The demand for truffles, which is especially high around the holiday season, tends to outpace the supply. And competition for product from renowned areas like Alba, Italy (the Mecca of white truffles) and P\u00e9rigord, France (home to the best winter blacks) can be even fiercer. \u201cIt\u2019s a very well-sought-after ingredient [for] any fine-dining establishment, all over the world, even if they\u2019re not Italian restaurants,\u201d Trabocchi said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re buying, I don\u2019t know, the price is caviar, but it\u2019s only available from September to January,\u201d he added, referring to the whites.\n\nIn November, an anonymous bidder from Hong Kong\u2014purportedly a \u201c\u2018famous Chinese writer\u2019\u201d\u2014placed a call by satellite phone to a white truffle auction at a castle in Italy\u2019s Piedmont region and shelled out $120,000, or three times the price of gold, for two pieces weighing a total of just over two pounds. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was gifted an $8,000 specimen from the same auction, which he promptly gave away to a local school. In 2012, after Jay-Z dropped more than $20,000 at Alba\u2019s local truffle haunts, traders speculated that he could do for their market what he did for Cristal champagne. The rapper P. Diddy once demanded that New York-based French chef Daniel Boulud \u201cshave that bitch\u201d onto his plate. And back in 2010, Macau casino tycoon Stanley Ho spent $330,000 on two pieces that weighed 2.87 pounds. Various attempts to explain the value of the fungus have veered into farcical territory. Writing in Time, food writer Josh Ozersky once described its scent as \u201ca combination of newly plowed soil, fall rain, burrowing earthworms and the pungent memory of lost youth and old love affairs.\u201d New York City chef and Food Network notable Alex Guarnaschelli told Ozersky: \"It conjures up images of a locker room. But the aroma deceptively conceals their complex yet delicate taste. They are sublime.\" The aroma is so unique, Trabocchi said, that a few slices sprinkled over a simple dish can generate a transcendent, \u201csort of umami experience.\u201d \u201cWhen you use truffles in general, my philosophy is that you don\u2019t need anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truffle is the star of the dish. [While] there\u2019s nothing wrong [with slicing] some black truffle over a beautifully cooked piece of beef or over foie gras to make the indulgence of a very extremely high level, I think that especially when you use white truffle or winter black truffle ... they just solely need to showcase themselves in a simple preparation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt Fiola, that\u2019s exactly what he offers, and at a comparatively practical price of $85. Epicureans can enjoy it shaved over their choice of the Piedmont region\u2019s classic pairs: freshly made and generously buttered Tajarin noodles, a simple Parmesan risotto, or a few farm-raised eggs. Customers can also swallow with at least some certainty that shady truffle bandits haven\u2019t tainted their bite.\n\n*** Though some news organizations, including CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes, have painted the darker actors in the truffle industry as members of a Mafia-style organization (it is Italy, after all), Federico Balestra, the president of one of the largest Italian truffle purveyors, Sabatino Tartufi, balks at the notion that there are truffle bosses ordering assassinations in the name of fungi. \u201cEverybody likes to talk about a great world war where ... weird stuff is going on,\u201d Balestra said. But he insists that most crimes in the industry are committed by rogue truffle hunters trying to up their profit margins during a short season, rather than a murderous criminal network with a top-down stranglehold on the industry. Balestra, who is originally from Italy and now runs his grandfather\u2019s business from New York, offered a helpful analogy: a man once entered his father-in-law\u2019s New Jersey Chevrolet dealership and shot his colleagues. The unfortunate incident didn\u2019t \u201cmean that they have a business that is full of crooks, or full of delinquents,\u201d he said, it simply indicated that \u201csomebody\u2019s crazy.\u201d The same lesson holds for the truffle business. But judging by his and others\u2019 descriptions, the industry has known its fair share of insanity. At least one attempted truffle heist has ended with a fatality. In 2010, a truffle farmer named Laurent Rimbaud spotted a man skulking under the oaks of his truffle patch in the village of Grignan, in southern France. Fearing that the man was carrying a weapon, Rimbaud fired his hunting rifle twice, connecting with the man\u2019s thigh and head. The local thief, who was known to police, succumbed to his wounds not long after, and a local prosecutor filed a case against Rimbaud. Nighttime truffle thefts had become so common, though, that around 250 fellow farmers and truffle growers staged a march to protest the legal action against Rimbaud, with one lamenting that truffle fields had become \u201copen-air safes.\u201d\n\nThough deaths are certainly rare, Balestra does admit there are certain criminal acts that are considered standard costs of doing business. Most, if not all, truffle hunters refuse to produce tax invoices for buyers and will only accept cash for their goods. The Italian government is so familiar with truffle tax evasion that it allows truffle distributors to pay the fees on behalf of hunters, and Balestra said that most companies do exactly that. Even the Italian truffle supplier Urbani Tartufi, which commands a self-professed 70 percent of the international truffle trade (competitors dispute that market share), has been accused of tax evasion. \"They give a gift, for when they die or something. They say, 'That\u2019s a good place to go truffle hunting.'\" Secrecy is also common. The exact locations of the parcels of dirt where truffles are uncovered is often guarded from even close friends because a select patch of forest can often translate into a consistent source of wealth over a lifetime. An average Italian working a typical job may only bring home between \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac2,000 each month. If that same person leaves work, picks up his dog, and goes for a jaunt through the woods each day during truffle season, Balestra explained, even stumbling upon one pound of truffles could mean doubling his monthly salary in just a few lucky hours. Sometimes, a hunter may even conceal the spots from his own sons. \"That's a secret, unique thing,\" Balestra said. \"They give a gift, for when they die or something.\u2026 They say, 'That's a good place to go truffle hunting.'\" Local rivalries can also sow jealousy, especially when certain farmers are blessed with particularly large hauls. The drive to beat out neighbors can lead to sabotage and other malicious tactics. A well-trained canine, especially one with a record of success, can make for an easy first target. Even the best-trained truffle hunters usually rely on dogs (or pigs, though they have been known to eat the truffles before allowing their handlers to retrieve them). Pointers, hounds, and setters are often used, and they can retail for between \u20ac2,000 and \u20ac5,000. Truffle hunters \u201ccan tell you which side of the land has more truffles than the others but, from there, to actually be able to smell it and remove the surface and find the truffles underground, [there\u2019s] a hell of a difference,\u201d Trabocchi said. That\u2019s where the dog comes in. \u201cThey are certainly the most prized tool of work for a truffle hunter,\u201d he added.\n\nAs a result, some hunters have planted spiked traps or poisoned meatballs in the weeds of select patches to eliminate expertly trained dogs, and then returned to the area later to sweep up truffles with their own hounds. The best-trained dogs have also been known to go missing. In August, truffle hunter Luke Fegatilli had three hounds worth \u20ac7,000 stolen from his farm in Celano, Italy. The loot included a curly-haired Lagotto Romagnolo, a breed famed for its truffle-detection abilities. \"The dogs disappear into a kind of black hole,\u201d Fegatilli told the local press, adding that there was a \u201creal war\u201d unfolding in his countryside. Newspaper ads displaying pictures of stolen truffle dogs are not rare. Securing hilly swathes of land against thieves who enter people\u2019s property at night is extremely difficult, and often requires constant patrol. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to control because you have acres, acres, and acres,\u201d Balestra said. Even if an intruder is spotted breaching a fence, itself a costly investment, it can be almost impossible to track the trespasser through, say, a forest. According to Fran\u00e7ois Le Tacon, a French truffle scientist and the director of research at a Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine-affiliated laboratory focused on forest microorganisms, many property owners have attempted to protect their truffle orchards with trespassing signs\u2014a practice that, predictably, has done little to halt robberies. Le Tacon\u2019s own research is focused on increasing truffle production through pruning and irrigation of the cultivated plantations in southern France. In a grove of three-decade-old trees in Vaucluse, a fertile farming region in southeastern France where Le Tacon conducts experiments with the cooperation of a private owner, bandits snuck in at night with dogs and without detection, stealing large quantities of truffles. Ironically, the heist ruined an experiment designed to eliminate, or at least better manage, the low yields that most likely motivated the crime. Federico Balestra balks at the notion that there are truffle bosses ordering assassinations in the name of fungi. French authorities have, at times, taken extreme measures to catch thieves, including conducting \u201cparamilitary\u201d patrols near truffle farms and setting up \u201croadblocks to search cars for stolen fungi.\u201d\n\nThieves\u2019 tactics have been equally dramatic. At sunrise one morning in November 2007, Dario Pastrone, a well-known truffle hunter, was driving a car loaded with \u20ac2,000 worth of white truffles to a truffle market in the Italian town of Asti when a car pulled alongside him and forced him off the road. Three men, dressed as police officers, leapt out and asked Pastrone where he was concealing his drugs. They popped open the trunk, grabbed 400 grams worth of truffles, and fled. In 2012, at least two truffle bandits broke through the security gates of a facility belonging to Urbani Tartufi in Sant'Anatolia di Narco. They covered up surveillance cameras, pried open a warehouse door, removed between \u20ac50,000 and \u20ac60,000 worth of truffles and associated merchandise, and sped away. *** Truffle crime doesn\u2019t just afflict producers. Restaurants and other big-time purchasers must also carefully evaluate sellers to ensure they\u2019re not being fooled by substandard or counterfeit product. The largest, most shapely truffles command a much higher price on the market than their smaller, irregular counterparts. \u201cWhen I\u2019m paying [for] truffles, I try to compare always to the diamond business,\u201d Balestra said. \u201cWhen you have a truffle [that\u2019s] full of soil, or is cut, the shape is not round, it\u2019s worth a lot less money than a truffle that\u2019s round, is perfect, and is hard.\u201d But as in the diamond industry, truffle hunters and merchants will try to conceal imperfections to increase their profits. A wayward hunter or middleman may infuse cracks in the fungus with topsoil to increase its weight and therefore its price. Other shady operators may try to offload worm- or bug-infested truffles, or use mud or pieces of other truffles to reconstruct damaged product. \u201cAnd you only figure that one out after you bought it, and a portion of the [truffle] kind of crumbles on your hands,\u201d Trabocchi said. Buyers must also beware of truffles that do not come from the regions that suppliers advertise\u2014usually Alba, Italy for whites and P\u00e9rigord, France for blacks. But that type of mischief can be tolerated, Trabocchi noted. Most French and Italian truffles are of high quality, no matter the valley or mountainside where they were found.\n\nThe underlying problem is that there\u2019s simply not enough European truffle supply to meet demand. France produced around 1,000 tons of black truffle in the early 1800s, but that number has fallen steeply to around 30 or 40 tons today, according to Le Tacon. Experts like him believe climate change has contributed to this decline. Lower rainfall means less water is showering trees and soil, where fungi flourish. Increasing temperatures have spurred surface evaporation, meaning even less water is reaching tree roots. In addition, farmers often fail to regularly prune and irrigate truffle orchards. Le Tacon is working to change this state of affairs, but it takes 10 to 15 years before inoculated tree seedlings bloom with fungi. \u201cIt takes a long time to invert the curve,\u201d Le Tacon said. The lagging production has forced French and even Italian suppliers to import truffles from outside Europe, mainly from China. About 30 or 40 tons are imported from China to France each year, Le Tacon estimates. A Chinese truffle will only go for about $70 or $80, whereas a black winter truffle from France may sell for 10 times that amount to a wholesaler like Balestra\u2019s Sabatino Tartufi. The two types of truffles are almost indistinguishable, even for experts. \u201cReally, I cannot make the distinction between Chinese black truffles and P\u00e9rigord black truffles,\u201d Le Tacon explained. \u201cTo recognize them, we have to use molecular tools.\u201d He added that the flavor is also nearly identical, but that\u2019s only if the truffles are eaten fresh. \u201cMaybe the intensity of the flavor is less with the Chinese truffle, but [it is] really difficult to [tell] the difference,\u201d he said. In the southern Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, according to Le Tacon, who has traveled there, truffles grow naturally in millions of hectares of wild forest. Since trees there stand far apart, and goats graze shrubbery and small plants, abundant rainfall can reach the open soil and truffles with relative ease. The supply is so vast that low-paid workers use rakes to pull truffles out of the ground, no dogs necessary. The relatively high supply and low labor investment combine to lower the price of Chinese truffles.\n\nSome truffle snobs maintain that the taste and smell of the black Chinese truffle is inferior to its European counterpart, but that\u2019s not because the Chinese variety is categorically deficient. The real culprit is travel time. Truffles are extremely perishable and the delivery channels from China to Europe are notoriously slow, which means the tubers often arrive in poor condition. \u201cThey smell very badly,\u201d Le Tacon said. \u201cSometimes, they are rotten.\u201d Nonetheless, Chinese truffles are occasionally mixed in with European batches and fraudulently sold as Europe\u2019s finest because they are so hard to tell apart without microscopic scrutiny. Often, the problem is not discovered until a chef comes across them during a taste or smell test in the kitchen. \u201cYou only realize that when you start to slice them, then you notice that one has a lot of flavor, and one doesn\u2019t,\u201d Trabocchi said. Passing Chinese truffles off as European has become so pervasive that the practice has even come across the desks of the folks at Interpol, the international police organization. \u201cThis is a trend, for sure, that has been identified immediately, from the very first operation that we carried out,\u201d said Interpol criminal intelligence officer Simone Di Meo, referring to Operation Opson, a task force focused on tracking substandard and counterfeit foods. The agency, which helps law enforcement outfits around the world share criminal intelligence, has recruited Asian partners like South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines to the project, but Chinese authorities have shown no interest in cooperating. \u201cInformation from the private sector should be followed up by [information from Chinese] police officers and translated into police knowledge with seizures, with arrests, and so on,\u201d Di Meo explained. (Enlisting the private sector in investigating food crimes isn\u2019t always easy either, since companies are often not willing to share intelligence, fearing brand destruction if the information goes public.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nighttime heists, Chinese knockoffs, and poisoned meatball-sabotage: Inside the high-stakes pursuit of the world&#39;s most-prized fungus.", "author": "Ryan Jacobs", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Nighttime heists, Chinese knockoffs, and poisoned meatball-sabotage: Inside the high-stakes pursuit of the world&#39;s most-prized fungus.", "title": "The Dark Side of the Truffle Trade", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/RTX16UTB/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-the-truffle-trade/283073/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Even the Italian truffle supplier Urbani Tartufi, which commands a self-professed 70 percent of the international truffle trade (competitors dispute that market share), has been accused of tax evasion.\n\u201cWhen you have a truffle [that\u2019s] full of soil, or is cut, the shape is not round, it\u2019s worth a lot less money than a truffle that\u2019s round, is perfect, and is hard.\u201d But as in the diamond industry, truffle hunters and merchants will try to conceal imperfections to increase their profits.\nSome truffle snobs maintain that the taste and smell of the black Chinese truffle is inferior to its European counterpart, but that\u2019s not because the Chinese variety is categorically deficient.\n\u201cReally, I cannot make the distinction between Chinese black truffles and P\u00e9rigord black truffles,\u201d Le Tacon explained.\n\u201cMaybe the intensity of the flavor is less with the Chinese truffle, but [it is] really difficult to [tell] the difference,\u201d he said."}
