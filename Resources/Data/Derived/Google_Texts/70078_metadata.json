That\u2019s a big jump from 2012, when fewer than half of pre-retirees expressed such concern.\n\nThose findings speak to increasing anxiety among older workers\u2014and cry out for benefits professionals to provide resources for employees who are nearing retirement age.\n\nAccording to the poll of 801 workers over age 50, 75% of pre-retirees say their top retirement fear is out-of-control health care costs. However, 64% say they haven\u2019t discussed retirement with a financial advisor. Of those that did, only 22% discussed how they would pay for health care needs not covered by Medicare.\n\n\u201cWhether it is the economy, concerns about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act or skyrocketing health care costs, this survey shows America\u2019s workers are increasingly concerned about how they will fund their health care costs in retirement,\u201d said John Carter, president of Nationwide Financial, which sponsored the survey.\n\nA quarter of baby boomers (26%) say they\u2019ll probably never be able to afford to retire. Women are twice as likely as men to think they will never retire. Forty percent of boomers say they would delay retirement if they had to buy their own health coverage.\n\nMost older workers underestimate how much they\u2019ll have to spend on health care. Asked to estimate their yearly out-of-pocket health care expenses in retirement, pre-retirees guessed an average of $4,300.\n\nBut a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) predicted that a 65-year-old couple retiring today will spend about $11,000 out-of-pocket per year over the course of 25 years.\n\nBlame the miscalculation on misunderstandings about Medicare. The poll found that most older workers estimate that Medicare will cover 69% of their health care costs in retirement. According to EBRI, Medicare generally covers only about 60% of the cost of retirees\u2019 health care, and doesn\u2019t cover long-term care.\n\nAdvice: Work with your retirement plan and health insurance providers to offer financial planning seminars to older workers. Many large providers can send experts to give presentations. Make sure the training covers how to pay for post-retirement health care needs. Alternative: Find a local financial planner who will agree to meet with your staff.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "4994136bc793ed9927db8cecc3707c22"}, "twitter": {"site": "@bizdaily", "creator": "@bizdaily", "description": "More than three in five (61%) pre-retirees now say they are \u201cterrified\u201d  of what health care costs may do to their retirement plans, according to  a new Harris poll.", "card": "summary", "title": "Boomers \u2018terrified\u2019 of out-of-control health care costs"}, "description": "More than three in five (61%) pre-retirees now say they are \u201cterrified\u201d of what health care costs may do to their retirement plans, according to a new Harris poll.
