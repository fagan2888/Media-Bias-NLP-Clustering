He led the October fight to defund the 2010 health care law, resulting in a partial government shutdown and the party\u2019s cratering in public opinion polls.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s favorability was at a record low of 28 percent in a Gallup Poll conducted Oct. 3-6, during the shutdown. That was down 10 percentage points from the previous month and 15 points below Democrats.\n\nOld Tools\n\nIn decades past, leaders could rein in such behavior by threatening to take away coveted committee assignments, withdrawing financial support, or shunning lawmakers. None of those tactics are effective in a political era in which campaign cash flows freely from outside the party machinery and cable outlets offer many ways to grab attention and influence.\n\nIn addition, the potential 2016 presidential aspirant who is aligned with the small-government Tea Party movement has demonstrated scant interest in cultivating Senate allies or building legislative coalitions, making him even more impervious to pressure from his colleagues.\n\nThe risk for Republicans is that Cruz will press similar votes and undermine the party\u2019s ability to win the net six seats needed to gain control of the Senate. Republican infighting has twice, in 2010 and again in 2012, blown up its strategy for retaking the chamber.\n\nMcConnell had to vote \u201cyes\u201d on advancing the debt bill to bring along enough fellow Republicans -- immediately providing fodder for his Republican opponent in the state\u2019s May 20 primary, Louisville businessman Matt Bevin.\n\nPunishment Backfire\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner in 2012 retaliated against four Republicans who went against him on budget and spending issues, by kicking them off the Budget and Financial Services committees. The move only liberated them to speak more boldly against the leadership.\n\nHouse Republican leaders this week removed Louisiana Representative Bill Cassidy from their whip team after he joined Democrats to press for a vote on legislation to prevent an increase in federal flood insurance premiums, said a Republican aide who sought anonymity. Cassidy is running against Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu.\n\nThere\u2019s no sign that McConnell will seek to punish Cruz, whose committee assignments include Armed Services, Judiciary and Commerce, Science and Transportation, by bumping him from those panels.\n\nCampaign Committee\n\nNor are there discussions of stripping Cruz of his leadership role at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, where he\u2019s serving as vice chairman for \u201cgrassroots outreach,\u201d said NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen.\n\nCruz \u201chas has been a powerful voice warning about the dangers of Obamacare and the lawlessness of the Obama administration,\u201d Hougesen said.\n\nThe Texan hasn\u2019t endorsed any Republican candidates in contested primaries, including those that involve incumbents, and has said he has no plans to do so.\n\nCruz has maintained close ties to the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee founded by former South Carolina Republican Senator Jim DeMint that has helped elect Tea Party-backed senators since 2010 and is targeting McConnell.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the support that he has given to our organization, and we look forward to working with him in the future,\u201d said Matt Hoskins, executive director of the group, which helped Cruz upset Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst in the 2012 Republican primary and win his Senate seat.\n\n\u2018Conservative Principles\u2019\n\nBefore last year\u2019s shutdown, Hoskins\u2019s group posted a video on Twitter Sept. 26 congratulating Cruz \u201cfor standing up for conservative principles.\u201d\n\nThe 90-second video is a montage of media coverage of Cruz\u2019s bid to control the Senate floor for more than 21 hours to protest Obamacare. It opens with a narrator declaring: \u201cMost Republicans promise to fight for conservative principles during the campaign, but then let us down after they\u2019re elected. Ted Cruz is different. Ted Cruz delivers.\u201d\n\nThe group, which has already spent more than $1 million this cycle, has endorsed Bevin in the Kentucky race and this week aired a web ad criticizing McConnell\u2019s past votes in favor of debt-limit increases.\n\nIt\u2019s also backing President Barack Obama\u2019s second cousin, Milton Wolf, in his bid to oust fellow Kansas Republican Pat Roberts as well as Mississippi state senator Chris McDaniel, who is challenging Republican Senator Thad Cochran.\n\nTop Financiers\n\nSCF and another Washington-based small-government advocacy group, the Club for Growth, were Cruz\u2019s top 2012 financiers, which makes him immune to any threats from party leaders to restrict the campaign money flow.\n\nDonors to those groups shipped Cruz $1.7 million of his total $14.5 million haul, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics. The two groups provided another $7.1 million in outside advertising to help him win.\n\nCruz, who often begins his answers to reporters\u2019 questions by saying \u201coutside of Washington,\u201d has gone out of his way to portray himself as an outsider willing to challenge the White House and his party\u2019s establishment.\n\nAsked this week whether McConnell should be replaced as Senate Republican leader, Cruz dodged a chance to buck up his leader and said that was a decision \u201cfor the voters of Kentucky to make.\u201d\n\nObama, speaking to House Democrats today in Cambridge, Maryland, credited unity among his party\u2019s lawmakers with staving off spending cuts or other conditions some Republicans including Cruz wanted to attach to a debt-limit increase.\n\n\u2018Stick Together\u2019\n\n\u201cThe fact that we were able to pass a clean debt limit is just one example of why when you guys are unified, you guys stick together, this country is better off,\u201d Obama said.\n\nFor their part, Senate Republicans are \u201cgetting used to Senator Cruz\u2019s style of operating, which is to continue to put them in very difficult positions,\u201d said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who was an aide to former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. \u201cHe is in it for a variety of reasons, but most likely in it for his future presidential ambitions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kathleen Hunter", "twitter": {"description": "A growing group of Ted Cruz\u2019s Republican Senate colleagues are infuriated with his tactics.", "title": "Cruz Senate Stunt Goes Unpunished as Old Tools Don\u2019t Work", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-14/cruz-senate-stunt-goes-unpunished-as-old-tools-don-t-work", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iUaKwqZt_E3s/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Kathleen Hunter", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Debt,Work,Mitch McConnell,Republicans,National Republican Senatorial Committee,Ted Cruz", "news_keywords": "Debt,Work,Mitch McConnell,Republicans,National Republican Senatorial Committee,Ted Cruz", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-14/cruz-senate-stunt-goes-unpunished-as-old-tools-don-t-work", "parsely-title": "Cruz Senate Stunt Goes Unpunished as Old Tools Don\u2019t Work", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-14T22:43:14.137Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A growing group of Ted Cruz\u2019s Republican Senate colleagues are infuriated with his tactics.", "parsely-tags": "Debt,Work,Mitch McConnell,Republicans,National Republican Senatorial Committee,Ted Cruz,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-02-14T22:43:14.137Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "A growing group of Ted Cruz\u2019s Republican Senate colleagues are infuriated with his tactics.", "title": "Cruz Senate Stunt Goes Unpunished as Old Tools Don\u2019t Work", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-14/cruz-senate-stunt-goes-unpunished-as-old-tools-don-t-work", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iUaKwqZt_E3s/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "A growing group of Ted Cruz\u2019s Republican Senate colleagues are infuriated with his tactics."}, "parsely-post-id": "N0YHV06VDKHS01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iUaKwqZt_E3s/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca223\"", "article_summary": "The Republican Party\u2019s favorability was at a record low of 28 percent in a Gallup Poll conducted Oct. 3-6, during the shutdown.\nA growing group of Ted Cruz\u2019s Republican Senate colleagues are infuriated with his tactics.\nIt\u2019s also backing President Barack Obama\u2019s second cousin, Milton Wolf, in his bid to oust fellow Kansas Republican Pat Roberts as well as Mississippi state senator Chris McDaniel, who is challenging Republican Senator Thad Cochran.\n\u201cIn this day and age, there are no tools available to a leader to punish a member like Senator Cruz, especially because Senator Cruz doesn\u2019t care what either the leader or the rest of his caucus thinks,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat.\nDonors to those groups shipped Cruz $1.7 million of his total $14.5 million haul, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics."}
