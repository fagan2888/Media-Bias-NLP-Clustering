Janssen Willhoit, R-St. Johnsbury, proposed the amendment ahead of the final reading of H.620, a bill that codifies provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nWillhoit\u2019s amendment would have required insurers in Vermont to offer a plan that does not cover contraceptives. The House voted it down, 107 to 33.\n\nSome supporters of the amendment argued on the floor that it would respect religious freedom.\n\n\u201cWe should not be forcing religious organizations to buy something for their employees that violates their conscience and their religious tenets,\u201d said Rep. Anne Donahue, R-Northfield.\n\nOpponents expressed concerns that the amendment would interfere with coverage of the use of contraceptives for medical procedures, as well as concerns about constitutional implications and women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cI think what may be occurring here is some confusion between personal rights and religious rights, and I don\u2019t believe that there is anything in the bill that would require a religious person to violate his or her own personal beliefs,\u201d said Rep. James Masland, D-Thetford Center.\n\nAfter the amendment was voted down, the House passed the bill on a voice vote. It now moves to the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "anne donahue, contraceptive, h.620, health care, james masland, janssen willhoit, vermont legislature, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "The House rejected an amendment Thursday that would have allowed religious employers to be exempt from a mandate that long-acting contraceptives be covered under health insurance.
