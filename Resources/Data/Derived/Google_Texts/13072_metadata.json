Hymowitz is the William E. Simon fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor to City Journal. She is the author of \"Manning Up, How the Rise of Women Has Turned Men Into Boys.\"\n\nOn its own, Friday\u2019s momentous Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage doesn\u2019t prove that Americans are becoming more liberal. But the five justices who joined the majority were clearly reacting to a breathtakingly rapid shift in public attitudes toward gays. Add a growing acceptance of nonmarital childbearing, legalized drugs, transgenderism and criminal justice reform and you have an undeniable change in the social weather. What\u2019s next, you may wonder? A woman president?\n\nTraditional Democratic issues can mean little to young people take social progress as a given and government as an impediment to change.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening here can largely be chalked up to generational change. The silent generation, by far the most conservative age group when it comes to social issues, is dying off. The baby boomers, though more liberal than their parents, became less so than its most nostalgic members sometimes imagine.\n\nMeanwhile, millennials who never knew a world without gay congressmen and women C.E.O.s don\u2019t see why these issues are even being debated. Technology, especially social media, has enhanced their worldview. It has opened up new venues of self-expression and magnified the voices of once ignored groups.\n\nStill, technology may not have the same liberalizing effect in the economic realm. If this generation has no memory of Ozzie and Harriet, it also has no memory of Fordism and collective bargaining. The Uber generation is used to images of the start-up life. They are likely to have less patience with regulations and powerful interest groups that inhibit innovation than their parents and grandparents. Traditional Democratic allies like teachers unions and taxi commissions could elicit less sympathy from a generation of freelancers, consultants, subcontractors who, for better or worse, assume they will have to make their way in a sharing economy.\n\nPolls don\u2019t tend to ask questions about these sorts of issues, but surveys of millennials do show some unexpected tensions in their political thinking. The most recent Harvard Institute of Politics survey of 18- to 29-year-olds, for instance, found that despite their overall preference for Democrats, millennials are not keen on environmental policies that would come at the expense of jobs, don\u2019t particularly like affirmative action and perhaps most surprising, are supportive of bringing in ground troops against ISIS. The survey also affirmed this generation\u2019s intense mistrust in the federal government, which may help explain their continuing distaste for Obamacare.\n\nStill, predicting generational shifts can be a fool\u2019s game. Just ask the anti-establishment baby boomers who launched a social revolution - and then helped put Ronald Reagan in the White House.\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-articleInline.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/red-white-and-bluer", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-articleInline.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Traditional Democratic issues can mean little to young people who take social progress as a given and government as an impediment to change.
