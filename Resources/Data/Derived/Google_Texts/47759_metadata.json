Matt Bevin for his work to dismantle elements of the Affordable Care Act in Kentucky during a campaign stop in Louisville Tuesday.\n\nThe former first lady and secretary of state has been campaigning in Kentucky ahead of the state\u2019s Democratic presidential primary next week.\n\nDuring the campaign stop at Family Health Centers in the Portland neighborhood, Clinton applauded Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange, Kynect, calling it \u201cthe best example\u201d of states\u2019 efforts to expand health coverage. She criticized apparent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s position against the law, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, your governor is working hard to undermine what Kentucky has accomplished,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI think with somebody like Donald Trump you would see a race to the bottom across our country \u2014 with working families paying the price.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Bevin Notifies Federal Government He\u2019ll Dismantle Kynect\n\nBevin has promised to dismantle Kynect by the end of this year and seek a waiver from the federal government to \u201ctransform\u201d Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion. About 500,000 Kentuckians got health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, bringing the state uninsured rate from more than 20 percent down to 9 percent.\n\nKentucky has become a battleground for the Democratic presidential candidates, with both Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vying for about 60 delegates in the state. Clinton has a lead over Sanders in the Democratic nominating process.\n\nDuring a 30-minute speech, Clinton also proposed a new federal program designed to subsidize childcare for families.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to say we are for family values, then we need to value families, and no family should have to pay more than 10 percent of their income on childcare,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton also said that as president, she would encourage state and local governments to increase wages for childcare workers.\n\nFormer Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear endorsed Clinton in a statement released by her campaign. In it, he cited health care policy as a reason for his support.\n\n\u201cGiven the battle playing out over health care access in Kentucky, we need a leader and ally in the White House who understands the importance of fighting for health care,\u201d Beshear said in the statement. \u201cHillary will stand up with us against efforts to pull the rug out from under our families, and she\u2019ll never give up.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nClinton Rallies At Slugger Field\n\nClinton was joined by Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and former Lt. Governor Crit Luallen at an evening rally in Louisville.\n\nShe continued her critique of Bevin\u2019s policies, this time for his cuts to state colleges, which he successfully pushed for during the most recent legislative session.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like your new governor\u2019s real friendly to higher education,\u201d she said.\n\nBevin and state lawmakers agreed to cut higher education by 4.5 percent over the next two years and 2 percent during the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30.\n\nClinton also touched on the heroin and opioid addiction epidemic, saying that states need to invest in treatment and \u201csecond chance\u201d programs that keep addicts out of jail.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to save lives, divert people from the criminal justice system, give them treatment, help them into recovery and let them get off on a better track,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton gave little attention to Sanders, instead focusing on Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric against Muslims and immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be scapegoating and finger pointing and blaming and demeaning and degrading and insulting our fellow Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump has suggested barring Muslims from traveling to the U.S. and deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Clinton also said Trump was engaging in \u201creckless talk\u201d by recently suggesting more countries should have access to nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cWhen he casually says he doesn\u2019t care if more countries get nuclear weapons, I shudder,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last thing we need is more countries with nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton also criticized apparent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s position against the law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Clinton also criticized apparent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s position against the law.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Defends Obamacare At Louisville Stop", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1920, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Hillary-Clinton-3.jpg", "height": 1280}, "updated_time": "2016-05-10T21:09:56-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/hillary-clinton-defends-obamacare-louisville-campaign-stop/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinton also criticized apparent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s position against the law.", "creator": "@RylandKY", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Hillary-Clinton-3.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton Defends Obamacare At Louisville Stop", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "hillary clinton", "published_time": "2016-05-10T17:41:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-10T21:09:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Matt Bevin for his work to dismantle elements of the Affordable Care Act in Kentucky during a campaign stop in Louisville Tuesday.\nIn it, he cited health care policy as a reason for his support.\nThe former first lady and secretary of state has been campaigning in Kentucky ahead of the state\u2019s Democratic presidential primary next week.\nClinton Rallies At Slugger FieldClinton was joined by Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and former Lt.\nClinton also said Trump was engaging in \u201creckless talk\u201d by recently suggesting more countries should have access to nuclear weapons."}
