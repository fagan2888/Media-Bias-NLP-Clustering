Ritter wrote to the president \u00adexpressing his dismay over the Affordable Health Care Act, and was surprised to get a response penned by Obama on official White House \u00adstationery. Ritter, a fifth-grade teacher at Sally B. Elliott \u00adElementary in Irving, Texas, had written to the president: \u201cThis bill has caused such a \u00addivisive, derisive and toxic environment . . . The reality is that any citizen that disagrees with your \u00adadministration is targeted and ridiculed.\u201d Ritter continued: \u201cI hesitated to write for fear of some kind of retribution . . . I watched you make fun of tea baggers and your press secretary make fun of Ms. [Sarah] Palin which was especially beneath the dignity of the White House . . . Do the right thing not the political thing. Suggest a bill that Americans can support.\u201d\n\nAll right, so it\u2019s important to note Ritter uses the term \u201ctea-bagger\u201d first, a common term used by the Left to ridicule Tea Partiers, but here\u2019s Obama\u2019s response:\n\n\u2018I\u2026 appreciate your concern about the toxic political environment right now. I do have to challenge you, though, on the notion that any citizen that disagrees with me has been \u201ctargeted and ridiculed\u201d or that I have \u201cmade fun\u201d of tea-baggers.\u2019\n\nA couple options, here. Obama carelessly used \u201ctea-baggers\u201d after reading it in Ritter\u2019s letter and meant to use Tea Partiers. Obama deliberately used the term \u201ctea-bagger\u201d to annoy Ritter, in which case it was quite a lot of effort to sit down and give a \u201ctea-bagger\u201d the honor of a letter from the President of the United States. Or, and this is my theory, Obama is so thoroughly surrounded by people who refer to Tea Partiers as \u201ctea-baggers\u201d nonchalantly that it slipped out without him even thinking about it. And, finally, no matter what the reason, the letter\u2019s certainly emblematic of Obama\u2019s utter inability to actually appeal to people who disagree with him despite fancying himself quite the bridge-builder.\n\nThe President of the United States, allegedly one of the smartest people to grace our country, sat down to write a hand-written letter to a political dissenter and used the most charged, rude, dirty term possible while claiming he\u2019d never do anything but treat this \u201ctea-bagger\u201d with the utmost respect. His own lofty self-concept survives contact with all conflicting facts, even when they come from his own pen.\n\nOn the upside, \u201ctea-bagger\u201d has now been used by a president on presidential stationery. You\u2019re welcome, George Washington. Love, 2013.\n\nThe New York Post uploaded the letter, which is now up for auction by Ritter, who was unconvinced by the president\u2019s respectful appeal.\n\nRitter, 49, is putting the letter up for auction through the Web site momentsintime.com for a reserve price of $24,000. Ritter said, \u201cI am selling the letter because I am just so disappointed, and this ObamaCare bill is wrong. The president told me what he thought I wanted to hear. The letter is just words on a paper. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to me because Obama doesn\u2019t mean any of it.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama's response", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Respect.", "title": "Obama letter to conservative: I\u2019ve been quite respectful of you tea-baggers", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/27/obama-letter-to-conservative-constituent-ive-been-quite-respectful-of-you-tea-baggers/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-28T01:01:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-28T12:14:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0a1\"", "article_summary": "Obama letter to conservative: I\u2019ve been quite respectful of you tea-baggersposted at 8:01 pm on November 27, 2013 by Mary Katharine HamA Texas teacher sent a letter to President Obama about his opposition to Obamacare and got a hand-written letter in return.\nObama carelessly used \u201ctea-baggers\u201d after reading it in Ritter\u2019s letter and meant to use Tea Partiers.\nRitter, 49, is putting the letter up for auction through the Web site momentsintime.com for a reserve price of $24,000.\nThe New York Post uploaded the letter, which is now up for auction by Ritter, who was unconvinced by the president\u2019s respectful appeal.\nRitter said, \u201cI am selling the letter because I am just so disappointed, and this ObamaCare bill is wrong."}
