WINDSOR, Colo. (AP) — A northern Colorado town has said goodbye to a beloved resident who was shot and killed while riding his bicycle.

John Jacoby’s funeral was held Friday afternoon in Windsor as police continued to search for his killer.

KCNC-TV reports (http://goo.gl/pRz1OW ) Faith United Church of Christ Pastor Fred Evenson said “Johnny will always be remembered as the unofficial mayor of Windsor” because he knew more people than anybody in town.

The body of the part-time parks worker and grocery store bagger was found Monday along a rural road. The 48-year-old was a big fan of high school sports and was described as always smiling and always on his bicycle.

The FBI is helping police investigate, but authorities haven’t said much about what they’ve learned since Jacoby’s body was found.
