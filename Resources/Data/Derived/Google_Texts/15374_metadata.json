Or if they talk about access to voting for minorities, or talk about economic interests,\u201d said Tom Lopach, the new executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to National Journal on Tuesday. \u201cAt a time when millionaires and corporations are getting their due and regular folks are finding it harder to pay for college, save for retirement, and pay for gas to run kids to soccer,\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat does Lopach mean by \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d? \u201cMillionaires\u2026 getting their due\u201d hurts women economically? Placed in the context of the first battle in the \u201cWar on Women,\u201d which raged in 2011 over Republican plans to defund Planned Parenthood, Lopach appears to be indicating that the Democratic Party \u2014 led by a handful of feminist senators and Hillary herself \u2014 will double down on its efforts to push for more wealth transfers from taxpayers to the federal bureaucracy and leftist non-profits during the upcoming presidential campaign.\n\nThe meme morphed from a charge Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) used to spook $1.1 million dollars from Obamacare supporters into a a key part of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. Mainstream media glommed onto it. A typical example: a 2012 New York Times editorial demonizes Republican pushback as an \u201cassault on women\u2019s equality and well-being\u201d and, ironically, calls state laws aimed at reducing abortions a \u201cdeath sentence.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with the \u201cWar on Women\u201d rhetoric, one Republicans could exploit: ignoring the effect Democratic policies have on living, breathing women while pushing liberal social engineering labeled as \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d Women who exercise their \u201creproductive right\u201d to have an abortion suffer devastating consequences, and not from Republican spending cuts. According to research left-leaning media tends to ignore, abortions leave \u201ca discernible wake of sorrow, suffering, and devastation\u201d that traumatizes women.\n\nDemocrats go so far as to focus on preventing working women from becoming pregnant at all \u2014 employers are even forced under Obamacare to pay for sterilization procedures for their female, but not male, employees \u2014 and call the opposition their proposals generate a \u201cwar\u201d against \u201crights\u201d and \u201chealth.\u201d In other words, childbearing is seen under Democratic legislation as a health problem to be treated like a disease. Does encouraging women to avoid having families make them happy? Not exactly, according to a 2011 survey of white collar workers. The most unhappy type of worker profiled was a 42-year-old unmarried woman with no children.\n\nA 2016 \u201cWar on Women\u201d corollary might run into another problem: The current hysteria over campus \u201crape culture\u201d has suffered a series of embarrassments from experts and mainstream media reporters. The \u201cone in five women on campus will be sexually assaulted\u201d myth has been rejected by self-identified feminists and questioned by sympathetic media. The horrific tale of a a gang rape on campus, whose grand reveal was meant to inspire agitators to impose a \u201cradical feminist culture seeking to upend the patriarchy\u201d on the \u201cgenteel\u201d University of Virginia\u2019s campus, imploded after media spoke to the accuser\u2019s friends \u2014 and revealed what appears to be an elaborate catfishing scheme behind the hoax.\n\nRepublicans have had some success challenging the Democrats\u2019 tone-deaf narrative. As the National Journal points out, former Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO) alienated voters in the 2014 elections by furiously denouncing Cory Garner for trying to outlaw birth control, period \u2014 as Garner called for allowing contraceptives to be bought without a prescription.\n\nDemocrats are signaling that the historic 2014 Congressional losses have not deterred them from abandoning \u201cWar on Women.\u201d If Hillary Clinton chooses to run in 2016, Republicans had better prepare to defend against a campaign that will wield social issues like a club. The 2016 \u201cWar on Women\u201d hyperbole will make \u201cbinders full of women\u201d a blip on the radar.\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter: @k_mcq.
