That means you\u2019ll be spared endless follow-ups on any of themes I\u2019ve written about recently. But I don\u2019t want to leave you empty-handed, so here are a few links related to recent subjects, and a few others as well.\n\nFirst, on same-sex marriage, if I were going to argue with a piece written after the Supreme Court decision, it would be this one from Rebecca Traister at New York, not least because it offers a cracked-mirror version of my own reading of the Anthony Kennedy decision and our cultural context. If I were going to recommend one piece related to the Christian response to the decision and the new realities of marriage, I\u2019d cheat and recommend these two, both by Wesley Hill, one on the immediate and one looking longer term. And then the First Things symposium (to which Hill, among others, contributes) includes a range of opinions I agree with, and a few with which I strongly differ or regard as fanciful; you can try to figure out which I think is which.\n\nI\u2019m deliberately not going to link to any of the pieces that are popping up arguing that now we need to take away church tax exemptions, because the #hottakes that follow a big moment aren\u2019t always the best guide to what comes next. But I will link, again, to my Indiana-inspired set of questions for liberals about the future of religious liberty, because they\u2019re likely to remain \u2026 apropos.\n\nFinally, I\u2019m grateful as usual to Jonathan Chait for his kind attention to my arguments on same-sex marriage, I\u2019m not surprised that they failed to convince, but I will gently suggest that his (mis)understanding of the historical roots of the traditional view of marriage is a case study in the phenomenon I described here, the politically-driven triumph of forgetting over memory.\n\nOn other matters, had I found time to follow up on the debate about Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical, I would have liked to engage with these three posts by Alan Jacobs (one responding to my own column), which include among other things a sketch of a wonderful-sounding syllabus that includes both \u201cLaudato Si\u201d and \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d\n\nOther encyclical links: Matthew Schmitz in dialogue with Nathan Schneider (and Schneider with me); Robert Royal on the environment and natural evil; Schmitz on Romano Guardini\u2019s influence on Francis; Rod Dreher\u2019s love letter to the encyclical\u2019s crunchiness; Noah Millman\u2019s critique; and a symposium.\n\nMillman also has an interesting response to my post on the South and the Confederacy, much of which I agree with; the part I don\u2019t, unfortunately, would require 2000 words to get at.\n\nOn King v. Burwell and Obamacare, I thought that this from Yuval Levin and this from Brookings\u2019 Philip Wallach got very nicely at the reasons to be unsettled by what the case\u2019s unfolding says about the state of our constitutional system.\n\nAnd finally, a miscellany: contrarianism on Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out\u201d from Eve Tushnet and Richard Brody, Derek Thompson contemplates a world without work, David Frum on a European dilemma that may be bigger in the long run than Grexit, and a critique of Scandinavia.\n\nBack in three weeks.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150629154041, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 29, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1435606841, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T19:41:28-04:00"}, "keywords": "Brody Richard,Chait Jonathan,Francis,Traister Rebecca,Encyclicals,Freedom of Religion,Marriages,Same-Sex Marriage Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships,Pixar Animation Studios,Supreme Court (US),Russia,Scandinavia,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/Hiatus, With Links ( 20150629 )", "description": "Reading recommendations while I take a brief book leave.", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Brody, Richard;Chait, Jonathan;Francis;Traister, Rebecca", "twitter": {"description": "Reading recommendations while I take a brief book leave.", "title": "Hiatus, With Links", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/hiatus-with-links/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "news_keywords": "Encyclical,Freedom of religion,Jonathan Chait,Marriage,Pixar Animation Studios,Pope Francis,Rebecca Traister,Richard Brody,Same Sex Marriage,Scandinavia,Supreme Court;SCOTUS", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 29, 2015", "org": "Pixar Animation Studios;Supreme Court (US)", "geo": "Russia;Scandinavia", "utime": 20150629194128, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150629, "pdate": 20150629, "des": "Encyclicals;Freedom of Religion;Marriages;Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "Reading recommendations while I take a brief book leave.", "title": "Hiatus, With Links", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/hiatus-with-links/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/hiatus-with-links/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Hiatus, With Links", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "But I don\u2019t want to leave you empty-handed, so here are a few links related to recent subjects, and a few others as well.\nThat means you\u2019ll be spared endless follow-ups on any of themes I\u2019ve written about recently.\nBut I will link, again, to my Indiana-inspired set of questions for liberals about the future of religious liberty, because they\u2019re likely to remain \u2026 apropos.\nBack in three weeks.\nMillman also has an interesting response to my post on the South and the Confederacy, much of which I agree with; the part I don\u2019t, unfortunately, would require 2000 words to get at."}
