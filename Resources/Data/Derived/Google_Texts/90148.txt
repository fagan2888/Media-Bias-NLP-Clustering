A 31-year-old Union Beach woman is in critical condition following a three-car crash on Route 33 late Sunday morning.

Megan Shaloo was taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center after the crash near West Jumping Brook Road and is listed in critical condition, according to information shared by the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office Monday.

According to the investigation, Shaloo was driving a 2002 Honda Accord westbound on Route 33 “at a high rate of speed” when she collided with the rear of a 2008 Ford Fusion at 11:18 a.m. Sunday. As a result, both vehicles rotated and the Accord struck a utility pole, overturned and slid on its roof and hood into the eastbound lane of the highway, where it was struck by a Dodge Caravan.

The driver of the Fusion was also taken to the JSUMC, where he was treated and released. The driver of the Caravan was uninjured. Their names were not realeased.

The crash investigation remains open and anyone with information is urged to call Detective Eric Kerecman of the prosecutor’s office at 800-533-7443 or Sgt. Michael Zarro of Neptune police at 732-988-8000.
