“Girls” actress and artist Jemima Kirke recently talked about an abortion she had in 2007 following an unexpected pregnancy with her college boyfriend. As part of a public service announcement for the Center for Reproductive Rights, Kirke explained the details of her own abortion in hopes of lifting the stigma surrounding a woman’s own reproductive choices.

"We think we do have free choice and we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them," Kirke explained in the PSA. "I’ve always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women especially should be able to talk about freely, especially amongst each other, and I still see that today. I still see shame and embarrassment around terminating pregnancy and getting pregnant."

Kirke — who is currently the mother of two daughters, ages 4 and 8 — explained that her pregnancy in 2007 came at a time when “raising a healthy, happy child” was just not possible. Although the couple was able to raise enough money for the abortion, funding the anesthesia for the procedure was another matter entirely. Kirke refused to tell her parents about the pregnancy and her decision, so she decided to go through with the procedure without anesthesia.

Kirke added that by sharing her story she hopes that one day her daughters won’t have to worry about protecting their own reproductive rights. "I'm already anticipating their issues with self-esteem, their body, the whole luggage that comes with being a woman," Kirke said. "And so I would love if when they're older, the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore."
