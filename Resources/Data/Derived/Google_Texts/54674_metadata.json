Father and son have raced in different sailboat classes over the years; this season marks the second anniversary of sailing a Flying Scot.\n\n\u201cThis was the boat we could sail together and there was a really good fleet that we could sail here that was fun and competitive,\u201d Zeke Horowitz said, as he waited with dozens of other sailors for the wind to pick up on Monday. The Sarasota Sailing Squadron is hosting four days of racing this week for 54 boats from across the country.\n\nCompetitors chatted as they took shade under the club pavilion. Colorful tents, where some sailors are staying, were set up along the northern bank. Others played corn hole as they waited for conditions to improve.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY: Click here for more images from the Flying Scot Midwinters championship\n\nThe Flying Scot class competes with a sailboat model that has been around for more than 50 years, said regatta director John Pether. It\u2019s a sturdy, simple model that tends to be less expensive than sleeker, faster sailboats. That means, he said, it attracts a diverse group, from competitive sailors who want a boat they can both race and take out with their families to newbies with less experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get a class of boat that has such a disparity of ages, from young people to old, and a mixture of very very good sailors with weekend sailors,\u201d Pether said. \u201cThe spirit of this class is fantastic.\u201d\n\nAmy Smith Linton, the defending Flying Scot North American champion, started sailing a Flying Scot more than a decade ago with her husband Jeff Linton, a former Rolex US Sailing Yachtsman of the Year.\n\n\u201cFor my husband and me, the really important thing about the Flying Scot was that it\u2019s great bang for the buck,\u201d Smith Linton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a $50,000 investment to get a race-ready boat.\u201d\n\nCompetitors are expected to participate in at least eight races in Sarasota Bay through Thursday, when a champion will be named. They will race in challenger and championship divisions, with the latter considered more competitive.\n\nJay Horowitz, 58, wants to win the champion title again with his son, but he said he likes competing in this class because there is no one to whom he truly minds losing.\n\n\u201cWhen you get back to the dock,\u201d he said. \u201cI think of a lot of people take pleasure in the successes of other competitors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/SFLY.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2a4\"", "article_summary": "PHOTO GALLERY: Click here for more images from the Flying Scot Midwinters championshipThe Flying Scot class competes with a sailboat model that has been around for more than 50 years, said regatta director John Pether.\nPHOTO GALLERY: Flying Scot Midwinters in SarasotaSARASOTASailing coach Zeke Horowitz, 25, flew into town late Sunday night for this, a chance to defend his Flying Scot Midwinters champion title in his hometown with his father, Jay, by his side.\nFather and son have raced in different sailboat classes over the years; this season marks the second anniversary of sailing a Flying Scot.\n\u201cFor my husband and me, the really important thing about the Flying Scot was that it\u2019s great bang for the buck,\u201d Smith Linton said.\nThe pair took first in the Flying Scot Midwinters championship last year in New Orleans, where the regatta for those who sail a particular 20-foot racing dinghy is held every other year."}
