On a hulking American assault ship moored at a nearby port sits a man who might have them \u2014 a U.S. Marine authorities suspect in the brutal slaying at a cheap hotel more than a week ago.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t eat without praying first. We don\u2019t sleep without saying a prayer. Where were you when this happened?\u201d Julita Laude beseeched God. \u201cShe had so many dreams and that killer destroyed them all.\u201d\n\nU.S. authorities are cooperating in the investigation, and have ordered the ship to stay at the Subic Bay Freeport, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Manila, until it is completed.\n\nThe killing of Jennifer Laude, a 26-year-old transgender whose former name was Jeffrey, has sparked public anger in the Philippines and revived a debate over the U.S. military presence in a country seen by Washington as a major ally in Southeast Asia. The nations signed a new accord in April that allows greater U.S. military access to Philippine military camps, part of Washington\u2019s pivot back to Asia where it wants to counter China\u2019s rising might.\n\nPhilippine police have identified the suspect as U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton. He was one of thousands of American and Philippines military personnel who took part in joint exercises earlier this month. He and other U.S. personnel were on leave in Olongapo city when Laude was found dead.\n\nAmerican investigators have worked with local police, but have not made public any details surrounding the case.\n\nIn interviews with The Associated Press, Philippine police and witnesses said that Laude met Pemberton at the Ambyanz, an Olongapo disco bar, in the late hours of Oct. 11.\n\nAt one point, they left friends at the bar and checked in at a nearby motel and got a room beside the reception desk.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, Pemberton walked out, leaving the door ajar, according to the motel staff.\n\nA housekeeper entered the room to find Laude\u2019s body, partly wrapped in bedsheet, in the bathroom. She had apparently been drowned in the toilet, according to police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo.\n\nTwo witnesses \u2014 a friend of Laude who was with them at the disco and the motel housekeeper \u2014 identified Pemberton in a gallery of pictures made available by U.S. military authorities as the Caucasian male seen with the victim at the bar and later at the motel, said Olongapo Mayor Rolen Paulino.\n\nDNA tests were being carried out on two condoms recovered from the bathroom, he said.\n\nA housemate of Laude, who identified herself only as Alexis, said the victim was a devout Catholic. In the house they shared, she pointed to a Christmas tree that Laude had only recently erected. There were photos of Laude wearing a bikini on the wall.\n\nAccompanied by local police, Laude\u2019s family filed a murder complaint Wednesday against Pemberton with Olongapo prosecutors.\n\nOn Friday, Philippine authorities served a subpoena at the U.S. Embassy for Pemberton and four other Marines, who were sought as witnesses, to appear Tuesday before prosecutors in Olongapo in a preliminary investigation. The prosecutors will decide if there is enough evidence for charges to be filed in court.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy said Sunday that prosecutors have met with the four witnesses. The embassy said it was up to the suspect whether to appear on Tuesday, depending on the advice of his Philippine lawyers. Under local laws, he could be represented by his lawyers at the initial hearing, but any non-appearance might spark more criticism about the government\u2019s inability to gain custody of him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marine suspect in Philippine killing tests US ties", "title": "Marine suspect in Philippine killing tests US ties", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Marine suspect in Philippine killing tests US ties", "title": "Marine suspect in Philippine killing tests US ties", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/19/marine_suspect_in_philippine_killing_tests_us_ties/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/philippines-us-killing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marine suspect in Philippine killing tests US ties", "title": "Marine suspect in Philippine killing tests US ties", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/philippines-us-killing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Gomez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He was one of thousands of American and Philippines military personnel who took part in joint exercises earlier this month.\nOn a hulking American assault ship moored at a nearby port sits a man who might have them \u2014 a U.S. Marine authorities suspect in the brutal slaying at a cheap hotel more than a week ago.\nAccompanied by local police, Laude\u2019s family filed a murder complaint Wednesday against Pemberton with Olongapo prosecutors.\nThe embassy said it was up to the suspect whether to appear on Tuesday, depending on the advice of his Philippine lawyers.\nPhilippine police have identified the suspect as U.S. Marine Pfc."}
