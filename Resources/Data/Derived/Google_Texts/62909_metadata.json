The video went viral and the incident became a national story.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obligated to use this as a teachable moment. \u2026 As educators, we\u2019ve got to take this opportunity to teach our young people two wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d Northside school district athletic director Stan Laing said at a news conference last week after two players with John Jay High School in San Antonio blindsided an official in a road game at Marble Falls.\n\nA teachable moment? This is a large part of what\u2019s wrong with too many of today\u2019s educators and their approach to athletics. They seem convinced everything negative can be explained away as a teachable moment. They center on too many esoteric rules \u2014 only positive cheers, please \u2014 and fail to provide necessary punishment when something goes wrong.\n\nThey don\u2019t have the gumption to do it, but I would suggest something that\u2019s bigger than the size of Texas and can reach \u2014 and teach \u2014 everyone in high school football.\n\nDiscontinue the John Jay program for the rest of the year, on all levels, and disband the coaching staff. It would be a statement heard loud and clear, a lesson not to be missed.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be opposed to it,\u201d said the Colorado High School Activities Association\u2019s Tom Robinson, who oversees local officials and is as kind and understanding a man as there is in today\u2019s prep sports landscape.\n\nRobinson, a former high school coach and respected college official, added: \u201cWe need to be ahead of that curve all the time.\u201d\n\nIn other words, behavior such as what happened cannot be tolerated and there must be severe ramifications. There were unconfirmed reports that the players in question were subject to racial slurs by the official they attacked and that an assistant coach may have encouraged some team members to seek payback due to previous ejections and alleged \u201cbad\u201d calls.\n\nBut all the players had to do was inform their coaches, or other game officials, about such incidents, if they happened.\n\nI asked a couple of local referees about the incident and they believe the Texas referee could have been paralyzed or killed, judging by the videotape.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s nice is the videotape gives no doubt it was intentional, and that\u2019s what is key here,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly. So, instead of educators running for cover, fearing parents and fearing lawsuits, why don\u2019t they hand out strict punishment and actually teach students that outrageous and criminal behavior has no place in society?\n\nDozens of other John Jay players and coaches may have had nothing to do with the incident, but teammates should be responsible for each other. Coaches preach it all the time. So are they merely words? Or do they have actual meaning?\n\nThug antics have no place in high school sports.\n\n\u201cThe teaching should be behind the scenes,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe life-lesson piece is a good thing, but it shouldn\u2019t be crammed down your throat. It should be the ultimate in everything we do.\u201d\n\nIt will be if they get it right in Texas.\n\nNeil H.
