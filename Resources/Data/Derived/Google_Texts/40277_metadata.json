Karen Fann said the insurance committee she chairs will hear placeholder legislation on Wednesday. She said she\u2019ll take limited testimony from all three interested parties to get their positions on the record and amend the legislation once a deal is in hand.\n\n\u201cI believe that we are very close in reaching an agreement,\u201d Fann said late Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, tedious process. Everybody has been wonderful about coming to the table at stakeholder meetings and offering their suggestions on how to make this a win-win for everybody.\u201d\n\nFann is trying to work out a compromise that will level the playing field between the new ridesharing companies and traditional taxi services. How the new services are insured is a key issue that Fann said in an interview appear to be nearly solved.\n\nArizona regulators stopped issuing citations to rideshare company drivers last month as the Legislature works to craft a new law allowing them to operate legally.\n\nThe Legislature passed a bill last year that would have exempted the new app-based transportation companies from insurance regulations imposed on traditional taxi and livery companies. It was vetoed by then-Gov. Jan Brewer, who said it failed to protect consumers.\n\nThe companies, which call themselves \u201cridesharing services,\u201d have continued to operate. The state Weights and Measures Department had issued nearly 100 citations by November to drivers who did not have proper commercial licenses or insurance.\n\nFann said the deal she\u2019s working on would level the playing field by make both taxis and rideshare companies adopt zero-tolerance policies for drug use. That deal would stop state testing of taxi drivers but pass the responsibility for maintaining anti-drug policies to all companies.\n\nThe biggest issue is the insurance coverage for rideshare drivers. The companies provide a large commercial policy when a passenger is in their car, but at other times drivers operate using just their noncommercial personal insurance. Fann said insurers are prepared to offer policy \u201criders\u201d that kick in to fill that gap.\n\nGov. Doug Ducey said he decided to stop state regulators from citing drivers for rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft last month because the policy wasn\u2019t working and was hampering job creation.\n\nHe said the companies are innovative and entrepreneurial and he wants to see them thrive.\n\nLast year\u2019s fight over the so-called Uber bill was one of the bigger issues of contention within the state Legislature. Democrats and Republicans were split within their own parties. Proponents of the bill said government should stay out of the way and let new companies innovate, while opponents said the lack of regulations pose a public safety threat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A key lawmaker said talks she's leading among taxi firms, rideshare companies such as Uber and insurers on an updated law regulating the new and growing rideshare industry are progressing.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Bob Christie, Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "A key lawmaker said talks she's leading among taxi firms, rideshare companies such as Uber and insurers on an updated law regulating the new and growing rideshare industry are progressing.", "title": "Negotiations to update Arizona ridesharing law progressing", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2015/02/18/negotiations-to-update-arizona-ridesharing-law-progressing/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2015/02/Uber-ridesharing620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Negotiations to update Arizona ridesharing law progressing Arizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "arizona, ridesharing, lyft, uber, karen fann, taxis, insurance coverage, douf ducey,douf ducey,insurance coverage,karen fann,lyft,ridesharing,taxis,uber", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb012\"", "article_summary": "A key lawmaker said talks she\u2019s leading among taxi firms, rideshare companies such as Uber and insurers on an updated law regulating the new and growing rideshare industry are progressing.\nThat deal would stop state testing of taxi drivers but pass the responsibility for maintaining anti-drug policies to all companies.\nArizona regulators stopped issuing citations to rideshare company drivers last month as the Legislature works to craft a new law allowing them to operate legally.\nFann said the deal she\u2019s working on would level the playing field by make both taxis and rideshare companies adopt zero-tolerance policies for drug use.\nThe biggest issue is the insurance coverage for rideshare drivers."}
