The more progressivism advances, the more its illiberal postulates are revealed.\n\nIn his recent article, \u201cNew Republic Falls Short of the True Liberalism It Champions,\u201d Peter Berkowitz, a former contributing editor to The New Republic, tells the story of the magazine in a way that sometimes obscures more than it clarifies.\n\nFirst, the claim that The New Republic (TNR) champions true liberalism would have confounded Herbert Croly, the magazine\u2019s founder. Croly was a dedicated Progressive. As such, he was an avowed enemy of liberalism\u2014an enemy, that is, of the classical liberalism of America\u2019s founders. Croly wanted not to champion liberalism, but to replace it. He would have been confused by Berkowitz\u2019s title, because he died before Franklin Delano Roosevelt managed to get away with changing the name of their movement from progressivism to liberalism. By choosing to gloss over the name-change, Berkowitz sows confusion.\n\nAs Berkowitz correctly states, Croly and TNR \u201cespoused a strong central state staffed by university-trained experts who would impartially manage the people\u2019s affairs.\u201d Obamacare is a perfect example of the Progressive ideal. It takes the management of the people\u2019s health-care affairs out of their hands and puts it into the hands of university-trained government experts. Progressives then and now reject the American founders\u2019 vision of limited government and individual liberty.\n\nHow FDR Stole Liberalism The classical liberalism of the American founders is called liberalism for the simple reason that the founders championed liberty. And because they championed liberty, they championed limited government. A strong central state that manages people\u2019s affairs is not what the founders had in mind.\n\nBecause the American voter had turned against progressivism, FDR decided to change its name. It is important to understand that progressivism\u2019s name-change occurred as a result of voters\u2019 dissatisfaction with Woodrow Wilson. Like Croly, Wilson was proud to call himself a Progressive, but the shockingly illiberal policies of the Wilson administration caused American voters to reject Wilson\u2019s progressivism. They elected Republican Warren Harding, who had promised them a return to \u201cnormalcy.\u201d\n\nBecause the American voter had turned against progressivism, FDR decided to change its name. Progressive policies could then be advanced under another label. Instead of coming up with a new name, FDR, with characteristic boldness, stole the name of the opposition. FDR stole the label of the philosophy of liberty and bestowed it on Progressives\u2014the party of the state, the party of government, the self-proclaimed political enemies of classical liberalism and of limited government. It was a knockout punch, and it left the proponents of the philosophy of liberty without a name.\n\nWhat should the defenders of the Constitution call themselves now? As my friend, the eminent scholar Professor Charles Kesler, writes in his masterful book, \u201cI Am the Change\u201d: \u201cFDR suggested, helpfully, that they ought to call themselves conservatives, a designation they were loath to accept because it sounded\u2026vaguely un-American[.] \u2026 Robert Taft, \u2018Mr. Conservative,\u2019 was still insisting he was a liberal in 1946.\u201d\n\nThe classical liberals resisted taking FDR\u2019s helpful suggestion because \u201cconservative\u201d had always been the label of their political foes. In the words of Jacques Barzun, \u201cfree enterprise, free trade, freedom to vote and run for office, free speech and religion are Liberal achievements.\u201d Classical liberalism\u2019s political opposition in the fight for liberty, the champions of the old order, had always (and very properly, too) been called the \u201cconservatives.\u201d\n\nCeding Liberalism to Progressives It gets confusing, doesn\u2019t it? That is the beauty of it, from the Progressive point of view. Making sense about this has become a challenge, even for very sensible people. Consider this passage by Harvey Mansfield, the distinguished Harvard professor, in the pages of The Claremont Review of Books, America\u2019s foremost journal of political thought:\n\nA true liberal is at minimum a person who wants both sides to be heard. That is the practice of free speech and its companion, academic freedom. The so-called liberals today don\u2019t want to hear both sides. Real liberals\u2026do, but those who stand up for liberalism today are mostly conservatives. [Italics added].\n\nI cite this in complete sympathy with Mansfield, noting only that this thoughtful scholar is forced to modify liberal with true, so-called, and real in quick succession to be able to use liberalism without a modifier\u2014all this, to make an important point that, however, has to be stated as an apparent paradox.\n\nIn the 1950s, William F. Buckley and other leading American defenders of the Constitution decided to accede to FDR\u2019s \u201chelpful\u201d suggestion and call themselves conservatives. So it was that the name of liberalism became the property of the opponents of liberalism.\n\nProgressivism Stands for Central Planning However, the confusion in Berkowitz\u2019s article is not limited to the problems with the title. The first sentence, too, can send the unwary directly into the ditch: \u201cLiberalism, most people would agree, stands for the state\u2019s responsibility to actively improve the social, economic, and political quality of citizens\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nAccording to Progressives, the state must manage people\u2019s affairs \u2018to improve the social, economic, and political quality of citizens\u2019 lives\u2019 because people are not capable of managing their own affairs. Of course, this is not what \u201ctrue liberalism,\u201d at least in the classical sense, \u201cstands for.\u201d But the sentence does not even state what progressivism stands for. It is actually progressivism\u2019s justification, progressives\u2019 justification for putting university-trained experts in charge of the people\u2019s affairs, as in Obamacare. According to Progressives, the state must manage people\u2019s affairs \u201cto improve the social, economic, and political quality of citizens\u2019 lives\u201d because people are not capable of managing their own affairs.\n\nThen there is Berkowitz\u2019s second sentence: \u201cIn a more fundamental sense liberalism also denotes certain qualities of mind and character, among them tolerance, generosity, the capacity to engage civilly competing opinions, and a determination to base politics on reason rather than physical force or arbitrary authority.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018The New Republic Effect\u2019 Is Happening to Progressives Everywhere Here Berkowitz again goes awry, this time in a totally different direction. Whether you use the term liberalism in its classical sense or as a label for progressivism, liberalism is a political philosophy\u2014an \u201cism.\u201d Yet Berkowitz says the term \u201calso denotes certain qualities of mind and character\u201d\u2014tolerance, generosity, and so on. Those qualities of mind and character are more appropriately called \u201cliberality.\u201d Someone who merely espouses political liberalism, in either sense, does not thereby acquire those excellences of mind and character.\n\nAmerican universities no longer instill the qualities of mind and character necessary to carry out the responsibilities of a sovereign citizen in a Constitutional republic. Berkowitz\u2019s overall point is that \u201ca dark and decidedly illiberal tendency\u201d has emerged in TNR. No doubt that is true, but it is not a mystery. What has happened at TNR is what is happening in progressivism in general; the more progressivism advances, the more its illiberal postulates are revealed.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 06:48:27 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "What has happened at The New Republic is happening in progressivism itself.
