The latest example is Sunrun, which has raised a $150 million Series E round that puts its post-money valuation above $1 billion, Timothy Hay reports for VentureWire. The round for Sunrun is part of a rush of late-stage private capital into the sector\u2013four such deals have closed for a total of $213.5 million through the first quarter, which already surpasses the sector total for each of the last two years, according to data from industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource.

Twitch, launched in June 2011, raised $20 million from investors including Thrive Capital, Alsop Louie Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners in September.

Chinese online retailer JD.com, which is preparing for a U.S. IPO, isn\u2019t offering potential shareholders much say in company affairs, the WSJ\u2019s Liz Hoffman reports. It\u2019s the latest in a string of Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. with governance plans that keep control within a small group.\n\nLongtime Square CTO Bob Lee to Depart.

Focusing too much on the competition can be a mistake for entrepreneurs, writes Maynard Webb for the WSJ\u2019s Accelerators blog. He gives an example: The week he officially joined eBay in 1999, Microsoft and Dell launched an online auction site called FairMarket. Had eBay gotten bogged down in competing against the new inititative, it might have lost its focus and changed its strategy. Instead, FairMarket never became a real threat and eBay wound up buying it a few years later in 2003, showing that big names don\u2019t guarantee big wins.\n\nIn a blog post, Andreessen Horowitz Partner Scott Weiss makes a similar point. \u201cWhen I was at Hotmail, we constantly debated about going after Exchange and the corporate market. Luckily, our growth on the consumer side was so overwhelming that we couldn\u2019t pursue it because we would have gotten killed,\u201d he writes, adding that companies sometimes over-prioritize competitive checklist features. Companies should instead double down on the things that make them special, he says.\n\nUnsung GGV Capital Anoints Tech\u2019s Biggest Players in China, U.S. The Chinese tech world is like a parallel universe, with its own social networks, e-commerce platforms, gaming empires and mobile chat clients.
