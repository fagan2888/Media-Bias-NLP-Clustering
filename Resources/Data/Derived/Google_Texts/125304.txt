Authorities on Monday identified a 19-year-old man who killed himself at a Littleton motel on Friday after officials say he shot and wounded an FBI agent.

The Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office says Jesus Emmanuel Avila shot himself in the head, according to a news release issued Monday. Authorities say he was found dead in a second-floor room of the motel.

An FBI spokeswoman said authorities were serving an arrest warrant in connection with a series of Denver-area bank robberies when the encounter occurred.

Avila shot the agent on at the Essex House Motel on the 5300 block of South Santa Fe Drive at about 4:15 p.m. as officials were serving the warrant, according to the FBI.

Amy Sanders, an FBI spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that authorities were serving a warrant for a man dubbed the “Longhorn Bandit” and wanted in connection with six bank robberies in the Denver area since February.

In some of his early crimes, the bandit was captured on surveillance cameras wearing a cap with a Texas Longhorn logo on it.

The agent , who was shot in the leg, was taken to Swedish Medical Center with injuries that were not considered life-threatening.

Officials say law enforcement fired no bullets in the encounter.

The bank robbery suspect had been tracked to the hotel by the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force, Mike Rankin, special agent in charge of the Denver bureau of the FBI, said Friday after the agent was shot.

Authorities have not definitively said if Avila is suspected of being the Longhorn Bandit.

“We are hoping to provide an update (Monday) as soon as feasible, barring no hiccups,” Sanders told The Denver Post.
