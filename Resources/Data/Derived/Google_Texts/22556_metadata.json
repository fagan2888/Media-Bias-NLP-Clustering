(Photo courtesy of Draw Events)\n\nIt figures to be a Black Friday with a twist of Blackbeard as tickets for Tall Ships Duluth go on sale Friday on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nTall Ships Duluth 2016 will be held August 18-21 in Canal Park and feature several vessels making their first trip under the Aerial Lift Bridge and into Superior Bay. Included in the nine-vessel lineup are a Norwegian Viking ship making its first voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States, and the Spanish El Gale\u00f3n Andaluc\u00eda, a replica of the massive 16th-17th century ships that were designed to explore trade routes around the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge; it\u2019s just amazing. It\u2019s the only replica galleon sailing the world right now,\u201d said Craig Samborski, executive producer of the festival that has undergone significant changes and additions since its last visit to Duluth in 2013.\n\nOf the Viking ship, the Draken Harald H\u00e5rfagre, Samborski said, \u201cWith such a Nordic and Scandinavian population and background we thought it would be cool to bring a 110-foot Viking ship from Norway to hang out as part of the festival.\u201d\n\nTall ships have been visiting Duluth sporadically since the 1990s, with the event formalizing around festivals in 2008, 2010 and 2013 as the vessels rotate from coast to coast and through the Great Lakes in a current three-year cycle.\n\nIn 2016, Samborski\u2019s Duluth-based Draw Events takes over from Visit Duluth as the event organizer. Having been associated with the Duluth event since 2008, and having organized tall ships festivals in Los Angeles and Philadelphia over the past two summers, Samborski has become a self-styled expert in the medium.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sail at all, but I\u2019ve sailed on the ships,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely fascinating.\u201d\n\nVisit Duluth leadership made the decision over the past year or so to divest itself from organizing Tall Ships Duluth and other events, such as this weekend\u2019s Amsoil Duluth National Snocross, in favor of focusing on its mission to market all things Duluth.\n\n\u201cWe were successful and fortunate our staff was able to stretch the way we did and put on tremendous events,\u201d said Anna Tanski, Visit Duluth\u2019s president and chief executive officer. \u201cBut at this point it feels good to be able to focus on our core missions and direct our time, talents and resources toward (marketing).\u201d\n\nVisit Duluth holds a contract with the city to be its official marketing and destination organization, Tanski said. In that role, Visit Duluth will continue to provide support for the tall ships festival and other events through marketing and promotion.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned ships, several other schooners will be in Tall Ships Duluth\u2019s nine-vessel lineup for 2016, including Gen. George Patton\u2019s personal yacht, When and If.\n\nSamborski explained that the legendary Patton commissioned the boat in 1939, on the crest of American involvement in World War II, famously saying he\u2019d sail it, \u201cWhen the war is over and if I survive.\u201d\n\nWhen and If is one of multiple ships that will be available for day sails, allowing visitors to get what Samborski called a \u201creal-life sailing experience.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in 2016, the tall ships festival will coincide with the Art in Bayfront Park event.\n\n\u201cWe ran into a situation where we needed the exact set of dates,\u201d Samborski said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to collaborate. They\u2019ve got such a great lineup of gallery-quality artists. When we realized it was the same weekend, it was kind of a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, tall ships tickets are being bundled with the Duluth Depot, allowing reduced prices for visitors to both attractions. Tickets will range from $9 to $150 \u2014 depending on the level of access. There also will be a limited quantity of \u201cfast passes\u201d for people who want to avoid wait lines onto the ships.\n\nSamborski believes he\u2019s got a hot ticket on his hands. As the tall ships website\u2019s inbox filled with ticket requests it resulted in ticket sales being moved up to Black Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very few attractions or events that appeal to every age group and demographic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a state fair. A family of four can get in at a very affordable price. There\u2019s going to be so much going on that families can come and spend a day very easily.\u201d\n\nTall Ships Duluth 2016\n\nFor tickets, visit www.tallshipsduluth.com\n\nThe lineup*\n\nDraken Harald H\u00e5rfagre\n\nEl Gale\u00f3n Andaluc\u00eda\n\nWhen and If\n\nMist of Avalon\n\nTree of Life\n\nAppledore\n\nPride of Baltimore II\n\nDenis Sullivan\n\nNiagara\n\n*Lineup subject to change", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,bayfront,Canal Park,decc,Lake Superior,Community", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Brady Slater", "og": {"site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "description": "It figures to be a Black Friday with a twist of Blackbeard as tickets for Tall Ships Duluth go on sale Friday on the festival\u2019s website.
