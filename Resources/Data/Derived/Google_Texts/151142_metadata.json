It will face fourth-seeded Iowa State (23-11) on Friday in the Midwest Regional semifinals in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI think they are who they are \u2014 they\u2019re really physical and tough,\u201d Butler coach Chris Holtmann said. \u201cThey make it difficult for you to score. They\u2019re smart and intelligent in how they play. I\u2019m certainly not going to put any more undue pressure on Tony or Virginia than is already there. They\u2019ve got the No. 1 seed by their name, but I think they\u2019re poised to have a very good tournament and we have a great appreciation for how they play.\u201d\n\nAndrew Chrabascz scored a season-high 25 points for ninth-seeded Butler (22-11), but only one of those came in the final 15 minutes after the Cavaliers put Brogdon on him.\n\n\u201cMalcolm\u2019s that type of player \u2014 he\u2019s guarded point guards, wings, different kinds of guys at the 4-spot,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe just said, this is the time\u201d for him to guard Chrabascz.\n\nRoosevelt Jones pulled the Bulldogs within 72-69 by hitting the first of two free throws with 36.2 seconds left.\n\nHe missed the second, Shayok pushed Virginia\u2019s lead back out to four with a free throw with 28.3 seconds left and Kellen Dunham\u2019s 3-pointer with 12 seconds to go bounced off the iron.\n\nJones finished with 18 points, but Dunham, the Bulldogs\u2019 leading scorer at 16.5 points, was held to eight \u2014 his lowest-scoring game since he also had that many in a loss to Providence on Dec. 31.\n\n\u201cOur seniors, they deserve another weekend,\u201d Chrabascz said.\n\nMike Tobey added 10 points for the Cavaliers, who took over a tight game and seemed to hit everything in the second half. They repeatedly found ways to get the ball into the paint and convert during a 28-12 burst midway through the half that gave them the lead for good.\n\nShayok started the run with six straight points, and Virginia hit seven layups or dunks before Gill came through with the shot of the night with just under 6 minutes to play.\n\nHe hit a falling-down jumper in the lane through contact from Chrabascz, and then knocked down the free throw that followed to give the Cavaliers their largest lead at 64-55.\n\nBREAKOUT PERFORMANCE:\n\nThe second-highest scoring game of Chrabascz\u2019s career came at a good time. This performance was second only to his 30-point game against Marquette last season.\n\nHe was 9 of 13 from the field and scored Butler\u2019s first 12 points of the second half \u2014 then didn\u2019t hit a field goal in the final 15 minutes after the Cavaliers\u2019 key defensive switch to Brogdon.\n\n\u201cEvery ball screen I was going into,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was someone in my lap the entire time.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nButler: The Bulldogs were trying to knock off a No. 1 seed for the third time since 2010. \u2026 They fell to 21-4 when leading at halftime.\n\nVirginia: The Cavaliers were 2 of 10 from 3-point range, just the fourth time all season that they shot 20 percent or less from long distance. \u2026 The senior class earned its 111th career victory and with a win in the Sweet 16 will match the school record set in 1983.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nVirginia faces Iowa State in a regional semifinal.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Malcolm Brogdon leads Virginia past Butler 77-69 in second round", "title": "Malcolm Brogdon leads Virginia past Butler 77-69 in second round", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/malcolm-brogdon-leads-virginia-past-butler-77-69-in-second-round/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516581284p1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516581284p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T19:44:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:37:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Malcolm Brogdon scored 22 points and Virginia used some hot shooting to beat Butler 77-69 on Saturday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\u201cI think they are who they are \u2014 they\u2019re really physical and tough,\u201d Butler coach Chris Holtmann said.\nRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 The Virginia Cavaliers refused to let Butler beat them at their own game.\nMike Tobey added 10 points for the Cavaliers, who took over a tight game and seemed to hit everything in the second half.\nCoach Tony Bennett said he told his team that \u201cButler will not lose.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go get it,\u201d he added."}
