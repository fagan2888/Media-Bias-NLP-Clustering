'Glee' Star Mark Salling Settles with Former GF In Fight Over Sexual Encounter

EXCLUSIVE

Former "Glee" star Mark Salling has just agreed to pay a woman more than $2.7 million for knocking her to the ground in a furious fight over an alleged sexual encounter ... and the settlement is absolutely bizarre.

Roxanne Gorzela claimed in her lawsuit ... in 2011, she hooked up with Mark and she consented to having sex but he did not want to wear a condom and forced unprotected sex anyway.

Gorzela claimed a few days later she went to Mark's apartment to confront him, worrying she might have contracted an STD. She claims they fought and he threw her to the ground, severely injuring her knees.

Mark claimed she was just a woman scorned and broke into his place, attacked him and he just defended himself. She sued for sexual battery.

The case settled Monday, in the middle of trial. The sexual battery claim was dropped and the only thing Mark admitted to was negligently causing her to fall and injure herself.

Now this is where it gets bizarre. They agreed to her damages:

-- Past medicals $64,155

-- Future medicals $666,000

-- Past non-economic damages $180,000

-- Future non-economic damages (pain and suffering) $1.8 million

Grand total: $2,710,155

But under the settlement, she agreed to ONLY go after Mark's insurance company to get payment -- NOT Salling.

We're told the insurance company -- State Farm -- already rejected the claim, but now there's a settlement signed by a judge.

And get this ... under the settlement, Salling gets a cut of whatever Gorzela gets from State Farm. Yes, in case that didn't compute with you, Salling will get a cut because he believes State Farm owes him something for rejecting his initial claim in bad faith.
