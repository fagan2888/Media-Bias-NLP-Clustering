The state-run news agency Xinhua said China was experiencing a \u201cBlack Monday\u201d after the stock\u2019s lowest decline in 8 years was recorded.\n\nBlack Monday! #ChinaStocks join global panic selloff, dive 8.5%, worst since Asian financial crisis at midday pic.twitter.com/nLHoFf34bV \u2014 China Xinhua News (@XHNews) August 24, 2015\n\nStocks also nosedived across Europe and Asia as the main indexes in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan and Hong Kong dropped by 4 percent or more.\n\nWilson said a global fall-off is occurring because of China\u2019s economic scope. It is the world\u2019s second-largest importer and has accounted for a third of global economic growth for the past five years\u2014more than any other country in the world. China is also the largest trading nation for 75 countries.\n\n\u201cWhen there are growth concerns in China there are obviously growth concerns at the global economy, and this is exactly what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe predicted that China will have a harder time mediating the current economic \u201ccrisis\u201d than it did in 2009 because of the state\u2019s \u201cenormous\u201d run up in debt, its interest rate cuts, and its continued use of stimulus packages.\n\n\u201cNone of it is working and they\u2019re getting desperate,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see further weakening of the exchange rate because they don\u2019t have anymore policy tools.\u201d\n\nDespite Monday\u2019s stock market numbers, Wilson said those in the U.S. should not panic.\n\n\u201cEconomic growth isn\u2019t tied that tightly to the Chinese economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese economy could actually hit a hard landing and the U.S. economy wouldn\u2019t necessarily go into a recession, we could continue growing,\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. stock markets plummeted Monday, furthering a global market decline that has eliminated nearly $10 trillion from international shares.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "U.S. stock markets plummeted Monday, furthering a global market decline that has eliminated nearly $10 trillion from international shares.", "title": "China\u2019s Economic Woes Jolt Global Stock Markets", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150824_StockPlunge_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JgJkKR"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "U.S. stock markets plummeted Monday, furthering a global market decline that has eliminated nearly $10 trillion from international shares.", "title": "China\u2019s Economic Woes Jolt Global Stock Markets", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150824_StockPlunge_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "monetary policy", "published_time": "2015-08-24T15:17:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "China, Dow Jones, stock market, Black Monday, Shanghai composite index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb513\"", "article_summary": "U.S. stock markets plummeted Monday, furthering a global market decline that has eliminated nearly $10 trillion from international shares as concerns grow over China\u2019s economic health.\nIt is the world\u2019s second-largest importer and has accounted for a third of global economic growth for the past five years\u2014more than any other country in the world.\n\u201cWhen there are growth concerns in China there are obviously growth concerns at the global economy, and this is exactly what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEconomic growth isn\u2019t tied that tightly to the Chinese economy,\u201d he said.\nWilson said a global fall-off is occurring because of China\u2019s economic scope."}
