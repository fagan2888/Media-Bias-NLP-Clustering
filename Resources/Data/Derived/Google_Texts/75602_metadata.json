There\u2019s not yet a race series for the late-model cars in Fairbanks, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s strictly a hand-built car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like just a bunch of tubes when you take the body off.\u201d\n\nAlso on display were cars that can be admired but not tinkered with. At the North Pole Speedway drivers race Legend Cars and other \u201cspec\u201d cars that must be mechanically identical under the rules.\n\nThe Legend and smaller Bandolero cars are designed to put drivers, especially the children and teenagers who drive the Bandoleros, on an even playing field, said Sean Ferris, the president of the Arctic Wheels of Alaska, the nonprofit organization that operates races at the North Pole Speedway.\n\n\u201cRacing is more of a head game then it is about your right foot,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has the same equipment, it\u2019s about how you develop your skills as a driver.\u201d\n\nArctic Wheels of Alaska plans to add two smaller classes of legend-style cars at North Pole Speedway in 2015, quarter-midgets and lawn mowers.\n\nThe quarter-midgets are a 2.5- to- 4 horsepower car for drivers as young as 5 years old. The lawnmower racing is a racing format sanctioned by the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association.\n\nArctic Wheels has experimented with it the last few years at the Tanana Valley State Fair.\n\nLike last year, the Interior\u2019s racing schedule will follow a pattern of Thursday and Friday night races each week in 2015.\n\nOn Thursday, Legend-car and smaller spec-car races take place at the North Pole Speedway, an asphalt oval off of Badger Road.\n\nOn Friday nights, the action is in South Fairbanks at the Mitchell Raceway, where larger stock and modified-class cars race around a dirt track. A handful of special events are mixed in, including the Parrish Racing mud bog races, held each month at the North Pole Speedway.\n\nPartway through the afternoon on Sunday, Matco Tools franchise owner Kelly Murrill got everyone\u2019s attention in earshot when he fired up his Matco Tools Dragster, by far the fastest car on display.\n\nMurrill\u2019s car was adorned with the number 6.80 seconds. That\u2019s the fastest the car has completed a 1,320 foot course, a speed of about 200 miles per hour, Murrill said.\n\nAt that speed, it burns 6 gallons of methanol alcohol fuel in 7 seconds.\n\nFor now drag racers like Murrill\u2019s don\u2019t have a competition track in the Interior. Murrill and a handful of other local drag racers travel to Palmer for competitions.\n\nThat could change in the next few years.\n\nThe Fairbanks Racing Lions have secured permits and are working to raise money to build a drag strip adjacent to the North Pole Speedway.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the tiny quarter-midget racers to the mighty drag racers, Fairbanks drivers are ready for the 2015 season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "From the tiny quarter-midget racers to the mighty drag racers, Fairbanks drivers are ready for the 2015 season.", "title": "Race car drivers in Alaska\u2019s interior ready for season", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/10/race-car-drivers-in-alaskas-interior-ready-for-sea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/08/0a90f498749ad414750f6a706700d5f3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/08/0a90f498749ad414750f6a706700d5f3.jpg", "description": "From the tiny quarter-midget racers to the mighty drag racers, Fairbanks drivers are ready for the 2015 season.", "card": "summary", "title": "Race car drivers in Alaska\u2019s interior ready for season"}, "Author": "SAM FRIEDMAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - From the tiny quarter-midget racers to the mighty drag racers, Fairbanks drivers are ready for the 2015 season.\nAt the North Pole Speedway drivers race Legend Cars and other \u201cspec\u201d cars that must be mechanically identical under the rules.\nTo get ready for the season and show off their cars, racers set up a motor sports car show on a recent Sunday morning.\nRaces are starting at the Interior\u2019s two main car racing courses, the North Pole Speedway and the Mitchell Raceway.\nOn Thursday, Legend-car and smaller spec-car races take place at the North Pole Speedway, an asphalt oval off of Badger Road."}
