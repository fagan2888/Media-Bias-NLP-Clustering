Press, pundits and even a few Republican insiders suggested this week that the Republican frontrunner would ramp down his vigorous campaign rhetoric in the name of appearing presidential. But Mr. Trump was in full voice on Saturday, advising an enthusiastic audience at a jumbo rally in Connecticut that his GOP rival Sen. Ted Cruz was \u201clyin Ted\u201d - and was \u201cstraight out of the hills of Canada.\u201d\n\nHe had a warning as well.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that the Democrats are going to do is sue him on the basis that he\u2019s not a naturalized citizen. That he wasn\u2019t born in this country. I happen to think they\u2019re gonna win, but who knows?\u201d Mr. Trump noted.\n\nIn a pivotal moment, the candidate asked his audience, \u201cIsn\u2019t it nice that I\u2019m not one of these teleprompter guys?\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be presidential.\u201d\n\nThough some press accounts claimed close advisor Paul Manafort was the source of rumors that a kinder, gentler Mr. Trump was emerging, the veteran strategist clarified his position.\n\n\u201cNowhere was I talking about there being a different Donald Trump. What I was talking about was there being a different environment where different parts of the message would be presented in a way that was different from a campaign rally,\u201d Mr. Manafort told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThere would be no reason to change the man who has probably been the most effective communicator in politics certainly since Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump will have an opportunity to exhibit his prowess as a policy wonk on Wednesday when he appears at the National Press Club in the nation\u2019s capital to outline his foreign policy.\n\nMeanwhile, his public outreach is as plainspoken as ever.\n\n\u201cWashington is broken. The truth is, too many politicians are totally controlled by special interests and lobbyists. That\u2019s going to change quickly,\u201d Mr. Trump advises in a new campaign ad. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut taxes for the middle class, negotiate new trade deals, bring back jobs, save Social Security and Medicare without cuts, end illegal immigration, build the wall, strengthen our military, knock out ISIS and take care of our great veterans. We\u2019ll make America great again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump is still very much in touch with his inner Trump, in full voice on Saturday, advising an enthusiastic audience at a jumbo rally in Connecticut that his rival Sen.
