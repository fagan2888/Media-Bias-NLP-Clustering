Some said they wished they\u2019d had something like this list when they began their foray into religious infidelity.\n\nSo, without further ado, here\u2019s a \u201csurvival guide\u201d to being an atheist in the Bible Belt:\n\nYou may be lonely, but you aren\u2019t alone\n\nNot so long ago, every other letter sent to the Freedom From Religion Foundation would begin something like, \u201cI\u2019m the only atheist in Nebraska \u2026 \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s still lonely being an atheist in rural America, says Annie Laurie Gaylor, the foundation\u2019s co-president, but there are plenty of skeptics and nonbelievers in God\u2019s Country \u2013 if you know how to find them.\n\nEven the most religious states like Mississippi and Alabama have secular meetup groups, although many keep quiet and require long drives to attend.\n\nGaylor\u2019s favorite story about the secretive lives of Bible Belt atheists involves two neighbors in Georgia whose jaws dropped when they saw each other at an atheist gathering. Each had assumed that the other was a good, God-fearing Baptist.\n\n\u201cThey were afraid to speak out,\" she says, \"because they didn\u2019t want to be stigmatized.\u201d\n\nGaylor recommends looking online for atheist support groups in your area; and be sure to search for related terms as well: agnostic, freethought, skeptic and nonbeliever.\n\nIt\u2019s no fun debating fundamentalists\n\nBart Ehrman doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of guy who backs down from a fight.\n\nThe University of North Carolina scholar often seeks them out, regularly debating the Bible and early Christianity with evangelicals and other experts.\n\nBut Ehrman told the atheists gathered in Raleigh not to bother arguing with fundamentalists.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t convince a fundamentalist that he or she is wrong,\u201d he says.\n\nTheir theology is a closed system, according to Ehrman, and their social bonds with fellow fundamentalists are too tightly knit to admit any wiggle room.\n\n\u201cYou can point to any contradiction in the Bible and it just doesn\u2019t matter. They will either find some way to reconcile it or say that even if they don\u2019t understand it, God does.\u201d\n\nTechnically, the term fundamentalist refers to a movement of 20th-century Protestants who rejected modernity and clung to a literal interpretation of the Bible.\n\nBut Ehrman has a different definition: \u201cSomeone who is no fun, too much damn, and not enough mental.\u201d\n\nPeople will think you worship Satan\n\nMany Americans don\u2019t actually know any professed atheists, according to surveys - which means they often seem to assume the worst about them.\n\nFewer than half of Americans say they\u2019d vote for an atheist politician; a similar number say they wouldn\u2019t want their children to marry a nonbeliever.\n\nA recent study also showed that businesses in the South are more likely to discriminate against atheist job candidates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they think we are, Satanists or baby eaters or who knows what,\u201d activist Todd Stiefel told the atheists gathered in Raleigh, \u201cbut it\u2019s kind of scary.\"\n\nA recent survey conducted for Stiefel's new \u201cOpenly Secular\u201d campaign found that 20% of Americans can\u2019t even define atheism. Far more don\u2019t know what \u201chumanist,\u201d \u201cfreethinker\u201d or \u201cagnostic\u201d means.\n\nBehold, the six types of atheists\n\nBased on \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d and other gay rights campaigns, \u201cOpenly Secular\u201d hopes to counter that ignorance by asking atheists to share stories online about their lives and beliefs.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is humanize us,\u201d Stiefel says. \u201cFrankly, most of the hate and distrust comes from misunderstanding about who we are.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to convince your friends, family and neighbors to accept all of your views, the atheist activist says. You just have to get them to accept you.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s better to stay in the closet\n\nAfter secular conferences like the one here Raleigh, many nonbelievers get so jazzed that they rush home and blurt out \u2026 \"Guess, what? I\u2019m an ATHEIST!!!\"\n\nThat can be a really bad idea, says Sarah Morehead, executive director of Recovering From Religion.\n\nIt may help the atheist movement as a whole to share your lack of faith with friends and family. But it\u2019s not always the best - or the safest - move for you, she says.\n\nRecovering From Religion\u2019s online support groups are filled with stories about people who lost their jobs, their kids or their spouses after coming out as atheist, Morehead says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. People don\u2019t realize how big a difference expressing their nonbelief can make.\u201d\n\nRecovering From Religion recommends having a plan in place before coming out as atheist.\n\n\u201cIf you decide you\u2019re a nonbeliever,\u201d Morehead says, \u201cyou\u2019re still going to be a nonbeliever in a year.\"\n\nThe group\u2019s own 10.5-step plan includes creating a support network, declining to get into debates and preparing yourself for a \u201creligious breakup\u201d with friends and family. (The half-step assures budding nonbelievers they don\u2019t have to be experts on atheism and points them toward educational resources.)\n\nDon\u2019t be the \u2018office atheist\u2019\n\nCandace Gorham says her close family is accepting of her atheism - but she\u2019s not completely \u201cout\u201d at work yet, and doesn\u2019t know if she wants to be.\n\nGorham, who was raised in the black church, says religion is deeply embedded in the lives of many Southern African-Americans, and the borders between private and public spirituality often blur.\n\n\u201cI work for a black-owned company, and most of my supervisors are black females, and it\u2019s just sort of OK for everybody to talk about God, or offer to pray for you,\u201d says Gorham.\n\nThe 33-year-old is author of a new book called \u201cThe Ebony Exodus Project,\u201d about black women leaving the church, which has pushed Gorham herself to become more public about being an atheist.\n\nRecently, a co-worker told Gorham she had seen her talking about being an atheist on Roland Martin\u2019s television show.\n\n\u201cI was like, Oh my God, shhh don\u2019t tell anybody!\u201d\n\nA mental-health counselor who works with children, Gorham worries that people will stop referring clients to her once they find out she\u2019s a nonbeliever.\n\nAccording to a survey Stiefel presented in Raleigh, more than 50% of Americans believe atheist teachers and day-care employees - people who, like Gorham, work with children - are likely to face discrimination at work.\n\nShe knows it's only a matter of time until more of her office mates find out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting to a place where I don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m just going to have to be comfortable with it - but it does concern me.\u201d\n\nThe Internet is your frenemy\n\nA co-worker isn\u2019t the only person who saw Gorham talking about atheism on television.\n\nHer aunt read about the Roland Martin interview online, which led Gorham\u2019s mother to call and ask if she is really an atheist.\n\nThe conversation went well, Gorham says, and her mother understands and respects her beliefs.\n\nBut the unexpected disclosure shows why many atheists cover their Internet tracks, even as they increasingly look for like-minded communities online.\n\nGorham says she used to delete her browsing history on her laptop after watching atheist debates and lectures online lest her husband or other family members find out her faith was wavering.\n\n\u201cI was still early in my deconversion and I wasn\u2019t sure how he would perceive it,\u201d says the Greensboro, North Carolina, native.\n\nOthers here for the conference said they keep two separate Facebook pages, one for friends and family and one for their secular communities.\n\n\u201cFacebook is my happy place,\u201d says one middle-aged woman who made a nearly seven-hour drive to Raleigh from Crossville, Tennessee.\n\nThe woman, who didn't want to be identified, teaches at public schools. She says most of her neighbors and co-workers are Christians.\n\n\u201cCrossville is a small Bible Belt community with churches on every corner,\u201d she said, \u201cand everything shuts down on Sunday except for Wal-Mart and the hospital.\u201d\n\nMost co-workers assume she\u2019s Christian, but she joins as many atheist groups online as she can and keeps an anonymous Facebook page called \u201cWithin Reason.\u201d\n\nOne recent post asks people to click \u201clike\u201d if they\u2019ve ever been unfriended because of an atheism-themed status update.\n\nSome people take Bible-thumping literally\n\nAdults may face more real-life repercussions for coming out as atheist in the Bible Belt, but that doesn\u2019t mean kids have an easy ride.\n\nKalei Wilson, 15, says she lost friends after trying to start a secular student club at Pisgah High School in Canton, North Carolina; and someone used a Bible to destroy her science project, leaving the holy book on her smashed model of the universe.\n\nThe blue-haired, nose-pierced freshman says she\u2019s not the only atheist at her high school, but most of them are closeted.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to come out at first,\u201d Wilson says, \u201cbut in order to start the club I had to.\u201d\n\nIn exchange for her openness, Wilson says, some students mutter \"Jesus loves you\u201d as she walks down the hall, and she regularly receives text messages with the greeting, \u201cHey, Satan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost friends because of it,\u201d the teenager says of her atheism, \u201cbut they\u2019re not real friends if that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nHave a sense of humor\n\nFor all the heartbreaking stories, if was there was a soundtrack to the conference in Raleigh, it would include a lot of laughter.\n\nIt seemed as if the atheists and freethinkers here had been storing their sharpest religion jokes for weeks, preparing for the day when they would find an appreciative audience at last.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living in the South for 13 years,\u201d says Pat Meller, who came to Raleigh from nearby Greensboro, \u201cand I\u2019ve had to watch my tongue for just as long.\u201d\n\nSo for two days, Meller and her kindred spirits cut loose.\n\nThey quipped about the folly of prayer, bought bumper-stickers calling the Bible a \u201cGrim Fairy Tale,\u201d and wore T-shirts proclaiming their belief in life before death.\n\nHarry Shaughnessy, president of the Triangle Freethought Society, played the cut-up emcee for much of the weekend.\n\n\u201cFor every activist-oriented event we have, we want to have three to five things that are just fun,\u201d says Shaughnessy, whose group holds regular \u201cHeathen Happy Hours\u201d and meets for barbecues in each other\u2019s homes.\n\nAt one point, the youthful 44-year-old donned a crown and a form-fitting, skin-colored costume to bestow Freedom From Religion\u2019s \u201cEmperor Has No Clothes\u201d award on Steifel for his activism.\n\nPerhaps appropriately for an atheist event, Shaughnessy\u2019s get-up left little to the imagination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Editor Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) \u2013 Back home, they erase their Internet histories, look over their shoulders before cracking jokes and nod politely when co-workers talk about church.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Atheists in the Bible Belt: A survival guide", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/24/atheists-in-the-bible-belt-a-survival-guide/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140516154938-bible-belt-atheism-00014928-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaleigh, North Carolina (CNN) \u2013 Back home, they erase their Internet histories, look over their shoulders before cracking jokes and nod politely when co-workers talk about church.", "title": "Atheists in the Bible Belt: A survival guide"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "atheism, belief, black issues, church and state, culture wars, discrimination, internet, lost faith, nones, north carolina, prejudice, religious liberty, atheism, atheist, bible belt, freedom from religion, freethinkers, freethought, nonbelievers, skeptics", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/24/atheists-in-the-bible-belt-a-survival-guide/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Gaylor\u2019s favorite story about the secretive lives of Bible Belt atheists involves two neighbors in Georgia whose jaws dropped when they saw each other at an atheist gathering.\nBy Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog EditorRaleigh, North Carolina (CNN) \u2013 Back home, they erase their Internet histories, look over their shoulders before cracking jokes and nod politely when co-workers talk about church.\nIt may help the atheist movement as a whole to share your lack of faith with friends and family.\nThe University of North Carolina scholar often seeks them out, regularly debating the Bible and early Christianity with evangelicals and other experts.\nBut Ehrman told the atheists gathered in Raleigh not to bother arguing with fundamentalists."}
