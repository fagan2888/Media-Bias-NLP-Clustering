Arizona gave Greinke a six-year, $206 million contract to help take the D-Backs from also-rans to contenders.\n\nAsked how he handles the pressure of being Arizona\u2019s new ace, Greinke told Arizona reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t try to wrap my mind around it. It doesn\u2019t cross my mind ever, really.\u201d\n\nPitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers last season, Greinke went 19-3 and was the runner-up for the NL Cy Young Award. His 1.66 ERA was the second-lowest ERA in Dodgers history. Greinke has posted 15 or more victories in each of the last five seasons, but a 20-win season has eluded him.\n\nGreinke, on Arenado. Greinke has had his way with the Rockies, going 7-3 with a 3.69 ERA in 17 career games (16 starts) against them. He has also dominated third baseman Nolan Arenado, who has hit just .208 (5-for-24) with three doubles and two RBIs vs. Greinke.\n\nBut Arenado evolved into one of baseball\u2019s best young hitters last season, belting 42 homers and driving in 130 runs. Arenado has certainly captured the attention, and respect, of Greinke.\n\n\u201cHe can hit every pitch,\u201d the veteran right-hander said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the toughest part. Every pitch in every location. There\u2019s not many guys that can do that. I don\u2019t know how he did it.\n\n\u201cIt seems like he figured out how to hit the ball in the air more and not strike out, and he still has power. It\u2019s like the perfect combination to hit. Early on, it seemed like he hit more groundballs. \u2026 Now he\u2019s more line drives, flyballs. With his power and not striking out, that\u2019s about as good as it gets.\u201d\n\nSpring forward. Left-handed reliever Jason Gurka was slipping off the Rockies\u2019 radar. After putting up a 9.39 ERA in nine games with Colorado last season, Gurka, 28, was removed from the 40-man roster at season\u2019s end.\n\nMonday, however, he will be in the Rockies\u2019 bullpen, thanks to an outstanding performance in spring training that was the result of an improved changeup.\n\n\u201cHe basically outpitched the entire camp,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cHe was dominant. I don\u2019t put all my eggs into the spring training basket, but there was a confidence that he showed this spring that lined up with the performance.\u201d\n\nThe former Baltimore Orioles minor-leaguer finished his spring with a 1.69 ERA and 20 strikeouts in 10 innings.\n\nRoster finalized. Colorado set its opening-day roster by placing six players on the disabled list Sunday.\n\nInfielder Daniel Descalso (fractured left hand), right-handers Jon Gray (abdominal strain) and Jason Motte (shoulder strain) and left-handers Tyler Anderson (oblique strain) and Tyler Matzek (anxiety) were sent to the 15-day DL, retroactive to March 25. Right-handed reliever Jairo Diaz, who underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, was placed on the 60-day DL.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 players on the 60-day DL \u2014 Diaz, as well as right-hander Adam Ottavino (elbow) and shortstop Jose Reyes, who is on the restricted list \u2014 do not occupy slots on the club\u2019s 40-man roster, which is full.\n\nRockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (9-7, 4.17 ERA in 2015) at D-backs RHP Zack Greinke (19-3, 1.66), 7:40 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nBoth opening-day starters have credentials. De La Rosa is the Rockies\u2019 franchise leader in wins (78) and strikeouts (877), and his 48-16 record (.750 winning percentage) at Coors Field surpasses everyone else. Greinke is simply one of the best pitchers of his generation, and he has been paid for it. He shocked the baseball world by signing a six-year, $206.5 million deal with Arizona after a remarkable season in which he posted a 1.66 ERA for the Dodgers \u2014 the majors\u2019 lowest since Greg Maddux in 1995. Greinke has made only one opening-day start, back in 2010 with Kansas City when he was coming off his first Cy Young Award. In 17 career games (16 starts) vs. the Rockies, Greinke is 7-3 with a 3.69 ERA. De La Rosa is 9-8 with a 2.94 ERA vs. the D-backs, but he has fared poorly at Chase Field, going 1-7 with a 4.22 ERA in 10 starts.\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post\n\nTuesday: Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (9-11, 5.22 ERA in 2015) at D-backs RHP Shelby Miller (6-17, 3.22), 7:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (did not play in 2015) vs. D-backs LHP Patrick Corbin (6-5, 3.60, 2015), 1:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Off", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 foe Zack Greinke doesn\u2019t sweat huge Diamondbacks expectations", "title": "Rockies\u2019 foe Zack Greinke doesn\u2019t sweat huge Diamondbacks expectations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/03/rockies-foe-zack-greinke-doesnt-sweat-huge-diamondbacks-expectations/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160401__greinkep1.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160401__greinkep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-03T18:24:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:11:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 17 career games (16 starts) vs. the Rockies, Greinke is 7-3 with a 3.69 ERA.\nHe has also dominated third baseman Nolan Arenado, who has hit just .208 (5-for-24) with three doubles and two RBIs vs. Greinke.\nIt doesn\u2019t cross my mind ever, really.\u201dPitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers last season, Greinke went 19-3 and was the runner-up for the NL Cy Young Award.\nThe 2009 American League Cy Young Award winner makes his Diamondbacks debut Monday night in the season opener vs. the Rockies.\nRockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (9-7, 4.17 ERA in 2015) at D-backs RHP Zack Greinke (19-3, 1.66), 7:40 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AMBoth opening-day starters have credentials."}
