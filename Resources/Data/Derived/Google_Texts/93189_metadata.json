Hospitals Economic Impact Report released today by the New Jersey Hospital Association said.\n\nFor instance, hospitals purchased $2.8 billion in goods and services from other companies last year, an increase of $100 million over 201, the report said. Hospitals also paid more than $8.3 billion in salaries last year, $400 million more than in 2012.\n\nWorkers paid $457 million in state income taxes last year, $22 million more than in 2012.\n\n\u201cEven as New Jersey hospitals are shouldering significant cuts in reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act, they continue to be a stable force in New Jersey\u2019s economy by adding jobs while still giving back to their communities and providing $1.3 billion in charity care for our uninsured,\u201d said NJHA President and CEO Betsy Ryan.\n\nHealthcare will continue to add jobs in New Jersey, according to the report, which cites a state Department of Labor analysis that projected that nearly 62,000 jobs will be added from 2010 to 2020.\n\nThe report, with data from individual hospitals, may be found here.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey hospitals help provide economic stability to the state through employment and revenue. And their economic investments in their facilities help expand infrastructure, purchase new technology and maintain a highly skilled workforce,\u201d said Sean Hopkins, the association's senior vice president of health economics.\n\nSusan K.
