I spent much time and energy seeking quality options across the spectrum of senior living: from independent living apartments, to assisted living communities, to special Alzheimer\u2019s communities, and finally to long-term skilled nursing facilities.\n\nAs Chair of CCAL, I hope that you will adopt a person-centered perspective as you seek senior living options for yourself or your loved ones.\n\nSuch a perspective requires an understanding that person-centered care is a holistic approach that focuses on enhancing all the dimensions of one\u2019s health and well-being, which includes:\n\nPhysical health\n\nIntellectual being\n\nSocial and emotional wellness\n\nCreative being\n\nSpiritual being\n\nPerson-centered living encompasses care, services and meaningful engagement that are planned according to residents\u2019 personal preferences, values and goals. This approach honors each senior\u2019s dignity, choice, self-determination and individuality, which enhances quality of life and quality of care for seniors.\n\nWhat Person-Centered Care Means for Seniors\n\nFrom the seniors\u2019 perspective, this type of care includes the following principles and practices:\n\n\u201cNothing about me, without me.\u201d\n\nI have the right to determine how best to meet my needs.\n\nMy care should optimize my physical and psychosocial well-being.\n\nMy care must be nurturing, empowering and respectful.\n\nIt must include me, my family and care team in decision-making.\n\nWhat Matters Most: Positive Emotional Connections and Experiences\n\nWhen seniors offer their perspective on quality of care and services, they most often describe how the care or service was experienced by them.\n\nAlthough seniors would probably say, \u201cIt\u2019s all about providing positive emotional connections and taking a new view of me,\u201d I believe they are really saying something else. They are saying, \u201cSee me for the person I truly am. See me for all the things I believe in, care about, and love to do. Don\u2019t diminish my personhood just because I need some assistance with activities of daily living.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all about relationships and valuing the uniqueness of each resident.\n\nHow Person-Centered Care Affects Memory Care\n\nWhen applied in memory care settings, all of the above-mentioned values, relationships, experiences and practices are enhancing the lives of individuals with dementia and other cognitive issues.\n\nHow person-centered memory care enhances dementia patients\u2019 lives, and how to create a person-centered memory care setting can be found on CCAL\u2019s website.\n\nPerson-Center Care Slow to Evolve in the U.S.\n\nIn 2001, the Institute of Medicine\u2019s (IOM) report titled \u201cCrossing the Quality Chasm\u201d called for a redesign of our nation\u2019s healthcare system, and described healthcare in America as impersonal and fragmented. The IOM report stated that a critical element needed in the redesign was a shift to a person-centered approach moving away from the traditional clinician/disease centered one.\n\nIn the decade following the IOM report, however, little national progress had been made to shift to making person-centeredness the standard of healthcare and long-term services and supports (LTSS). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 helps to reinforce the need for change by requiring that services funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services be provided in a person-centered manner.\n\nA growing body of empirical evidence indicates that person-centered practices are more pleasant to experience, help to optimize health and well-being outcomes, and result in higher satisfaction.\n\nAccording to Jason A. Wolf, PhD, and Executive Director of the Beryl Institute, \u201cThe healthcare experience\u2026 is based on every interaction a patient and/or their family have on the care journey and is ultimately measured by the very perceptions those individuals have of their experience.\u201d\n\nExcerpted from: Dementia Care: The Quality Chasm, K. Love and J. Pinkowitz (eds). Falls Church, VA. National Dementia Initiative, CCAL\n\nSeeking Person-Centered Living Communities\n\nAs you visit different communities, I encourage you to spend time at the community and see how comfortable you and your loved ones feel being there. Ask yourselves if you feel the following principles are being practiced:\n\nEvery person is provided a choice, autonomy and independence, and is treated with dignity, respect and privacy.\n\nServices are provided in a respectful way that also includes their family and larger caregiving and support network.\n\nPeople have the right to determine their needs, decide how best to have those needs met, and to be provided a means to give feedback about the quality and nature of the services and supports.\n\nMoving into a new community is a major transition for the prospective resident and your entire family, so I urge you to drop by the community at different times of the day and week. Chat informally with residents and staff. Are they friendly and positive about the community? Look for life enrichment within the community. Does it feel as if they are honoring the residents\u2019 life experiences, choices and routines in the natural rhythms of daily living? These are the person-centered elements that contribute to residents\u2019 and families\u2019 sense of belonging and well-being.\n\nWishing you much success in seeking person-centered senior living!\n\nJackie Pinkowitz, M.Ed., is the Chair of the CCAL: Advancing Person-Centered Living, and a co-leader of the Dementia Action Alliance and the National Dementia Initiative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jackie Pinkowitz, Chair of the CCAL, speaks with us about person-centered care and it's effects on the senior care industry.", "og": {"description": "Jackie Pinkowitz, Chair of the CCAL, speaks with us about person-centered care and it's effects on the senior care industry.", "title": "How Person-Centered Care is Changing the Senior Care Industry", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/how-person-centered-care-is-changing-the-senior-care-industry.jpg", "height": 383}, "updated_time": "2014-02-10T09:50:14-07:00", "url": "http://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/senior-person-centered-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jackie Pinkowitz, Chair of the CCAL, speaks with us about person-centered care and it's effects on the senior care industry.", "title": "How Person-Centered Care is Changing the Senior Care Industry", "image": "http://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/how-person-centered-care-is-changing-the-senior-care-industry.jpg", "creator": "@aplaceformom", "site": "@aplaceformom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003829061896}, "article": {"section": "Senior Living Industry News", "published_time": "2014-02-10T09:30:03-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-10T09:50:14-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "aging, lifestyle, health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5194\"", "article_summary": "Jackie Pinkowitz, M.Ed., and Chair of the CCAL, discussed her experience with person-centered care with us, and writes about how it is changing the senior care industry.\nWe recently spoke with CCAL: Advancing Person-Centered Living, a non-profit national consumer advocacy and education organization focused on raising awareness about person-centered care.\nHow person-centered memory care enhances dementia patients\u2019 lives, and how to create a person-centered memory care setting can be found on CCAL\u2019s website.\nWishing you much success in seeking person-centered senior living!\nAs Chair of CCAL, I hope that you will adopt a person-centered perspective as you seek senior living options for yourself or your loved ones."}
