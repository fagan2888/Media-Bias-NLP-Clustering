We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That\u2019s what gets me.\u201d\n\nOldman also defended Alec Baldwin\u2019s use of homophobic language, an issue that hasn\u2019t quite cost Baldwin his career but has been hotly contested since last fall: \u201cAlec calling someone an F-A-G in the street while he\u2019s pissed off coming out of his building because they won\u2019t leave him alone. I don\u2019t blame him.
