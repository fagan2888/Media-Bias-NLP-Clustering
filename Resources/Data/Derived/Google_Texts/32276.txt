Texas Senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz expressed his love for The Simpsons Thursday, only to have the long-running Fox cartoon’s producer publicly state the show doesn’t love him back.

During a radio conversation with The Daily Beast’s Will Rahn, Cruz talked about Obamacare, his colleagues in the Senate, and popular culture, including his favorite television shows.

After disclosing he is a big fan of The Simpsons, Cruz began to quote lines from his favorite episodes of the show. One of those was the 1995 episode “Round Springfield,” wherein the infamous joke “cheese-eating surrender monkeys” was coined to poke fun at the French.

Cruz also recalled a scene from 1996’s “Treehouse of Horror VII,” in which space aliens named Kang and Kodos take on the identities of President Clinton and Bob Dole in order to run for president and take over the world.

In the show, Kodos the alien explains to a Springfield voter that he has no choice but to vote for one of the two them, and that in a two-party system, when someone votes third party, the vote is wasted. Kang replied, “Go ahead, throw your vote away.”

The Daily Beast later contacted Simpson’s producer Al Jean for comment, and he did not return the love.

“To paraphrase Kang, ‘Ted Cruz?’ Go ahead, throw your vote away,” Jean told the site.

During his interview, Cruz also stated he is not a fan of HBO’s True Blood, which mocked him in 2014.

Unrequited love for pop culture icons is familiar territory for Republican politicians. After years of professing his love for all things Bruce Springsteen, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie finally found himself in the good graces of “The Boss” just last year.

“He actually told me we were friends,” Christie said of Springsteen.
