Rosario is fine with that.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I know is that I want to win and do the best thing I can for my team,\u201d Rosario said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be that great player like (Todd) Helton or (Justin) Morneau at first, but I want to be a player. If they need me there, I will prepare.\u201d\n\nFirst and foremost, Rosario is a catcher, and he said a winter spent working in his native Dominican Republic has him well prepared. He\u2019s down from 232 pounds to 223 and he worked hard to build leg strength.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more flexible and stronger,\u201d he said.\n\nRosario has a new catching coach this season. Exuberant Rene Lachemann took over the quiet and studious Jerry Weinstein. Rosario has noticed the difference between the two men.\n\n\u201cThey both have that special thing, the old school, to prepare you for games,\u201d Rosario said. \u201cRight now with Lachemann it\u2019s a little (more) dynamic. You can laugh more and be happy. With Jerry, it was a little serious. When we were going to work, we were going to work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jerry Weinstein,Justin Morneau,Rene Lachemann,Todd Helton,Wilin Rosario", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Colorado Rockies catcher Wilin Rosario was back at work Saturday, returning to spring training  from Denver where his new daughter, Aidelyus, was born.", "title": "Rockies' Rosario welcomes new baby bull to family, gets back to work", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/02/22/rockies-wilin-rosario-welcomes-new-baby-bull-family-gets-back-work/16440/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado Rockies catcher Wilin Rosario was back at work Saturday, returning to spring training  from Denver where his new daughter, Aidelyus, was born.", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Wilin Rosario welcomes new baby bull to family, gets back to work", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/02/22/rockies-wilin-rosario-welcomes-new-baby-bull-family-gets-back-work/16440/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado Rockies catcher Wilin Rosario was back at work Saturday, returning to spring training from Denver where his new daughter, Aidelyus, was born."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9d2\"", "article_summary": "SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. \u2014After welcoming a baby Baby Bull to the family, the Rockies\u2019 Baby Bull returned to spring training Saturday morning.\n\u201cShe\u2019s great, everything\u2019s great,\u201d Rosario said.\nWhen we were going to work, we were going to work.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be that great player like (Todd) Helton or (Justin) Morneau at first, but I want to be a player.\nCatcher Wilin Rosario, who was back in Denver to see his new daughter, Aidelys, come into the world, was all smiles in the Rockies\u2019 clubhouse."}
