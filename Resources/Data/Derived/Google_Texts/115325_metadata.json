Remember that. Don\u2019t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number is probably 28-29 as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently the number may be as high as 42%. Do you think we\u2019d have a gathering like? If we had 5% unemployment, do you think we\u2019d have gatherings like this?\u201d\n\nDonald Trump also proclaimed that the American people are miserable with Obamacare, and generally gave a speech that was full of empty self-hype, paranoia, and delusion. In other words, it was a typical Donald Trump speech. It is easy to brush off Trump as just another paranoid loon, but this paranoid loon just won the New Hampshire Republican primary and is leading the delegate count for the nomination.\n\nTrump is a symptom of the larger Republican disease. Donald Trump can call the unemployment numbers fake because Republicans no longer believe in facts. If Republicans disagree with a fact, they proclaim that the fact isn\u2019t real.\n\nThe man who could be the Republican nominee thinks that branch of the federal government that he wants to lead is cooking the books on unemployment. Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and the former Grand Old Party is completely unhinged from reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump made a complete break from reality in his New Hampshire victory speech by declaring that the unemployment numbers are a lie, and unemployment is really 42%.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Donald Trump made a complete break from reality in his New Hampshire victory speech by declaring that the unemployment numbers are a lie, and unemployment is really 42%.", "title": "Trump Goes Paranoid Loon In NH Victory Speech And Declares Employment Numbers A Lie", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/09/trump-goes-paranoid-loon-in-nh-victory-speech-and-declares-employment-numbers-a-lie.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Trump-NH-victory-speech.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-09T22:28:51+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Donald Trump,trump claims unemployment numbers are fake,trump NH victory speech,trump wins new hampshire primary,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2016-02-09T22:28:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-09T22:28:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, trump claims unemployment numbers are fake, trump NH victory speech, trump wins new hampshire primary"}, "article_summary": "In other words, it was a typical Donald Trump speech.\nDonald Trump made a complete break from reality in his New Hampshire victory speech by declaring that the unemployment numbers are a lie, and unemployment is really 42%.\nDonald Trump can call the unemployment numbers fake because Republicans no longer believe in facts.\nDonald Trump is the Republican Party, and the former Grand Old Party is completely unhinged from reality.\nIt is easy to brush off Trump as just another paranoid loon, but this paranoid loon just won the New Hampshire Republican primary and is leading the delegate count for the nomination."}
