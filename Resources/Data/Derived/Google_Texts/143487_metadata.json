Williams writes that he didn\u2019t hear from his close friend Woods for four months as the golfer\u2019s marriage, career and reputation fell apart.\n\nWhile Williams says he was angry to learn Woods had cheated on his wife Elin Nordegren, \u201che was still a friend in trouble and I was going to stick by him. I did that even though people were accusing me of being an enabler, an accomplice, saying I was lying when I stated clearly that I knew nothing about this.\u201d\n\nWilliams says his life became \u201cabsolutely miserable\u201d as details of Woods\u2019 behavior emerged and people suspected he had been aware of, or event played some part in Woods\u2019 affairs.\n\n\u201cPeople in my local community would front up to me at the shops and call me a liar to my face, and ask \u2018what are you doing with him?'\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cI repeatedly asked for Tiger\u2019s management to release a statement that would clear me of any involvement in this lurid news.\n\n\u201cThey simply wouldn\u2019t do it because there were others in his group who knew exactly what was going on and management felt they couldn\u2019t single out one person as innocent. Angry, frustrated and hung out to dry, I was also in limbo about when I would next work.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he didn\u2019t consider quitting as Woods\u2019 caddie \u201cas I felt incredibly loyal to Tiger \u2014 this was the toughest time of his life and I wasn\u2019t going to ditch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTiger finally rang me on March 23 (2010). He had already sent me an apologetic email when he was in rehab. It was heartfelt and meaningful; he was open, honest and remorseful and it reinforced my thinking that because I was so straight up and had such strong values, he felt he couldn\u2019t tell me what was going on with his affairs.\u201d\n\nWilliams said that before resuming his 13-year association with Woods he met with the golfer and presented a list of demands.\n\n\u201cI wanted him to prove to me he could change his behavior and show me \u2014 and the game of golf \u2014 more respect,\u201d he said.\n\nWilliams said he often felt angry when Woods \u201cwould flippantly toss a club in the general direction of the bag, expecting me to go over and pick it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt uneasy about bending down to pick up his discarded club \u2013 it was like I was his slave,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe other thing that disgusted me was his habit of spitting at the hole if he missed a putt. Tiger listened to what I had to say, the air was cleared and we got on with it \u2014 his goal was to be the best player in history and my goal was to keep working as best I could to help make that happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Caddie Steve Williams rips Tiger Woods in his new book", "title": "Caddie Steve Williams rips Tiger Woods in his new book", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/caddie-steve-williams-rips-tiger-woods-in-his-new-book/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__steve-williamsp1.jpg", "height": 408}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__steve-williamsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T18:12:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:09:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "'\u201d Williams wrote.\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 Tiger Woods\u2019 former caddie Steve Williams has described his anger and frustration at being \u201chung out to dry\u201d by Woods\u2019 management when the golfer\u2019s infidelities were revealed in 2009, and says he was sometimes treated as a \u201cslave\u201d on the course.\nWilliams writes that he didn\u2019t hear from his close friend Woods for four months as the golfer\u2019s marriage, career and reputation fell apart.\nA New Zealand newspaper on Sunday published a chapter of Williams\u2019 tell-all book \u201cOut of the Rough\u201d in which the New Zealand-born caddie describes his reaction on learning of Woods\u2019 extramarital affairs.\n\u201cThey simply wouldn\u2019t do it because there were others in his group who knew exactly what was going on and management felt they couldn\u2019t single out one person as innocent."}
