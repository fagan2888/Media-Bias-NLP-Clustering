Companies this size don\u2019t face the ObamaCare employer mandate, but were supposed to be helped by the law\u2019s ban on medical underwriting and the competitive small business insurance markets it promised to unleash.\n\nThe survey found the opposite. A quarter of firms that that had offered insurance to their employees last year were canceling their health plans this year, and another 25% said they planned to do so next year.\n\nMore telling is the fact that 68% of those dropping coverage this year are directing their employees to the Healthcare.gov website to buy coverage on their own.\n\nIn other words, these companies are shifting their health insurance costs onto taxpayers. That\u2019s the very outcome ObamaCare architects like Gruber said wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nWait, there\u2019s more.\n\nNearly half of the firms surveyed say they\u2019ve limiting or reducing new hires because of the law \u2014 presumably to avoid coming up against the employer mandate should they go over 50 workers. And 28% said they are considering cutting back their overall workforce because of the law.\n\nIn his latest State of the Union speech, President Obama, after bragging about the recent economic growth, said he\u2019d make sure \u201cgovernment doesn\u2019t halt the progress we\u2019re making.\u201d\n\nA good place for him to start living up to that promise would be with ObamaCare.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the ObamaCare debate was raging five years ago, advocates insisted that the law would have only a minimal impact on employer-provided health plans. \"A key", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "When the ObamaCare debate was raging five years ago, advocates insisted that the law would have only a minimal impact on employer-provided health plans. \u201cA key goal of the bill,\u201d explai\u2026", "title": "Small Firms Dropping Health Coverage Because of ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/survey-finds-small-firms-in-michigan-dropping-coverage-because-of-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-01-23 12:17:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-23T12:17:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2961\"", "article_summary": "In other words, these companies are shifting their health insurance costs onto taxpayers.\nWhen the ObamaCare debate was raging five years ago, advocates insisted that the law would have only a minimal impact on employer-provided health plans.\nMore telling is the fact that 68% of those dropping coverage this year are directing their employees to the Healthcare.gov website to buy coverage on their own.\nThe survey focused on companies in the southwestern region of the state that have 50 or fewer full-time employees.\nCompanies this size don\u2019t face the ObamaCare employer mandate, but were supposed to be helped by the law\u2019s ban on medical underwriting and the competitive small business insurance markets it promised to unleash."}
