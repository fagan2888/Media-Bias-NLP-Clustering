In a preview of the Pentagon\u2019s upcoming 2017 budget request, Carter said military research and development spending would rise to $71.4 billion from last year\u2019s $71.3 billion request.) Carter also listed areas where the Defense Department was already seeing \u201creturns\u201d on R&D spending through the Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to tell you about a few projectsSCO has been working on that we\u2019re funding in the budget,\u201d he said. \u201cSome you may have heard of, and some we\u2019re talking about here for the very first time\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\nSending Swarmboats to Watch Manmade Islands\n\nRobotic autonomy is critical to the Pentagon\u2019s ambitions to be in more places at less cost. Carter today highlighted \u201cswarming, autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways, and in multiple domains.\n\nMany military technologists such as Center for a New American Security senior fellow Paul Scharre and New America\u2019s Peter Singer see robotic teaming, or swarming, as a game-changing capability on the battlefield. The military has been researching swarmbots large andsmall, for years.\n\nSwarming robots aren\u2019t just in the air but also on the water. In 2014, on Virginia\u2019s James River, the Office of Naval Researchstaged a key demonstration of the Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing, or CARACaS, system in which 13 self-driving boats conducted highly coordinated maneuvers.\n\nRelated: 12 Weapons that Changed Everything\n\nCarter alluded to the demonstration in his Tuesday speech: \u201cAnd for the water, they\u2019ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance \u2013 including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk,\u201d a clear (if indirect) reference to China\u2019s man-made islands in the Pacific.\n\nSmaller Railguns\n\nThe high cost of advanced ballistics is driving the military toward cheaper alternatives like direct energy and electromagnetic railgun that hurl shells at hypersonic speeds. The Navy is planning an at-sea demonstration of a BAEdesigned railgun that can hurl 44-pound shells.\n\nBut Carter wants to shrink railgun technology until it can fit into \u201cthe five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers. This way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors, we can turn past offense into future defense \u2013 defeating incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby imposing higher costs on the attacker,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: 5 Expensive Weapons Programs No One Wants\n\nHe noted a January demonstration that equipped a Paladin with railgun capabilities.\n\nSmarter Smart Bombs\n\nHelping bombs find their targets without relying on outside communications (or worse, dumb luck) could decrease errant strikes and save lives. Carter highlighted advanced navigation projects that would use \u201cthe same kinds of micro-cameras and sensors that are littered throughout our smartphones today, and putting them on our Small Diameter Bombs to augment their targeting capabilities. This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads \u2013 enabling off-network targeting through commercial components that are small enough to hold in your hand.\u201d\n\nDARPA\u2019s program in micro-technology for positioning, navigation and timing exemplifies this long-standing,growing research effort.\n\nArsenal Planes\n\nAnd where will these smarter smart bombs descend from?\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nCarter said the Pentagon is working to turn \u201cone of our oldest aircraft platforms\u201d \u2014 understood to be the B-52 bomber \u2014 into \u201ca flying launch pad for all sorts of different conventional payloads. In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, networked to 5th-generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes \u2013 essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create wholly new capabilities.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what that might look like in a real-world mission. Next-generation stealth fighter jets like the F-22 and the F-35 would take the lead in a strike, slipping through and disabling enemy radar and electromagnetic weapons. The arsenal planes would follow to finish the job.\n\nFifth-generation fighter and older craft have difficulty communicating, which some have highlighted as a critical oversight in planning. Carter today acknowledged that fixing the problem is going to be key to keeping older aircraft relevant.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.
