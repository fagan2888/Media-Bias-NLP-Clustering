A local Kentucky TV news station caught Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul Wednesday morning discussing some congressional Republican messaging strategy regarding the showdown with Democrats over the government shutdown.

“I just did CNN and I just go over and over again ‘We’re willing to compromise. We’re willing to negotiate,” Paul is seen on-camera telling McConnell, who is standing by for his own interview remote from D.C. “I don’t think they (Democrats) poll tested ‘we won’t negotiate.’ I think it’s awful for them to say that over and over again.”

“Yeah, I do too and I — and I just came back from that two hour meeting with them and that, and that was basically the same view privately as it was publicly,” McConnell said back.

Paul continued, saying he believed Republicans are in a good position. “I think if we keep saying, ‘We wanted to defund it (Obamacare), we fought for that’ and that we’re willing to compromise on this, I think… We’re gonna win this, I think.”

The government shutdown negotiations don’t appear to be moving ahead as President Obama refuses to waiver on changes to Obamacare funding.
