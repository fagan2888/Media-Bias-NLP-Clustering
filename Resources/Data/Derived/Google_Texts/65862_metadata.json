(Photo: Freddie Herpin, Daily World)Buy Photo\n\nSeniors hopped to it Wednesday for an Easter egg hunt at Holy Trinity Villa, an assisted-living community in Opelousas.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to do something for our residents. We have 500 eggs \u2014 some plastic, some boiled and five golden eggs with prizes. We had eggs everywhere,\u201d said Angela Beverly, Holy Trinity\u2019s manager who said she plans to make this an annual event.\n\n\u201cEaster is not just for kids,\u201d Beverly said.\n\nZella Joseph was the champion of the egg hunt with 78 in her basket. But almost everyone found a few.\n\nMary Fontenot, 93, collected about a half dozen eggs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep the plastic ones and I\u2019ll make an egg salad with the rest,\u201d said Fontenot, who grew up in a sharecropper family in the Arnaudville-Grand Coteau area with 10 brothers and sisters.\n\nHer clearest memories of Easter as a child was going to Mass at her local Catholic church.\n\n\u201cThat was very special for us. There were three Masses then. There was a High Mass as 9 a.m. for adults, and we had a special children\u2019s Mass for us,\u201d Joseph said.\n\nEaster Sunday services also created good memories for Lillian Stewart, the former Lillian Jackson, who grew up with 17 brothers and sisters in a farming family around Plaisance. \u201cI was a pure country girl,\u201d said Stewart, 78.\n\nShe said Easter for her family always started with a horse and buggy ride to Mohorn Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nAfter that, she said. everyone in the neighborhood along with aunts, uncles and other relatives would come over to eat.\n\n\u201cWe had tables outside. It was a big meal for the community,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nShe said the family raised everything it ate. The Easter meal included various pork products, chickens, turkeys, ducks and more as well as bounty from the garden.\n\nAfter the meal was over, the adults would spend the rest of the day socializing while the children played games.\n\n\u201cWe played hopscotch \u2014 all kinds of games. I even played pegs with knives with the boys. I was a tomboy,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nBut one of her favorites was \u201cpacques-pacques,\u201d also known as egg knocking.\n\n\u201cI used to win that all the time. I had a guinea egg. That was my egg. It was the hardest of all eggs,\u201d Stewart said with a big laugh.\n\nPacques-Pacques, which is Cajun French for \u201cEaster, Easter,\u201d is also a play on words because it sounds like the hard shell of one egg tapping on another.\n\nThe game, once a popular country tradition throughout Acadiana, is a simple one. Contestants pair off and knock their eggs together. The loser is the first whose egg cracks.\n\nWhoever wins the match not only gets to stay in the game but also gets to keep the loser\u2019s egg.\n\nThe eggs were all boiled and dyed in advance.\n\nCountry folks, Stewart said, didn\u2019t have commercially available dyes in those days so they made do with other sources of color.\n\n\u201cI had a red sweater. I would boil my eggs with the sweater and they would come out a beautiful red,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe had red eggs, blue eggs, yellow eggs \u2014 all colors.\u201d\n\nBoiling the eggs with onion skins created a yellow dye.\n\nBlueberries and strawberries could also be used \u2014 even boiling the eggs with an old teabag would produce unique colors.\n\nAlthough Easter was a fun time for the entire family, Stewart and Fontenot recalled that people couldn\u2019t party too much.\n\n\u201cWe had to be ready to be back in the fields early the next morning,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/03/25/easter-egg-hunt-generates-memories-seniors/70448860/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Seniors remember coloring eggs with natural dyes and playing pacques-pacques", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "Seniors remember coloring eggs with natural dyes and playing pacques-pacques", "title": "Easter egg hunt generates memories for seniors", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/03/25/easter-egg-hunt-generates-memories-seniors/70448860/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seniors remember coloring eggs with natural dyes and playing pacques-pacques", "title": "Easter egg hunt generates memories for seniors", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4489eee9721585eb5dcafbb3637b01c014907f71/c=435-0-1965-1530&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Opelousas/2015/03/25/B9316736016Z.1_20150325165426_000_GIAAASIQ9.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe had red eggs, blue eggs, yellow eggs \u2014 all colors.\u201dBoiling the eggs with onion skins created a yellow dye.\n(Photo: Freddie Herpin, Daily World)Buy PhotoSeniors hopped to it Wednesday for an Easter egg hunt at Holy Trinity Villa, an assisted-living community in Opelousas.\nPacques-Pacques, which is Cajun French for \u201cEaster, Easter,\u201d is also a play on words because it sounds like the hard shell of one egg tapping on another.\nBuy Photo Holy Trinity Villa director Angela Beverly, left, presents Zella Joseph with a giant Easter bunny after Joseph collected 78 eggs during Wednesday\u2019s Easter Egg Hunt at the assisted living facitlity.\nThe Easter meal included various pork products, chickens, turkeys, ducks and more as well as bounty from the garden."}
