A new study finds it also sticks with them according to their gender, as many boys who witness their parents fighting tend to project their aggression outward, while girls keep their feelings inside and withdraw.\n\nMounting evidence in psychology research shows individual snapshots of kids\u2019 behavior don\u2019t capture the state of their mental health. A lot can happen between preschool and kindergarten \u2014 a turning point that can have dramatic impacts on a child\u2019s academic performance and social skills. When parents fight, these turning points can turn to concrete parts of their personality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this carryover effect,\u201d Megan Holmes, assistant professor at Case Western University, told Medical Daily. Holmes is the lead author of the new study and an expert on domestic violence, particularly as it disrupts healthy childhood development. \u201cKids aren\u2019t just affected when it\u2019s immediately happening, but there is this chain effect that\u2019s happening in the later years.\u201d\n\nIn the latest investigation, Holmes and her colleagues looked at data on 1,125 children referred to Child Protective Services for abuse or neglect, whose cases were housed in a federal database. They tracked how often kids were exposed to male-led partner violence, including fathers and non-biological figures, and how kids\u2019 behaviors shifted from preschool to kindergarten. While most children fell in the normal ranges for social development and aggression, in preschool 14 percent of kids showed aggressive tendencies and 46 percent lagged in social skill development. By kindergarten, aggressive tendencies had risen to 18 percent and social skill lags dropped to 34 percent.\n\nFalling on traditional gender lines, boys and girls displayed varied responses to parental violence. Boys tended to mirror their fathers\u2019 aggressive behaviors, becoming more verbally abusive and quick to turn on their peers. Girls, meanwhile, channeled their inner difficulties into their social skills. They had trouble interacting with other kids and became more anxious or depressed, Holmes says. \u201cThat may be why we\u2019re not necessarily seeing the effect of aggressive behavior for girls.\u201d\n\nLooking at the big picture of childhood development isn\u2019t all that new for Holmes. In 2013, she published a study describing a so-called \u201csleeper effect.\u201d Again, investigating intimate partner violence, she found that kids who were exposed to the violence at an early age showed no behavioral effects directly after, but they seemed to lay dormant until the child reached school age. Then the sleeper effects re-emerged and played out as expected.\n\nIn both this study and the more recent one, she says, magnification with time is an all-too-prevalent factor. And while the data samples exclude violent mothers, much of the research into domestic violence already tilts the proportion heavily toward victims being female. Each year, roughly 1.3 million women experience physical assault by an intimate partner, making up approximately 85 percent of the total victim pool. Worse, when kids witness the behavior, they are more likely to adopt it themselves once they grow up.\n\nGiven these sleeper effects, Holmes says the best course of action is to curtail aggressive or antisocial behavior early. Moving from preschool to kindergarten isn\u2019t just a matter of a birthday. It\u2019s a big step from a classroom based on cultivating social skills to one focused on academics. It\u2019s up to observant teachers and school officials, she says, to make sure the only baggage kids are carrying during that time are the school supplies on their backs.\n\nSource: Holmes M, Voith L, Gromoske A.
