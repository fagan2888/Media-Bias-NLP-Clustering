World Breastfeeding Week (Aug. 1-7), however, aims to raise awareness about the power of breast milk in reducing death from these factors and others, and it\u2019s all in hopes of achieving the United Nation\u2019s fourth Millennium Development Goal (MDG): Reducing the 1990 mortality rate among under-5 children by two-thirds by 2015.\n\n\u201cBy protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding, we can all contribute to each of the MDG\u2019s in a substantial way,\u201d said Dr. Felicity Savage, chairwoman of the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA), in a press release. \u201cExclusive breastfeeding and adequate appropriate complementary feeding are key interventions for improving child survival, potentially reducing deaths among children under 5 by about 20 percent. Early and exclusive breastfeeding improves newborn care and reduces neonatal mortality, which contributes to the majority of infant deaths.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of health issues relating to newborns and their mothers comes from low- and middle-income countries in Africa and South Asia, where continuity of health care rarely occurs after the mother has given birth. Once she has, however, and assuming that her child doesn\u2019t have to be treated for infections or any other urgent matter, it\u2019s important for at-home care to focus on the baby\u2019s needs. Breastfeeding is one of these.\n\n\u201cBreastfeeding has been shown repeatedly to be the single most effective way to prevent infant death; it plays a major role in children\u2019s health and development, and significantly benefits the health of mothers,\u201d Savage said. Indeed, breastfeeding offers many health benefits to kids. In a brochure, WABA notes that \u201cimmediate skin-to-skin contact and early initiation of breastfeeding \u2014 putting the baby to the mother\u2019s breast within an hour after birth \u2014 could reduce neonatal mortality significantly\u201d Yet, less than 50 percent of newborns are breastfed within this first hour.\n\nIn fact, many moms have historically been terrible at breastfeeding their kids, despite it being the best way for an infant or toddler to get proper nutrition. In the U.S., only 49 percent of moms breastfed up to 6 months in 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s 2014 Breastfeeding Report Card. At 12 months, that number dropped to 27 percent, despite recommendations supporting the benefits of breastfeeding for that long \u2014 the WHO suggests that mothers breastfeed for up to two years. In doing so, studies have shown children will experience improvements in motor and language development, which not only makes them smarter but more able to tackle the world socially as well.\n\nIn the U.S., breastfeeding rates have seen a continued rise over the past few years, with 79 percent of newborns receiving breast milk. Even though many of them didn\u2019t get the recommended amount, the simple fact that they got it is one step ahead of other moms around the world. By raising awareness of its benefits, millions of future newborns will be saved.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world, breastfeeding, week, 2014, reducing, infant, mortality, nutrition, packed, breast, milk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "There aren't nearly enough moms around the world breastfeeding their children, despite the fact that it could reduce infant death by 13 percent.", "title": "World Breastfeeding Week 2014: Raising Awareness Of Infant Death Around The World", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-breastfeeding-week-2014-reducing-infant-mortality-nutrition-packed-breast-milk-296232", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/breastfeeding.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There aren't nearly enough moms around the world breastfeeding their children, despite the fact that it could reduce infant death by 13 percent.", "title": "World Breastfeeding Week 2014: Raising Awareness Of Infant Death Around The World", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/world-breastfeeding-week-2014-reducing-infant-mortality-nutrition-packed-breast-milk-296232", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/breastfeeding.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/breastfeeding.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-02T16:54:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-02T16:50:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "There aren't nearly enough moms around the world breastfeeding their children, despite the fact that it could reduce infant death by 13 percent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e40\"", "article_summary": "Indeed, breastfeeding offers many health benefits to kids.\nIn the U.S., breastfeeding rates have seen a continued rise over the past few years, with 79 percent of newborns receiving breast milk.\nWorld Breastfeeding Week (Aug. 1-7), however, aims to raise awareness about the power of breast milk in reducing death from these factors and others, and it\u2019s all in hopes of achieving the United Nation\u2019s fourth Millennium Development Goal (MDG): Reducing the 1990 mortality rate among under-5 children by two-thirds by 2015.\n\u201cExclusive breastfeeding and adequate appropriate complementary feeding are key interventions for improving child survival, potentially reducing deaths among children under 5 by about 20 percent.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that as many as 3.3 million children around the world die during their first four weeks of life, with the most common causes of these deaths being infections, premature birth, and asphyxia."}
