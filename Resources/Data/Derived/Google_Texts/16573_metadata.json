Ken Crawley\u2019s second- quarter interception led to the Buffaloes\u2019 first touchdown. He added two pass breakups.\n\nGunslinger\n\nCU quarterback Sefo Liufau made big momentum throws when the Buffaloes needed them the most. Trailing 14-3, Liufau hit wide receiver Shay Fields in stride for a 65-yard touchdown strike. In the third quarter, Liufau threw a 24-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Ross for a 17-14 lead.\n\nYoung phenom\n\nCSU running back Dalyn Dawkins, right, totaled 177 yards and a touchdown carrying the Rams\u2019 offense in the second half.\n\nWorsts\n\nBoth teams failed to master the kicking game\n\nCSU kicker Wyatt Bryan went 1-for-4, missing field goals from 47 and 52 yards and getting his kick blocked in OT. CU kicker Diego Gonzalez had a 36-yard field goal blocked and missed the potential game-winner \u2014 a 48-yarder \u2014 in the final seconds of regulation.\n\nIt\u2019s how you finish\n\nCSU quarterback Nick Stevens started the game 8-of-9 passing with a TD, but struggled the rest of the way, finishing 25-of-39 and two later interceptions.\n\nPounding the ground\n\nCU\u2019s run game was a near nonfactor. They were one-dimensional and got outrushed by CSU by nearly 100 yards.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "CU vs. CSU,Diego Gonzalez,Nick Stevens,Rocky Mountain Showdown,Sefo Liufau", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "CU linebacker Kenneth Olugbode intercepted a tipped pass and took it to 60 yards to the house and a 24-17 lead", "title": "Bests and Worsts from Rocky Mountain Showdown 2015", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/09/19/bests-and-worsts-from-rocky-mountain-showdown-2015/33937/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/09/Kenneth-Olugbode-495x279.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "CU linebacker Kenneth Olugbode intercepted a tipped pass and took it to 60 yards to the house and a 24-17 lead", "title": "Bests and Worsts from Rocky Mountain Showdown 2015", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/09/19/bests-and-worsts-from-rocky-mountain-showdown-2015/33937/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/09/Kenneth-Olugbode-495x279.jpg", "creator": "@cameronwolfe", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "CU linebacker Kenneth Olugbode intercepted a tipped pass and took it to 60 yards to the house and a 24-17 lead"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c43\"", "article_summary": "In the third quarter, Liufau threw a 24-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Ross for a 17-14 lead.\nKen Crawley\u2019s second- quarter interception led to the Buffaloes\u2019 first touchdown.\nTrailing 14-3, Liufau hit wide receiver Shay Fields in stride for a 65-yard touchdown strike.\nYoung phenomCSU running back Dalyn Dawkins, right, totaled 177 yards and a touchdown carrying the Rams\u2019 offense in the second half.\nGunslingerCU quarterback Sefo Liufau made big momentum throws when the Buffaloes needed them the most."}
