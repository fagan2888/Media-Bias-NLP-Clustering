The information presented is essential to the approximately 25% of Long Beach residents currently living in poverty and the 33% of Long Beach youth in poverty who now have more healthcare options under the ACA.\n\nThe ACA expands the number of individuals and families who qualify for Medi-Cal and, through Covered California, many more individuals are eligible for tax subsidies to help purchase health insurance.\n\n\u201cI'm all in on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Lowenthal told the Post. \u201cWe have to make this work because it is massively better than before, and it is the law of the land.\u201d\n\nFor local healthcare professionals like Diana Hendel--CEO of Miller Children's, Long Beach Memorial, and Community Hospital Long Beach\u2014the changes created by the Affordable Care Act are just another way for her businesses to serve people better.\n\nWhen asked about the new health insurance access that poorer Long Beach residents will have under the ACA, Hendel said she is looking forward to serving Long Beach\u2019s newly insured residents.\n\n\u201cWe've taken a mission-based \u2018serve everyone\u2019 approach to healthcare since even before the ACA passed,\u201d she said, \u201cbut more people having health insurance will augment our efforts.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ACA, any person or family earning an annual income of less than 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) in the state is now eligible for free Medicaid coverage, including expanded preventive services added by the ACA. And for those earning up to 399% FPL will be eligible for varying amounts of financial assistance based on income.\n\nHendel said that from the business perspective, this law will level the playing field and increase the competition between the same private insurers who did business in each state before. This in combination with the expansion of Medicaid services will allow much greater health insurance access to low-income residents of California.\n\n\u201cFor the last ten years we've been trying to move forward on the curve towards preventive medicine in order to keep people from even needing to come [to the hospital]. The ACA will augment our efforts to do that,\u201d Hendel said.\n\nOne small but practical way that the ACA is changing the way Hendel's hospitals do business is the coordination of medical homes for people that previously could not pay for regular medical attention and hence did not have a regular physician or pediatrician.\n\nBooths at an ACA enrollment fair held earlier this month, sponsored by Rep.

Molina Healthcare is based in Long Beach and has always served the low-income communities. But with the passage of the ACA and the expansion of insurance access to low-income people, Molina officials say the company will be stepping up their infrastructure and marketing their services to folks with incomes up to 250% FPL.\n\nMolina officials say they expect revenues to double within the next few years as more patients begin to receive healthcare. The company still owns a pair of business office towers in the Long Beach downtown area, and recently rennovated both the Press-Telegram and Meeker-Baker buildings on Pine Ave., where some of the 4000+ new employees the company will need to hire in the coming years can work.\n\nHealth services at the Pacific Hospital in the Wrigley neighborhood will also be expanded through a coordinated effort between Molina and the College Hospital company.\n\n\u201cCollege Hospital will use half of the beds for psychiatric purposes, and we will use the other half to expand our delivery of healthcare services in the area,\u201d said Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare. \u201cPeople who are not eligible for Medicaid and otherwise do not have affordable access to health insurance will now have access to our network. This is a great opportunity for people who until now have been unable to get coverage.\u201d\n\nOverall, the poor and working class of Long Beach stand to gain a great deal from the Affordable Care Act, and the service providers in this city are prepared to embrace the law as a positive change.\n\n\u201cLong Beach becomes a healthier city with each new person who signs up at Cover Long Beach,\u201d Mayor Bob Foster said in a statement. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for people to ask their questions about the new health mandates and make a more informed decision on their own health insurance.\"\n\nCover Long Beach will take place Saturday, November 16 from 10AM-3PM at six locations throughout the City of Long Beach.
