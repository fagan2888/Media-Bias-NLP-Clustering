While many pharmacies require no appointment and only ask that you complete a consent form (which includes questions about your medical history and authorizes the release of your health care provider and insurers), rules and vaccine availability vary by state—so call ahead before you drop in.

As at your doctor’s office, most pharmacies will file with your insurance, and under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to cover most immunizations for adults and children, so you probably won’t be charged. When in doubt, you or your pharmacist should check first with your insurer. Note, too, that your insurance plan may have age limitations, for example, most plans will not cover the shingles vaccines for adults under age 60. If you’re paying out-of-pocket, know that prices vary depending on the pharmacy, just as they do at your doctor’s office. For example, you’ll pay $85 for the pneumonia vaccine at CVS and Target, but just $73 at Costco pharmacies. And the dual Hepatitis A and B vaccine costs $169 at Target, and $114 at Walmart. Ask your pharmacist to forward information about your vaccinations to your doctor's office so that it can be added to your medical record.
