This year, liberals who dine with like-minded people might find that things are just as tense as if they had someone ranting about how the Syrian refugees are all terrorists over pumpkin pie. This year is marked by a fraught primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. It\u2019s likely going to be even harder to avoid conflict between Team Clinton and Team Sanders than it is to avoid fighting with your right-wing relatives. After all, liberals and conservatives have practice agreeing to talk about football instead, but with your liberal peeps, talking about politics is a habit that will be hard to break.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some dos and don\u2019ts to keep your Thanksgiving dinner sane and you friendships lasting after the primary.\n\nFor Sanders supporters\n\nDo acknowledge that while Clinton is more centrist than Sanders, she is still quite clearly a liberal and falls to the left of both her husband and Barack Obama.\n\nDon\u2019t accuse Clinton supporters of only supporting her because she has a vagina. That just suggests that\u2019s the only reason you\u2019re voting against her.\n\nDo accept that Clinton\u2019s plan for reining in the big banks is thoughtful and more detailed than Sanders\u2019s plan, even if you think it does not go far enough.\n\nDon\u2019t pretend that Clinton would have invaded Iraq just as surely as George W. Bush did, just because she voted for the war authorization. No one buys that, not for a minute.\n\nDo acknowledge that whoever wins will be facing a Republican-dominated legislature that will make sweeping change nearly impossible for any Democrat sitting in the White House.\n\nDon\u2019t assume that people are unaware of what the term \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d means and that they need lengthy lectures to rectify this assumed ignorance.\n\nDo acknowledge that Wall Street donors are actually throwing their weight behind Republicans far more than Clinton this election season, even though they supported Obama over John McCain in 2008.\n\nDon\u2019t swear that if Clinton wins the nomination over Sanders, you refuse to vote for her in the general election. That just confirms that you\u2019re less interested in economic justice than fluffing your own ego or that you panic at the thought of women in power.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forget right-wing relatives.
