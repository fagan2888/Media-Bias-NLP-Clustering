U.S. osteopathic medical schools have increased their class sizes to keep up with demand, and in the fall of 2013, three new osteopathic medical schools opened their doors to students.\n\nThe AAFP has been tracking the unprecedented growth of osteopathic medicine. In the AAFP's analysis of the 2013 NRMP Match(www.stfm.org) in the October issue of Family Medicine, authors pointed out that the number of D.O.-granting medical schools grew from 19 schools in 2002 to 37 schools -- including branch campuses and satellite programs -- in 2013.\n\nIn the same report, authors noted that osteopathic medical school first-year enrollment nearly doubled between 2002 (2,968) and 2012 (5,627), and predicted enrollment could reach 6,699 by 2017.\n\nResults of the much larger 2014 NRMP Match(www.nrmp.org) will be available from AAFP News on March 21. Adams suggested that many positions left unfilled after the osteopathic match would be filled in the NRMP Match.\n\nRelated AAFP News Coverage\n\nRadical Changes in Primary Care Needed to Meet the Coming Demand for Health Care\n\n(1/30/2013)\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "More osteopathic physicians matched to family medicine than any other medical specialty in the recently completed American Osteopathic Association Intern/Resident Registration Program, which matches graduating osteopathic physicians with residency programs nationwide.
