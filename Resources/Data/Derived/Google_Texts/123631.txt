MELIPILLA, Chile (AP) â€” Hundreds of people gathered in a Chilean town Saturday at the funeral for a teenager who got international attention by going on YouTube to make an unsuccessful plea for permission to end her life.

Fourteen-year-old Valentina Maureira died Thursday from lung problems caused by cystic fibrosis.

Earlier this year, Valentina posted a YouTube video in which she asked Chilean President Michelle Bachelet to allow her to be euthanized and end her suffering. Her brother had died of cystic fibrosis when he was 6 years old.

Bachelet visited the girl at the hospital, but the government said it could not approve her request to be euthanized. Valentina later changed her mind after meeting people who responded to her video.

The funeral was held in Melipilla, 90 kilometers (55 miles) from Santiago.
