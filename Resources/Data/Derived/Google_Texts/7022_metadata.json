Most reforms, most problems are complicated. But to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary equality.\u201d\n\nSo said prominent women\u2019s suffrage advocate Alice Paul. The first step toward \u201cordinary equality\u201d for women was the adoption of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.\n\nAlmost 50 years later, in 1971, Congress designated Aug. 26 as Women\u2019s Equality Day to commemorate its passage.\n\nWe have made progress in advancing women\u2019s equality in Minnesota the past few years. For example, the Legislature in 2014 passed the Women\u2019s Economic Security Act, which included raising the minimum wage (two-thirds of minimum-wage workers are women), requiring businesses that contract with the state to certify that they abide by equal pay for equal work, and extending unpaid family leave to 12 weeks.\n\nAnother example is last year\u2019s Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) resolution to Congress, calling for renewed efforts to extend constitutional protections to women. This resolution passed the Minnesota Senate with a bipartisan vote.\n\nWe\u2019ve undoubtedly made progress in this state, but there is still much work to be done to ensure equality for all women.\n\n\u2022 Are women fully equal when full-time female workers in Minnesota still earn only about 80 percent of what their male counterparts earn? The gender pay gap is even greater for African-American women, who only earn about 64 cents, and Latinas, who earn 54 cents for every dollar earned by white men.\n\n\u2022 Are we all truly equal when women, particularly women of color, are most negatively impacted by almost every existing economic policy? Women today still deal with low wages, outdated workplace policies that deny women paid leave, scheduling rules, lack of affordable child care, unfair promotions, cuts to public services, pregnancy discrimination and more limited access to health care, including reproductive health care?\n\nDuring the 2015 legislative session, we were not able to continue our momentum to advance women\u2019s equality. As a champion of fairness and opportunity for everyone, especially women, I plan to press forward in the 2016 session with efforts not just for unpaid leave, but for paid family leave, and for earned sick days so a sick employee doesn\u2019t have to choose between her health and her paycheck. And I plan to urge my House colleagues to show their support for women\u2019s equality by passing the ERA resolution to Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s time for us all to stand with women and demand action in St. Paul to advance positive change for all women and their families.\n\nAnd we must hold accountable those who will stand in the way of women making progress in our state, leaving families worse off than they are now. Let\u2019s make extraordinary equality ordinary.\n\nSandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, is a member of the Minnesota Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Building upon recent progress in Minnesota, the to-do list for the 2016 Legislature will include paid family leave, earned sick days and more.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Building upon recent progress in Minnesota, the to-do list for the 2016 Legislature will include paid family leave, earned sick days and more.", "title": "For Women's Equality Day, still more work is needed", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/for-women-s-equality-day-still-more-work-is-needed/322556701/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Building upon recent progress in Minnesota, the to-do list for the 2016 Legislature will include paid family leave, earned sick days and more.", "title": "For Women's Equality Day, still more work is needed", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/for-women-s-equality-day-still-more-work-is-needed/322556701/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "minimum wage"}, "news_keywords": "Women's Equality Day,Equal Rights Amendment,Minnesota Legislature,gender gap,sick leave,family leave,minimum wage"}, "article_summary": "Almost 50 years later, in 1971, Congress designated Aug. 26 as Women\u2019s Equality Day to commemorate its passage.\nDuring the 2015 legislative session, we were not able to continue our momentum to advance women\u2019s equality.\nAnd I plan to urge my House colleagues to show their support for women\u2019s equality by passing the ERA resolution to Congress.\nWe have made progress in advancing women\u2019s equality in Minnesota the past few years.\nWe\u2019ve undoubtedly made progress in this state, but there is still much work to be done to ensure equality for all women."}
