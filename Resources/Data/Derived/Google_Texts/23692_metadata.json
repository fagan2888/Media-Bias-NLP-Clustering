Here\u2019s the latest.\n\nPhoto\n\n1. The F.B.I. mustered hundreds of agents after a gunman attacked two military sites in Chattanooga, Tenn., killing four Marines and leaving others injured before being killed. A federal official said the case was being treated \u201cas an act of domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\n2. A Colorado jury rejected the insanity plea of James E. Holmes, finding him guilty of killing 12 and wounding 70 at a Denver movie theater three years ago.\n\nPhoto\n\n3. The trial date for Dylann Roof, the suspect in the killings of nine blacks in a South Carolina church last month, was set for a year from now. Our latest profile portrays a youth many saw as aimless, troubled and strange, but with no record of violence to prefigure the massacre.\n\nPhoto\n\n4. E.U. officials agreed to shore up Greece with more loans and credit while working toward a bailout package. But there was little sense of security, particularly after Germany\u2019s finance minister raised, for the second time this week, the idea of Greece leaving the euro.\n\nPhoto\n\n5. With an eye on China\u2019s rise, Japan took a big step toward allowing itself limited foreign combat powers for the first time since World War II. Its lower house approved security bills backed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the U.S., but detested by most voters.\n\nPhoto\n\n6. Golf\u2019s wunderkind Jordan Spieth, left, ended the first day of the British Open two strokes behind Dustin Johnson, right. (Johnson, by the way, is so impetuous that when the portable toilet was occupied, he urinated on the fairway grass.) Two former stars, Tiger Woods and Tom Watson, were among those tied for 141st place.\n\nPhoto\n\n7. Senate passage of a bill that rewrites the No Child Left Behind law set up a showdown with the House. Both of their bills give local governments more power, but the House\u2019s, passed last week, limits the federal government\u2019s role in education.\n\nPhoto\n\n8. President Obama visited a prison near Oklahoma City as part of his campaign for reform of the criminal justice system. He reflected on how he had used marijuana and cocaine as a young man, saying, \u201cThere but for the grace of God\u201d as he toured a cellblock emptied for his security.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n9. The prognosis was good for former president George Bush, who was hospitalized Wednesday after cracking a bone in his neck in a fall at his seaside summer home in Maine. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great, his spirits are good, and he\u2019s up and talking, and out of bed,\u201d his doctor said.\n\nPhoto\n\n10. HBO dominated the Emmy nominations with 126, almost a fifth of them for \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Surprise snubs: no drama series nomination for \u201cEmpire,\u201d or nods to Gina Rodriguez (\u201cJane the Virgin\u201d) or Ellie Kemper (\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d). The awards are set for Sept. 20.\n\nPhoto\n\n11. It\u2019s a big week for the star of \u201cInside Amy Schumer.\u201d Her Emmy nomination for outstanding actress in a comedy series was one of seven for her show, plus her much-anticipated first film, \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d opens Friday.\n\nVideo\n\n12. There isn\u2019t even a name for what these stunt skydivers pulled off recently. Dropping from 7,000 feet, one leapt between his two wingsuit-clad teammates, and then went into freefall before deploying his parachute. According to the man who filmed it, the motive was to have a killer video for last month\u2019s edition of an annual extreme sport festival in Voss, Norway.\n\nThe Evening Briefing by Email Get a nightly rundown of the day's top stories delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.\n\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\n\nWant to look back?
