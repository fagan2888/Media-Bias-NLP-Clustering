The exchange informed people that two plans do not cover abortions when, in fact, they do. As the state\u2019s pro-life group informs LifeNews, there is only one plan that is abortion-free.\n\nThe Seattle Times has more on the dustup:\n\nDo they or don\u2019t they cover abortion? That question caused a scramble Thursday after two insurers were erroneously reported to lack coverage for abortion in plans offered through Washington\u2019s exchange marketplace, Washington Healthplanfinder. The state\u2019s Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC), responding to an inquiry from the state Legislature\u2019s Republican caucus, said it had determined that Molina Healthcare of Washington and Coordinated Care did not cover voluntary pregnancy termination. Human Life of Washington sent out an email to that effect; CEO Dan Kennedy said the organization had received inquiries from people who didn\u2019t want to buy a plan that covered abortion. In answer to inquiries from The Seattle Times, Molina and Coordinated Care said that in fact, their plans doinclude coverage. Coordinated Care\u2019s CEO, Dr. Jay Fathi, said in a statement: \u201cWomen who enroll in Ambetter (the exchange plans) from Coordinated Care on the Exchange will have access to and coverage for abortion services. We apologize for any current confusion on this matter. We are presently working with the OIC to clarify this issue.\u201d CLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE! Molina spokeswoman Laura Hart said, \u201cMolina\u2019s Marketplace plans do cover pregnancy terminations,\u201d and pointed to language in its \u201cEvidence of Coverage\u201d that spells out coverage.\n\nThe article goes on to say that just one plan does not include abortion coverage in Washington state. According to the article \u201cPremera\u2019s multistate plans, which are prohibited from covering abortion by federal law, do not include it among its benefits.\u201d\n\nKennedy responded to the flap in an email to LifeNews, saying, \u201cOf course, Planned Parenthood points to the confusion to insist that essentially every plan must cover abortion with, ironically, no choice for the consumer. They will again this year, in the state legislature, push the absurd abortion insurance mandate that goes by the euphemism \u201cReproductive Parity Act.\u201d\n\nKennedy provided LifeNews the following info:\n\nONLY ONE PLAN THAT DOES NOT cover voluntary abortions\n\nBlue Cross Multi-state options (administered by Premera in WA) \u2013 http://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/plan-codes/2014/states/wa.asp\n\nVoluntary abortion is not covered.
