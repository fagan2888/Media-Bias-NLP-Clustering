Sen. Warren: Republicans Making "Naked Attempts To Nullify" 2012 Election

SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): There are three vacancies in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The President of the United States has nominated judges to fill those vacancies. Thatâ€™s his job. And it is the job of the Senate to confirm highly qualified, independent judges. Thatâ€™s how our system worksâ€”thatâ€™s what the Constitution demands.



Republicans these days donâ€™t seem to like that. They keep looking for ways to keep this

President from doing his job. So far, they have shut down the government, they have filibustered

people heâ€™s nominated to fill out his Administration, and now they are filibustering judges to

block him from filling any of the vacancies with highly qualified people.



We need to call out these filibusters for what they are: naked attempts to nullify the results of the

last Presidential electionâ€”to force us to govern as though President Obama hadnâ€™t won the 2012

election.



Well, President Obama did win the 2012 election â€“ by five million votes. And he has done what

the Constitution requires him to do: nominated highly qualified people to fill open vacancies on

the federal bench.



If Republicans continue to filibuster these highly qualified nominees for no reason other than to

nullify the Presidentâ€™s Constitutional authority, then senators not only have a right to change the

filibuster rules â€“ senators have a duty to change the filibuster rules. We cannot turn our backs on

the Constitution. We cannot abdicate our oath of office. We have a responsibility to protect and

defend our democracy, and that includes protecting the neutrality of our courts - and preserving

the Constitutional power of the President to nominate highly qualified people to court vacancies.
