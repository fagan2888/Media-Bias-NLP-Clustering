Chris Murphy broke with a Senate tradition that freshmen should be seen and not heard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a waiting period anymore for freshmen,\u201d he said. \u201cMy constituents did not elect me to be a shrinking violet.\u201d\n\nRon Schurin, political science professor at the University of Connecticut, said Murphy \u201chas had a little bit higher visibility than your average freshman senator.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s not been someone who has stood in the shadows of (Connecticut\u2019s) senior senator (Richard Blumenthal,) Schurin said.\n\nHaving represented Newtown in the House of Representatives before he was elected to the Senate in 2012, Murphy started the 113th Congress with a path set for him.\n\nHe became a forceful critic of colleagues who would not support gun control, saying they were complicit in the slaying of 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He also became Public Enemy No. 1 for the gun lobby by attacking the National Rifle Association with a series of reports. One showed the organization did not have much impact on the 2012 elections, despite spending millions of dollars. Another showed a disconnect between the opinions of gun owners and the NRA.\n\nMurphy, 41, favored much tougher gun control measures, including a total ban on assault weapons. But he said his biggest disappointment in the 113th Congress -- and his political career -- was Congress\u2019s failure to approve a much more modest bill that would expand FBI background checks of gun owners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been as personally and emotionally invested in any issue,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also brought his hard-charging ways to the bitter, ongoing congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act. While other Democrats were trying to avoid the political storm that resulted from the botched rollout of the law, Murphy volunteered to be the health care law\u2019s chief protector in the Senate.\n\nAlthough Democrats once hesitated \u201cto defend the law at full volume,\u201d Murphy said he\u2019s gratified that as more Americans seek health coverage under the law, Democrats no longer balk at embracing it.\n\nAccording to the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates for open government, Murphy introduced 25 bills in the 113th Congress. Two became law.\n\nOne, which Murphy had once sponsored in the House, was introduced in that chamber by Rep. Elizabeth Esty, D-5th District, in this session. It had never passed the Senate until this year. It requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reinstate expired licenses for hydropower dams at two old mills on the Farmington River so they can once again produce electricity.\n\nThe other, called the Honor Flight Act, establishes a process to provide expedited airport screening for veterans traveling to visit war memorials.\n\nGary Rose, head of the political science department at Sacred Heart University, said Murphy could not point to any huge legislative victories, \u201cbut to be fair, that\u2019s difficult for a freshman senator.\u201d In addition, the 113th Congress was an unproductive one in terms of the amount of legislation passed.\n\nAna Radelat / Ctmirror.org\n\nProspects of getting legislation approved are likely to dim for Murphy \u2013 and all other Democratic senators \u2014 when the GOP takes over the Senate on Tuesday.\n\nMurphy\u2019s reputation in the Senate, however, is not being built on legislation. Besides his high-profile roles on gun control and Obamacare, Murphy came to national attention in September of 2013 when he told Obama (who called the senator at home) that he could not back the administration\u2019s policy on Syria.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that it was a comfortable position to be in, having a public dispute with the president so early in my freshman term,\u201d said Murphy, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nHe also later clashed with the Obama administration over its plan to arm Syrian rebels to fight Islamic militants known as ISIS.\n\nMurphy said he became wary of U.S. military involvements because of what he\u2019s perceived to be the failures of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United State should be able to lead without exerting military power, he said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about American\u2019s role in the world.\u201d\n\nHe said a high point of the last two years was traveling to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in December of 2013 to speak to protesters who were displeased with their government\u2019s relationship with Moscow.\n\nMurphy called it \u201ca truly history-making moment.\u201d\n\nSchurin said he was impressed when Murphy's staff, shortly after he was elected to the Senate, contacted the University of Connecticut\u2019s political science department and asked students to submit questions the senator could bring up at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing.\n\n\u201cIt was a nice gesture,\u201d Schurin said.\n\nA balancing act\n\nMurphy said his interest in foreign affairs does not interfere with representing Connecticut interests in the Senate. He also said it\u2019s a tradition to have Connecticut senators involved in foreign affairs, noting the international interests of former Sens. Joe Lieberman and Chris Dodd.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s balancing the two,\u201d Rose said of Murphy\u2019s domestic and foreign agendas.\n\nAs a congressman representing the 5th district, Murphy \u201chad pretty high marks\u201d taking care of constituents, Rose said. \u201cSo I would think that would translate as good constituent service in the Senate.\u201d\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nMurphy highlights a Connecticut company every week as \u201cMurphy\u2019s Monday Manufacturer, has spent a day with a homeless man in New Haven and hopped on buses in Meriden, Bridgeport, Stamford, Hartford, Torrington, Waterbury, and New Haven \u201cto hear what\u2019s on people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\nAlthough Murphy said it\u2019s easier to work on a bipartisan basis in the Senate than in the House, Govtrack.us shows that of the 144 bills Murphy cosponsored in 2013, only 16 percent were introduced by a Republican.\n\nGovtrack.us also says Murphy has one of the best voting attendance records in the Senate, having missed only four of the 657 votes cast in that chamber.\n\nBesides his seat on the foreign affairs panel, Murphy is a member of the Joint Economic Committee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. He hopes to sit on those panels in the new Congress, which will be gaveled in on Tuesday.\n\nSenate leaders have made note of Murphy\u2019s vigorous defense of the Affordable Care Act and have also given Murphy a seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee in the new Congress.\n\n\u201cI am not going to be shy about using my seat on appropriations\u201d to steer federal funds to Connecticut, Murphy said.\n\nHis willingness to join a political fight also means Murphy is likely to be on the attack in efforts to thwart the GOP\u2019s agenda this year.\n\nMurphy said he\u2019ll also play defense.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are not going to back down from their efforts to gut the ACA,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/01/05/murphy-breaks-senate-tradition-with-high-profile-positions/", "news_keywords": "Politics, Washington, Affordable Care Act, Appropriations Committee, Chris Murphy, Collinsville Dam, Govtrack.us, gun control, Honor Flight Act, ISIS", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/01/05/murphy-breaks-senate-tradition-with-high-profile-positions/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 With his fight for gun control, defense of the Affordable Care Act and clashes with President Obama on foreign policy, Sen.
