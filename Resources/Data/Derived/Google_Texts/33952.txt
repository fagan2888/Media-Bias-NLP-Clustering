In less than two weeks, MedWorks will hold its first medical clinic of the year at Neighborhood Family Practice, 3569 Ridge Road, Cleveland.



The free clinic will run from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 22.



Services will include women's health exams, Pap tests and clinical breast exams, general physical exams and specialty appointments, lab work, pharmacy and HIV testing. If you need a mammogram, you can obtain a referral.



Those attending can also see specialists in other areas, such as cardiology; dermatology; ear, nose and throat; podiatry; rheumatology; and urology.

Need an appointment? Here's how to make one While the MedWorks volunteers will work to accommodate walk-in patients on Feb. 22, it's best to make an appointment in advance. from 6-8 p.m. today and Feb. 19, you can call 2-1-1, United Way's First Call for Help phone bank. From now through Feb. 21, you can also call the MedWorks appointment line at 216-201-9584.



Schedulers from Neighborhood Family Practice will be on hand to set up follow-up medical appointments with their physicians.



Patients who need information about the Affordable Care Act can meet with a social worker.



There is no limit to the number of services you can get during clinic hours, says MedWorks Executive Director Carrie Clark.

"When we do the initial consult, the doctors can address whatever issues need to be addressed," she said.

Just be sure to call ahead for an appointment.

And remember to bring your ID, although not having one won't stop you from getting medical care.

"Weâ€™re simple," Clark said. "You don't need ID. You just have to show up and be seen by the doctor."



Having an ID and health records, however, will make it easier for those who are treating you, and for setting up any necessary follow-up care.
