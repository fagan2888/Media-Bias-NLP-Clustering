CHENNAI: Madras high court has directed the Tamil Nadu government to hold 'as many Teacher Eligibility Tests (TET) as possible' every year, keeping in mind the shortage of TET-eligible teachers for government and aided schools in the state.Justice D Hariparanthaman, passing orders on two writ petitions filed by G Nagarajan of M D Crane Middle School in Tindivanam, and Chitra of Hindu Middle School at Madathur in Tirunelveli district, said, "It is stated that only once the TET was conducted (since April 2013). But the requirement of teachers in government/local bodies/aided schools is plenty. Therefore, the government shall hold as many as TETs as possible, so as to comply with the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, and in the absence of TET qualified teachers, aided schools have no other option except to appoint teachers without TET qualification."After the RTE Act came into operation in 2010, it has become mandatory for government and aided schools to appoint candidates only after they clear the statewide TET every year.The present pettions were filed by Nagarajan and Chitra, who, like several others, were working in aided schools, but without the mandatory TET qualification.On April 29, 2013, Justice Hariparanthaman came to the rescue of this batch of teachers, by holding that they should be allowed to continue in their posts for five years, during which time they would write TET and score a pass. The order, he said, was passed taking note of the fact that no TET hands were available.These teachers are fully qualified to teach in aided schools, but lacked the mandatory TET qualification, he said, adding that they should be granted temporary approval till the completion of the five year period which started in 2013. "It is made clear that he should get qualified in TET within five years, otherwise, they would automatically go out of employment," Justice Hariparanthaman said.
