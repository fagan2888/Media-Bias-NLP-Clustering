Not only is Obamacare a “train wreck,” N.J. Gov. Chris Christie says, but it’s a train wreck that even a newbie politico could have predicted.

“This is a disaster, and it was a train wreck that anybody who’s managed anything, ever, in their lives could’ve seen coming,” Mr. Christie said to New Jersey 101.5 FM.

But he was just getting warmed up.

Politico reported he went on: “This is just an awful law. It made no sense and that’s why I didn’t get into a state exchange. And no, I have absolutely no regrets. In fact, I’m really glad that the train wreck’s not mine. It’s [President Obama’s,]” and Mr. Obama is now “scrambling.”

Why?

He’s up the creek without a paddle on promises that Americans could keep their insurance plans if they wanted.

“This entire Obamacare program is a failure,” Mr. Christie said in the Politico report. “It’s a failure and people are seeing it starkly and clearly right now and the president is scrambling. He should’ve just told people the truth from the beginning, but you know what if he had — they wouldn’t have passed it. Not even Democrats would’ve passed this.”

Mr. Christie, the newly minted chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is a much-touted possible GOP nominee for president in 2016. He’s been a moderate conservative on many policies, such as climate change — and a vocal supporter of the president during the Superstorm Sandy devastation that hit New Jersey.
