The Broncos announced they activated Bibbs Saturday and waived tight end Richard Gordon.\n\nBibbs had spent the first five games on Denver\u2019s practice squad, but with Juwan Thompson (hamstring) questionable for Sunday\u2019s game Bibbs was needed to be the third running back.\n\n\u201cI told them not to give me a chance because if I get one I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure that I stay on this roster,\u201d Bibbs said Thursday.\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 203 pound speed back said he played on all of the starting special units in place of Thompson in practice all week.\n\nBibbs, who will wear no. 35, signed with the Broncos as a 2014 college free agent. He spent the first four weeks of his rookie season on the active roster, but has not appeared in a regular season game.\n\nHe only spent one year at CSU, but broke the Rams\u2019 single-season record for rushing yards (1,741) and touchdowns (31) in 2013.\n\nBibbs has 25, carries 111 rushing yards and three touchdowns in seven Broncos preseason games over the last two seasons.\n\nGordon\u2019s stay in Denver only lasted three days. He was signed Wednesday in place of Mitchell Henry to be a third tight end.\n\nThe Broncos will play Sunday with Owen Daniels and Virgil Green as their only two tight ends.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos activate Kapri Bibbs, waive Richard Gordon", "title": "Broncos activate Kapri Bibbs, waive Richard Gordon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/17/broncos-activate-kapri-bibbs-waive-richard-gordon/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017_100532_broncos-running-back-kapri-bibbs.jpg", "height": 523}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017_100532_broncos-running-back-kapri-bibbs.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T10:12:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T07:42:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Broncos announced they activated Bibbs Saturday and waived tight end Richard Gordon.\nFormer Colorado State and Broncos running back Kapri Bibbs will finally get his shot Sunday versus Cleveland.\nBibbs has 25, carries 111 rushing yards and three touchdowns in seven Broncos preseason games over the last two seasons.\nBibbs had spent the first five games on Denver\u2019s practice squad, but with Juwan Thompson (hamstring) questionable for Sunday\u2019s game Bibbs was needed to be the third running back.\nThe Broncos will play Sunday with Owen Daniels and Virgil Green as their only two tight ends."}
