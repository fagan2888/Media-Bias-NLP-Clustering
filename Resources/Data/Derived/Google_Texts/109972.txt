It’s game day for Shoni Schimmel and the Atlanta Dream.

The Dream have had an incredible season, and this evening they are headed in to the final game of the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the WNBA Playoffs. Their home opener in the three-game series, put Chicago up 80-77; but on Sunday, in Game 2, the Dream rallied back for a 92-83 win over Chicago.

ICTMN photographer Amy Morris captured rookie guard Shoni Schimmel in Game 1, which was played at home in Atlanta on August 22.

Schimmel and the Dream play tonight at 7:30 EST on NBA TV.
