One client who uses the services was showing signs of mental illness. Renee Crawford coordinates social services at the Center.\n\n\u201cShe gets very loud, very aggressive and very anxious,\u201d Crawford said, in reference to the troubled client. \u201cAnd then we have to go in and tell her, \u2018Calm down, relax, you can\u2019t be this loud,\u2019 Then she gets very upset and very irate.\u201d\n\nThe woman seemed to be suffering from paranoid delusions, and Crawford says the workers here aren\u2019t trained to help her.\n\n\u201cStaff gets very uncomfortable with it. We have called the police. We have asked her to leave the building.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, there were few places for Crawford to go for help. But legislation passed last year in Sacramento provides more than $140 million in grant funds for, among other things, mobile crisis support teams.\n\nBecause Crawford was worried her client might become violent, she turned to a service of the Burbank Police Department, called a Mental Health Evaluation Team. The team pairs a clinical psychologist and a patrol officer, who respond together to mental health crises. Psychologist Jennifer Hunt says the goal is to assess people and, if appropriate, connect them with mental health services. The team seeks to head off a confrontation that could land a person, like Crawford\u2019s client, either in the hospital or jail.\n\n\u201cWe would want to make sure not only that we are addressing the needs that she continues to present,\u201d says Hunt, \u201cbut also to make sure that everybody\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nBack in the patrol car, Kristiana Sanchez, the police officer who works with Hunt, says units like this one free up other patrols to focus on their primary mission \u2014 fighting crime. Before crisis teams were in use, she says police officers wasted valuable time in waiting rooms.\n\n\u201cIt took many officers out of the field to deal with transporting someone who was in a mental health crisis to the hospital and then sitting there for multiple hours,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cAnd that took two officers for just one person.\u201d\n\nNow, says Sanchez, specially-trained officers like her are able to recognize the symptoms of mental disorders.\n\nLinda Boyd, who started the emergency outreach bureau for Los Angeles County, says responding to mental illness requires very different skills from disarming criminals.\n\n\u201cWe treat people with respect,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cWe don\u2019t rush in. \u2026 We give the person time to calm down. With folks who have a mental illness, you really have to slow down.\u201d\n\nMobile crisis teams are expensive, and were only available in parts of the Los Angeles County until last year when lawmakers approved the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act. It restored badly needed funding for psychiatric services. Now, with the new grant money, Los Angeles has more than a dozen new mobile crisis teams, and is doubling the number of its urgent care units \u2014 places where people in a psychiatric emergency can go for help, instead of the hospital or jail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New state funding means better psychiatric services.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"New State Funding Improves County Mental Health Services\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/11\\/07\\/new-state-funding-improves-county-mental-health-services\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-07 05:40:42\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-10 15:52:43\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22403,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/11\\/iStock_000016939839_Large-e1415663541743.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "New state funding means better psychiatric services.", "title": "New State Funding Improves County Mental Health Services", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/11/07/new-state-funding-improves-county-mental-health-services/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/11/iStock_000016939839_Large-640x420.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17d6\"", "article_summary": "Psychologist Jennifer Hunt says the goal is to assess people and, if appropriate, connect them with mental health services.\nThe team pairs a clinical psychologist and a patrol officer, who respond together to mental health crises.\nWith folks who have a mental illness, you really have to slow down.\u201dMobile crisis teams are expensive, and were only available in parts of the Los Angeles County until last year when lawmakers approved the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act.\nBecause Crawford was worried her client might become violent, she turned to a service of the Burbank Police Department, called a Mental Health Evaluation Team.\nBefore crisis teams were in use, she says police officers wasted valuable time in waiting rooms."}
