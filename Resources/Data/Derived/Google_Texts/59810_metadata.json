Ami Bera (D-Elk Grove), a physician, co-sponsored the Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act with Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ken), a lawyer. The bill was introduced in the House last week.\n\n\u201cAs a doctor, I know that physicians want to do what\u2019s best for their patients, and promoting evidence-based medicine will help us do that,\u201d Bera said in a written statement. \u201c[The bill] is a practical way to bring down the skyrocketing cost of health care, and to make the system work better for patients.\u201d\n\nThe law would provide added protection from lawsuits \u2014 called \u201ca safe harbor,\u201d for physicians who adhere to specific evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. It applies to providers a physician is supervising, as well.\n\nThe physicians facing the highest malpractice risk are obstetrician-gynecologists, and this bill could help ease that risk, according to Jeanne Conry, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\n\u201cClinical practice guidelines \u2026 provide ob-gyns with top-quality recommendations based on scientific research and input from expert obstetrician-gynecologists,\u201d Conry said. \u201cThese guidelines help ensure the highest standards of patient care. It is essential that physicians who follow best practices in patient care be protected from liability.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bera, about 75% of all physicians face a malpractice claim sometime during their career.\n\n\u201cThe fear of lawsuits can lead to care choices that protect the physician legally, like ordering unnecessary tests and procedures,\u201d Bera said, \u201cbut may not be what evidence says is the best option for the patient.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>A new national legislative proposal is designed to use evidence-based medicine to improve patient\u00a0health, save money and reduce risk of medical malpractice lawsuits. \u00a0</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "A new national legislative proposal is designed to use evidence-based medicine to improve patient\u00a0health, save money and reduce risk of medical malpractice lawsuits.", "title": "California Rep.
