And the majority of that spending was taxpayer-funded subsidies from ObamaCare.\n\nIn other words, the stimulus never ended.\n\nHealth care is what Americans are spending most of their money on today \u2014 far more than they spend on housing and utilities combined. Or cars, furniture, food or fuel.\n\nSurging medical spending also explains the third quarter\u2019s huge upward revision in GDP growth. President Obama in his State of the Union speech touted the revised 5 percent rate as the \u201cfastest economic growth in over a decade.\u201d But health care accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the uptick in consumer spending and much of the overall economic improvement.\n\n\u201cHealth care spending might be higher\u201d in coming revisions, says Commerce Department economist Nicole Mayerhauser, as additional data more accurately reflect health outlays spurred by new ObamaCare enrollments and subsidies.\n\nMost of the 15 million who have signed up for ObamaCare or new Medicaid benefits gained coverage last April or later. Enrollment is expected to increase as people respond to penalties for failure to get coverage. The Congressional Budget Office projects total enrollment to climb to 23 million this year and to 34 million in 2016.\n\nHealth spending will continue to outpace GDP \u2014 in fact, government actuaries forecast a whopping 6.1 percent annual growth for 2016 to 2023 versus 4.7 percent for 2013 to 2015.\n\nThe economy wouldn\u2019t be nearly as stable as reported if not for this massive injection of government steroids. Liberal, or Keynesian, economists think that\u2019s a positive feature of the new health law. But it\u2019s actually a drawback.\n\nOver time, higher taxes and spending act as a drag on the economy, crowding out private investment. Almost 90 percent of ObamaCare users get federal aid. As a result, a new CBO report projects ObamaCare subsidies will balloon to nearly $2 trillion over the next decade, only partially paid for by more than $640 billion in ObamaCare taxes and fines, which means more government borrowing and more upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nA government-funded flood of new patients, many of them forced into mandatory spending on services they didn\u2019t previously want or need, may be good for the health care sector, but it drains revenue from other sectors of the economy. That means GDP won\u2019t reach its full potential. University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan estimates that the Affordable Care Act will reduce GDP by 5 percent in the long run, thanks to all of its offsetting negative provisions.\n\nObamaCare may be helping some uninsured, but it\u2019s killing entrepreneurs \u2014 the jobs engine of the American economy.\n\n\u201cThe ACA has three major taxes in it \u2014 two are taxes on full-time employment and the other is on income,\u201d Mulligan said. \u201cAs a result, we are going to have fewer people working and less value created overall.\u201d\n\nRecent data bear him out. The Labor Department says the number of full-time jobs as a share of the adult population is at an alarmingly low 44 percent. In fact, \u201cThe number of full-time jobs as a percent of the total population is the lowest it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Gallup CEO Jim Clifton warns.\n\nThat\u2019s why the seemingly low 5.7 percent unemployment rate is also an illusion, Clifton argues. Millions have given up looking for work or are underemployed, and are thus not counted.\n\nThe dearth of full-time employment is highly unusual this far along in a recovery. ObamaCare explains the anomaly, and here\u2019s why: The ACA requires employers cover all full-time employees working 30 hours or more a week.\n\nBut many smaller businesses, or businesses with razor-thin profit margins, like restaurants, can\u2019t afford the government\u2019s comprehensive health benefits package and have been slashing full-time jobs to avoid the mandate.\n\nLabor data show the share of part-time employees working just below 30 hours a week has been rising since ObamaCare went into effect, while the share working just over 30 hours has been falling.\n\n\u201cObamaCare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time,\u201d Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, recently asserted.\n\nAs of January, more than 450 employers have made cuts to work hours or staffing levels as a result of ObamaCare, according to a database compiled by Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\nLikewise, ObamaCare helps explain flat wages, also unusual in the latter stages of a recovery. A recent poll by the National Federation of Independent Business found that of 900 firms surveyed, 26 percent said they\u2019re freezing or reducing wages because of the added costs from ObamaCare.\n\nThe new health law is also creating another economic deformity: New business formations are at a 35-year low, thanks in large part to ACA\u2019s many business burdens and uncertainties.\n\n\u201cFirms and individuals appear to be more risk adverse \u2014 businesses are hanging on to cash, fewer people are launching firms,\u201d the Brookings Institution noted in a recent study of \u201cbusiness dynamism\u201d in America.\n\nObamaCare may be helping some uninsured, but it\u2019s killing entrepreneurs \u2014 the jobs engine of the American economy.\n\nIn his State of the Union, Obama boasted he rescued the country from recession by rebuilding \u201cour economy on a new foundation.\u201d Unfortunately, that new foundation is government-run health care.\n\nPaul Sperry is a Hoover Institution media fellow and author of \u201cThe Great American Bank Robbery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "GDP is up, unemployment is down \u2014 good times are here again!\nSure, if you don\u2019t ask too many questions.\nWhile the economy grew 2.6\u00a0percent\u00a0in the fourth quarter, what most reports don\u2019t", "title": "ObamaCare is creating an illusion economy", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/obama_ferguson.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-9076256\"}", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,economy,employment,jobs,obamacare,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-08 06:00:05", "sailthru.title": "ObamaCare is creating an illusion\u00a0economy", "nypost-section": "News", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/obama_ferguson.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "GDP is up, unemployment is down \u2014 good times are here again!\r\n\r\nSure, if you don\u2019t ask too many questions.\r\n\r\nWhile the economy grew 2.6\u00a0percent\u00a0in the fourth quarter, what most reports don\u2019t mention is that 20 percent\u00a0of that growth was health care spending.
