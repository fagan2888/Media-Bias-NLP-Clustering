DETROIT (AP) - Detroit’s Eastern Market is getting ready for the inaugural Murals In the Market festival.

An announcement about the event was Tuesday. The festival’s first official mural has been created by Australian artist Meggs.

The festival starts Sept. 17 and will feature the work of more than 45 local and international artists who will paint large scale murals throughout the wholesale food and retailing area.

Eastern Market also will host discussion panels with artists and local farmers, a cultural tour, movie premiere, block party and other activities.

The festival is a collaboration of Eastern Market-based fine art publisher 1xRUN and the Eastern Market Corp.

Over the past four years 1xRUN and Inner State Gallery have curated and produced more than 30 murals in Eastern Market.
