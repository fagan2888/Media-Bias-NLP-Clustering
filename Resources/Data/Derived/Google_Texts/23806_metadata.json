In fact, about 42 million people around the United States are totally or partially responsible for a family member who is older, sick, disabled or otherwise dependent on them for daily tasks.\n\nAt least 21 percent of African Americans \u2014 that\u2019s one in five \u2014 are among those caregivers. Many still are working and some have had to leave jobs to care for a loved one, according to a study by the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP.\n\nThere is often no road map for the new level of responsibilities. And because caregivers don\u2019t see themselves as caregivers, per se \u2014 but rather as sons, daughters, spouses and relatives doing what families do \u2014 they may feel lonely, isolated and even confused. Yet, their natural love, caring and sense of responsibility may prevent these family members from asking for help.\n\nSo, what is available to them when they need guidance or simply need \u2014 and deserve \u2014 a break? AARP recognizes the selfless commitment and the difficulties of caregiving. Here\u2019s help that\u2019s readily available:\n\nThe AARP Caregiving Resource Center offers the tools you need to help care for yourself and the ones you love. It also provides opportunities to join an online community of caregivers and learn about local services.\n\nYour employer may have a program that enables caregiving workers to continue their duties and enhance productivity. Find out. Some may provide flexible scheduling for employees caring for loved ones.\n\nEldercare.gov offers guidelines on how adult day care services may help ease your concerns while you\u2019re at work.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nThe stats show that if you aren\u2019t currently a caregiver, you either have been or will be one at some point. Whether during the holidays or throughout the year, caregivers are like miracle workers in all they do for their families. Though exhausting, this can also be an enormously meaningful accomplishment that deserves many thanks.\n\nCredit: AARP.org\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s that time of year when millions of families begin enjoying new scents from the kitchen, the excitement and anticipation from the children, and the sights and sounds of celebration and merriment from multiple directions.
