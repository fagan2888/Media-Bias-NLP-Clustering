Rather, the tour starts by taking an inverted plunge \u2014 20 miles up Boulder Canyon with approximately 2,750 feet of elevation to the first aid station in Nederland.\n\n\u201cDay 1: There\u2019s no sugarcoating it; it\u2019s gonna be a tough day,\u201d said Ride The Rockies tour director Chandler Smith. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a day where you need to pace yourself. There\u2019s obviously a lot of elevation gain in the first day. And some significant climbs.\u201d\n\nOverall, Day 1 to Winter Park covers 89 miles with 9,911 feet of elevation. Smith was quick to reveal the bright side to the course\u2019s profile.\n\n\u201cThe route itself is a lot of fun,\u201d Smith said. \u201cGoing up Boulder Canyon with westbound traffic closed? It\u2019s not every day you get that experience. Riding Peak to Peak Highway: It\u2019s a gorgeous stretch of road going through the likes of Black Hawk and Central City, and just seeing the character and charm of those towns will keep people\u2019s minds a little preoccupied.\u201d\n\nThe most menacing aspect at first blush might be the climb from Empire up Berthoud Pass \u2014 approximately 2,700 feet of climbing over 13 miles \u2014 because of its placement late in the course. However, Smith advises cyclists not to overlook the stretch preceding that final climb.\n\n\u201cThe real challenge in this is you have a big day, and that only gets you to Empire,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd then you still have a big climb up and over Berthoud Pass before you finish out the stage. \u2026\n\n\u201cBut I think the part that is going to surprise people the most \u2014 you don\u2019t see it necessarily on the profile \u2014 once you hit Idaho Springs to Empire, you have about 12-13 miles which is just a steady gradual. That stretch is notorious for headwinds. You just get done doing all this climbing, and then you get to Idaho Springs thinking, \u2018Ah, I might have a little reprieve,\u2019 by just looking at the elevation profile. But that 13 miles can be pretty punishing.\u201d\n\nTypically on Ride The Rockies, cyclists can start the day at their leisure. In the interest of traffic management in Boulder Canyon, however, Day 1 begins with a \u201cwave start\u201d (details below).\n\nSmith: \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with Colorado State Patrol, CDOT and Boulder and Nederland police departments to facilitate a more timely plan out of respect for everyday motorists and other tourists trying to get up and down the canyon. \u2026\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019ll be waves of up to 300. Twenty-minute increments. With a break for an opening ceremony at 7 a.m. The first wave will be 5:45; the last wave is 8:05.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day awaits Winter Park, which will serve as a host community for Ride The Rockies for the first time in tour history.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think without a doubt it\u2019ll go down as one of the toughest days,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut perhaps one of the most rewarding days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Boulder,climbing,Colorado,course,Cycling,Ride the Rockies,Ride the Rockies 2014,Winter Park", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ride the Rockies", "description": "With one of the most challenging days of riding in the history of Ride The Rockies, the 29th annual cycling tour gets underway in Boulder on Sunday morning.", "title": "Day 1 of Ride The Rockies 2014: \"One of the toughest days\" in history", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/06/day-1-ride-rockies-one-toughest-days-tour-history/2482/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/05/RTR_2014_CueSheet_BlackHawk.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "With one of the most challenging days of riding in the history of Ride The Rockies, the 29th annual cycling tour gets underway in Boulder on Sunday morning.", "title": "Day 1 of Ride The Rockies 2014: \u201cOne of the toughest days\u201d in tour history", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/06/day-1-ride-rockies-one-toughest-days-tour-history/2482/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/05/RTR_2014_CueSheet_BlackHawk.jpg", "creator": "@boyle", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "With one of the most challenging days of riding in the history of Ride The Rockies, the 29th annual cycling tour gets underway in Boulder on Sunday morning."}, "article_summary": "\u201cYeah, I think without a doubt it\u2019ll go down as one of the toughest days,\u201d said Smith.\nWith one of the most challenging days of riding in the history of Ride The Rockies, the 29th annual cycling tour gets under way in Boulder on Sunday morning.\n\u201cDay 1: There\u2019s no sugarcoating it; it\u2019s gonna be a tough day,\u201d said Ride The Rockies tour director Chandler Smith.\nIn the interest of traffic management in Boulder Canyon, however, Day 1 begins with a \u201cwave start\u201d (details below).\n\u201cGoing up Boulder Canyon with westbound traffic closed?"}
