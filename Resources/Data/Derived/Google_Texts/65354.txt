National Weather Service forecasters were predicting more rain overnight through Monday morning across metro Denver — but no snow.

“The temperatures are just a little too high to get snow,” NWS meteorologist Jim Kalina said.

Expect more snow in the mountains and moderate rain across Denver, continuing through early morning, decreasing around 9 a.m., Kalina said.

There was a 50 percent chance of rain before 8 a.m. in Denver. Skies are likely to stay cloudy much of the day, he said.

“Could see some sun.”
