Back in June, the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs revealed that the organic food juggernaut had been overcharging its customers, even though products are already considered overpriced. Thanks to a customer visiting one of the company\u2019s California locations, we now have evidence of one of Whole Foods\u2019 most egregious sales mistakes: $6 \u201cAsparagus Water.\u201d\n\nInstagram user Marielle Wakim posted a photo of 16 fl oz. bottles of water inexplicably filled with three asparagus spears each. The post was accompanied by the caption: \u201cSomewhere in L.A., Whole Foods are laughing at all of us.\u201d If the combination of water and asparagus wasn\u2019t ludicrous enough, however, the price of $5.99 was enough to make the Instagram post go viral. The company was quick to address its newest product that has already been taken off supermarket shelves.\n\n\"We looked into the item as soon as it was brought to our attention,\u201d Liz Burkhart, Whole Foods\u2019 senior media relations specialist, told the Huffington Post. \u201cIt was carried briefly in just one of our stores in California and was meant to be water with the essence of vegetables and/or mushrooms, which is typically made over a long period of time soaking in water. It was made incorrectly and has since been removed.\u201d\n\nBurkart added that Asparagus Water was \u201ccarried briefly\u201d by its location in Brentwood, Calif., where it was promptly removed. Trying to dupe customers into spending $6 on a bottle of water with three asparagus spears stuffed into it is pretty foolish it its own right. Doing so when your company is already embroiled in controversy for taking money out of the pockets of its customers is just absurd.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "whole, foods, tried, sell, 6, asparagus, water, and, it, did, not, go, planned, company, issues", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Whole Foods doubled down after overcharging its customers with $6 \"Asparagus Water.\"", "title": "Whole Foods Tried Selling $6 'Asparagus Water' And It Didn't Go So Well [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/whole-foods-tried-sell-6-asparagus-water-and-it-did-not-go-planned-company-issues-346268", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/05/asparagus-water.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Whole Foods doubled down after overcharging its customers with $6 \"Asparagus Water.\"", "title": "Whole Foods Tried Selling $6 'Asparagus Water' And It Didn't Go So Well [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/whole-foods-tried-sell-6-asparagus-water-and-it-did-not-go-planned-company-issues-346268", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/05/asparagus-water.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/05/asparagus-water.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-05T12:27:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-05T12:27:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Whole Foods doubled down after overcharging its customers with $6 \"Asparagus Water.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda680\"", "article_summary": "It was made incorrectly and has since been removed.\u201dBurkart added that Asparagus Water was \u201ccarried briefly\u201d by its location in Brentwood, Calif., where it was promptly removed.\nbottles of water inexplicably filled with three asparagus spears each.\nTrying to dupe customers into spending $6 on a bottle of water with three asparagus spears stuffed into it is pretty foolish it its own right.\nDoing so when your company is already embroiled in controversy for taking money out of the pockets of its customers is just absurd.\nWhole Foods has been having a bad go of it this summer, and that\u2019s putting it lightly."}
