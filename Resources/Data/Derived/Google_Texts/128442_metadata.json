The company hasn\u2019t done any deals this year, after completing four deals in 2012, including the roughly $380 million purchase of German pump manufacturer ixetic GmbH.\n\nMagna\u2019s hesitation on the M&A front reflects a broader trend. Surging stock markets have pushed up market capitalizations overall, which is one factor behind a 15% drop in M&A activity this year. According to Dealogic, companies have announced 32,746 deals globally so far this year, down from 38,757 at this point last year.\n\nMr. Galifi said his company is still interested in acquiring new technologies to add to its business, but cautioned that fewer of its competitors feel any pressure to sell, which makes it harder to find deals.\n\n\u201cThe level of potential transactions is substantially slower than it would have been a couple of years ago, in part due to the stronger health of the supply base,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not that desire, or the need, to sell assets to raise cash.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of M&A, Magna has been using its cash to make capital expenditures and returning money to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nThe company has recently opened plants in China, Mexico, Serbia and Turkey and expects to spend $1.3 billion on investments this year. That\u2019s down from the $1.4 billion the company had expected to spend in August, but Mr. Galifi said the reduction is due mainly to moving some costs into 2014, rather than cutting back. Magna spent roughly $1.3 billion on capital expenditures in 2012.\n\nThe company has a $0.32 quarterly dividend and its board authorized a one-year 12 million share repurchase program earlier this month.\n\nMagna\u2019s business has been benefitting from the resurgence of the U.S. auto industry. The company \u2018s stock has almost doubled this year to C$87.91, from C$49.68 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. However, a restructuring in Europe caused the company to report an 18% decline in its third quarter earnings.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Magna International Inc., North America\u2019s largest auto-parts maker by sales, is easing off on acquisitions because potential targets have become too expensive.", "title": "Magna CFO: High Valuations Curb M&A Appetite", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2013/11/22/magna-cfo-high-valuations-curb-ma-appetite/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Magna CFO: High Valuations Curb M&A Appetite", "description": "Magna International Inc., North America\u2019s largest auto-parts maker by sales, is easing off on acquisitions because potential targets have become too expensive.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Vipal Monga", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CFO Journal.
