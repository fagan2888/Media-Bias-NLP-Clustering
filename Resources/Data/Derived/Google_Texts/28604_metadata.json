The required tools will also be nearby.\n\nTransformation: According to Homebase, modern homeowners are so lacking in DIY skills that it's having to change the layout of its stores to help them cope (file picture)\n\nHomebase hopes it will bring to an end the frustration of having to know what you need before you even start the job and endless running between departments.\n\nThe firm says it is making the change because the younger generation is no longer picking up DIY skills from parents.\n\nThe overhaul was prompted by research showing that 50 years ago every young adult would have been able to wire a plug, fix a leaking tap or put up some shelves \u2013 but that is not the case today.\n\n\u2018A once familiar rite of passage of family life seems to have come to an end,\u2019 said Simon Rix of Homebase. \u2018Children are now less likely to possess DIY skills than ever.\n\nChange: Instead of displaying items in broad categories such as plumbing, it will group them by specific tasks\n\n\u2018Yet as first time buyers look for ways to save extra cash, the necessity to learn home maintenance skills has never been greater.\n\n\u2018Saving money by doing it yourself has become essential to make homes affordable for first time buyers in the middle of a housing price boom \u2013 but relatively few know how to cope.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018We\u2019re breaking the mould which assumes that people who shop for DIY items are already accomplished builders. That used to be true \u2013 it\u2019s not any more.\u2019\n\n'We\u2019re breaking the mould which assumes that people who shop for DIY items are already accomplished builders'\n\nSimon Rix\n\n\n\nHomebase has launched a major campaign to restore the tradition by showing everyone how easy it can be by holding the hands of those new to DIY.\n\nIt has become the first retailer to totally re-examine how DIY goods are displayed and sold, making it much easier for people with absolutely no DIY experience to do tasks around the home.\n\nThe firm has also changed the way products are displayed online, making it easier to gain advice and buy everything they need in one place.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Try,fix,leaky,tap,aisle,Homebase,bosses,change,store,layouts,products,grouped,task", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2707930/Try-fix-leaky-tap-aisle-Homebase-bosses-change-store-layouts-products-grouped-task.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Instead of displaying items in broad categories such as plumbing, electrical or heating, Homebase will group them by specific tasks.", "title": "Homebase bosses to change store layouts so products grouped by task", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2707930/Try-fix-leaky-tap-aisle-Homebase-bosses-change-store-layouts-products-grouped-task.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/28/article-2707930-02CA572F000005DC-844_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2707930/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2707930/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "keywords": "Try,fix,leaky,tap,aisle,Homebase,bosses,change,store,layouts,products,grouped,task", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2707930, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-07-28T01:08:54.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Jaya+Narain+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-07-28T10:46:11.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Try fix leaky tap aisle Homebase bosses change store layouts products grouped task"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Instead of displaying items in broad categories such as plumbing, electrical or heating, Homebase will group them by specific tasks.", "title": "Homebase bosses to change store layouts so products grouped by task", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2707930/Try-fix-leaky-tap-aisle-Homebase-bosses-change-store-layouts-products-grouped-task.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/28/article-2707930-02CA572F000005DC-844_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Instead of displaying items in broad categories such as plumbing, electrical or heating, Homebase will group them by specific tasks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd902e\"", "article_summary": "The firm says it is making the change because the younger generation is no longer picking up DIY skills from parents.\n\u2018Children are now less likely to possess DIY skills than ever.\nInstead of displaying items in broad categories such as plumbing, electrical or heating, it will group them by specific tasks.\nThe firm has also changed the way products are displayed online, making it easier to gain advice and buy everything they need in one place.\n\u2018A once familiar rite of passage of family life seems to have come to an end,\u2019 said Simon Rix of Homebase."}
