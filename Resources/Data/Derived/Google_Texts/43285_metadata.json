That's before subsidies kick in, though -- so it really depends on whether the customer qualifies for that government help.\n\nThe president is also telling uninsured Americans that if price is a problem, maybe they should cut out other utilities, such as cell phones and cable TV.\n\nDuring a March town hall meeting hosted by Univision and Telemundo, Obama said of the uninsured, \"it may turn out that they just haven't prioritized health care.\"\n\nMany young people scoffed at the suggestion they give up being connected, to get covered.\n\n\"It's just ignorant of the times,\" said one young Obama supporter, Chelsea Andrews. Andrews has insurance and a phone, but said that she would never part with either, instead resolving to figure out how to keep both if she were in a financial bind. \"I really support Obama but that was off-base for him, I think.\"\n\nOther young Americans agree.\n\n\"I'm single, I'm very healthy, and I don't have a lot of medical expenses that I pay,\" said Nick Lowenstein, outside a Washington, D.C., mall. \"I'm glad to pay my cell phone and cable and those are two things I don't want to not have in my life.\"\n\nBut some aren't so sure their lives would change without a cell phone.\n\n\"If people want to find me, they can find me,\" Alicia Subasinghe said. \"My mom knows where I am, they know where I live, so I don't need a cell phone as much as I need health care.\"\n\nThe administration is still pushing to get young people covered by the sign-up deadline of March 31. As of March 1, just a quarter of new enrollees were between 18 and 35 years old. The administration has suggested they need a grand total of 2.7 million in that age group to sign up, for open enrollment to be considered successful.\n\nPeter Doocy is currently a Washington D.C.-based correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).
