Prevail Health, which combines peer support with a structured cognitive behavior therapy program, first focused on helping veterans cope with depression and post traumatic stress disorders. It\u2019s launching a direct-to-consumer version of Vets Prevail this week.\n\niPrevail will be launched Thursday after six months in beta. In a phone interview with founder and CEO Richard Gengler, he said the peer support component would be free, but the company would charge $9.99 per month for users interested in taking part in its cognitive behavioral therapy program which spans several weeks.\n\nVets Prevail guides users who enroll anonymously through interactive questions to develop an initial assessment. It tailors a multistep program to their needs.\n\nIt combines calls with military peers who have been through similar experiences with reading assignments. By completing directed tasks, users get points that can be used to buy items such as gift cards for purchases.\n\nThe consumer play was always a part of the original plan, Gengler said. If he could get veterans to warm up to this program, he reasoned, the mass market should be easier to penetrate.\n\nAsked about the effectiveness of its program, Gengler pointed to a randomized control trial of Vets Prevail carried out from 2011-2013 with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. The study was published at the end of August. Asked if he thought an assessment of a therapy program for veterans was comparable to civilians he said yes, although he pointed out that there was no standardized treatment in mental health.\n\nThe vision for its program is to get people who would otherwise not take part in therapy to get to a comfort level talking about their problems, if only with a trained peer. If the user is interested, they can get involved in its CBT program. It would be great to see data showing how many people using the peer support segment opt for the CBT program, but it doesn\u2019t have any immediate plans to do clinical validation for its consumer facing program like what it did for its veterans program.\n\nSpengler noted that in addition to Vets Prevail, it also have one for new mothers with postpartum depression called Mothers Prevail. About 80 percent of the content for the two programs is the same. A third one is aimed at students taking advantage of the GI Bill.\n\nThe challenge of treating conditions like depression is that many people don\u2019t think they have a problem or they are not yet ready to acknowledge they do. Although an anonymous approach to therapy would seem like an innocuous approach, it\u2019s hard to figure out which peers in its peer group pool will succeed in getting participants to pay for the program. Reimbursement remains the ultimate challenge.\n\nGengler notes that is tough to quantify the impact of improving mental health access on society but from a military perspective there\u2019s more urgency. All you need to do is look at the Vietnam cohort to understand the cost of not dealing with veterans mental health issues, especially the link to chronic conditions.\n\n\u201cIf we reduce crime as part of our program Aetna is not going to reimburse for that,\u201d Gengler said. \u201cWe are past the tipping point of awareness, but there\u2019s no consensus of who pays for mental health.\u201d\n\nThe thing that Prevail Health and many companies are betting on is that the shift to outcomes-based care that Obamacare sets up will drive home the need to provide better mental health care access to avoid the costs associated with ignoring it.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user darcyadelaide", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prevail Health initially focused on helping veterans cope with depression and post traumatic stress disorders.
