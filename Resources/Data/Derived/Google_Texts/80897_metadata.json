Physical violence. Abusive sex.\n\nLive Action\u2019s latest undercover investigation unravels Planned Parenthood\u2019s startling sexology. Live Action\u2019s new investigative video reveals how far the abortion-giant will go to promote questionable practices to teens, and how the organization\u2019s rationale essentially condones any sexual activity among partners. Teenagers are not only encouraged to experiment with a slew of sexual practices, they are coached by Planned Parenthood staffers how to view pornography, obtain adult sex toys, and even defecate on each other for sexual pleasure. The organization\u2019s sexual ideology caters dangerous and violent Fifty Shades of Grey-type BDSM relationships to youths as acceptable, \u201cnormal\u201d practices based on personal preference.\n\nEpisode Four of Live Action\u2019s SEXED investigative series takes place in Eden Prairie, a city in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. The footage reveals an employee encouraging an investigator, who told the worker she is 15, to experiment with alarming sexual activities. The counselor coaches the girl that sexual practices, including the use of horse whips and ropes to inflict welts and bodily pain, is not sexual abuse as long as activities are consensual among partners. In addition to offering advice on where to obtain adult sex toys, the Planned Parenthood counselor exposes the organization\u2019s corporate sexual culture.\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD: I would say anything within the sexual world is normal as long as it\u2019s consensual\u2014\n\nSpotlighting Planned Parenthood\u2019s questionable sexual ethos, Episode 4 details how the organization promotes the violent bondage sex popularized by bestselling erotica novel, Fifty Shades of Grey, to inexperienced teenagers. In the expos\u00e9, the Planned Parenthood clinician suggests several sexual experiments for the girl and her boyfriend to try, including the infliction of bodily pain, welts and rope burns.\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD: \u2014um, so there are lots of things that happen in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d that border on\u2014um, I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cabuse,\u201d because it\u2019s consensual, but definitely extreme. So there are things that\u2014\n\n15-YEAR-OLD: Extreme?\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD: \u2014happen in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d that are extreme. Now, if it\u2019s consensual, again, completely normal. Um, uh, things that happen in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d all center around pain, and your response to pain, and submission. And, um, there are lots of people in the public view that argue that that\u2019s not a healthy relationship, and then there are people that argue that it is, and that it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s between two people.\n\nHowever, Planned Parenthood\u2019s corporate definition of sexual normalcy ironically falls into the grey. Despite the institution\u2019s desire to streamline Fifty Shades of Grey relationships, and the worker\u2019s insistence that anything is \u201cnormal,\u201d the Planned Parenthood counselor tacitly admits that violent BDSM practices are not only \u201cextreme,\u201d but abnormal when she questions whether the girl has been in a \u201cnormal\u201d sexual relationship:\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD: OK. OK. Um, have you\u2014have the two of you been sexually active, like, in a normal way?\n\n15-YEAR-OLD: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD: In a normal relationship?\n\n15-YEAR-OLD: Mm-hm.\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD: And how long have you been sexually active with him?\n\n15-YEAR-OLD: Um, for probably, like, about six months now.\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD: OK.\n\nThe inadvertent admission not only exposes that Planned Parenthood staffers are unsure of what constitutes normal sexual practices, but further delves into the organization\u2019s radical \u201canything goes\u201d sexology.\n\nThe staffer also mentions that Planned Parenthood patients have visited the clinic with welts and markings as a result of violent sex games, and refers the investigator to neighborhood adult sex shops to purchase sex toys.\n\nBacked by the Obama administration, Planned Parenthood\u2019s heavily tax-funded sex-education programs seek to normalize sexual abuse and BDSM relationships among teenagers. The organization receives a $75 million allocation under the Affordable Care Act each year in addition to half of a billion dollars from taxpayers.\n\nLive Action President, Lila Rose, condemns the abortion giant\u2019s double standards and startling sex advice for underage boys and girls.\n\n\u201cWhat else could an underage girl agree to that Planned Parenthood would call \u2018completely normal\u2019?\u201d Rose said. \u201cCuts? Broken bones? Is child sexual abuse \u2018completely normal\u2019 if the girl thinks she wants it? Planned Parenthood has covered up the statutory rape of minors for years as well, not taking child sexual abuse seriously. Apparently it\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 to everything \u2013 to depraved and dangerous behavior \u2013 as long as there\u2019s \u2018consent.'\u201d\n\nLive Action\u2019s SEXED investigative series uncovers similar abuses by Planned Parenthood facilities in multiple states. In previous SEXED episodes, Planned Parenthood staffers were caught encouraging teens to experiment with BDSM, secretly view pornography without parental consent, and visit local adult sex shops to obtain ideas for various sexual practices.\n\nUnlike Planned Parenthood, Live Action doesn\u2019t get hundreds of millions of dollars in forced taxpayer funding to keep us going.
