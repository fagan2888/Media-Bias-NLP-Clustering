But the thing that has gotten his name on the healthcare blacklist has nothing to do with price (because drug-price gouging has been done early and often).\n\nHis big sin in the industry is that he was loud about it at the wrong time. As a result, he\u2019s given presidential candidates a way to tie a national debate on wealth disparity and wage equality directly to healthcare (and not just pharma).\n\nBig healthcare follows the rule of the wise, old-school movie mobster: Don\u2019t attract attention. It\u2019s a smart one \u2013 businesswise.\n\nBeyond Obamacare, it\u2019s hard to find a wedge issue in medicine. It\u2019s a complicated, compartmentalized industry. You can\u2019t get mad at one drugmaker, one insurance company or one hospital (each sector is pretty good at blaming the other). Enough people have been saved by a drug or doctor that it\u2019s hard to complain.\n\nIn short: it\u2019s a grey area.\n\nShkreli, suddenly, made it black and white. Here was one brash dude bro who fed the trolls online and boasted about caring little beyond the bottom line. He\u2019s a lifelong 1 percenter who came off as gaming the system even further to his benefit.\n\nGordon Gekko was cool 12 months ago. But not today.\n\nThis is not going to go away. It\u2019s too good of an issue not to. Hillary Clinton is bringing in big insurance \u2013 and that means Aetna and Anthem will take some shrapnel. Sovaldi is already getting linked to Shkeli and Daraprim, along with Rodelis Therapeutics and Valeant.\n\nThe drug-pricing issue is all the rage only in the Democratic primary. But the Republicans will join in during the general election (how can you be in favor a 5,000 percent price spike?). There\u2019s plenty of time between then and now for legislators and regulators to help whichever side of the aisle they are on.\n\nThings start to change when a issue gets a face. Drug-price spiking had become business as usual. But now it has a face.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He spoke too much at the wrong time.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "He spoke too much at the wrong time.", "title": "Martin Shkreli\u2019s biggest sin (and it\u2019s not drug-price gouging)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bloomberg.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-04T07:55:10-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/09/martin-shkreli-real-sin-turing-daraprim/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bloomberg.jpg", "description": "He spoke too much at the wrong time.", "card": "summary", "title": "Martin Shkreli's biggest sin (and it's not drug-price gouging) - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Daraprim, drug pricing, Martin Shkreli, OB, Turing Pharmaceuticals, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Biotech", "tag": "Turing Pharmaceuticals", "published_time": "2015-09-23T09:23:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-04T07:55:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But the thing that has gotten his name on the healthcare blacklist has nothing to do with price (because drug-price gouging has been done early and often).\nHis big sin in the industry is that he was loud about it at the wrong time.\nMartin Shkreli has thrown the mob a bone by saying Turing Pharmaceuticals will cut the price of Daraprim (now we wait for how low it will go).\nYou can\u2019t get mad at one drugmaker, one insurance company or one hospital (each sector is pretty good at blaming the other).\nHere was one brash dude bro who fed the trolls online and boasted about caring little beyond the bottom line."}
