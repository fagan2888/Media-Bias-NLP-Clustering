Once Cheyenne goes back to school she will work with special-needs teachers.\n\nShe's also seeing a speech therapist and physical therapist.\n\nCheyenne is not alone in her journey.\n\n\u201cIt was really good to see all my friends and stuff. They have helped me through this by just by being there,\u201d said Cheyenne.\n\nIt's a spirit that can't be broken.\n\n\u201cWhen I get better, I want to dance and do all the things I used to do,\u201d said Cheyenne.\n\nThe Queen family also wants to thank the community for their outpouring of support. The Fighting with Cheyenne Facebook page has more than 4,000 likes.\n\nAn account has been created in Tim Queen's name at Palmetto Bank in Simpsonville to help pay for Cheyenne's medical expenses.\n\nRiley McDermott has been charged with six counts of felony DUI in the crash that injured Cheyenne.\n\nThree people died in the crash: Jessica Roberts, 20, Cory Simmonds, 22, and Amber Hope Perkins, 17, who was Cheyenne's sister.\n\nJessica Roberts' 17-year-old sister, Samantha, was hurt.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 23:27:04 EST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Liz Lohuis", "og": {"site_name": "WYFF4", "description": "The youngest survivor of a triple-fatal wreck last November sat down with WYFF News 4\u2019s Liz Lohuis for an exclusive interview.", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: 12-year-old survivor of triple fatal wreck home from hospital", "url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/exclusive-12yearold-survivor-of-triple-fatal-wreck-home-from-hospital/31533868", "image": "http://www.wyff4.com/image/view/-/31534026/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/c0hn6oz/-/CHEYENNE-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/exclusive-12yearold-survivor-of-triple-fatal-wreck-home-from-hospital/31533868", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wyff://content/article/31533868", "iphone": "wyff://content/article/31533868", "googleplay": "wyff://content/article/31533868"}, "name": {"ipad": "wyff", "iphone": "wyff", "googleplay": "wyff"}, "id": {"ipad": 505507641, "iphone": 505507641, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}}, "site": "@wyffnews4", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wyff://content/article/31533868", "app_name": "wyff", "package": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}, "ios": {"url": "wyff://content/article/31533868", "app_store_id": 505507641, "app_name": "wyff"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 135671321180}, "google-site-verification": "LWpc590JPr9qDk05qHGWcq1nIo4PF7VlkN6wQmjiOb8", "keywords": "CHEYENNE, QUEEN, DUI, WRECK, SURVIVOR, LIZ, LOHUIS", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/LizLohuisWyff4"}, "news_keywords": "CHEYENNE, QUEEN, DUI, WRECK, SURVIVOR, LIZ, LOHUIS", "description": "The youngest survivor of a triple-fatal wreck last November sat down with WYFF News 4\u2019s Liz Lohuis for an exclusive interview."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd8b\"", "article_summary": "Cheyenne Queen, 12, was pinned behind the driver\u2019s seat for a nearly an hour before firefighters could free her.\nThe youngest survivor of a triple-fatal wreck last November sat down with WYFF News 4\u2019s Liz Lohuis for an exclusive interview.\n\u201cI know the trach was to help me breathe when I first got in the hospital,\u201d said Cheyenne.\n\u201cI don't really remember when I couldn't walk.\nThere's a lot that Cheyenne doesn't remember about being in the hospital."}
