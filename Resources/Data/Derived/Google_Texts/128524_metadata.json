Debbie Stabenow, Michigan Democrat, said Thursday in a lengthy floor speech on the case, known as King v. Burwell.\n\nCongressional Republicans insist the debate won\u2019t end with the King ruling. A lawsuit filed by House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, against Obamacare elicited sympathetic vibes from a federal judge this month, and Republicans are piling up bills to replace the president\u2019s overhaul with a model that relies on market forces, medical malpractice reform and other party principles.\n\nRep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican who authored one of the plans, said Mr. Obama \u201ccontinues to shamelessly condemn and attack those standing up for patient-centered health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that he\u2019s got a pen and a phone. What he doesn\u2019t seem to have is the knowledge or the humility or the concern or the desire to work together on behalf of those struggling to provide care and those receiving the care,\u201d he said during a Ways and Means Committee hearing on Obamacare.\n\nHis colleagues say Mr. Obama is taking a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to the King challenge because if the subsidies are struck down, the president will simply demand a one-sentence fix to the law\u2019s contested phrasing.\n\n\u201cLike the Borg, the administration wants you to think that \u2018resistance is futile,\u2019\u201d said Georgetown University law professor Randy Barnett, evoking the mantra of a menacing alien race from \u201cStar Trek.\u201d \u201cEverything they get is \u2018settled,\u2019 but anything they fail to get is always up for a new vote.\u201d\n\nThe justices have made up their minds at this point, so Mr. Obama\u2019s speeches last week from the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations in Germany and the Catholic Health Association\u2019s meeting in Washington won\u2019t sway the outcome. Instead, analysts say, Mr. Obama\u2019s rhetoric is setting the terms for post-ruling debate.\n\n\u201cObama is playing the blame game. If the Supreme Court strikes down the federal subsidies, the administration will blame them for costing millions their health insurance. If they uphold the law, Obama was use it to gain greater legitimacy for his reform,\u201d said Darrell West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nEither way, Republican lawmakers aren\u2019t about to lay down their arms. If the subsidies are voided, Republicans say, they will help affected Americans while using the ruling to move away from Obamacare.\n\nIf the subsidies stay, the law\u2019s critics will pursue other legal challenges and point to insurers\u2019 request for double-digit rate hikes for the coming plan year.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans running for president are using opposition to the law to build support ahead of primary election season.\n\nSome Republicans want to lock in Obamacare\u2019s subsidies through 2017 if the court invalidates them, although presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told Politico last week that states should be able to opt out of such a plan.\n\n\u201cPublic opposition to the [health care law] isn\u2019t going anywhere no matter how the Supreme Court rules in King v. Burwell,\u201d said Michael Cannon, a health care policy director at the libertarian Cato Institute and chief architect of the subsidies case. \u201cEven if the administration wins, the next president will be able to rescind those illegal taxes and force Congress to repeal the law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama and his top aides are increasingly portraying this month's Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare subsidies as the final showdown for the health care law, saying that if the justices rule in their favor it should be the signal for Republicans to give up their attacks and move on to other fights.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama and his top aides are increasingly portraying this month\u2019s Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare subsidies as the final showdown for the health care law, saying that if the justices rule in their favor it should be the signal for Republicans to give up their attacks and move on to other fights.", "title": "Supreme Court\u2019s Obama subsidies ruling final health law showdown, Democrats say", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/supreme-courts-obama-subsidies-ruling-final-health/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/6_142015_congress-health-overhaul--28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/6_142015_congress-health-overhaul--28201.jpg", "description": "President Obama and his top aides are increasingly portraying this month's Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare subsidies as the final showdown for the health care law, saying that if the justices rule i", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court\u2019s Obama subsidies ruling final health law showdown"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Supreme Court, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Washington"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPublic opposition to the [health care law] isn\u2019t going anywhere no matter how the Supreme Court rules in King v.
