Religious organizations have doggedly protested the Health and Human Services mandate, part of Obamacare\u2019s Affordable Care Act, in courts across the country. This recent ruling has been seen as a huge blow to those efforts.\n\n\u201cThis marked the first time that a federal appeals court had rejected a claim that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last June in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores should shield a non-profit religious organization from any role whatsoever in carrying out the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate,\u201d Lyle Denniston of SCOTUS blog wrote.\n\nThe ruling has frustrated Notre Dame alumni and others who see it as an infringement on strongly held religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe 7th Circuit majority was just plain wrong in its application of Hobby Lobby,\u201d William Dempsey, chairman of the alumnus Sycamore Trust donor group, told The College Fix in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court said courts have to accept a plaintiff\u2019s sincere claim of conscience, though the plaintiff could still lose if the public interest demanded it, but the court of appeals simply said to Notre Dame in effect, \u2018You may feel that way but you shouldn\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cStill, the Supreme Court may not take this or any other case for review until some court of appeals rules against the government. So far, none have.\u201d\n\nThe Obamacare mandate requires all employer health plans to provide free contraceptives, sterilizations, and abortion-inducing drugs. The mandate provides an extremely narrow exemption for \u201creligious employers,\u201d which fails to cover most faith-based organizations including Catholic hospitals, universities, and service organizations.\n\nTo meet the exemption qualifications, religious employers must hire and serve exclusively people of their own faith, qualify as a church or religious order as defined by the tax code, and exist for the purpose of inculcating religious doctrine. With that, religious universities and business owners have had limited successes with their legal challenges.\n\nLast June, the Supreme Court issued a major ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby on the contraception mandate, stating that the federal regulation cannot be applied to \u201cclosely held corporations\u201d if their owners object on religious grounds. Following this case, the court of appeals reconsidered Notre Dame\u2019s plea for exemption, after the trial court denied Notre Dame\u2019s request that the Obamacare mandate requirement be suspended pending the trial.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Joel Flaum stated that \u201cbecause Notre Dame offers health insurance to its students, and especially because it acts as a self-insurer for its employees, the law turns Notre Dame into a conduit for the provision of cost-free contraception\u2026Notre Dame\u2019s only alternative is to endure crippling fines.\u201d\n\nYet alumni groups such as Sycamore Trust have been critical of the way Notre Dame itself handled the lawsuit against the Health and Human Services mandate from the beginning.\n\nIn its denial of relief, the trial court mentioned that Notre Dame\u2019s delay in legally challenging the mandate was \u201ca little hard to swallow.\u201d President Rev. John Jenkins and the administration had told employees just two months prior to filing the lawsuit that they would be receiving free contraceptives. Citing \u201ccompetitive necessity,\u201d Notre Dame also provided a contraceptive and abortifacient plan to students following the mandate after considering the health plans of other major universities.\n\nDennis Brown, Notre Dame\u2019s assistant vice president for university communications, did not respond to The College Fix\u2019s request for comment. As of today, Notre Dame has released no official statement about the 7th circuit\u2019s ruling.\n\nCollege Fix reporter Kate Hardiman is a student at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGES: Kate Hardiman", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "OBAMACARE: Catholic institution denied religious exemption.", "title": "Federal court rules Notre Dame must pay for birth control, abortifacients - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NotreDame.KateHardiman.jpg", "height": 468}, "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/22621/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NotreDame.KateHardiman.jpg", "description": "OBAMACARE: Catholic institution denied religious exemption.", "card": "summary", "title": "Federal court rules Notre Dame must pay for birth control, abortifacients - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2015-05-28T02:01:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe260c\"", "article_summary": "College Fix reporter Kate Hardiman is a student at the University of Notre Dame.\nDennis Brown, Notre Dame\u2019s assistant vice president for university communications, did not respond to The College Fix\u2019s request for comment.\nThe ruling has frustrated Notre Dame alumni and others who see it as an infringement on strongly held religious beliefs.\nFollowing this case, the court of appeals reconsidered Notre Dame\u2019s plea for exemption, after the trial court denied Notre Dame\u2019s request that the Obamacare mandate requirement be suspended pending the trial.\nAs of today, Notre Dame has released no official statement about the 7th circuit\u2019s ruling."}
