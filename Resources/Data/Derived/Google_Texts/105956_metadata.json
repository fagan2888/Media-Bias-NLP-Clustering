In the southern hemisphere it marks the beginning of Autumn.\n\nSpring manifests itself in ways we take for granted yet it is a combination of many events that should make us marvel if we gave them any thought. For example, where does all the snow go? The U.S. and the rest of the world set records of snowfall levels throughout Winter.\n\nAs noted by the U.S. Geological Service, \u201cin the world-wide scheme of the water cycle, runoff from snowmelt is a major component of the global movement of water.\u201d\n\n\u201cMountain snow fields act as natural reservoirs for many western United States water-supply systems, storing precipitation from the cool season, when most precipitation falls and forms snowpacks\u2026As much as 75 percent of water supplies in the western states are derived from snowmelt.\u201d Snowmelt ensures sufficient water for all of us and for the Earth that depends upon it for the growth of all vegetation.\n\nHow do the flowers know it is Spring? In a 2011 article for the Inside Science News Service, Katherine Gammon noted that \u201cJust in time for the birds and bees to start buzzing, the flowers and the trees somehow know when to open their buds to start flowering. But the exact way that plants get their wake-up call has been something of a mystery.\u201d A molecular biologist at the University of Texas, Sibum Sung, has been trying to solve that mystery and has discovered \u201ca special molecule in plants that gives them the remarkable ability to recall Winter and to bloom on schedule in the Spring.\u201d\n\nNothing on Earth happens by accident. It is a remarkable inter-related system to which we give little thought. The sheer power of all those blooming flowers and trees should tell us something about the power of Nature that dwarfs all the claims that humans have any influence whatever on the events of Spring or any other time of the year.\n\nThen think about the role of the animals with whom we share the planet. In the Spring many come out of hibernation in their dens, while others such as birds make lengthy migrations from the warmer climes to those in the north. The huge migration of Monarch Butterflies should leave us speechless. Spring is a time when many animals give birth to their young.\n\nA sign of the Spring that leaves us breathless is the way it is the season for the aurora borealis. Dr. Tony Phillips of NASA notes that \u201cFor reasons not fully understood by scientists, the weeks around the vernal equinox are prone to Northern Lights. From Canada to Scandinavia they provide a great show.\n\n\u201cSuch outbursts are called auroral substorms and they have long puzzled physicists,\u201d says UCLA space physicist Vassilis Angelopoulos. They represent \u201ca potent geomagnetic storm.\u201d The equinox in Spring and Autumn is a time when magnetic connections between the Sun and Earth are most favorable.\n\nOne book, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d, by Rachel Carson, first published in September 1962, started the environmental campaign against pesticide use for any reason, leading most famously to the ban on DDT in the U.S. What Carson neglected to tell readers was how they were supposed to cope with the trillions of insects that come with the advent of warm weather.\n\nNo pesticide use does not mean less mosquitoes, less termites, less flies, less ants, or less of any other insect species and the diseases they spread, property damage, and the damage they cause to crops of all descriptions. And, of course, the much of the pollination of crops and other vegetation depends on insect species.\n\nCarson\u2019s claims of a silent spring bereft of bird species was a blatant lie. Rich Kozlovich, an authority on pest management, noted that \u201cBird populations were never so high in North America\u201d despite the use of DDT and other pesticides. \u201cCarson\u2019s claim about how the poor robin was going to disappear was not only wrong, she was deliberately lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarson was a science writer for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and absolutely had to know that in 1960 there were 12 times more robins, 21 times more cowbirds, 38 times more blackbirds, 131 times more grackles, etc., compared to 1941 numbers.\u201d\n\nSpring is a time of renewal in the northern hemisphere and it occurs with enormous levels of natural power. Most people, however, are oblivious to that power as they enjoy the sight of flowers and trees blooming.\n\nI could almost guarantee that you will read or hear about \u201cglobal warming\u201d or \u201cclimate change\u201d being attributed to the arrival of Spring. Do yourself a favor. Keep in mind that those claims, like Rachel Carson\u2019s, represent an anti-humanity, anti-energy, and anti-capitalism agenda of the environmental movement.\n\nInstead, celebrate the seasonal renewal of life on Earth and give thanks for the energy that permits you to control the environment of the structures where you live and work, that provides you the means to get in your car and go anywhere, and that powers every device you use.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/03/its-not-global-warming-its-springtime/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AA-Springtime2.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "It\u2019s Not \u201cGlobal Warming.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cSpringtime.\u201d"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2154\"", "article_summary": "I could almost guarantee that you will read or hear about \u201cglobal warming\u201d or \u201cclimate change\u201d being attributed to the arrival of Spring.\nMost people, however, are oblivious to that power as they enjoy the sight of flowers and trees blooming.\nKeep in mind that those claims, like Rachel Carson\u2019s, represent an anti-humanity, anti-energy, and anti-capitalism agenda of the environmental movement.\nA sign of the Spring that leaves us breathless is the way it is the season for the aurora borealis.\nThis year, Spring begins in the northern hemisphere on Friday, March 20 at 6:45 PM EDT."}
