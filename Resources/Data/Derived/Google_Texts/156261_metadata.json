AMN has logged at least double-digit earnings growth in all but two of the past 12 quarters.\n\nCEO Susan Salka is upbeat about the demand for AMN\u2019s services on a number of fronts.\n\n\u201cThe demand for health care professionals is through the roof,\u201d Salka told IBD.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a key driver, she says. It added 16.4 million newly insured Americans into the system, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 2015 estimate.\n\nAs more insured people have been added to the system, more go to the emergency room, urgent care or to see a doctor, which has sparked more demand for doctors and nurses, Salka says.\n\nDemand From Demographics\n\nAnother driver, she adds, is the point that more people in the U.S. are reaching the age of 65 and, as they age, require more medical services than the general population.\n\nDoctors and nurses are also getting older, she says, and are beginning to retire in greater numbers.\n\nAn improved economy and brighter jobs picture have also helped provide more people the money needed for medical expenses and co-pays.\n\n\u201cLower general unemployment also drives higher attrition and job openings, particularly within nursing,\u201d Salka adds.\n\nAMN\u2019s stock has risen 35% this year after a 33% gain in 2014.\n\nAMN provides workforce solutions \u2014 including managed services programs, vendor management systems, recruitment process outsourcing and consulting services \u2014 meant to help health care providers more effectively and efficiently manage their temporary and permanent staffing needs.\n\nIts clients are hospitals, community health centers and clinics, physician practice groups and many other health care providers. Through its managed services program, or MSP, it provides clients with a single point of contact for all their dealings with workforce vendors. AMN handles all the financial, management, clinical and other aspects of agency workforce supply.\n\nProviding that single point of contact to meet clients\u2019 needs has worked in AMN\u2019s favor:\n\n\u201cFor years, the main driver (of our business) was helping clients fill hard-to-fill positions and deal with seasonal fluctuations,\u201d said Salka. \u201cOver the past decade more and more health care providers want to outsource the whole procurement and staffing function for temporary and permanent workers.\u201d\n\nThe result has been a \u201cpickup\u201d in clients; demand to work with one large outsourcing partner to fill their needs, Salka says.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to continue this evolution of not just being a staffing partner, but a holistic workforce solutions partner,\u201d Salka said.\n\nAcquisitions have helped AMN meet that goal.\n\nStaffing Up By Acquisition\n\nOne important acquisition in this area was the 2010 purchase of Medfinders, a leading provider of clinical workforce managed services programs, and its Nursefinders brand that keyed in on the continuing high demand for nurses.\n\n\u201cAMN embraced the managed service provider concept with Nursefinders \u2026 pretty big in the MSP concept,\u201d SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Tobey Sommer told IBD. \u201cPrior to that acquisition AMN was not that big in MSP.\u201d\n\nAfter the acquisition, he adds, AMN grew the MSP business \u201cnicely\u201d and in the last 18 months has bought companies that have software to implement MSP.\n\n\u201cThe acquisitions they\u2019ve done in the last couple of years bring additional software and alternative staffing services that coincide with this trend of being a broader provider of workforce solutions to clients,\u201d William Blair analyst Timothy McHugh told IBD.\n\nOne of AMN\u2019s recent acquisitions was Avantas, a leading provider of clinical labor management services, including workforce consulting, data analytics, predictive modeling and scheduling technology, a transaction it completed in December 2014.\n\nThe price included an initial payment of $16.5 million, with an earn-out potential of up to $8.5 million based on future operating performance. Avantas\u2019 2014 projected revenue was estimated then at about $8 million, with the acquisition expected to be neutral to AMN\u2019s earnings in 2015 and accretive by 2016, AMN said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAvantas helps hospitals with workforce planning by providing technology and consulting services to help them better predict their total staffing needs,\u201d said Salka. \u201cThey have scheduling and predictive analytics to predict what (hospitals\u2019) needs will be, so they can better schedule the clinicians. Most hospitals do scheduling (for nurses) two to three weeks in advance. We can help them do better than that by looking out 60 to 90 days.\u201d\n\nIn January, AMN closed on the acquisition of Onward Healthcare, Locum Leaders and Medefis from OGH for a total price of $82.5 million. Onward Healthcare is a top national nurse and allied health care staffing firm. Locum Leaders is a national locum tenens (temporary physicians) provider. Medefis is a provider of an SaaS (software as a service)-based vendor management system for health care facilities.\n\nAcquisitions have helped drive AMN\u2019s growth. In the first quarter, earnings climbed 67% to 30 cents a share, on an adjusted diluted basis. Revenue rose 36% to $327.5 million.\n\nRevenue for its Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $229 million, up 40% (24% excluding acquisitions) from a year earlier. This segment provides hospitals and health care facilities with temporary professionals.\n\nThe Locum Tenens Staffing segment revenue was $87 million, an increase of 30% (19% excluding acquisitions). This segment involves the temporary placement of physicians as independent contractors.\n\n\u201cTheir growth the last few quarters is a reflection of longer-term demand drivers coming to fruition as well as positive market share trends,\u201d said McHugh.\n\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 39% to $1.03 a share. They see a 16% gain in 2016.\n\nOverall, temporary nurse staffing accounts for the biggest percentage of the company\u2019s revenue, or about half of the total, says Salka.\n\n\u201cOur growth strategy is to help clients to be more efficient and effective in managing their entire clinical workforce, both permanent and temporary,\u201d said Salka. \u201cIt\u2019s all about getting the right talent at the right time at the right cost.\u201d\n\nSalka says the company continues to look for acquisitions, including those that would expand its workforce solutions.\n\nAMN is a part of IBD\u2019s Commercial Services-Staffing industry group.
