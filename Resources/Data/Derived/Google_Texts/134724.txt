An excerpt of a segment from Bill O'Reilly's 'The O'Reilly Factor' that aired on Friday. O'Reilly: 'Kill zone' just a 'slang expression'

Fox News host Bill O'Reilly doubled down on his criticism of journalist David Corn while stressing that his controversial "kill zone" remark was "simply a slang expression" that shouldn't be taken literally.

In a transcript of remarks O'Reilly will make on his prime-time program, the Fox News host once again called Corn "a liar" and accused his magazine, Mother Jones, of trying to carry out "a political hit job." On Thursday, Corn published a report alleging that O'Reilly had lied about his experiences covering the Falklands War for CBS News in 1982.

O'Reilly responded to the Mother Jones report on Thursday by calling Corn "a liar" and a "despicable guttersnipe." In one of several interviews with reporters, O'Reilly said he expected Corn "to be in the kill zone. Where he deserves to be."

The editors-in-chief of Mother Jones responded to that attack on Friday by calling on O'Reilly to renounce and apologize for the remark. The EICs said they were alarmed by O'Reilly's "violent tone."

Instead, O'Reilly issued a brief statement saying, “It’s simply a slang expression.”

The veracity of Mother Jones' allegations has been a subject of debate among media reporters. O'Reilly has said throughout his career, in varying ways, that he was in a war zone in the Falklands. In fact, O'Reilly was present at a protest against the military junta in Buenos Aires during the Falklands War.
