Jefferson County Coroner John Graham is running for re-election, and one of his fans says ever since Graham took over the office in 2011 there’s been no complaints from the clientele.

At that, the Jefferson County Republican Party assembly exploded in laughter. Steve Jensen, chief deputy district attorney for the 1st Judicial District, explained that mortuaries and others are happy with Graham’s performance. Jensen nominated Graham for a second term at the assembly Saturday in Lakewood.

“It is important to have a coroner who can balance not only the need to determine the cause and manner of death, but also can act passionately and with sympathy to victims,” Jensen said. “John has done that job.”

Graham had no primary opposition and is his party’s nominee for coroner.

The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office was created by the Colorado Constitution.
