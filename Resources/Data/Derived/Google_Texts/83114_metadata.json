Dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama\u2019s six years in office further dims Democratic prospects.\n\nMany analysts expect the Republicans\u2019 House majority to swell. McCuan said his forecast ranges from a net gain of at least six GOP seats \u2014 boosting the party\u2019s majority to 23 \u2014 to a net gain of 27 seats, giving Republicans 260 of the House\u2019s 435 seats.\n\nThat number would far exceed a Republican campaign, announced in May, called \u201cDrive to 245,\u201d targeting a net gain of 12 seats.\n\nThe \u201cmost likely scenario,\u201d McCuan said, is a GOP gain of 10 to 15 seats. \u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d he said, but noted that the average midterm loss for the incumbent political party from 1934 to 2010 is 37.7 seats.\n\nDemocrats captured the most recent supermajority by winning 295 House seats, a net gain of 36, during Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidential landslide victory over Barry Goldwater in 1964.\n\nThe incumbents\n\nThompson, 63, an eight-term House veteran and former California state senator who has never lost an election, is running in the 5th Congressional District, which includes Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, Cotati and Sonoma Valley, all of Napa County and parts of Lake, Solano and Contra Costa counties.\n\nA Democratic Party rainmaker known for his fundraising prowess, Thompson has collected nearly $1.7 million in his bid for a ninth House term. He captured 80 percent of the vote in the June primary, and faces a political newcomer with no party preference, James Hinton, 40, of Napa in the run-off mandated by California\u2019s top-two primary system.\n\nHuffman, 50, who won the House seat vacated by former Democratic Rep. Lynn Woolsey in 2012, raised nearly $975,000 in his first re-election campaign and took 68 percent of the June primary vote. His opponent, supermarket cashier Dale Mensing, 56, of Garberville, is the only Republican competing in the two congressional races.\n\nThe 2nd Congressional District stretches from Marin County to the Oregon border. Democrats account for about half of the registered voters in both districts, with Republicans and no party preference voters splitting most of the rest.\n\nThompson and Huffman agree that Democrats will not win a majority this year, but Thompson is more sanguine about the party\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have some success in gaining seats,\u201d he said, without citing a number.\n\nHuffman acknowledged the likelihood of Republican gains, noting that Democrats are defending seats the party won in swing districts in 2012, a presidential election year that drew high voter turnout which typically benefits Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With name recognition, legislative history, big-money backing and opponents that lack established", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "For Reps.
