Bush from 2007-2009, said she recalled working at the Justice Department in 2001 \"and a lawsuit like this came through.\"\n\nThe former Bush spokeswoman added that \"before the day had finished the United States Senate and the House of Representatives had both passed resolutions saying that they were for keeping \u2018under God\u2019 in the pledge.\"\n\n\"If these people don't like it, they don't have to live here,\" Perino added.\n\nDavid Silverman, president of the American Atheists, called Perino's comments \"bigotry.\"\n\n\"I, for one, am tired of those Christians, like Ms. Perino, who think that equality is somehow un-American,\" Silverman said. \"If Ms. Perino doesn't like being only equal, it is she who will have to leave America to some other country that doesn't value religious liberty.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Famous Atheists and Their Beliefs\n\nIn 2002, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with atheist Michael Newdow who argued that the words \"under God\" in the pledge amounted to an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. The Supreme Court overturned that ruling.\n\nCongress added the words \"under God\" in 1954 amid the red scare over the Soviet Union. In November 2002, after the Newdow ruling, Congress passed a law reaffirming \"under God\" in the pledge.\n\nGreg Gutfeld, another co-host on \"The Five,\" continued the discussion after Perino, saying the Pledge of Allegiance \"is not a prayer, it's a patriotic exercise. In a sense, it's basically saying: Thanks for giving us the freedom to be an atheist.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts case, which was brought by an unidentified family of a student at a school in suburban Boston, will be argued on the premise that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution.\n\nREAD MORE: Behold, the Six Types of Atheists\n\nIt is the first such case to be tried on the state level: All previous attempts have been argued in federal court on the grounds that \"under God\" was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of church and state.\n\nCNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke,\u00a0CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN) -- Fox News pundit Dana Perino said she's \"tired\" of atheists attempting to remove the phrase \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance, adding, \"if these people really don't like it, they don't have to live here.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Fox News host: Atheists 'don't have to live here'", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/09/fox-news-host-atheists-dont-have-to-live-here/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130909124121-exp-fox-atheist-00002001-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke,\u00a0CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Fox News pundit Dana Perino said she's \"tired\" of atheists attempting to remove the phrase \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance, adding, \"if these people really don't like it, they don't have to live here.", "title": "Fox News host: Atheists 'don't have to live here'"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "atheism, belief, church and state, courts, culture wars, news media, schools, tv, american humanist association, dana perino, fox news, pledge of allegiance, roy speckhardt", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/09/fox-news-host-atheists-dont-have-to-live-here/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d03\"", "article_summary": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-EditorFollow @BurkeCNN(CNN) - Fox News pundit Dana Perino said she's \"tired\" of atheists attempting to remove the phrase \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance, adding, \"if these people really don't like it, they don't have to live here.\"\n\"If these people don't like it, they don't have to live here,\" Perino added.\nGreg Gutfeld, another co-host on \"The Five,\" continued the discussion after Perino, saying the Pledge of Allegiance \"is not a prayer, it's a patriotic exercise.\nThe group's executive director, Roy Speckhardt, called the suit \"the first challenge of its kind,\" but Perino begged to differ.\nCongress added the words \"under God\" in 1954 amid the red scare over the Soviet Union."}
