It\u2019s a chance to spend some quality time with people you\u2019ve spent nearly every day with for the past four years, but now they get to do so outside of the classroom. Seniors at Profile Junior-Senior High School in New Hampshire worked harder than most senior classes to earn their senior trip, but when something much more important came up they knew what they had to do. Warning: Altruism on fleek.\n\n\u201cEvery one of us has a connection with her, and she has given so much to us that we just wanted to give back,\u201d Christopher Sirois, the senior class president, told WMUR.\n\nSirois is referring to his high school\u2019s principal, Courtney Vashaw, who was recently diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer. Vashaw\u2019s diagnosis coincided with the week before her senior class left for Rydin\u2019 Hi Ranch in New York. Although no one told them, the senior class knew they had a decision to make. After raising around $8,000 over the course of the past four years to fund their senior trip, the class decided there was a better purpose for all that money.\n\n\u201cShe is one of the strongest, most determined women I know and if it can happen to her, you know anything can happen to anyone,\u201d senior Hunter Leighton said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "senior, class, gives, 8k, reserved, senior, trip, principal, diagnosed, cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A high school's senior class in New Hampshire donated the $8,000 for the senior trip to their principal, who was recently diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer.", "title": "HS Seniors Donate Class Trip Money To Principal With Cancer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/senior-class-gives-8k-reserved-senior-trip-principal-diagnosed-cancer-335532", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/28/senior-class-gives-8k-reserved-senior-trip-principal-diagnosed-cancer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A high school's senior class in New Hampshire donated the $8,000 for the senior trip to their principal, who was recently diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer.", "title": "HS Seniors Donate Class Trip Money To Principal With Cancer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/senior-class-gives-8k-reserved-senior-trip-principal-diagnosed-cancer-335532", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/28/senior-class-gives-8k-reserved-senior-trip-principal-diagnosed-cancer.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/senior-class-gives-8k-reserved-senior-trip-principal-diagnosed-cancer.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-28T17:10:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:10:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A high school's senior class in New Hampshire donated the $8,000 for the senior trip to their principal, who was recently diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer."}, "article_summary": "Vashaw\u2019s diagnosis coincided with the week before her senior class left for Rydin\u2019 Hi Ranch in New York.\nHigh school seniors around the country look forward to their senior trip.\nAlthough no one told them, the senior class knew they had a decision to make.\nAfter raising around $8,000 over the course of the past four years to fund their senior trip, the class decided there was a better purpose for all that money.\n\u201cEvery one of us has a connection with her, and she has given so much to us that we just wanted to give back,\u201d Christopher Sirois, the senior class president, told WMUR."}
