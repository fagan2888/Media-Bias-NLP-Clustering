And it\u2019s not even close.\n\nNearly 1.6 million Floridians have signed up for or re-upped their private insurance plans for this year through HealthCare.gov, compared with just 1.1 million Texans.\n\nAdvocates, leaders of outreach and enrollment organizations in both states and others who closely follow the health law speculated that Florida may be outperforming Texas in sign-ups for three major reasons.\n\nThe Sunshine State is more compact. It fielded a bigger, centrally managed army of trained helpers. And its GOP leaders haven\u2019t imposed as many roadblocks as Texas\u2019 leaders have.\n\nWhile nearly 60 percent of Floridians eligible to buy policies in the online state exchange actually purchase them, only 36 percent of eligible Texans do, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. Nationally, the take-up rate is 41 percent, it says.\n\nLeading Texas supporters of the Affordable Care Act admit they watch with envy as Florida outpaces other Southern states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just pleasantly surprised Texas is as close to the national average as it is,\u201d said former Texas Medicaid official Anne Dunkelberg, who supports and does research on Obamacare as associate director of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, provides subsidies so individuals and families with low to moderate incomes can buy private coverage in state exchanges.\n\nAcross most insurance markets, the law bars denying people coverage or charging more for pre-existing health conditions. It improved and reduced the cost of prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program for seniors. States were able to add poor adults to their Medicaid program for free for several years and on very generous terms thereafter.\n\nFor nearly six years, Republicans have blasted Obamacare as a misguided, one-size-fits-all attempt to remedy flaws in what they describe as the United States\u2019 high-quality medical care system. Republicans say the law has hurt, not helped, that system. But so far, they\u2019ve been unable to repeal it.\n\nTwo conservative analysts emphasized Florida\u2019s higher median age may be another key factor why the state has outpaced Texas in sign-ups \u2014 40.7 years in the last census vs. 33.6 years in Texas.\n\nJohn Davidson of the Texas Public Policy Foundation said \u201cit makes sense that a state like Florida, with one of the oldest populations in the country, would have more enrollees than Texas, with one of the youngest populations.\u201d\n\nEconomist Devon Herrick of the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis said exchange policies usually carry with them federal subsidies, which would be attractive to early retirees.\n\nIn the federal government\u2019s latest numbers, 49 percent of purchasers in Florida\u2019s exchange were between ages 45 and 64. In Texas, people that age accounted for 44 percent of the buys.\n\nMelissa McChesney, Dunkelberg\u2019s colleague at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, said \u201cthe difference in age distribution of enrollees isn\u2019t huge.\u201d\n\nShe stressed other factors, such as Texas\u2019 sprawling geography and differences in the two states\u2019 nonprofit groups that received federal grants to hire application counselors known as \u201cnavigators.\u201d Texas\u2019 networks have been \u201cpretty fragmented,\u201d she noted.\n\nOther analysts and activists in both states pointed to subtle differences. Florida is further down the road in shedding its rural heritage. It has larger groups of Cuban and Haitian immigrants seeking refugee status, who generally can enroll in Medicaid or buy into the exchanges. Florida has more insurance agents and brokers hawking exchange policies.\n\nSouth Florida cities, including Miami, have seen a proliferation of storefront sign-up locations run by agents and brokers. Many have put up signs or pay people to walk alongside traffic carrying placards.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to Miami, it looks like everybody and their brother is selling Obamacare,\u201d said Annette Raveneau, the national Latino press secretary for Enroll America, a nonprofit with ties to the Obama administration. \u201cYou see signs everywhere, \u2018Obamacare here. Obamacare here.\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen that in any of the cities I\u2019ve traveled to in Texas.\u201d\n\nWith two weeks left to sign up, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has intensified her travel to Texas and Florida because they represent mother lodes of potential enrollees. For years, they topped all other states in percentage of uninsured residents.\n\nLast fall, Burwell made a point of naming Dallas and Houston \u2014 and Miami \u2014among five \u201ctarget cities\u201d for a bigger push. Since then, she has visited Texas four times and Florida, three.\n\nMiami alone, though, has enrolled more than 90 percent of all those signed up in greater Dallas and Houston combined \u2014 though the three metro areas are roughly comparable in population.\n\n\u201cFlorida has less than 75 percent of Texas\u2019 population, crammed into one quarter of our real estate,\u201d said Dunkelberg, the Austin-based analyst who supports the law.\n\nEven before the Affordable Care Act, Texas has been tightfisted and generally unwilling to help pay for public awareness campaigns and application helpers for government health programs, she said. The drought of state funds \u2014 and federal and private financial support \u2014 has especially hurt rural counties, she said.\n\n\u201cSupport for outreach, education and enrollment activities from both federal sources and philanthropy rarely if ever is adjusted to accommodate Texas\u2019 vast geography,\u201d Dunkelberg said.\n\nIn Texas and two other Southern states analyzed by Harvard public health researchers last year, receiving assistance in filling out the applications was the strongest predictor of successful enrollment in coverage \u2014 far bigger than race, sex, level of education and income and whether someone applied online, at a hospital or a state benefits office.\n\nBut Texas, by adding 20 hours of state-prescribed training for the federally paid \u201cnavigators\u201d who help people sign up, went further than Florida in discouraging nonprofit groups from sticking their necks out to try to help the exchanges work, analysts said.\n\n\u201cBoth states are certainly not the warmest politically to the Affordable Care Act, but Texas has put more strenuous requirements on their enrollment assisters than Florida has,\u201d said Jennifer Sullivan, who heads a best practices institute at Enroll America, the group pushing sign-ups across much of the country. \u201cThey\u2019re more intense.\u201d\n\nMimi Garcia, Enroll America\u2019s Texas director, said Texas leaders created a \u201clevel of intimidation\u201d that discouraged groups from paying for fingerprinting, additional background checks, the extra training and fees. That\u2019s created \u201ca certain amount of churn and loss of institutional knowledge,\u201d as a few Texas grant recipients bowed out, she said.\n\nUnited Way of Tarrant County, which was Texas\u2019 biggest recipient of navigator grants the first two years of exchange operations, withdrew last year. Chief executive Tim McKinney acknowledged some of his board members probably dislike the federal law. But he said managing the effort took far more time than expected, as he had to testify at insurance department hearings in Austin and grant scores of media interviews.\n\nFlorida Covering Kids & Families, based in Tampa, has been the chief recipient of navigator grants in that state \u2014 and largest single recipient in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for Medicaid and [Children\u2019s Health and Insurance Program] for 20-something years,\u201d said project director Jodi Ray. \u201cWe were already trusted. We already had relationships with people who were trusted in communities. We didn\u2019t invent the wheel when the first [Obamacare] open enrollment came. We just made it bigger.\u201d\n\nSeveral activists and analysts said Texas\u2019 immigrant population is different from Florida\u2019s and poses big hurdles. The Pew Hispanic Center says 1.65 million Texas residents in 2012 were in the U.S. without permission, compared with 925,000 in Florida. Unauthorized immigrants cannot buy in the exchanges or qualify for Medicaid and CHIP.\n\nGarcia, the Enroll America Texas director, said families that include immigrants in the U.S. illegally and spouses and children who are legal residents often fear to sign up for Obamacare because they must provide the names of everyone in their household \u2014 even though Burwell\u2019s department keeps that information confidential.\n\n\u201cIt keeps people away from looking at what their opportunities are because they\u2019re afraid \u2026 a member of their family might get deported,\u201d she said.\n\nLaura Brennaman, policy and research director for Florida Community Health Action Information Network, a health care advocacy and outreach group, said wariness about deportation is a major stumbling block.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge fear here, but it\u2019s probably bigger there\u201d in Texas, she said.\n\nHispanics and rural residents are among the most difficult people to reach with counseling and information about the exchanges, studies have shown.\n\nIn 2010, Texas was home to more rural residents than any other state \u2014 more than 3.8 million. They accounted for 15 percent of state residents, compared with less than 9 percent in Florida, which had 1.7 million rural people.\n\nBrennaman said there probably are more cities in Florida that lean left politically than in Texas. Obama carried Florida twice, she noted. That makes a difference, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are areas in Florida where we see lots of favorable action, favorable political climates toward the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have that in Texas.\u201d\n\nThree reasons why Florida is outpacing Texas at Obamacare enrollment\n\n1. Density\n\nFlorida has less than three-quarters of the population of Texas, crammed into barely more than one-fifth of Texas\u2019 real estate.\n\n2. Do-gooder history\n\nSince the late 1990s, a nonprofit affiliated with the school of public health at a state university in Tampa has built up expertise and good will as it helped enroll poor children in government health programs. Enjoying statewide reach, it is the main conduit for Obamacare navigator efforts. Texas\u2019 helper networks have been constantly shifting, regional coalitions.\n\n3. Bigger Republican roadblocks\n\nWhile GOP leaders in both states warned that navigators might steal unsuspecting consumers\u2019 personal information to commit identity theft, Texas made things rougher for helper groups. Its insurance regulators imposed 20 hours of additional, state-prescribed navigator training.\n\nBottom line\n\nIn Florida, it\u2019s easier logistically to meet face to face with a greater percentage of the people who need help figuring out health insurance. And the Sunshine State has fielded a bigger, centrally managed army of trained helpers to get the job done.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@RobertTGarrett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fewer system navigators and demographic differences may drive down sign-ups in Lone Star State.", "og": {"description": "Fewer system navigators and demographic differences may drive down sign-ups in Lone Star State.", "title": "Why are so many more Floridians than Texans signing up for Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20160117-why-are-so-many-more-floridians-than-texans-signing-up-for-obamacare.ece", "image": {"width": 790, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160118-0118obamacaretx.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/0118obamacaretx.jpg", "height": 478}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-19T23:19:46Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-18T04:56:04Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Why are so many more Floridians than Texans signing up for Obamacare?\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20160117-why-are-so-many-more-floridians-than-texans-signing-up-for-obamacare.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160118-0118obamacaretx.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/0118obamacaretx.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2616586\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-18T04:56:04Z\", \"section\": \"General News\", \"author\": \"ROBERT T.
