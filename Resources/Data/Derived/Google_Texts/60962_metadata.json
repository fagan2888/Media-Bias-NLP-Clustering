Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned of a \u201cterritorial, social and ethnic apartheid that has developed in our country.\u201d\n\nSome three years ago, Mr. Sarkozy hinted at growing segregation, singling out as the problem segments of a Muslim population that is the largest in Europe, estimated at about 10 percent of France\u2019s 66 million people. He criticized some Muslims for pushing a cultural clash with France by insisting on veiled women and by praying \u201cin an ostentatious way in the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not want on the territory of the French Republic the proliferation of aggressive religion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want, for example, that imams can preach violence.\u201d\n\nAUDIO: Rowan Scarborough with Andy Parks\n\nThat same year, one of France\u2019s leading think tanks, Institut Montaigne, issued a 2,000-page report on the \u201cbanlieues,\u201d the low-income, high-unemployment suburbs where so many French Muslims live around Paris, Lyon, Marseilles and other cities. Led by Gilles Kepel, a leading Arabic authority, the study focused on the Seine-Saint Denis district north of Paris, home to 600,000 Muslims.\n\nThe study wrote of \u201cseparate Islamic societies\u201d parallel to France\u2018s. To describe the district and its residents, it used words such as \u201cisolation,\u201d \u201cwasteland of the deindustrialization,\u201d \u201cradical rejection of France\u201d and \u201cIslamic values of community closure.\u201d\n\nThose warnings took on new urgency this month when three homegrown Muslims extremists, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly, committed mass slayings at a satiric magazine and a kosher Jewish grocery store. The Kouachis had bonded with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Coulibaly had ties to the Islamic State, a particularly violent Sunni Muslim army.\n\nHow did France arrive at a time in history when the word \u201capartheid\u201d is invoked to describe the republic?\n\nSome blame a balky economy that cannot kept up with immigration from France\u2019s former colonies. Some blame French indifference.\n\nAmong the post-massacre debate topics is, to what degree did France, in practice, cede control of poor, majority Muslim neighborhoods \u2014 what some call \u201cno-go zones\u201d \u2014 to a nexus of criminal gangs and hard-line imams.\n\nSome American TV analysts inaccurately stated that all of France\u2019s 700-plus \u201csensitive urban zones\u201d were totally isolated and ruled by harsh Muslim Shariah law, with government consent. That prompted liberal media, on the lookout for \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d to respond that France has no \u201cno go\u201d neighborhoods.\n\nThe problem may be one of definition: Scholars who have studied France\u2019s Islamization say that if \u201cno go\u201d means a neighborhood generally isolated from the rest of France, where police will not always go and where criminal gangs and Islamists wield considerable control, then France indeed has no-go areas.\n\nWhen Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, gave a speech about the dangers of Muslim extremists and warning against no-go zones cropping up in the U.S., liberal media ridiculed him. Some demanded he name the zones in France.\n\nMultiple studies\n\nBut multiple scholars and reporters, on both sides of the Atlantic, have written in detail about the phenomenon.\n\nAndrew Hussey, a British scholar who lives in Paris, last year published \u201cThe French Intifada.\u201d The book chronicles France\u2019s long wars against Arabs in the Middle East, former North African colonies and, now, inside France itself. He calls France a front line in \u201cThe Fourth World War.\u201d\n\nBagneux, one of the notorious banlieues south of Paris and home to Coulibaly, who killed a police woman and four Jewish Frenchmen before he was killed, qualifies as one such zone, Mr. Hussey said.\n\n\u201cThe Tribu Ka are regarded as the real masters of Bagneux,\u201d Mr. Hussey wrote, referring to a black Muslim supremacist gang that now goes by its leader\u2019s name, Generation Kemi Seba.\n\nAs Mr. Hussey and a guide explore the area, he wrote, \u201cwe soon entered a dark labyrinth of grey, crumbling concrete. This was \u2018Darfour City,\u2019 a series of rectangular blocks of mostly boarded-up flats where the local drug dealers gathered. The police call it a \u2018quartier orange,\u2019 largely a no-go area for the police themselves as well as for ordinary citizens.\u201d\n\nAfter riots in 2012 rocked the northern city of Amiens in its largely Muslim northern quarter, Mayor Gilles Demailly, a socialist, said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got gangs of youths playing at being gangsters who have turned the area into a no-go zone. You can no longer order a pizza or get a doctor to come to the house.\u201d\n\nFabrice Balanche, a professor at the University of Lyon, told Swiss TV in September that \u201cmini-Islamic states\u201d coexist in France. He specifically mentioned Marseilles, France\u2019s second-largest city, with a Muslim population estimated at 25 percent.\n\n\u201cThe authority of state is completely absent and therefore mini-Islamic states were formed,\u201d he said.\n\nA Muslim-dominated neighborhood in the southern city of Toulouse also seems to fit the definition of a no-go area.\n\nThe newspaper Le Figaro in May 2012 depicted the neighborhood as one dominated by drugs and guns, home to one of France\u2019s most deadly jihadis, Mohamed Merah. Residents complain that police withdraw at night, foreigners are warned to stay away and municipal offices are vacated \u201cbecause agents have exercised their right of withdrawal.\u201d The mayor called this neighborhood \u201can area of lawlessness.\u201d\n\nThe previous March, Merah, who had traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, armed himself with pistols, got on a scooter and went on a killing spree. His last victims were three children at the Ozar Hatorah Jewish day school. He grabbed one girl by the hair and shot her in the temple.\n\nHe told a TV channel that he killed to \u201cuphold the honor of Islam,\u201d according to press reports. Police killed him after a standoff at his Toulouse apartment.\n\nSoeren Kern is a French-speaking analyst at the Gatestone Institute, a think tank led by former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John R. Bolton. Mr. Kern writes an annual report on the \u201cIslamization of France,\u201d paying particular attention to French press reports, government and think tank research, and official statements.\n\nWhat differentiates France\u2019s Muslim-dominated banlieues from being just \u201cbad neighborhoods,\u201d he said, is the degree of anti-France sentiment as well as the injection of radical Islam ideology, with some pushing Shariah law on the young.\n\nLack of understanding\n\nPress ridicule of Mr. Jindal, he said in a post this month, shows a lack of understanding of what is happening.\n\n\u201cThe problem of no-go zones is well documented, but multiculturalists and their politically correct supporters vehemently deny that they exist,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome are now engaged in a concerted campaign to discredit and even silence those who draw attention to the issue.\u201d\n\nMr. Kern told The Washington Times that bringing up the Muslim problem in France can result in countercharges that one is an \u201cIslamophobe,\u201d or racist, or the far right.\n\n\u201cThe problem is there is a permanent underclass and these kids grow up in these banlieues and they can\u2019t get out. There\u2019s just no hope.\u201d\n\nMr. Kern and other researchers say there is evidence that Muslim extremism is preached inside the banlieues. The fact that an estimated 1,000 French Muslims left the country for the Islamic State is one indication. Just last week, the French government said it would now surveil around 3,000 residents tied to terrorism.\n\nThen there were the open, defiant mass prayers, shutting down intersections and blocking traffic, to which Mr. Sarkozy alluded. They were outlawed in 2012. France also barred the wearing of women\u2019s face-covering niqabs and full-body burkas.\n\nFrance works to keep its public school system rigorously secular. That stance, too, is being tested by Muslims.\n\nIn October, Le Figaro reported on a secret intelligence report under the headline \u201cThe Muslim communalism defies school.\u201d\n\nMr. Kern said \u201ccommunalism\u201d refers to the \u201cpractice of Muslim allegiance to their own ethnic, religious groups rather than to the society at large.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsidiously, the Muslim communalism [is] seeking to gain ground in the French education system\u201d in Muslim-dominated areas, said Le Figaro.\n\nThe intelligence report tells of \u201cchronic absenteeism\u201d of 90 percent during Muslim holidays not recognized by the state, \u201cclandestine prayer in gyms and hallways,\u201d and \u201cyoung guardians of orthodoxy\u201d exerting pressure on Muslim girls.\n\nAs criminal gangs came to dominate neighborhoods in some banlieues, the French government made decisions that, some analysts believe, paved the way for mini-Islamic states within France.\n\nMunicipal officials turned to various Islamic associations to guide rebellious youths and, in return, granted them official recognition, said Clara Beyler, who authored a 2006 Hudson Institute report titled \u201cThe Jihadist Threat in France.\u201d\n\nShe quotes a French Christian preacher as saying the Muslim Youth Association, for example, triggered \u201chardening of religious identities.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther associations held to be non-profit \u2026 were nothing more than terrorist fronts,\u201d Ms. Beyler wrote.\n\nA 2004 book on Islam in France quotes Tokia Saifi, who was secretary of state for durable development, as saying the \u201cfundamental mistake made by the officials\u201d was handing \u201cthe keys of the neighborhood to Islamists\u201d in exchange for peace, such as an end to setting cars on fire.\n\nParis press reports say the government estimates that 30,000 cars were set on fire in 2013 alone as acts of defiance.\n\nIn September 2005, a former French intelligence analyst released his study, \u201cDevelopment of Islam Fundamentalist in France.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rise of radical Islam is largely concentrated in the most sensitive French suburbs,\u201d wrote Eric Denece, who founded the French Center for Intelligence Research. \u201cOver the past three decades, France let its inner cities become real powder kegs. In lawless areas, the fundamentalism has used the failure of the state because it thrives wherever there is frustration.\u201d\n\nHe said Islamists boast that they one day will begin to win local elections and \u201cthey will be free to impose Shariah law in the municipalities under their control.\u201d\n\nHe told of some women giving birth in burqas. Husbands not letting male medical staff touch their wives. Muslim workers demanding increasingly strict religious accommodations.\n\nIn one year alone, the author wrote, France deported seven radical Islamic preachers.\n\nMr. Denece interviewed Muslims and law enforcement authorities. He concluded in 2005 that about 500,000 Muslims in France adhere to hard-line Islam. Perhaps 5,000 are jihadis.\n\n\u2018Explosion in the suburbs\u2019\n\nPredicting an \u201cexplosion in the suburbs,\u201d Mr. Denece proved prescient. A month later, Greater Paris erupted into full-scale riots by mostly Arab and black youths in the banlieues, triggered by a fatal encounter between Muslim youths and French police in Paris.\n\nAngel Rabasa, an analyst at the Rand Corp. who co-authored the book \u201cEurojihad,\u201d said the root cause of Muslim segregation in France is a lack of jobs. France\u2019s economy, he said, is simply not structured to promote large, sustained growth that would create more opportunity for idle immigrant youths.\n\nFrance\u2019s Muslim population is projected to keep growing. The Pew Research Center estimated the count at 4.7 million at the end of 2010, or 7.5 percent. Mr. Kern said that based on Pew\u2019s projections, there are likely over 6 million Muslims in France today, approaching 10 percent of the population.\n\nUnlike the U.S., the French government does not take a census based on ethnic origin or race.\n\nThe lack of jobs leaves young French Arabs of North African origin open to lives of crime and radicalization.\n\n\u201cPrisons are the breeding ground even more so than the neighborhoods,\u201d Mr. Rabasa said. \u201cThat is the relationship because individuals marginalized in the banlieues are the ones who turn to petty crime and then they get arrested and then they get sent to prison and then in prison they get radicalized.\u201d\n\nMr. Hussey, author of \u201cThe French Intifada: The Long War Between France and Its Arabs,\u201d said the government has been blind to the radicalization movement in prisons, whose inmate population he estimates at 70 percent Muslim.\n\nEven from outside the walls, radical Islam can exert control inside.\n\n\u201cIslam in prison has a strange status in France; everybody knows that it is a significant force, but everyone denies it,\u201d Mr. Hussey wrote. \u201cIt is hard to find imams who will work in prisons, for fear of recrimination in their own communities.\u201d\n\nMr. Hussey concludes: \u201cUntil this ceases to be the case, the unacknowledged civil war between France and its disturbed suburbs \u2014 one of the most complex and fragile front lines in the Fourth World War \u2014 will go on. The positions and tactics of the immigrants of the banlieues \u2014 their identification with Palestine, their hatred of France \u2014 reveal the struggle to be part of the \u2018long war,\u2019 just like those caught up in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2011, as the Charlie Hebdo killers were learning their jihadi trade, French President Nicolas Sarkozy told his country that it had suffered a major societal defeat.
