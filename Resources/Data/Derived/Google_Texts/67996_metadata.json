(Photo: The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nTaking \u201cHot Rod Harvest\u201d as its theme, the Harvest Homecoming Festival will officially kick off its 48th year on Oct. 3. That means a parade, carnival rides, four days of booths and food and hundreds of thousands of visitors flooding into New Albany.\n\nThings officially kick off on Oct. 3 with a parade, and Booth Days will run Oct. 8 through 11. The approximately 200 booths offering arts and crafts, food, political candidates, adoptable animals and much more, attract 400,000 to 600,000 visitors each year according to organizer estimates.\n\nWhat started as a three-day pumpkin festival has evolved into a massive event, with activities tied to the festival dotted throughout the area and starting even before the Oct. 3 opening ceremony.\n\nThe Ohio River Greenway 5K Run/Walk and the Culbertson Mansion Coffin Races were held Saturday, and a bicycle tour in Starlight heads out from the Forest Discovery Center Sunday.\n\nOver the years Harvest Homecoming events and activities have come and gone. \u201cThe event\u2019s kind of evolved,\u201d said Jeff Cummins, Harvest Homecoming president. \u201cSome events come and others go away. We don\u2019t do a balloon glow anymore. No-tap bowling was an event we resurrected a couple of years ago and we have a revitalized golf scramble.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year we added the Pumpkin Chunking,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year we have more teams, both youth and adult.\u201d\n\nThe Pumpkin Chunking competition, Oct. 6 at Purdue\u2019s Charlestown Road campus, will see competitors using trebuchets to fire 5- to 16-pound pumpkins. Using gravity, in the form of falling weights, the devices will launch their melon missiles at a target up to 125 yards away.\n\nSome events are just for fun, like the Baby Crawl and Big Wheel Race, while Who Wants to Be a College Student? Will award up to $1,800 in scholarship money to some lucky Floyd County residents.\n\nThe Harvest Homecoming Parade is considered by most to be the official launch of Harvest Homecoming, drawing thousands to watch the parade make its way from New Albany High School to downtown New Albany.\n\n\u201cThe parade\u2019s always been a big deal,\u201d said New Albany Mayor Jeff Gahan, a life-long resident of the city. \u201cEven when I went away to college I would come back for Harvest Homecoming.\u201d\n\nAfter the parade the New Albany Restaurant and Bar Association will be hosting Biers on Parade until 6 p.m. in the Farmers Market Pavilion at Bank and Market Streets. Local food, beer and wine will be featured, including Donum Dei Brewery, Floyd County Brewing Co. and the New Albanian Brewing Co.\n\nRiver City Winery will sell wine, and food will be available from Feast BBQ, Big Four Burgers + Beer, and The Exchange. Proceeds benefit NARBA and charities selected by Harvest Homecoming.\n\nIn keeping with the hot rod theme, a car show will be held October 10 on the New Albany Riverfront. Any type of stock, classic, show or racecar, antique vehicle, truck or motorcycle is welcome.\n\nA number of events geared to children are clustered on Oct. 10, including a Big Wheel race, children\u2019s tractor pull, baby crawl, and Petite Little Miss, Little Master and Little Miss pageants. Kids\u2019 Day in the Tent offers hands-on activities for kids through sixth grade, accompanied by an adult.\n\nFiesta carnival rides run Oct.3 \u2013 11 with hours varying from day to day and ride-all-day passes available for $15 through the Oct. 7.\n\nFood is always a big part of Booth Days, drawing some people in for the doughnuts or caramel apples, others go for the fresh-grilled corn on the cob or chicken and dumplings.\n\n\u201cTypically (visitors) have their favorite foods,\u201d said Jeff Cummins, Harvest Homecoming president. \u201cPork chop sandwiches, rolled oysters, cobblers, chicken and noodles. Everybody has their favorites they go to as soon as we open.\n\nThe doughnut booth manned by the Masonic Lodge is arguably the most popular, with long lines forming even before they open each day. Those that don\u2019t want to wait for booth days for their doughnut fix can get an early taste during the parade. \u201cThey set up out front that day,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cThe parade runs right past the lodge.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, Harvest Homecoming is obviously a community kind of thing,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cSome people argue against it, some just love it. But it\u2019s a good atmosphere for everybody. You can\u2019t say that too much anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around the state, to all the burgs and all the villes,\u201d said Gahan. \u201cThey ask about Harvest Homecoming and what makes it work. I always say I\u2019m not sure exactly how it works, but I know it has a lot to do with the enthusiasm of the volunteers.\u201d\n\nHARVEST HOMECOMING EVENTS\n\nVarious locations.
