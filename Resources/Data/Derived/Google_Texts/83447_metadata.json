In January a majority of Americans, 51%, favored all or most of ObamaCare.\n\nToday, only 39% do.\n\nFully 57% now oppose all or most of ObamaCare,according to the new survey.\n\nMuch of the growing unpopularity is blamed on further blows to the weak economy attributed to requirements of Obama\u2019s health measure, such as employers cutting back hiring and work hours to get beneath the 30-hour requirement to provide employee coverage.\n\nFrom a political point of view, Obama is relatively immunized from the growing disapproval since he\u2019s done with elections. Still, public approval of his healthcare policies continues to wane. Forty-two percent now approve of his job in that area, down from 44% in April.\n\nDuring the same time period, those disapproving of his healthcare work grew slightly from 55% to 56%.\n\nBut the growing unpopularity of ObamaCare could present a real threat to Democrats\u2019 chances of holding the Senate and regaining the House in next year\u2019s midterm elections. At his numerous fundraisers for that cycle, Obama has proclaimed that restoring Nancy Pelosi to the House Speakership is a key political goal.\n\nHis party paid a heavy price for its obedience to his requests to vote to approve ObamaCare. Democrats lost more House seats then than in any midterm since pre-World War II. Historically, a president\u2019s party loses additional seats in his second term midterm balloting.\n\nWhat\u2019s especially surprising though is where ObamaCare\u2019s support is fading the furthest fastest.\n\n\u201cSupport has dropped in virtually all demographic categories,\u201d CNN found, \u201cbut it has fallen the farthest among two core Democratic groups \u2014 women and Americans who make less than $50,000.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nFor a healthy laugh on ObamaCare, watch this\n\nTurns out, you can\u2019t really keep your healthcare plan if you like it\n\nObama promised healthcare premiums would drop $2,500; Fact: They\u2019re up $3,000", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama acknowledges there are some glitches as his massive ObamaCare reorganization launches.
