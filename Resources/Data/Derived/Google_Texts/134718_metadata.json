For example, in 2013-14, the NHL\u2019s pay cap was $12.8 million. After a player paid at that rate subtracts taxes, take-home pay could vary from $5.8 million in California to $7.8 million in Alberta.\n\n\u201cIs living in California worth a $2 million dollar pay cut?\u201d the report asked.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nThe purpose of this report is to show the impact that taxes\u2014personal income taxes in particular\u2014have on labour mobility. While the numbers are more extreme with NHL players, the concept is the same for millions of North American families. Jurisdictions with high taxes will continue to lose the most talented, highly-skilled citizens to lower tax jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cIf high tax rates make it more difficult to attract free-agents in the NHL, it\u2019s not a stretch to believe it\u2019s also hard to attract other highly skilled workers,\u201d said Canadian Taxpayers Federation Federal Director Aaron Wudrick. \u201cGovernments need to keep that in mind when they\u2019re considering the impact of tax rates on attracting top talent.\u201d\n\nSome highlights of the report include:", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the report, \u201c57 percent of unrestricted free agents who moved teams went to teams with lower taxes.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "According to the report, \u201c57 percent of unrestricted free agents who moved teams went to teams with lower taxes.\u201d", "title": "How Taxes Leave Some NHL Teams at a Disadvantage for Hockey\u2019s Top Players", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven6624562.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zCRSpB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "According to the report, \u201c57 percent of unrestricted free agents who moved teams went to teams with lower taxes.\u201d", "title": "How Taxes Leave Some NHL Teams at a Disadvantage for Hockey\u2019s Top Players", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven6624562.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2014-11-19T13:57:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hockey, National Hockey League, NHL, taxes, tax rates, personal income tax"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe34b3\"", "article_summary": "A new study suggests that another factor is the personal income tax rate based on the team\u2019s location.\n\u201cObviously, there are other factors at play besides taxes, but the fact remains that disparities in tax rates leave some teams at a major disadvantage.\u201dThe \u201cdisparities\u201d in tax rates do vary widely among the states and provinces where NHL teams are located.\nThe joint study between the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and Americans for Tax Reform examined team spending on salaries and the tax rate in the team\u2019s Canadian province or U.S. state to determine a player\u2019s after-tax pay.\n\u201cGovernments need to keep that in mind when they\u2019re considering the impact of tax rates on attracting top talent.\u201dSome highlights of the report include:\nWhile the numbers are more extreme with NHL players, the concept is the same for millions of North American families."}
