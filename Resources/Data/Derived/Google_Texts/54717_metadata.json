It\u2019s a question that was raised against Stephen Colbert when he generated laughs by using Asian stereotypes, launching the #CancelColbert on Twitter. The hashtag movement that was largely dismissed as frivolous, however, because the target in the case was clear: racism of the Redskin name, and the obvious offensiveness of an Asian name joke mocked the ignorance of the Redskins owner. But on Tuesday night, \u201cColbert\u201d did turn in on itself with a segment highlighting sex reassignment surgeries that are now covered by Medicare.\n\nColbert jumps the gun, assuming that his liberal audience is on-board with trans-inclusive healthcare and understands the importance of the surgeries themselves, as well as the policy change. \u201cEven more disturbing than the idea of Nana and Pee-Pop playing Mr. Potatohead downtown is that it violates the tacit agreement we have reached with the transgender community,\u201d Colbert jokes, \u201cI agree to be totally cool with it \u2014 which I clearly am [footage of his interview with trans activist Janet Mock], which Time Magazine clearly is, and which all the people lobbying for this transgendered woman [Carmen Carrera] to be a Victoria\u2019s Secret model clearly are \u2014 as long as you are hot.\u201d\n\nColbert is attempting to move to another phase of the trans movement, working on getting trans people who might not look as flawless as Cox, Carrera and Mock do, in front of the camera. But his jokes rely on the conceit that society is on the same page about trans people as he is \u2014 Colbert may get it, Time may get it, some people on the Internet get it. But Time also declared the issue \u201cAmerica\u2019s next civil rights frontier,\u201d implying that there is still a significant struggle ahead for trans people to gain mainstream acceptance. Most media outlets and personalities are still getting the framing of basic trans issues wrong (even within \u201cColbert\u201d\u2013the preferred term within the trans community is \u201csex reassignment,\u201d not \u201csex-change\u201d surgery), while companies are issuing transphobic ads like this, without understanding why they\u2019re offensive. We\u2019re talking about a community who faces significantly higher rates of bullying, violence and suicide than the general public. So it\u2019s not safe to assume, yet, that even Colbert\u2019s liberal-leaning audience really, truly \u201cgets it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberal America is not as accepting of the trans community as the comedian thinks it is VIDEO", "author": "Prachi Gupta", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Liberal America is not as accepting of the trans community as the comedian thinks it is VIDEO", "title": "Why \u201cThe Colbert Report\u2019s\u201d segment on sex reassignment surgery falls flat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/04/why_the_colbert_reports_segment_on_sex_reassignment_surgery_falls_flat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-04-at-11.16.33-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liberal America is not as accepting of the trans community as the comedian thinks it is VIDEO", "creator": "@prachigu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-04-at-11.16.33-AM.png", "title": "Why \u201cThe Colbert Report\u2019s\u201d segment on sex reassignment surgery falls flat", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why \u201cThe Colbert Report\u2019s\u201d segment on sex reassignment surgery falls flat", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #cancelcolbert, carmen carrera, colbert report, Comedy, janet mock, laverne cox, Medicare, Satire, sex-change surgery, trans issues, transgender community, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5d4\"", "article_summary": "But on Tuesday night, \u201cColbert\u201d did turn in on itself with a segment highlighting sex reassignment surgeries that are now covered by Medicare.\nIt\u2019s a question that was raised against Stephen Colbert when he generated laughs by using Asian stereotypes, launching the #CancelColbert on Twitter.\nWe\u2019re talking about a community who faces significantly higher rates of bullying, violence and suicide than the general public.\nMost media outlets and personalities are still getting the framing of basic trans issues wrong (even within \u201cColbert\u201d\u2013the preferred term within the trans community is \u201csex reassignment,\u201d not \u201csex-change\u201d surgery), while companies are issuing transphobic ads like this, without understanding why they\u2019re offensive.\nSo it\u2019s not safe to assume, yet, that even Colbert\u2019s liberal-leaning audience really, truly \u201cgets it.\u201d"}
