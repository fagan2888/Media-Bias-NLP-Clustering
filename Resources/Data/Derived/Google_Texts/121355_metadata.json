Because various occupations were excluded, only about half of American workers were covered. In particular, approximately two out of three African Americans were not covered, a percentage that rose to three out of four in parts of the South. The NAACP initially criticized the law as \u201ca sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.\u201d Not exactly universal.\n\nIt's worth noting that welfare (originally called \"Aid to Dependent Children\" and created by the Social Security Act) similarly excluded blacks at the outset, i.e., under FDR. The fact that there was significant local control over how these programs were administered especially hurt Southern blacks. A study by Richard Sterner (cited here by Ira Katznelson) found that, in Georgia, just over 14 percent of eligible whites got aid compared to 1.5 percent of eligible blacks.\n\nHere's the other point worth making: From 1935 to 1938, when the Social Security Act became law, FDR had what Emory sociology professor Alexander Hicks described as \"rare, non-Southern Democrat majorities\u2014270 non-Southern Democrat representatives and 71 non-Southern Democrat senators\" backing his Second New Deal. Although African Americans certainly benefited from the New Deal in many ways, one can ask whether FDR could have done more to ensure equal treatment. That's a polite way to ask that question. We can certainly say that the New Deal was not applied, to return to Michael Lind's point, in a \"universal\" way. We'll never know how white working-class voters, in particular those in the South, would have reacted to FDR had it been.\n\nIn 1965 LBJ passed Medicare. It didn't exactly guarantee Democratic dominance in subsequent decades. This leads to the larger point that pushes back against Lind's argument. The Democratic Party didn't abandon the white working class, nor did the white working class abandon the Democratic Party. The Southern white working class abandoned the Democratic Party, and they did so because of civil rights, and they continue to do so because of race and other cultural/social issues on which the South diverges from the rest of the country. If you haven't read Elisabeth Jacobs' study on the politics and voting patterns of the American white working class, you should:\n\n\n\nOn average, Democratic presidential candidates prospects with self-identified white working class voters have diminished somewhat over time. ... Yet, the downward trend in Democratic presidential vote choice between 1956 and 2008 is concentrated amongst the Southern white working class. ... White working class presidential party vote choice for non-Southerners is remarkably stable over time; if anything, the period between 1984 and 2008 has been one of improvement for the Democrats amongst this group. The opposite is true in the South. Prior to the 1960s rights revolutions (including, most notably for the South, the major upheavals of the Civil Rights Movement), a strong majority of the Southern white working class voted for Democratic candidates. Southern white working class voting appears to have settled into a basic equilibrium with Reagan\u2019s 1984 election, with the notable exception of an uptick for Clinton\u2019s first election in 1992, and again for Obama\u2019s 2008 election gambit.... Third, and perhaps most importantly because it is so often overlooked in\n\npopular analysis, the defection of the white South from the Democratic Party plays\n\na central role in driving the overarching story of white working class politics. As\n\nBartels succinctly summarizes: \u201cDemocratic presidential vote share has declined\n\nby almost 20 percentage points among [S]outhern whites without college degrees.\n\nAmong non-southern whites without college degrees, it has declined by one\n\npercentage point. That\u2019s it. Fourteen elections, 52 years, one percentage point.\u201d\n\nThe same basic relationship holds across all income groups of non-college educated\n\nwhites: a 20-point-gap between the South and the rest of the country.\n\nThis is Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern Strategy come to life, not a widespread national\n\ndefection of white working class voters from the Democratic Party. Case in point:\n\nin 2008, Obama won 54 percent of whites with incomes under $50,000 outside of\n\nthe South, while he secured just 35 percent of this group in the South.\n\nIt is important to note that these are presidential election years, and the 2010 midterms went a different way for Democrats. Of course, other mid-term elections have not been bad at all for Democrats in recent decades. Furthermore, it doesn't make sense to ignore the stark difference between the non-Southern and Southern white working class vote in presidential years, and put this all on the general so-called abandonment of the white working class. The numbers are simply too strong.\n\nTo return to the broader argument of Lind and others who contrast Obama to FDR and LBJ, he criticizes Obamacare because it is not \"universal\" like Social Security and Medicare, and suggests this is why working-class whites aren't responding by voting Democratic. First of all, Social Security and Medicare are aimed at a population that is not expected to be working, a significant difference from the population at which Obamacare is aimed. But that's irrelevant, critics say\u2014why didn't he fight for single-payer?\n\nGreat question. I support single-payer. I believe single-payer is preferable to Obamacare. But before we condemn Obama for not passing it and criticize him as falling short where FDR and LBJ succeeded, let's remember some facts. As I cited previously, FDR had huge Democratic majorities. LBJ had majorities almost as large, and, as this memo makes clear, a filibuster of Medicare was not even a possibility, as opponents would not have considered one. President Obama's \"filibuster-proof\" majority of 60 senators included \"Democrats\" like Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman\u2014the latter of whom promised to filibuster the whole package if it included a public option, let alone single-payer. Single-payer never even stood a chance. Finally, a review of a large number of polls shows that single-payer is not that popular compared to private health insurance. That surprised me, frankly.\n\nAnd here's the other thing to remember about Obamacare and Social Security: Social Security is a hell of a lot better program in 2014 than it was in 1935, as I've described above. Well, if Social Security improved, maybe Obamacare will as well. Noam Scheiber has predicted, in fact, that it will ultimately pave the way toward single payer. But the thing is, you know who else\u2014in addition to Barack Obama\u2014failed to pass single-payer, universal health care? FDR and LBJ. And Harry Truman, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. So maybe Obama's not such a bad liberal after all.\n\nMy point here isn't to talk down FDR and LBJ, but rather to counter the idea that Obama \"failed\" in comparison. Lind's larger point\u2014that Democrats should embrace liberal, populist positions that would appeal to the white working class that too often votes Republican\u2014is totally right. But the idea that Obama failed where the great liberals succeeded (you should see the things those who criticized FDR from his left called him), and that that's why white working class voters aren't voting for Democrats, just doesn't hold water.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Social Security is tremendously important.
