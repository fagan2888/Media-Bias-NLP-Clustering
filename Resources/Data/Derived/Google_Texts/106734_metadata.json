It gained attention because McNealy chose Denver as Wayin\u2019s headquarters instead of California, where he lives.\n\nOver the years, Wayin has raised at least $33.5 million from investors. But it also has changed its focus. It currently helps customers promote and measure their social networking activity.\n\nThe management change is the result of \u201ctremendous growth in the past two years\u201d and looking to the future, according to Jordan Slabaugh, Wayin\u2019s vice president of marketing.\n\n\u201cAfter leading Wayin through a momentous stage during her tenure as CEO, Elaine and the board of directors agreed the time was right to bring in a leader with the experience to take Wayin to the next level. We\u2019re confident that we have all the right pieces in place to get Wayin to the next level and are extremely grateful for Elaine\u2019s contributions,\u201d Slabaugh said.\n\n\u201cScott\u2019s previous experience in leading aggressive expansion of enterprise companies in the technology space, paired with his involvement on the board, made him the obvious choice as a leader in this next phase.\u201d\n\nMcNealy isn\u2019t moving to Denver but expects to be in the office frequently. He will be the keynote speaker for the Colorado Venture Summit in June. The company employs 55 people.\n\nTamara Chuang: 303-954-1209, tchuang@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Gadgetress", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sun Microsystems founder Scott McNealy takes over as CEO of Wayin", "title": "Sun Microsystems founder Scott McNealy takes over as CEO of Wayin", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/22/sun-microsystems-founder-scott-mcnealy-takes-over-as-ceo-of-wayin/", "image": {"width": 265, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150522__20150523_A20_BZ23WAYIN1p1.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150522__20150523_A20_BZ23WAYIN1p1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-22T15:24:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T04:34:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22b0\"", "article_summary": "McNealy, who co-founded Sun Microsystems, started Wayin in 2011 as an aggregator of social media content for companies.\nWayin replaced chief executive Elaine Feeney with its co-founder and chairman, Scott McNealy, the company confirmed Friday.\nThe management change is the result of \u201ctremendous growth in the past two years\u201d and looking to the future, according to Jordan Slabaugh, Wayin\u2019s vice president of marketing.\nIt gained attention because McNealy chose Denver as Wayin\u2019s headquarters instead of California, where he lives.\n\u201cAfter leading Wayin through a momentous stage during her tenure as CEO, Elaine and the board of directors agreed the time was right to bring in a leader with the experience to take Wayin to the next level."}
