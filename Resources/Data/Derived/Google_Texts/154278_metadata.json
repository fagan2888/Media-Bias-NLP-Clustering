Obamacare) would receive medical treatment, when there is a shortage of primary care providers, including nurse practitioners?\n\nThe state is working with the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, to understand the impact more insured New Yorkers will have on the demand for medical services, Frescatore said. People who previously lacked health insurance did not go entirely without medical care, she told the hundreds in the audience Friday morning \u2014 though they may choose to access services differently once they have coverage. The state expects 1.1 million New Yorkers, most of them currently uninsured, to enroll in new health insurance plans within the next three years.\n\nAre nurse practitioners included among primary care providers, another attendee wanted to know, through the new state-run health insurance market?\n\nMore Information\n\nThe insurance plans offered through the market, called NY State of Health, are through private companies, Frescatore said. They must meet requirements to have an adequate network of health providers, but how they do that is up to the companies, not the state.\n\nFrescatore, who serves as executive director of NY State of Health, provided the nurse practitioners with an overview of the online market, which launched Oct. 1. The market, also called a health exchange, was established to meet requirements of Obamacare, including that most Americans get insurance coverage or pay a penalty.\n\nSome questions posed to Frescatore revealed that even those in medical professions continue to have basic questions about the 2010 law and its implementation in New York.\n\nOne asked whether her patients should try to use the federal health exchange, Healthcare.gov, that was the subject of a national address Monday by President Barack Obama, responding to criticism over technical problems that continue to plague that site. Frescatore explained that NY State of Health is the exchange that New York residents who do not have insurance should use. Healthcare.gov is meant for residents of 34 other states that did not establish their own exchange.\n\nNY State of Health is operating smoothly now, after some technical problems following its launch, Frescatore said. There continue to be what she termed \"isolated incidents\" of trouble verifying users' identity.\n\nAs of midweek, 174,000 New Yorkers had been deemed eligible to enroll in insurance plans through the site, according to the state Health Department. More than 37,000 of them had actually enrolled, representing more than a third of all Americans who have used exchanges nationwide to do so.\n\nTechnicians continue to work on improvements to the site each night, Frescatore said.\n\nchughes@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5417 \u2022 @hughesclaire", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "At the Nurse Practitioner Association's annual conference Friday at the Saratoga Hilton and City Center, their questions to speaker Donna Frescatore, the state's assistant deputy secretary for health, revealed concerns over their position in an industry undergoing profound change.
