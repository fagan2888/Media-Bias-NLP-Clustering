More than a month later, Talmadge, who lives Lancaster, Texas, is still waiting to receive a bill from her insurers, Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Texas, so that she can pay for the policy and receive her insurance card.\n\n\u201cI will pay that invoice the day that I get it,\u201d Candace says. \u201cI just haven\u2019t gotten it. So I can go to the doctor and tell him I have signed up for insurance, but I can\u2019t prove it to him.\u201d\n\nTalmadge isn\u2019t the only person in \u201cinsurance limbo.\u201d Friday was supposed to be the deadline for consumers to pay for insurance they signed up for by Dec. 24 that would kick in retroactively on January 1. Insurers have said that they\u2019re struggling to get many enrollees to actually pay their premiums, but experts say that the gap between the number of people who have enrolled and the number of people who have paid also reflects a backlog by insurers who were not prepared for the crush of consumers who in late December, after the administration repeatedly pushed back the enrollment deadline from the original December 15 date.\n\nWhile there are no national figures yet detailing how many enrollees have actually paid their premiums, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the gap between those who have enrolled and those who have paid ranged from less than 50 percent in Michigan and Illinois to more than 80 percent in Arizona. Further complicating the calculation, several large insurers have extended the deadline for payment through the end of the month.\n\nRelated: The Obamacare \u2018Shotgun Wedding\u2019\u2014Marry or Lose Your Home\n\nThe disastrous rollout of the exchanges meant that nearly half of the 2.1 million people who signed up between October 1 and December 24, did so in December. Plus, even when the site\u2019s interface began working for consumers, problems with the back-end meant that the insurers still weren\u2019t seamlessly receiving the applications via the government Web sites. Since it takes a few weeks for an insurer to process an application in normal times, insurers are still plodding through a backlog of submissions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to have this kind of retro-activity in health insurance,\u201d says Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research organization. \u201cThere certainly are people out there who have insurance but don\u2019t have any way to prove it.\u201d\n\nLevitt concedes that some consumers may also have signed up for insurance but have since decided that they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to pay the premiums required for the coverage to kick in.\n\nConsumers who have signed up for insurance but haven\u2019t received an invoice should contact their insurer to see if they can pay directly for the coverage. \u201cIf things get lost or crossed in the mail, you\u2019re still responsible for making the payment,\u201d says Carrie McLean of eHealth. \u201cUntil the money has been withdrawn from your account, you don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, people who have already paid their premiums still haven\u2019t received their insurance cards. Those consumers should call their insurers and ask for a policy number, which their doctor can use to process a claim even without a physical card.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown how many of the 2.1 million people who have enrolled in the exchanges were previously uninsured, and how many had received cancellation notices under the new law. Uninsured Americans have until March 31 to get coverage, or they\u2019ll face a penalty of $95 per person or 1 percent of yearly income, whichever is higher.\n\nRelated: Why Divorce Attorneys Will Love Obamacare\n\nAdministration officials have stressed that the number of people who enroll in the health exchanges matters less than who is enrolling. In order to function properly, the exchanges need to sign up healthy, typically young Americans in order to offset the cost of premiums for older, sicker individuals who tend to rack up higher medical bills. Yesterday, the administration said that 24 percent of enrollees are aged 18-34.\n\nThat\u2019s short of the 40 percent that the Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated would keep the market stable, but if it holds through the end of March, there should be only a modest impact on premiums, Levitt says. He doesn\u2019t expect the premium-payment gap to have a significant impact on lasting rollout of the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much a short-term problem,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people might fall through the cracks, but given that there are still two-and-a-half months left in open enrollment, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a huge issue.\u201d\n\nTop reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Many consumers who signed up for Obamacare haven\u2019t yet paid their premiums.
