More than 4,563,000 passengers passed through DIA in May, up from 4,470,000 in May 2013.\n\nThe year-to-date totals are also up 2.1 percent over the same period in 2013.\n\n\u201cSouthwest and Frontier both saw strong increases in origin and destination traffic while United saw an acceleration in connecting traffic \u2014 all of which helped fuel two consecutive months of record-setting passenger traffic at Denver International Airport,\u201d airport CEO Kim Day said in a news release.\n\nPerhaps, but Denver-based Frontier Airlines stole the show for May traffic. After Frontier\u2019s traffic at DIA plummeted 14.4 percent in 2013 \u2014 largely because of the carrier\u2019s scaling back of its flight offerings \u2014 the carrier\u2019s traffic spiked in May by 6.2 percent over the same month a year ago.\n\nIt is the first reported data since Frontier changed its business model from a low-cost carrier to an ultra-low-cost carrier at the end of April.\n\n\u201cThis growth is primarily attributable to the continuing evolution of our business into an ultra-low-cost carrier,\u201d said Tyri Squyres, Frontier\u2019s vice president of marketing. \u201cBy offering a new, very low fare product, we are able to stimulate new demand for travel amongst current customers as well as discover a new audience who previously could not afford air travel.\u201d\n\nJanuary and April saw record traffic at DIA.\n\nMeanwhile, United Airlines saw a 1.8 percent increase while Southwest Airlines\u2019 overall traffic decreased less than 1 percent.\n\n\u201cInternational traffic at DIA also continues to strongly outpace previous years, and May signaled the start of the peak season for transatlantic travel,\u201d Day said.\n\n\u201cWe remain on pace to have a very strong year as we enter the height of the busy summer travel season.\u201d\n\nInternational passenger traffic increased by 18.8 percent over May 2013, a month before United launched its Denver-to-Tokyo route.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver airport logs 3rd record-setting month for passenger traffic", "title": "Denver airport logs 3rd record-setting month for passenger traffic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/02/denver-airport-logs-3rd-record-setting-month-for-passenger-traffic/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130627__Denver-International-Airport-DIAp1-8.jpg", "height": 397}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130627__Denver-International-Airport-DIAp1-8.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-02T12:50:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:56:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Denver International Airport saw its busiest May ever \u2014 the third month in 2014 to set a record for the number of passengers using the airport.\nMeanwhile, United Airlines saw a 1.8 percent increase while Southwest Airlines\u2019 overall traffic decreased less than 1 percent.\n\u201cSouthwest and Frontier both saw strong increases in origin and destination traffic while United saw an acceleration in connecting traffic \u2014 all of which helped fuel two consecutive months of record-setting passenger traffic at Denver International Airport,\u201d airport CEO Kim Day said in a news release.\nPerhaps, but Denver-based Frontier Airlines stole the show for May traffic.\nOverall traffic increased by 2.1 percent in May compared with the same month in 2013."}
