He was very straightforward about his conception of \u201cchange\u201d long before he was even thought of as a contender for the White House.\n\nObama and \u201cDistributive Justice\u201d\n\nFor example, way back in September of 2001 when he was an Illinois State Senator, in an interview with Chicago public radio station WBEZ, he was asked about the achievements and challenges of the Civil Rights Movement in America.\n\nObama said that the Supreme Court had focused on \u201ccourt-imposed remedies regarding segregation and voting rights.\u201d But, he went on, \u201cthe Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth and sort of more basic issues of political and economic justice in society.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court, Obama went on, \u201cdidn\u2019t break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution, at least as it has been interpreted.\u201d And, thus, the Court \u201cwasn\u2019t that radical.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Civil Rights Movement never \u201cput together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive change.\u201d\n\nIt was clear that Obama thought that the next \u201cprogressive\u201d phase of \u201cchange\u201d for America needed to be precisely in the direction of greater \u201cdistributive justice.\u201d And that, of course, required an increasingly more intrusive hand of government in the economic, financial and personal affairs of the citizenry.\n\nSocialism as \u201cReal Freedom\u201d\n\nDuring the heyday of communism in the 20th century, socialist governments in the Soviet bloc often formally called their systems \u201cPeople\u2019s Republics.\u201d For instance, South Korea is the \u201cRepublic of Korea.\u201d But North Korea is the \u201cDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\u201d\n\nWhy the difference? Because in the eyes of socialists and communists Western democracies were not really \u201cfree.\u201d They argued that what prevailed in the West were false \u201cbourgeois freedoms\u201d \u2013 freedom of speech and press, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and association, and freedom to vote and elect people to political office, and freedom to own and use private property.\n\n\u201cReal freedom,\u201d socialists said, could only come with the end of capitalism and its system of profit-based exploitation of the workers by greedy, self-interested capitalists. The democratic systems of the West were merely political shams used to dupe the masses into a \u201cfalse consciousness\u201d to passively accept their oppression by the ruling capitalist class.\n\nOnly under socialism and communism would \u201cthe workers\u201d \u2013 the broad masses of the population \u2013 have that \u201ctrue freedom\u201d through the common ownership of the means of production and through redistribution of wealth from the immoral and unjust hands of \u201cthe rich\u201d to the deserving and needy toiling laborers and the poor.\n\nTrue democracies were \u201cPeople\u2019s Democracies\u201d and \u201cPeople\u2019s Republics\u201d where the economy was controlled by the government \u2013 in the name of the people and for their benefit, of course \u2013 and redistributive justice (\u201csocial justice\u201d) assured that each received what they \u201crightly\u201d deserved.\n\nFrom Socialist Planning to the Welfare State\n\nIn the post-World War II period, socialists in Western Europe were forced, slowly but surely, to give up on the ideal of government direct ownership and central planning of industry and agriculture. Socialism\u2019s economic inefficiencies and experienced political abuse, corruption and brutal tyranny as witnessed in the Soviet bloc countries became too clear to too many people in Western society for it to remain a shinning ideal for Western socialists to espouse.\n\nWhat the Social Democrats in Western Europe retreated to was the interventionist-welfare state. To have \u201csocial justice,\u201d they argued, it was not necessary for the government to fully nationalize industry and all other economic activity. It is sufficient for the government to \u201ctame\u201d capitalism through a spider\u2019s web of controls, regulations, and commands; and to use the tax system to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor and the deserving middle class, and to establish a network of \u201csocial safety nets\u201d such as social security, national health care, public housing, and state subsidization of all education.\n\nThis is basically the ideal that Barack Obama, from all his public statements, clearly has long believed in and wanted to see expanded beyond the extent to which they are already practiced in America. Thus, he wants to use the tax system to \u201cspread the wealth\u201d and apply the regulatory powers of the government to more forcefully manage and direct the economic affairs of the citizenry \u2013 all for a particular interpretation of the \u201ccommon good,\u201d of course.\n\nObama\u2019s criticism of the Supreme Court in 2001 goes back to the fact that the Constitution of the United States was designed to secure people in their individual rights to life, liberty, and honestly acquired property. It was not designed to micromanage the population\u2019s personal, social, and economic affairs, and redistribute wealth from some who are designated \u201cthe rich\u201d to others labeled \u201cthe poor.\u201d\n\nKarl Marx and Obama\u2019s Belief System\n\nSo is Barack Obama a \u201csocialist\u201d? In November of 2013, while on a three-day campaign trip to raise money for Democratic Party candidates, the president said that he was \u201cnot a particularly ideological person,\u201d but that he was passionate about his \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d about how to achieve them.\n\nBut what are those \u201cvalues\u201d that arouse his \u201cpassion\u201d for the achievement of which he is willing to be \u201cpractical\u201d? In July 2013, Obama said in a speech, \u201cIf you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help . . . If you\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen.\u201d\n\nUnderlying this statement is a fundamental belief that all that the individual might achieve and enjoy is due not to his own creative ability or determination and work, but to the efforts of the others in the \u201ccollective\u201d to which he belongs. He therefore owes everything to \u201cthe group\u201d and therefore any wealth and material comfort that he might enjoy is really a \u201cdebt\u201d that he owes to all those others in the society in which he lives.\n\nThe idea that an individual has \u201cearned\u201d that wealth and material comfort as a result of his own mind and efforts is an illusion, and if he is allowed to have any of that wealth or material well-being he should accept that fact that it is only at the \u201cpleasure\u201d of the collective others in society.\n\nHence, every successful businessman and entrepreneur should realize that all that he claims to be his own is really \u201cunearned income\u201d \u2013 a category even embedded in the tax code.\n\nHere, again, is the ghost of Karl Marx who defined \u201cproductive labor\u201d as the material output resulting from the physical effects of \u201cthe workers.\u201d The businessman was an \u201cexploiter\u201d who demanded a portion of the workers\u2019 output as the \u201cprice\u201d for letting them use the machines and tools in the factory that he unjustly declared to be his private property.\n\nThus, the businessman \u201cdid not build it.\u201d The workers did. And his profits, rent, and dividends are a measure of the degree to which he has \u201cexploited\u201d and \u201cstolen\u201d from the real producers, \u201cthe workers\u201d on the shop floor.\n\nDenying the Creative Mind Behind All that is Built\n\nFrom whose accumulated savings came the resources to build the factory or business, and to pay the workers their salaries until the work was done and a product was ready for sale? From whose creative mind and imagination came the idea of how to build it, and for the manufacturing of what goods to satisfy the demands of others in society in their role as consumers? From whose entrepreneurial spirit came the willingness and character to bear the uncertainty of whether a profit might be earned or a loss suffered in the competition of the market place?\n\nThese questions were irrelevant to Karl Marx and seem to be equally unimportant to Barack Obama. The only thing that matters is to find the \u201cpractical\u201d political means to tax and regulate the capitalist creators so to fulfill those \u201cvalues\u201d of redistribution and the equalizing of outcomes. After all, in Obama\u2019s eyes it really does not belong to those from whom it is taken.\n\nThis is the false and insidious idea: that the individual is really nothing and the collective everything; and that the creative mind that imagines what might be done is less important than the physical work that reflects the implementation of the creative idea.\n\nThis is the idea behind the socialist conception of man, society, and government. And it is the basis of the \u201cvalues\u201d that guide the policies and \u201cpractical\u201d politics of the current occupant of the White House.\n\n[Originally published on Epic Times]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/barack-obama-and-the-meaning-of-socialism/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Communist-Party.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Barack Obama and the Meaning of Socialism"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd94d\"", "article_summary": "True democracies were \u201cPeople\u2019s Democracies\u201d and \u201cPeople\u2019s Republics\u201d where the economy was controlled by the government \u2013 in the name of the people and for their benefit, of course \u2013 and redistributive justice (\u201csocial justice\u201d) assured that each received what they \u201crightly\u201d deserved.\nThese questions were irrelevant to Karl Marx and seem to be equally unimportant to Barack Obama.\nTo have \u201csocial justice,\u201d they argued, it was not necessary for the government to fully nationalize industry and all other economic activity.\nIn July 2013, Obama said in a speech, \u201cIf you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help .\nThis is basically the ideal that Barack Obama, from all his public statements, clearly has long believed in and wanted to see expanded beyond the extent to which they are already practiced in America."}
