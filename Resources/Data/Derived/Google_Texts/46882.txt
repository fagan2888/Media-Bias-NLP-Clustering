Yet the recovery in the job market is still somewhat lopsided. In many industries, hiring is strongest for low-pay, low-skill positions — think retail clerk and hotel housekeeper — and for jobs that require technical skills, according to D'Arcy of Indeed. For many tech-related jobs, there aren't enough qualified candidates to fill the growing number of positions.



Computer- and math-related occupations, such as computer scientist and software-developer jobs, represented nearly 8.5 percent of Indeed's listings in 2014, but they generated only about 5.5 percent of job-seeker interest (as measured by clicks on the site) last year.

Sectors whose performance is highly correlated with the economic cycle have seen some of the strongest levels of job growth over the past year.

In August — the most recent month for which data is available — Indeed listings in the construction, retail, hospitality and real estate sectors rose by 18 percent, 28 percent, 34 percent and 37 percent, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.
