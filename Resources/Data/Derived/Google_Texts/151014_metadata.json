Even Obama still agrees that most of what Iran does in its foreign policy is still problematic to the region, it\u2019s still destabilizing, but I think he\u2019s expecting the Saudis to develop their own capability to respond to how Iran projects power in the region.\u201d\n\nThat disconnection, the analysts say, likely prompted the normally low-key Saudi Arabia, under a new monarch King Salman, 80, and his son, the 30-year-old Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman, to take more aggressive actions lately.\n\nIn January, it executed 47 men on terrorism charges, including a Shiite cleric, prompting Iranians to attack the Saudi Embassy in Tehran.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also carried out a bombing campaign in Yemen for over a year to try to defeat the Houthi Shiite militant group, but the effort has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians and the growth of al-Qaeda in the country.\n\n\u201cI think the Saudis realize they are in a difficult situation and that\u2019s why you are seeing an increasingly independent Saudi foreign policy,\u201d McInnis said. \u201cThe problem is Obama is trying to take the training wheels off [Saudi Arabia] too quickly, which has created not the best judgement on the part of the Saudis. I think the president is right to try and shake the Saudis out of their strategic stupor and overreliance on the U.S., but when we have a system that\u2019s developed for decades and it\u2019s clear whose side we are on, to all of a sudden begin to change that without providing a long-term vision is creating an acceleration of a Saudi-Iran proxy war.\u201d\n\nJim Phillips, a Middle East expert at The Heritage Foundation, says he expects the U.S. to maintain cooperation with Saudi Arabia on issues like security and counterterrorism.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is [still] a valuable ally for containing and rolling back Iran, defeating ISIS and al-Qaeda, and keeping oil prices low,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia breaks with the United States and pursues its own goals unilaterally, the Middle East will be a much more unpredictable, dangerous and unstable place.\u201d\n\nThe best way to manage a complex relationship, McInnis and Phillips say, is for the U.S. to continue to be frank with Saudi Arabia about the two countries\u2019 differences, while hoping they can unite around common goals, despite competing priorities.\n\n\u201cI think fundamentally we can admit our differences we have with the Saudis, and recognize we won\u2019t always be aligned,\u201d McInnis said. \u201cThe Saudis support for the promulgation of the Wahhabism ideology [an ultraconservative branch of Sunni Islam] will always be a problem with them, and we don\u2019t like how they treat women and restrict freedom of the press. But if we hope to someday calm down the region, working with the Saudis is better than working against the Saudis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama will visit Saudi Arabia trying to salvage what he can from a historically stable partnership that has frayed over differing priorities.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama will visit Saudi Arabia trying to salvage what he can from a historically stable partnership that has frayed over differing priorities.", "title": "America\u2019s Iran \u2018Tilt\u2019 Likely Topic as Obama Visits Saudi Arabia", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ObamaSaudi.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-19T21:12:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ThNPth"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama will visit Saudi Arabia trying to salvage what he can from a historically stable partnership that has frayed over differing priorities.", "title": "America\u2019s Iran \u2018Tilt\u2019 Likely Topic as Obama Visits Saudi Arabia", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ObamaSaudi.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2016-04-19T17:46:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:12:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "President Obama, King Salman, Iran nuclear deal, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Houti, ISIS, Syria, Bashar-al Assad"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think the Iranians still believe the U.S.\u2019 most fundamental alliances remain with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is [still] a valuable ally for containing and rolling back Iran, defeating ISIS and al-Qaeda, and keeping oil prices low,\u201d Phillips said.\n\u201cI think the Saudis realize they are in a difficult situation and that\u2019s why you are seeing an increasingly independent Saudi foreign policy,\u201d McInnis said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to overplay that we have all of a sudden switched to Iran and we are against the Saudis,\u201d McInnis said.\n\u201cThe problem is Obama is trying to take the training wheels off [Saudi Arabia] too quickly, which has created not the best judgement on the part of the Saudis."}
