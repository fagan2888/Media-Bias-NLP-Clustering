One of Newton County's most anticipated traditions kicked off today at the Chunky Shoals Fish Camp.

The Chunky Shoals Raft Races were a once-popular event that the fish camp's owners have brought back. Racers build their own rafts to compete or paddle the river with kayaks and canoes. A festival in front of the restaurant has crafts, water activities and plenty of food for everyone who comes. Owner Rick Lewis says last year's races were a big success, but this year's races have been even better.

"Absolutely, this is an annual event, we have a great venue down here," he says. "We're going to start doing some more things down here this summer, as well. It's just a perfect place for it under these oak trees. "

The festival goes on through the night with live concerts and food. Lewis says they're looking forward to continuing this tradition for many years to come.
