Crowd Pleaser

In a fiery speech to an adoring crowd at CPAC, Dr. Ben Carson offered conservative red meat on Saturday.

If Ben Carson had been a member of NWA, his speech on Saturday at CPAC would be entitled "Fuck The PC Police."

The conservative firebrand, potential 2016 Presidential candidate and doctor who came "straight outta Johns Hopkins" repeatedly targeted those he called the "PC Police" and exclaimed "I hate political correctness" in an address that drew cheers from a packed house which was filled with attendees who held up signs proclaiming "Run Ben Run."

Carson used the speech to refute liberal critics of us who had jumped on controversial remarks, including his 2013 proclamation that "Obamacare was the worst thing to happen this country since slavery." He said he wasn't comparing the two and obviously slavery was much worse than the Affordable Care Act.

The retired surgeon, who spent decades at Johns Hopkins Hospital, also focused on traditional marriage, proudly declaring "I still believe marriage should be between one man and one woman." Carson lashed out at those on the left who he said miscontrued his remarks on gay marriage, saying "anyone who thinks gay marriage and bestiality are the same thing is a dummy." He tooks pains though note that he thinks gays and lesbians should have the same rights as anyone else. However, "they don't get extra rights. They don't get to redefine marriage."

Carson did play coy on his political plans for 2016. He said God has a plan for me and "I'm not sure what the culmination of that plan is." In the meantime, he insisted he was having a good time travelling around the country speaking and preemptively rebutted those, presumably members of the PC Police, who said he was just doing it to sell his book. Carson proclaimed he's "got plenty of money," instead he's doing it to turn around the country that's in trouble."
