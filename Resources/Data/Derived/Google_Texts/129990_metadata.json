Can an identity be changed as easily as an address?\n\nSet in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Abbudin, \u201cTyrant\u201d explores the fate of a population in the grip of a madman\u2019s power, the life-altering boyhood experiences of two brothers, the culture clash of Americans and Middle Easterners, the paralysis of diplomats in certain oil-rich territories, the unfair treatment of women and girls in much of the world and more.\n\nProduced in Israel, the series has already drawn complaints about the show\u2019s presentation of Muslims and Arabs. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) found the pilot\u2019s depiction of Arab Muslim culture \u201cdevoid of any redeeming qualities\u201d and \u201d represented by terrorists, murderous children, rapists, corrupt billionaires, and powerless female victims,\u201d said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper. \u201cIn \u2018Tryant,\u2019 even the \u2018good\u2019 Arab Muslims are bad.\u201d\n\nBut the viewing public has enough experience with real-life tyrants from Saddam Hussein to Muammar Gaddafi to pick up the inferences; also enough experience with TV drama to grasp the idea of fictional villains apart from Muslims in general.\n\nFor its part, FX says the network, studio and producers have discussed the concerns internally and with the Muslim Public Affairs Council and with Muslims on Screen and Television.\n\nCynical or no, past experience suggests this kind of back and forth can only mean extra publicity for the show. Achieving notoreity with special interest groups is a time-honored first step.\n\nIn a word, an American family with ties to a non-specific Middle Eastern country is drawn into the political, military and economic maelstrom of the brutal dictator\u2019s regime.\n\n\u201cBarry\u201d ( Adam Rayner) is an American dad who has carefully put distance between himself and his family history. His real name is Bassam Al-Fayeed, he is the son of a dictator and he\u2019s been in self-imposed exile for 20 years, living quietly in Pasadena.\n\nBarry would like to continue working as a pediatrician in Los Angeles with his wife Molly (Jennifer Finnigan), devoted teenage daughter Emma (Anne Winters) and his son Sammy (Noah Silver), who is easily wowed by the wealth and power of his grandfather\u2019s regime. But when Barry and his family are invited to his nephew\u2019s wedding, a trip to the homeland will bring up repressed memories.\n\nThe cinematography is stunning, the music and atmospherics are immersive. With occasional hiccups the acting is mostly subtle.\n\nSuspension of disbelief will be required (how else can Bassam/Barry slip out of his father\u2019s palace in the middle of the night to rendez-vous with an old journalist buddy?) But \u201cTyrant\u201d is worth the effort.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Like \u201cHomeland,\u201d FX\u2019s \u201cTyrant\u201d pushes TV\u2019s geopolitical drama", "title": "Like \u201cHomeland,\u201d FX\u2019s \u201cTyrant\u201d pushes TV\u2019s geopolitical drama", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/22/like-homeland-fxs-tyrant-pushes-tvs-geopolitical-drama/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140622__AE23TVTYRANTp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140622__AE23TVTYRANTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-22T20:38:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:45:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It may be too early to hail \u201cTyrant\u201d as the next intelligent geopolitical drama after \u201cHomeland.\u201d We\u2019ll need to see where it goes after the first couple of hours.\nBut when Barry and his family are invited to his nephew\u2019s wedding, a trip to the homeland will bring up repressed memories.\nBut \u201cTyrant\u201d is worth the effort.\nCynical or no, past experience suggests this kind of back and forth can only mean extra publicity for the show.\nWhile the scene is exotic, the questions posed are universal: can an offspring every truly break away from a controlling parent?"}
