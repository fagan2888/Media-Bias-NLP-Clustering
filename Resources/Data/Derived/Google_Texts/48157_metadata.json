Nearly 225,000 people in the state rely on their health insurance through the Retired Teachers Association. However, if $768 million in funding isn\u2019t passed, the program will go broke by January of next year.\n\n\u201cHealthcare costs keep rising every year, so I guess that\u2019s a moving target,\u201d said Bill Barnes, Retired Teachers Association legislative coordinator.\n\nRight now retirees, pay about 50 percent of their healthcare coverage; the rest is covered by the state and current employees. The Retired Teachers Association feels confident the bill, which passed in the House and is now in the Senate, will continue to receive support because one out of every 16 Texans over the age of 65 are part of this program.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a big deal fixing this thing. So just telling everyone, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s just not fix it, and everyone just pays twice as much money and get less benefits,\u2019 you are going to affect folks out there that are voters,\u201d said Tim Lee, Retired Teachers Association executive director. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the House or Senate want that to happen.\u201d\n\nTheir rally happens from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on the East Lawn of the state Capitol.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the state legislator doesn't fund the healthcare insurance program for retired teachers, it will go broke in January 2016.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.kxan", "og": {"site_name": "KXAN.com", "description": "If the state legislator doesn\u2019t fund the healthcare insurance program for retired teachers, it will go broke in January 2016.", "title": "Health insurance costs could double for retired Texas teachers", "url": "http://kxan.com/2015/04/08/health-insurance-costs-could-double-for-retired-tx-teachers/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkxan.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/3.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If the state legislator doesn\u2019t fund the healthcare insurance program for retired teachers, it will go broke in January 2016.", "creator": "@KXAN_News", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkxan.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/3.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Health insurance costs could double for retired Texas teachers", "site": "@kxan_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Austin, Education, Health, Local, News, Texas, Top Video,,Kate Weidaw", "msapplication-tooltip": "Austin News & Weather - Austin Texas, Round Rock, TX", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488539168", "fb": {"app_id": 1700724863485098, "pages": 46541548036}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kxan.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1f076c9b4fe849f39a5e507e2b3d4de3?s=16", "application-name": "KXAN.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KXANnews", "published_time": "2015-04-08T09:30:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T12:15:25+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "TOUaqAtzSxABm640WZ3y3-lSxo9q4IYLt49vxevsvHI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda176\"", "article_summary": "AUSTIN (KXAN) \u2014 Health insurance rates for retired teachers in Texas could double if the state Legislature doesn\u2019t pass funding this session.\n\u201cHealthcare costs keep rising every year, so I guess that\u2019s a moving target,\u201d said Bill Barnes, Retired Teachers Association legislative coordinator.\nNearly 225,000 people in the state rely on their health insurance through the Retired Teachers Association.\nSo just telling everyone, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s just not fix it, and everyone just pays twice as much money and get less benefits,\u2019 you are going to affect folks out there that are voters,\u201d said Tim Lee, Retired Teachers Association executive director.\nHowever, if $768 million in funding isn\u2019t passed, the program will go broke by January of next year."}
