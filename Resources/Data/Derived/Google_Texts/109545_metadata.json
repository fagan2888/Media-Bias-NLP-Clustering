States which fared badly, sitting at the bottom of the list, were South Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas.\n\nMarking this month\u2019s Women\u2019s History Month, the study inspected how much women earned, what the health care standards were like, and how states fared for levels of employment and poverty.\n\nVermont reportedly ranked top for health care, while the best for economic social and wellbeing was Maryland.\n\nFor women wanting to earn the best money, WalletHub said the District of Columbia came out top, but at the opposite end of the spectrum, the lowest unemployment rate for women was found in North Dakota, and Nevada had the most jobless women.\n\n[Image Source: WalletHub]\n\nIf education is a priority, it\u2019s worth women taking a look at New Hampshire, where there\u2019s the lowest high school dropout rate in the country. The teachers there must be doing something right, or at least something better than Arizona, which was found to have the highest dropout rate.\n\nFor those women planning on sticking around for as long as possible, Hawaii ranked best for long life. The birthplace of President Obama enjoys the highest life expectancy for women at birth, with Mississippi registering the lowest.\n\nData was used from a number of sources including the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Center for Educational Statistics.\n\nIn introducing the report, author Richie Bernardo provided the following comments.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, women have made even more remarkable strides in areas where men once dominated. In fact, both the percentages of women in public-sector leadership positions and private-sector board memberships increased in 2014. And far more women \u2014 especially those from racial minority groups \u2014 than men are enrolled in college these days. \u201cBut much work remains to be done in the name of social progress. In some states, women continue to fall behind their male counterparts in various measures. For instance, women represent nearly two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers in the U.S. And in the 22 states that have refused to expand their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, women comprise the majority of poor uninsured adults.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag of findings, which you might expect from a country with the size and diversity of America. But it\u2019s also worth remembering the bigger picture and struggles of women globally.\n\nWhile the WalletHub report may or may not be without its own political agendas, its study into women\u2019s quality of life throughout the U.S. offers compelling data on which areas give women the best chance of success in life.\n\n[Image \u2013 Alamy]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women in Minnesota enjoy the best quality of life of all women in the United States, a new study finds.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Women in Minnesota enjoy the best quality of life of all women in the United States, a new study finds.", "title": "Does Your U.S. State Treat Women Fairly?
