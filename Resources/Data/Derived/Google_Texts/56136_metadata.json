Each would love to land the company\u2019s massive, $5 billion gigafactory for battery production. Tesla has acknowledged breaking ground on a potential site in Reno, but is keeping its options open. State politicians, economic development officials, governors and senators are falling over themselves to bring the economic development bacon, and the promise of 6,500 manufacturing jobs, home.\n\nEnter Republican Ted Gaines of Roseville, who represents California\u2019s 1st Senate District. He\u2019s also running for the statewide office of Insurance Commissioner and is the legislature\u2019s most vocal critic of what many call \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Gaines will tour Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont. Then he plans to show up at Tesla\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters with a \u201csymbolic gift\u201d for CEO Elon Musk. He doesn\u2019t have an appointment with Musk, who may not even be there. Musk travels extensively and also runs SpaceX.\n\nWhat is the symbolic gift? An oversized check for $500 million? CEQA in a shredder? Gaines wouldn\u2019t say: we\u2019ll find out on Friday.\n\n\u201cI am doing everything that I can to communicate that California is serious, and we\u2019re going to win,\u201d said Gaines in an interview Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t buy that Reno is the front-runner in the line. The Nevada legislature isn\u2019t even in session. How can they cut a deal? We can put together a package that makes us competitive.\u201d\n\nGaines and Senate President pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) are co-authors of SB 1309, a bill that aims to entice Tesla to build the factory. There\u2019s about a month left in the legislative session to get the bill, which currently just has intent language, done.\n\nState Senator Ted Gaines\n\nShare this: Email\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: gigafactory, Tesla Motors", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.8", "og": {"site_name": "SiliconBeat", "description": "Tesla Motors has five Southwestern states \u2013 Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas \u2013 on the ropes.
