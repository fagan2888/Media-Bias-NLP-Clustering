Love him or hate him, he is a vision of the future\n\nMarco Grob for TIME\n\nThey don\u2019t teach this stuff in eighth-grade civics class: a freshman U.S. senator from the minority party provokes a shutdown of the federal government in a hopeless quest to undo the President\u2019s signature legislative achievement. The nation flirts with a potentially disastrous default while the populace looks on in disgust. And when the instigator tries to explain himself during one of the longest speeches in Senate history, somehow he ends up reciting Dr. Seuss\u2019s Green Eggs and Ham.\n\nThe faux filibuster to \u201cdefund Obama\u00adcare\u201d waged by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas made him so unpopular with his fellow Republicans (Democrats scarcely concealed their delight) that they might have made him walk the plank\u2014except that the GOP\u2019s approval ratings were sinking so fast that even the plank was underwater.\n\nPlus, anyone steeped in Washington politics could see that Cruz was already dead from this massive self-inflicted wound.\n\nBut to Cruz, 42, that is precisely the reason he believes he is winning. The young barn burner is convinced that \u201cofficial Washington\u201d\u2014his umbrella term covering the old guard of both \u00adparties\u2014is hopelessly out of touch with the voters, so he wears the scorn like a crown of laurel. If the Establishment says he\u2019s finished, he concludes, he must be making headway. If they\u2019re so sure he\u2019s wrong, he must be doing something right.\n\n\u201cChanging Washington isn\u2019t easy, and we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when official Washington fights back,\u201d he told Time in an end-of-year interview. \u201cPeople who were used to making decisions in smoky rooms behind closed doors don\u2019t know how to operate in today\u2019s world, where people have direct access to information, can form their own opinions and know how to make their views heard.\u201d\n\nTIME Graphic by Chris Wilson, Sam Jacobs & Alexander Ho", "article_metadata": {"description": "They don\u2019t teach this stuff in eighth-grade civics class: a freshman U.S. senator from the minority party provokes a shutdown of the federal government in a hopeless quest to undo the President\u2019s signature legislative achievement.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In 2013, the audacious upstart shut down the government on a hopeless quest to stop the President's signature policy.
