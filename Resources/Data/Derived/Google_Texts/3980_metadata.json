In his remarks, he outlined all the progress of the last eight years that he would have reversed and all of the government agencies he would have repealed.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, let me tell you how the State of the Union goes,\u201d he said in his town hall in New Hampshire. \u201cLadies and gentleman, the state of the union is strong\u2026 Boy have things changed in Washington.\u201d\n\nTurned the IRS into a Trump hotel\n\nCruz joked that, as president in 2018, he recently abolished the Internal Revenue Service and sold the building to Donald Trump who turned it into a hotel. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to say after months of that haunted house, we have finally auctioned off the IRS building to the public, and I for one am particularly pleased that my good friend Donald Trump will be building a hotel where the IRS used to stand,\u201d he said.\n\nBuilt the border wall, financed by Trump\n\nHe also said that just last week, Trump finished building the wall \u2014 \u201cDonald paid for it\u201d \u2014 and strengthened security on the border.\n\nHillary Clinton is in prison\n\nAnd, he joked, Hillary Clinton is in prison. \u201cYou know I have to say, we\u2019ve never had a president serving from Leavenworth,\u201d he said about the prison in Kansas. \u201cBut had prisoner 260401 been elected president, we would have seen 12 million people here granted amnesty.\u201d\n\nRepealed Obamacare\n\n\u201cIn the year 2017, Congress listened to the American people and we repealed every word of Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cOur long national nightmare is over.\u201d\n\nPassed a flat tax\n\nAfter repealing Obamacare, he continued, Congress \u201cheard the mandate that came out of November 2016, and we passed a simple flat tax.\u201d\n\nGot rid of ISIS\n\n\u201cIn the past year, we haven\u2019t simply weakened, we haven\u2019t simply degraded, we have utterly and completely destroyed ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, the terrorists thought they were winning,\u201d he continued. \u201cTwo years ago, militants from across the world were going to fight with ISIS. Two years ago, they were beheading American children. Two years ago, they were crucifying Christians. Today, every American citizen that went and joined ISIS, that waged jihad against America, has found their American citizenship revoked.\u201d\n\nInvited Netanyahu to the Capitol\n\nHe even hinted at what guests he would invite to sit in the audience, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious organization that has sued the federal government arguing that having to sign a document to opt out of contraceptive coverage is a burden.\n\n\u201cFor years, we were ashamed to see the federal government\u2026 trying to impose millions of dollars on that Catholic charity in order to force nuns to pay for abortion inducing drugs and others,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know, it was a year ago that the federal government\u2019s case against you was dismissed\u2026Never again will the government be persecuting you or anybody else\u2019s religious liberty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Hillary Clinton is in prison, the IRS is a Trump hotel, and more.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Hillary Clinton is in prison, the IRS is a Trump hotel, and more.", "title": "Ted Cruz Gave A Preview Of His State Of The Union In 2018.
