But that doesn\u2019t excuse the clunkers.\n\nWell, now is the time to acknowledge those errors over the past year and try to explain what went wrong with my thinking.\n\nI break out in cold sweats every time I think of my April 28 column, \u201cHillary Rodham Romney? Keep an Eye on O\u2019Malley .\u201d\n\nThe premise \u2014 that Clinton would face a challenge from someone in her party who could run against the establishment and as a candidate of change and progressivism \u2014 was not half bad. In fact, it was correct. But it was when I dismissed Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders and identified former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley as a potential alternative to Clinton that I jumped the shark.\n\nIn fact, Sanders emerged as the alternative to Clinton, and I\u2019m still waiting for O\u2019Malley to do something \u2014 anything. O\u2019Malley did eventually get into the race, of course, and immediately disappeared.\n\nWhy did I get it so wrong? I think O\u2019Malley waited too long to get into the race, allowing Sanders to coalesce skeptics of the former secretary of State. Sanders\u2019 Larry David-like imitation of himself \u2014 his accent, hair, passion and progressivism \u2014 caught fire, if only for a few months. He became weirdly hip \u2014 even compared with the much younger O\u2019Malley, who oozes political ambition and calculation out of every pore of his skin.\n\nJust a few weeks later, on May 12, I penned another humdinger of a column titled \u201cWhy it\u2019s a Mistake to Dismiss Bobby Jindal. \u201d Oy vey.\n\nI argued that while the Louisiana governor was not showing well in early polls, he was worth watching because of his potential in Iowa, a state where evangelicals constitute a crucial voting group during the Iowa caucuses. Yes, I expressed plenty of doubts about Jindal in the column, but given what eventually happened, that column now looks like a ridiculous over-estimation of his chances.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t throw Jindal to the wolves early enough, I was too dismissive of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz initially.\n\nIn my April 21 column \u2014 I was clearly out of sorts in the spring, suggesting I suffer some sort of inverse Seasonal Affective Disorder that may actually be covered by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 I seriously underestimated where Cruz would be at the end of the year.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear, I wrote, that \u201cthe Texas senator can attract much more than the hard core tea party and movement conservative crowd, which, while an important segment of the GOP, isn\u2019t large enough to select the party\u2019s presidential nominee.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe that was and is true, and maybe it isn\u2019t. But Cruz clearly has found a lane in the Republican race, including support from the party\u2019s important evangelical contingent, that could well take him to the nomination finals, pitting him against a more pragmatic opponent. (I finally wrote about my reassessment of Cruz\u2019s prospects in late October, here .)\n\nNot convinced that I\u2019m an idiot, yet? Well my March 17 column (yes, as spring was about to bloom), titled \u201cThe Fearsome Foursome: Bush, Paul, Walker and Rubio ,\u201d should seal the deal.\n\nThe piece argued that Jeb Bush and Rand Paul should have the resources to stay in the GOP for a long time, while Scott Walker and Marco Rubio also seemed to have the qualities and resources to play with the big boys. No, I didn\u2019t think Paul was a serious contender for the nomination, but I believed he would be a very visible presence in the race.\n\nWell, one of those four dropped out early, and Bush and Paul aren\u2019t exactly scaring any of the other candidates still in the Republican race. Only Rubio now looks like a top-tier contender.\n\nOf course, the entire Republican nominating contest has been bizarre.\n\nWhile I continue to agree with my friend Charlie Cook that it is unlikely the Republican Party will nominate for president one of the candidates who has never held elective office (see my Nov. 16 column ), I clearly underestimated the appeal of Donald Trump.\n\nIndeed, on Sept. 9, I devoted an entire column to my changed view of the Republican race, concluding that \u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t going to go away anytime soon,\u201d and suggesting he could win a considerable number of delegates, starting in Iowa, and possibly even put himself in a position to demand a speaking slot at the Cleveland convention.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, strange year. And just imagine how strange next year could be. Maybe Chris Christie will be a factor longer than Jeb Bush. Or maybe Donald Trump will be ... Oh, wait. It isn\u2019t going to be that strange, is it?\n\nRelated:\n\nRoll Call Race Ratings Map: Ratings for Every House and Senate Race in 2016 Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you write dozens of columns each year, as I have been doing for a long time (some people think far too long), you look back at some of them with embarrassment.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "When you write dozens of columns each year, as I have been doing for a long time (some people think far too long), you look back at some of them with embarrassment.", "title": "Stu in Review: Dumb Stuff I Wrote This Year", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/rothenberg-dumb-stuff-i-wrote-this-year", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/4/2015/12/omalley_001_120115-445x278.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-12-13T11:00:43Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "When you write dozens of columns each year, as I have been doing for a long time (some people think far too long), you look back at some of them with embarrassment.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,author,RC-Tags,stuart-rothenberg-columns-archive,Bernie Sanders,Bobby Jindal,Donald Trump,Hillary Clinton,Jeb Bush,Marco Rubio,martin o'malley,Rand Paul,Scott Walker,Stu Rothenberg,Ted Cruz", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-12-13T11:00:43Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-13T11:00:43Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "When you write dozens of columns each year, as I have been doing for a long time (some people think far too long), you look back at some of them with embarrassment.", "title": "Stu in Review: Dumb Stuff I Wrote This Year", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/rothenberg-dumb-stuff-i-wrote-this-year", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/4/2015/12/omalley_001_120115-445x278.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "I think O\u2019Malley waited too long to get into the race, allowing Sanders to coalesce skeptics of the former secretary of State.\nWell, one of those four dropped out early, and Bush and Paul aren\u2019t exactly scaring any of the other candidates still in the Republican race.\nNo, I didn\u2019t think Paul was a serious contender for the nomination, but I believed he would be a very visible presence in the race.\nI break out in cold sweats every time I think of my April 28 column, \u201cHillary Rodham Romney?\n(I finally wrote about my reassessment of Cruz\u2019s prospects in late October, here .)"}
