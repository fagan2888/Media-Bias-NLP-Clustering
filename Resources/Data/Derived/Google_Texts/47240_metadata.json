But as the Senate parliamentarian, MacDonough is the person who would have final say on which pieces of Obamacare qualify to be repealed using the complicated budget process called reconciliation \u2014 as Republicans may attempt to do. Her job is a pretty quiet one, except when thorny decisions around reconciliation come up. Last time the post was in the news was 2010, when then-parliamentarian Alan Frumin allowed the budget fast-track tool to pass a small part of the ACA \u2014 to the ire of Republicans. Those who know MacDonough express confidence that her personality, smarts and experience on the Hill will equip her to make a fair call. While Obama would veto Obamacare repeal even if Republicans successfully pursue that through reconciliation, how MacDonough rules could shape what could be done if a Republican is in the White House in 2017.

It\u2019s an effort to move beyond the contentious politics of the Affordable Care Act and onto issues where the parties typically agree, such as improving health care quality, strengthening global health security and boosting research capabilities and innovation. \u201cI count myself among those who do not believe that disagreements in some areas \u2014 even significant disagreements \u2014 should prevent us from moving forward on others,\u201d Burwell plans to say in the speech at the New America Foundation, according to excerpts obtained by POLITICO. The POLITICO Pro story: http://politico.pro/1yfeQGS\n\nARE MORE LATINOS GETTING COVERED? \u2014 It\u2019s not clear whether the extra money and effort that HHS and Obamacare advocacy groups are devoting to chipping away at Latinos' high uninsured rate is paying off, reports Pro\u2019s Sarah Wheaton. HHS has spent a third of its paid advertising budget on Spanish-language media this enrollment season \u2014 up from 10 percent during the first enrollment period, Secretary Burwell said Wednesday during a media call attended by some of those groups. The administration has also focused on improving the federal exchange website for users on mobile devices, which is how many Latinos access the Spanish-language version of the site. But December\u2019s enrollment report revealed relatively little improvement from last year \u2014 Latinos accounted for 8 percent of plan selections, compared to 7 percent during the first few months of the first enrollment period.

Chuck Grassley wants to know what\u2019s going on between CMS and CoOportunity Health, an Obamacare co-op in Iowa and Nebraska that is failing financially after enrolling a surprisingly large number of members and charging premiums that proved to be too low. Iowa insurance regulators took over the co-op after CMS refused to meet its request for more funding in order to continue to offer coverage. New enrollments were stopped, and members were advised to find insurance elsewhere. \u201cWhile CoOportunity was facing financial challenges, if CMS had informed it earlier that it would not receive additional funds it could have taken steps to potentially avoid failure,\u201d Grassley wrote in a letter to CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner Wednesday. He wants CMS to explain how it decided to make loans to co-ops and for all communication between the agency and the co-op about how much funding would be available.\n\n\u2014 CMS responded that the co-op\u2019s last request for funding was greater than all of the resources CMS had available to loan to co-ops.\n\n** A message from Healthcare Education Project: America\u2019s hospitals are already reeling from billions of dollars in slashed funding.

The Commonwealth Fund finds that 66 million Americans skipped health care because of cost in 2014 \u2014 down from 80 million in 2012. And fewer were struggling to pay their medical bills or pay off their medical debt \u2014 64 million in 2014 compared to 75 million two years earlier. Sara Collins, the study\u2019s lead author, says the findings suggest that the ACA is helping people afford the care they need. The report also found a decline in the uninsured ranks \u2014 from 37 million or 20 percent of Americans in 2010 to 29 million or 16 percent in 2014.

And being 96 is the most expensive as far as Medicare spending, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation review published by Health Affairs on Wednesday. The review found that seniors who were 80 or older in 2011 made up just under a quarter of traditional Medicare enrollees but accounted for a third of the program's spending. Medicare spent 2\u00bd times as much on 85-year-olds and three times as much on 95-year-olds than the $5,600 spent on the average 66-year-old. But 96-year-olds were the priciest, costing $16,145. Back in 2000, Medicare spent the most on 92-year-olds, indicating that the age of peak spending is on the rise.

Paula Ercolini of Georgia told lawmakers how her MA plan helped her avoid a kidney transplant at a briefing hosted by the Coalition for Medicare Choices.

HealthCare.gov reports formulary cost sharing in a four-tier structure \u2014 although, problematically, 35 percent of silver plans don\u2019t use four-tier formularies. So what consumers see might not be what they actually get.

On Wednesday, he eliminated a provision of the rule narrowing the definition of \"companionship services\" in a way that would have limited the number of workers that employers could exempt from minimum wage and overtime requirements. The opinion: http://politico.pro/1FYJ8Ba\n\n\u2014 \"I cannot help but conclude that Congress's intent in 1974 to exempt from minimum wage and overtime wage requirements domestic workers providing services, including care to the elderly and disabled, is still as clear today as it was forty years ago,\" Leon said. \"Here, yet again, the Department is trying to do through regulation what must be done through legislation.\"\n\nCHRIS DAWE JOINS EVOLENT HEALTH \u2014 Former White House health policy advisor Chris Dawe has joined Evolent Health, a company founded in 2011 by the Advisory Board and UPME Health Plan to help health systems move towards providing value-based care.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
