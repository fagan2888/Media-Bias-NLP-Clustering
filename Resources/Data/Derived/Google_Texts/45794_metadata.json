Keep (Barack) Obama in President, you know? He gave us a phone, he\u2019s going to do more.\u201d (Sic) \u201cYou sign up if you on food stamps, you on Social Security, you got no income, disability\u2026.\u201d (Sic)\n\nThus was the Lifeline redistribution-of-wealth government phone program rechristened \u201cObamaPhone.\u201d Which drove nuts the Left and the Media (please pardon the redundancy).\n\nThe Obama Phone? FactCheck.org Q: Has the Obama administration started a program to use \u201ctaxpayer money\u201d to give free cell phones to welfare recipients? A: No. Low-income households have been eligible for discounted telephone service for more than a decade. But the program is funded by telecom companies, not by taxes, and the president has nothing to do with it.\n\nFactCheck.org is \u2013 as usual \u2013 fact challenged.\n\nLifeline isn\u2019t \u201cfunded by telecom companies\u201d \u2013 it is funded by us. Check your bill \u2013 that \u201cUniversal Service Fund (USF)\u201d tax is you paying for (in part) ObamaPhones.\n\nDon\u2019t like the name \u201cObamaPhone?\u201d Check with Lifeline website ObamaPhone.com.\n\nThis program\u2026was dubbed \u201cObama Phone\u201d in recent years because of its rapid expansion during the Barack Obama presidency.\n\nOr you can peruse ObamaPhone.net. Or\u2026.\n\nIs there fraud in the ObamaPhone program? Ummm\u2026.\n\nUber-rich Senators are equally as \u201celigible\u201d:\n\n(Democrat) Senator Claire McCaskill\u2026- a millionaire many times over \u2013 could apply for a free cell phone, complete with monthly service, paid for by the federal government. From what McCaskill could tell, \u201cyou just had to check the box\u201d saying you met the income requirements, submit the form, and collect the phone\u2026.\n\nSo the government should \u201creform\u201d the program, right? Ummm\u2026.\n\nActual reform of a government program is like finding a duck-billed unicorn. It never, ever happens.\n\nSo when government can\u2019t reform \u2013 and it never, ever can \u2013 it changes the definition.\n\nReal reform would be a paring down of the two-plus million fraudulent Lifeline users. Government \u201creform\u201d is exponentially expanding that number.\n\nThis is \u201creform\u201d \u2013 like the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d (ObamaCare) is \u201caffordable.\u201d\n\nGone is any mention of trying to actually fix this mess \u2013 more government is all that matters.\n\nChairman Tom Wheeler\u2026said he wants to \u201c\u2018reboot\u2019 Lifeline for the Internet age.\u201d \u201c[A]s communications technologies and markets evolve, the Lifeline program also has to evolve to remain relevant\u2026.\u201d\n\nFor government \u2013 continued gi-normous fraud and waste is a part of remaining relevant.\n\nSome Republicans remain woefully out of step.\n\n\u201cEven after a GAO report questioned the effectiveness of Lifeline and the FCC\u2019s promises of \u2018sweeping reforms,\u2019 we continue to have regular reports of fraud and abuse,\u201d said Sen. David Vitter (R-La.). \u201cThe free government cell phone program is beyond reform and should be ended.\u201d\n\nIn Reality, the Lifeline \u201cObamaPhone\u201d program would have been ended long ago.\n\nBut this is GovernmentLand. So it\u2019s full steam ahead \u2013 with millions of additional sinking ships.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Remember this woman?", "title": "The Feds Want to \u2018Reform\u2019 Fraud-Riddled ObamaPhone - By Expanding It to the Internet | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015_06_01_182237_07f30ecc-b212-448d-8c39-5504b98b4f0b.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/06/01/the-feds-want-to-reform-fraud-riddled-obamaphone-by-expanding-it-to-the-internet/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Remember this woman?", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015_06_01_182237_07f30ecc-b212-448d-8c39-5504b98b4f0b.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Remember this woman?"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22bf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe free government cell phone program is beyond reform and should be ended.\u201dIn Reality, the Lifeline \u201cObamaPhone\u201d program would have been ended long ago.\nThis program\u2026was dubbed \u201cObama Phone\u201d in recent years because of its rapid expansion during the Barack Obama presidency.\nThe Obama Phone?\nIs there fraud in the ObamaPhone program?\nBut the program is funded by telecom companies, not by taxes, and the president has nothing to do with it."}
