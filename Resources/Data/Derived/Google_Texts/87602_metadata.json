Politically, Jonah [Goldberg] and Kirsten [Powers] are right. This is not going to have a real effect on those who lost their policies. The state health insurance commissioners have indicated and the insurers have indicated this is almost impossible to undo. You can\u2019t put Humpty Dumpty back. He did it because there was a rebellion among Democrats on this end. Everyone knows about Republican opposition \u2014 wall-to-wall and constant. But what he was getting, especially after the statement by Bill Clinton who essentially said a few days ago, you know the president has not honored the promise he made. That\u2019s number one, a pretty big accusation, even though he had the pseudo-apology.\u201d\n\nNoting that the political fallout from Obamacare has spread to the president\u2019s own party, Krauthammer said Obama had to act to avoid a rebellion among Democrats who could be tempted to defect and vote with Republicans to alter the law.\n\n\u201cAnd second, he needs to change the law,\u201d he continued. \u201cWell here are all the Democrats furious at him. They went out on a limb for him. They\u2019re getting all this mail from people that have lost their insurance plans. And he doesn\u2019t want to change the law. So what he does \u2014 this is a stopgap because there\u2019s going to be a bill introduced in the House by Republicans tomorrow and he was afraid of a stampede of [Democrats] who would support it and make him look completely isolated\u2026to join the Republicans in changing the law, but the law itself. So he decided I\u2019ll do an executive action as a way to at least allow the Democrats to say we\u2019re trying something. But what the miscalculation is: These Democrats have to have a vote. They have to support what the Republicans are doing. They have to show on the record that they wanted to undo this disaster and that\u2019s why some of them will support the Republicans tomorrow.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Columnist has doubts about president's proposal; says it\u2019s to prevent a 'stampede' of Democrats to the Republican side", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Thursday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on the Fox News Channel, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer deplored President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement of a so-called fix to his health care law a", "title": "Krauthammer on Obamacare \u2018fix\u2019: \u2018You can\u2019t put Humpty Dumpty back\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/14/krauthammer-on-obamacare-fix-you-cant-put-humpty-dumpty-back/", "image": {"width": 702, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CK1114-e1384483754195.jpg", "height": 301}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Washington Post columnist says Obama is trying to prevent defections by Democrats", "title": "Krauthammer on Obamacare \u2018fix\u2019: \u2018You can\u2019t put Humpty Dumpty back\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/14/krauthammer-on-obamacare-fix-you-cant-put-humpty-dumpty-back/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CK1114-e1384483754195.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-14 23:10:30", "sailthru.title": "Krauthammer on Obamacare 'fix': 'You can't put Humpty Dumpty back'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "charles-krauthammer,obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "On Thursday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on the Fox News Channel, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer deplored President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement of a so-called fix to his health care law a", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CK1114-e1384483754195.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b25\"", "article_summary": "You can\u2019t put Humpty Dumpty back.\nHe did it because there was a rebellion among Democrats on this end.\nThe state health insurance commissioners have indicated and the insurers have indicated this is almost impossible to undo.\n\u201cThis is all about show, this all about appearances,\u201d Krauthammer said.\n\u201cAnd this is all about the president protecting himself and some Democrats."}
