The justices seemed split along ideological lines, which is bad news for the administration because a 4-4 ruling will leave the lower court\u2019s injunction against implementing the order in place.\n\nLiberals will undoubtedly blame conservative partisanship for the outcome. But the fact of the matter is that Solicitor General Verrilli, who argued the case, wrote a poor brief and mounted an even poorer defense. Although the arguments for DAPA are far stronger than for Obamacare, it still seemed like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with the administration claiming that conferring \u201clawful\u201d status on the undocumented was not actually making them \u201clegal\u201d \u2013 just like when it argued that the fines for violating Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate were a tax but also not a tax.\n\nChief Justice Roberts saved Obamacare by voting with the liberal justices. But his pointed questions to Verrilli suggested that he was not inclined to do so a second time \u2013 which leaves Justice Kennedy as the swing vote. But Kennedy too seemed skeptical. Should the decision go against Obama, he\u2019ll get his comeuppance given how cynically he\u2019s handled the whole issue.\n\nBut the price will be paid by hard working undocumented aliens, living in fear of deportation, desperately waiting for relief from government harassment, I note at The Week.\n\nGo here to read the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The president's counsel bumbled badly before the Supreme Court", "title": "How Obama Doomed DAPA", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/04/20/how-obama-doomed-dapa", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14611553489981.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14611553489981.jpg", "description": "The president's counsel bumbled badly before the Supreme Court", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Obama Doomed DAPA"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Civil Liberties", "published_time": "2016-04-20T12:37:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/shikha-dalmia"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf326\"", "article_summary": "But his pointed questions to Verrilli suggested that he was not inclined to do so a second time \u2013 which leaves Justice Kennedy as the swing vote.\nShould the decision go against Obama, he\u2019ll get his comeuppance given how cynically he\u2019s handled the whole issue.\nChief Justice Roberts saved Obamacare by voting with the liberal justices.\nBut the fact of the matter is that Solicitor General Verrilli, who argued the case, wrote a poor brief and mounted an even poorer defense.\nThe justices seemed split along ideological lines, which is bad news for the administration because a 4-4 ruling will leave the lower court\u2019s injunction against implementing the order in place."}
