A family that spends most of their income on housing[ii] is unable to invest in other basic necessities like preventative health care or education, much less build resources for the future. While each community\u2019s housing needs are unique, lack of affordable housing is a problem in all 100 North Carolina counties[iii] and calls for a statewide solution.\n\nThe NC Housing Trust Fund was created by the General Assembly in 1987 and is administered by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency. It is North Carolina\u2019s most flexible resource for the state\u2019s growing and complex affordable housing need. Funds leverage private funding to create a variety of housing solutions \u2014 homeownership, rental, supportive housing, new construction, rehabilitation, and emergency repairs. Examples include:\n\nSenior communities;\n\nHabitat for Humanity homes funded by second mortgages;\n\nUrgent repairs of dangerous housing conditions; and\n\nDomestic violence shelters.\n\nHousing is not only an integral part of a family\u2019s budget, but also the state\u2019s economy. Ensuring that all North Carolinians have access to safe, decent and affordable housing is a sound financial investment in North Carolina\u2019s future.\n\nIn Governor Pat McCrory\u2019s 2015-17 budget, former Budget Director Lee Harris Roberts wrote that \u201cthe NC Housing Finance Agency represents one of the greatest returns on investment of any state money spent.\u201d[iv] Because the Finance Agency is a self-supporting agency, every dollar spent goes directly to bricks and mortar. For every $1 million that the Housing Trust Fund spends:\n\n108 households are assisted;\n\n$5,169,000 in affordable housing real estate value is generated;\n\n110 jobs are supported; and\n\n$455,000 in state and local revenue is generated.[v]\n\nIn 2005, bipartisan leadership filed Senate Bill 330 to fund the Housing Trust Fund at $50 million. The bill speaks directly to a \u201cshortage of decent, safe, and sanitary\u2026 housing available at affordable prices\u201d and the importance of affordable housing to economic development \u201cbecause businesses will not locate in communities where workers cannot live.\u201d Despite this, the state\u2019s investment in the Housing Trust Fund has decreased nearly 68% over the last 10 years \u2014 from $21 million in FY07 to a low-water mark of $6.8 million in FY15.[vi]\n\nUnderstandably, state funding for the Housing Trust Fund dropped in the wake of the Great Recession. However, as North Carolina recovers, so should our investment in our housing infrastructure. Last year saw the first increase in the Housing Trust Fund in 10 years. This is an encouraging sign, but we are far from meeting the size of the growing need. Now is the time to reclaim the vision cast in 2005 for the Housing Trust Fund and make a bold commitment to investing in North Carolina\u2019s families and growing economy.\n\n[i] National Housing Conference.
