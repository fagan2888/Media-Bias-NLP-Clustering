Who would defend a body with a 14 percent approval rating? Only the Ebola virus may be less popular than Congress, but it\u2019s Mr. Obama who has imposed the gridlock.\n\nSpeaking at a fundraising dinner in Chicago, Mr. Obama feigned frustration. \u201cYou remember Harry Truman with the do-nothing Congress? This is a less productive Congress than the do-nothing Congress. This Congress makes the do-nothing Congress look like the New Deal.\u201d\n\nThe deals that Mr. Obama and the Democratic Party are eager to impose include a comprehensive amnesty bill, gun control, a declaration of war on coal and billions of dollars more in subsidies for windmills and solar panels. Many of these proposals aren\u2019t popular with the public. In fact, Mr. Obama\u2019s program could rightly be called the Raw Deal.\n\nA two-party system guarantees that one party can\u2019t dominate the agenda to the exclusion of the other. The Founders didn\u2019t intend for Congress to bend to every whim of a president. The system is designed to demand debate and encourage compromise. Alas, Mr. Obama\u2019s idea of debate, negotiation and compromise is to seize the nearest microphone to demand, like a truculent child, that \u201cit\u2019s my way or the highway.\u201d\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, follows the president\u2019s lead. She tells voters to keep one word in mind on their way to the November polls. The word, she says, is \u201cbipartisanship,\u201d and the need for reasonable elected officials to work together in the spirit of compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s about progress versus obstruction,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about bipartisanship versus obstruction.\u201d Just not when Mrs. Pelosi wields the speaker\u2019s gavel. She helped stuff Obamacare down the throats of her colleagues, a poisonous scheme enacted without even a fragment of compromise offered to Republicans. That\u2019s the Democratic idea of bipartisanship.\n\nSeveral Democratic Senate incumbents running for their lives have reluctantly acknowledged that the blame for congressional inaction lies with their own leader. Sen. Mark L. Pryor conceded the other day, as reported by The Washington Free Beacon, a website, that he wouldn\u2019t mind if Sen. Harry Reid were replaced. Not so coincidentally, he\u2019s trailing Rep. Tom Cotton in their Senate race in Arkansas.\n\nThe Senate votes only on bills that Mr. Reid wants enacted and, contrary to Senate tradition, neither Republicans nor Democrats can have much to say about it. Since 2013, Mr. Reid has allowed only 14 amendments to legislation to come to a vote in the Senate. In the House, controlled by the Republicans, 194 Democratic amendments have come to a vote. The House has passed 393 bills, many with bipartisan support. The Senate has passed only 85.\n\nThe stack of House-passed bills continues to pile up on Mr. Reid\u2019s desk, and none will get a vote as long as Mr. Reid is in charge. The only way to break the gridlock that plagues Washington is to elect a Senate to act like a Senate, not a cheering section for a president who has lost his way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama likes to kick Congress when it's down.
