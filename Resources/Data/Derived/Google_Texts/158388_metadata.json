March Madness is getting increasingly political as the tournament rolls on, and President Obama is using the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act to take a victory lap, of sorts. Victories have not come easy in Afghanistan, however, but the country\u2019s new president is in town to offer a status report.\n\nAnother foreign leader will address Congress in the House on Wednesday, but this one is more likely to be thanking President Obama and America than criticizing the president.\n\nAshraf Ghani, the new president of Afghanistan who has been in Washington this week, will speak to a joint meeting of the House and Senate just a few weeks after the fiery appearance by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who used the occasion to assail the administration\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\nBut Mr. Ghani, a former World Bank official familiar with the ways of Washington, will speak one day after Mr. Obama agreed to his request to halt the pullout of United States forces to allow more time for the Afghan military to prepare for American troops to be almost completely out of Afghanistan by 2017.\n\nIn his public statements, Mr. Ghani has emphasized his country\u2019s gratitude for the American commitment of money and military forces, and he will no doubt reiterate that sentiment before Congress, which is responsible for providing the money for the American presence. Some televisions at the White House might even be turned on to this address to Congress.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nStay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updates\n\nAfter an extensive internal debate, heaps of ridicule from Democrats and years of promising to hack away at federal spending, congressional Republicans are poised to pass their respective budgets with big increases to military spending, before leaving town for a two-week recess.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Republicans will vote on their budget, and party leaders are betting that those members who objected to increased spending will come around.\n\nThe austere spending plan, with large cuts to social programs, will add $2 billion in additional \u201cemergency\u201d war funding outside the discretionary caps set in the Budget Control Act, through a procedural trick known as \u201cQueen of the Hill.\u201d\n\nOver in the Senate, members have already begun to vote on scores of expected amendments on a budget plan that will most likely pass in the witching hours of Friday morning.\n\nIn that chamber, the dynamic was about the same. Defense hawks won the day and forced the Budget Committee to add $38 billion above the president\u2019s $58 billion request in military spending through a war account not subject to statutory spending restrictions, and Senate Republicans seemed poised to sign off.\n\nIf bursting caps on military spending through procedural trickery of the trade contradicts years of griping about overspending, please don\u2019t point that out to Republicans, who get a wee bit defensive. \u201cWe were trying to pass a budget that met the B.C.A. totals,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. \u201cBut there was a strong feeling we needed to do more for the military.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Steinhauer\n\nDick Cheney can still pack a house. Or in this case, a museum.\n\nRepublicans raked in more than $17 million at the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s spring dinner Tuesday night, as conservatives flocked to the National Building Museum in Washington to hear the former vice president denounce President Obama\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nWhile the news media was excluded from the event, Mr. Cheney was said to have given a robust critique of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies on Iran, Iraq, Israel, Russia and Syria.\n\nRepresentative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who attended the dinner, said Mr. Cheney drew multiple rounds of applause from what he acknowledged was a \u201csympathetic\u201d audience. Mr. Cheney stuck to attacking Mr. Obama and steered clear of presidential politics, said Mr. Cole, the committee chairman in 2008.\n\nAs for the rest of the crowd, Mr. Cole said Republicans were most interested in winning in 2016 and less sure about who could get them there. Those with experience as governors, such as former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, seemed to be favorites over senators considering a run.\n\nRegardless, Mr. Cole said the mood was good, and the money was pouring in.\n\n\u201cFinancially, we\u2019re going to do very well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nPresident Obama will deliver remarks hailing the success of the Affordable Care Act on its fifth anniversary.\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee holds a 10 a.m. hearing on the F.B.I. budget.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan addresses Congress at 10:45 a.m.\n\nTo the delight of those who see politics as sport, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and his aides have taken to describing the Republican primary constituencies in terms of March Madness brackets, with Final Four spots for the Establishment, Libertarians, Evangelicals and the Tea Party.\n\nThe Cruz team believes it is the top seed in the Tea Party bracket, but also among conservative evangelicals, a point underlined by the senator\u2019s decision to announce his presidential candidacy on Monday at Liberty University, a Baptist institution in Lynchburg, Va.\n\nBut Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the libertarian favorite, is not willing to cede ground on the evangelical vote. On Thursday, he will meet with 60 to 90 evangelical leaders in Washington, according to his office.\n\nHis hope is that, come the Iowa caucuses, Cruz fans will be left mournfully playing a piccolo.\n\n\u2014 Jason Horowitz\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton is caught between the dueling forces of teachers and donors on education.\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida appears to be quite comfortable raising money in Washington.\n\nA bipartisan deal on health care issues has hit a snag in the Senate.\n\nSenator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, will not seek re-election in 2016.\n\nThe New Yorker says Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is stronger than he might appear because he does not fear losing.\n\nThe National Review explains why Mr. Cruz can win.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida told the radio host Hugh Hewitt he would revoke President Obama\u2019s possible Iran deal if he wins the White House.\n\nThe Hill weighs in on the hairdo Michelle Obama was wearing on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d\n\nFormer Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, had some harsh words for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr, according to Politico.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150325064810, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 25, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "The New York Times", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "The New York Times", "byl": "The New York Times", "twitter": {"description": "Another foreign leader will address Congress in the House on Wednesday, but this one is more likely to be thanking President Obama and America than criticizing the president.", "title": "Today in Politics: Afghan President Addresses Congress", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/25/today-in-politics-afghan-president-addresses-congress/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/25/us/politics/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003592152, "description": "Another foreign leader will address Congress in the House on Wednesday, but this one is more likely to be thanking President Obama and America than criticizing the president.", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 25, 2015", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-03252015.jsonp", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1427280490, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2015-04-21T19:33:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150421193341, "PUD": 20150325, "pdate": 20150325, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/25/us/politics/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "Another foreign leader will address Congress in the House on Wednesday, but this one is more likely to be thanking President Obama and America than criticizing the president.", "title": "Today in Politics: Afghan President Addresses Congress", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/25/today-in-politics-afghan-president-addresses-congress/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/25/us/politics/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Today in Politics: Afghan President Addresses Congress", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/25/us/politics/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani/25firstdraft-newsletter-ghani-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Cheney stuck to attacking Mr. Obama and steered clear of presidential politics, said Mr. Cole, the committee chairman in 2008.\nAnother foreign leader will address Congress in the House on Wednesday, but this one is more likely to be thanking President Obama and America than criticizing the president.\nMarch Madness is getting increasingly political as the tournament rolls on, and President Obama is using the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act to take a victory lap, of sorts.\nPhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington, where Republicans have been partying with former Vice President Dick Cheney while Congress is nearing a budget breakthrough.\nThe National Review explains why Mr. Cruz can win."}
