â€” Authorities in Moore County recovered the remains of a woman from a swamp behind an Aberdeen home Friday night.

A family that lives on Sun Road noticed the body while out boating and called police, investigators said.

Aberdeen Deputy Chief Carl Calasacco said the body was fully clothed and that he was unsure how long it had been there.

Right now, he added, police don't suspect foul play, but he said that could change based on autopsy results, which could be available as early as Saturday.

Police are also awaiting a positive identification of the remains.

Officers have been investigating for the past month the disappearance of Amy Sands, a Cameron woman last seen on Nov. 5. Her 1999 red Jeep Cherokee was found Nov. 11 at a local restaurant.

Authorities would not say whether the body might be Sands'.

Anyone with information about her whereabouts is asked to call the Aberdeen Police Department at 910-944-9721 or Crime Stoppers at 910-944-4561.
