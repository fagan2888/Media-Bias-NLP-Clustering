But, their first listeners \u2013 first century Jews in Galilee and Judea \u2013 heard much more challenging messages.\n\nOnly when we hear the parables as Jesus\u2019 own audience did can we fully experience their power and find ourselves surprised and challenged today.\n\nHere are four examples of Jesus\u2019 teachings that everybody gets wrong:\n\n1. The 'Parable of the Prodigal Son'\n\nThis parable is usually seen as a story of how our \u201cFather in heaven\u201d loves us regardless of how despicable our actions. This is a lovely message, and I would not want to dismiss it.\n\nIt is not, however, what first-century Jews would have heard. Jesus\u2019 Jewish audience already knew that their \u201cFather in heaven\u201d was loving, forgiving, and compassionate.\n\nIt is Luke who sets up a message of repenting and forgiving. Luke prefaces our parable with two shorter ones: the Parables of the Lost Sheep and the Lost Coin.\n\nThe evangelist concludes them with, \u201cThere will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.\u201d\n\nBut is this really what the parables are about? Jesus was not talking about ovine sin or coinage cupidity; sheep don\u2019t feel guilty and coins don\u2019t repent.\n\nMoreover, the man loses the sheep; the woman loses her coin. But God does not \u201close us.\u201d\n\nThe first two parables are not about repenting and forgiving. They are about counting: The shepherd noticed one sheep missing out of 100, and the woman noticed one coin missing from 10.\n\nAnd they searched, found, rejoiced, and celebrated. In doing so, they set up the third parable. The Prodigal Son story begins: \u201cThere was a man who had two sons \u2026 \u201d\n\nIf we focus on the one prodigal son, we mishear the opening. Every biblically literate Jew would know that if there are two sons, go with the younger: Abel over Cain, Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Ephraim over Manasseh.\n\nBut parables never go the way we want. We cannot identify with junior, who \u201csquandered all he had in dissolute living.\u201d\n\nNext, if we see the father as surprising when he welcomes junior home, we mishear again. Dad is simply delighted that junior has returned: He rejoices and throws a party. If we stop here, we\u2019ve failed to count.\n\nThe older brother \u2013 remember him? \u2013 hears music and dancing. Dad had enough time to hire the band and the caterer, but he never searched for his older son. He had two sons, and he didn\u2019t count.\n\nOur parable is less about forgiving and more about counting, and making sure everyone counts. Whom have we lost? If we don\u2019t count, it may be too late.\n\n2. The 'Parable of the Good Samaritan'\n\nOur usual understanding of this famous story goes astray in several ways. Here are two.\n\nFirst, readers presume that a priest and Levite bypass the wounded man because they are attempting to avoid becoming \u201cunclean.\u201d Nonsense.\n\nAll this interpretation does is make Jewish Law look bad. The priest is not going up to Jerusalem where purity would be a concern \u2013 he is \u201cgoing down\u201d to Jericho.\n\nNo law prevents Levites from touching corpses, and there are numerous other reasons why ritual purity is not relevant here.\n\nJesus mentions priest and Levite because they set up a third category: Israelite. To mention the first two is to invoke the third.\n\nIf I say, \u201cLarry, Moe \u2026\u201d you will say \u201cCurly.\u201d However, to go from priest to Levite to Samaritan is like going from Larry to Moe to Osama bin Laden.\n\nThat analogy leads us to the second misreading.\n\nThe parable is often seen as a story of how the oppressed minority \u2013 immigrants, gay people, people on parole \u2013 are \u201cnice\u201d and therefore we should check our prejudices.\n\nSamaritans, then, were not the oppressed minority: They were the enemy. We know this not only from the historian Josephus, but also from Luke the evangelist.\n\nJust one chapter before our parable, Jesus seeks lodging in a Samaritan village, but they refuse him hospitality.\n\nMoreover, Samaria had another name: Shechem. At Shechem, Jacob\u2019s daughter Dinah is raped or seduced by the local prince. At Shechem, the murderous judge Abimelech is based.\n\nWe are the person in the ditch, and we see the Samaritan. Our first thought: \u201cHe\u2019s going to rape me. He\u2019s going to murder me.\u201d\n\nThen we realize: Our enemy may be the very person who will save us. Indeed, if we simply ask \u201cwhere is Samaria today?\u201d we can see the import of this parable for the Israeli/Palestinian crisis.\n\n3. The 'Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard'\n\nThis parable tells the story of a series of workers who come in at different points of the day, but the owner pays them all the same amount.\n\nThe parable is sometimes read with an anti-Jewish lens, so that the first-hired are the \u201cJews\u201d who resent the gentiles or the sinners entering into God\u2019s vineyard. Nonsense again.\n\nJesus\u2019 first listeners heard not a parable about salvation in the afterlife but about economics in present. They heard a lesson about how the employed must speak on behalf of those who lack a daily wage.\n\nThey also discovered a prompt for people with resources: Attend to those who do not have jobs, and make sure everyone has what is needed.\n\nJesus does not invent this idea of advocating for the unemployed and sharing resources. The same concerns occur in Jewish tradition from King David onward. But, unless we know the biblical and historical sources, again we will mishear the parable.\n\n4. The 'Parable of the Pearl of Great Price'\n\nThis parable describes a man who sells everything in order to obtain his prized pearl. It is usually allegorized to tell us about the centrality of faith, or the church, or Jesus, or the Kingdom of Heaven. But commentators cannot conclude what the pearl represents.\n\nPerhaps they are looking in the wrong place.\n\nWe don\u2019t recognize the parable\u2019s initial absurdity today \u2013 the merchant (a wholesaler who sells us what we don\u2019t need at a price we cannot afford) sells everything he has for a pearl.\n\nHe can\u2019t eat it, or sit on it; it will not cover much if it\u2019s all he wears. But, he thinks this pearl will fulfill him.\n\nWhat if the parable challenges us to determine our own pearl of great price? If we know our ultimate concern, we should be less acquisitive. We won\u2019t sweat the small stuff.\n\nMore, we become better able to love our neighbors, because we will know what is most important to them.\n\nJesus\u2019 short stories provoke us because they tell us what, somehow, we already know to be true, but don\u2019t want to acknowledge.\n\nI am not a Christian, but I hear profound messages in these parables. If I as an outsider can be so moved by Jesus\u2019 stories, surely people who worship him as Lord and Savior can appreciate them even more.\n\nAmy-Jill Levine is the author of \"Short Stories by Jesus: The Enigmatic Parables of a Controversial Rabbi,\" and a professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies at Vanderbilt University Divinity School and College of Arts and Sciences.
