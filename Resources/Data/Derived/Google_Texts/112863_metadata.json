Can the state afford to add millions more low-income residents to the rolls and improve preventative care?, 01.10.13.\n\nPatient \u201cHilde\u201d presented the online diagnosticians with a stumper: The 48-year-old Sacramento woman suffers from what she describes as a significantly diminished sense of taste.\n\nSweeter foods, especially, had lost their richness, she explained. \u201cI can even differentiate herbs \u2026 but nothing tastes flavorful,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I can recognize you and tell you the color and style of your clothes, but my ability to see patterns or textures is fuzzy.\u201d\n\nFor almost five years now, brick-and-mortar health-care establishments have been unable to provide answers. So Hilde turned to a relatively new website that marshals people\u2019s growing tolerance for crowdsourced solutions to agonizing medical mysteries.\n\nSince launching in April 2013, CrowdMed has hosted more than 400 cases from across North America and Europe. People in pain and discomfort fill out online profiles detailing their symptoms, medical histories, lifestyles and any medications they\u2019re taking, and can offer cash rewards to sweeten the odds of a helpful hypothesis.\n\nAfter their free 30-day trials, users are emailed individual reports with the highest-scoring possible diagnoses at the top, followed by a list of every other suggested answer. They\u2019re instructed to bring their reports to their doctors to collaborate on the course forward.\n\nCEO and founder Jared Heyman said most doctors actually welcome the results, but allows that there is another camp. \u201cThe other reaction we get is, \u2019Oh no, something from the Internet,\u2019\u201d he laughed.\n\nRepresentatives from Kaiser Permanente and Sutter Health declined to comment.\n\nIt may sound insane, asking strangers for medical advice, but CrowdMed officials say their buzzy Silicon Valley startup has proven faster, cheaper and more accurate than traditional medicine.\n\n\u201cOf the patients we\u2019ve been able to contact, 80 percent reported receiving accurate diagnostic suggestions, and 50 percent said that we brought them closer to a correct diagnosis or cure,\u201d said spokeswoman Ann Murray.\n\nCrowdMed surveys its users at the end of 30-day free trials and 90-day paid trials.\n\nAccording to internal figures, the average CrowdMed user was sick eight years, consulted eight different physicians and spent $65,000 by the time he or she came to the site.\n\nThose whose cases haven\u2019t been satisfactorily cracked during the free 30-day time frame can keep profiles up at $99 a month or purchase 60-day or 90-day subscription packages.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, anyone can sign up to be a medical detective, but only those detectives who offer correct diagnoses earn points that increase their ratings and, thus, influence.\n\nThat point system determines how much weight the website\u2019s algorithms give to certain diagnoses and also which detectives are eligible for a share of any offered reward. So does the level of consensus among detectives.\n\n\u201cWe give patients every diagnosis suggested,\u201d Heyman said, but tell patients they should only put their confidence in the most likely ones listed at the top. \u201cWe want to strike a balance, because you never know where that needle in a haystack can come from.\u201d\n\nThe website is the creation of the 36-year-old Heyman, who watched his younger sister struggle with an undiagnosed genetic mutation for three years. As the story goes, the family cycled through two-dozen doctors and $100,000 in medical expenses without solving her immobilizing condition. Finally, in 2006, a team of experts diagnosed the young woman\u2019s rare condition.\n\nThe family\u2019s shared frustration eventually inspired the website that counts a Sacramento woman among its 133 currently active cases. The otherwise healthy Hilde has no allergies and hasn\u2019t undergone chemotherapy. She even passed a smell test at an ear, nose and throat clinic. A zinc prescription did nothing to revive her taste buds.\n\n\u201cMy attitude to date has been, \u2019if this is my chronic problem, I\u2019m more fortunate that others,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I would still like to get at the root cause and try to solve it.\u201d\n\nAt press time, her case had been on the website 82 days, with submissions from four medical detectives.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Raheem F.
