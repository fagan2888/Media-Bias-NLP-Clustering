Bear hands, slimy squid tentacles, being electro-magnetically hot, wiping out any computer you come into contact with, the list goes on. And it seems that, almost all of the Obamacare navigators turned out to be Inhuman as well, so they aren\u2019t in a position to assist. Looks like not enough background checks were done there.\n\nIn Britain, however, the National Health Service has stepped up and promised full coverage of any British Inhuman needs. However, due to the winter rush, those affected have been asked to stay in their cocoons if at all possible for the next six months, while they work through the backlog.\n\nComics courtesy of Orbital Comics, currently exhibiting the work of some rather well known comic artists from Portland.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the healthcare.gov website wasn't under enough strain as it is, Inhumanity #1 just added a whole load of traffic.
