Hideki Matsuyama was tied with Langer at 1-under, hoping to become the first man from Japan to win a major.\n\nSpieth was at 3-under 213.\n\n\u201cUnderstand this is the position I wanted to be in after 54 holes and not think about the finish to today\u2019s round,\u201d Spieth said.\n\nKaufman, who qualified for his first Masters by closing with a 61 to win in Las Vegas in October, kept stress to a minimum and rolled in one last birdie down the hill on the 16th for a 69, the lowest score of the day.\n\nThe biggest surprise was Langer, who won the first of his two Masters in 1993, three months before Spieth was born. On the 30th anniversary of Jack Nicklaus becoming the oldest Masters champion at 46, Langer is two shots behind in his quest to become the oldest major champion by 10 years. Langer ran off three consecutive birdies on the back nine and posted a 70.\n\nHe even beat Day, who was hitting it some 60 yards by him. Day managed a 71, and thanks to Spieth\u2019s late implosion, goes into the final round on Sunday just three shots behind.\n\nDay was tied with Dustin Johnson and Danny Willett, each of whom shot a 72. Willett who didn\u2019t think he was going to be able to play the Masters for the first time until his wife gave birth to their first child.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spieth shot a 1-over-par 73 on Saturday, but still held a one-shot lead over Smylie Kaufman and a cast of challengers that also includes Day and 58-year-old Bernhard Langer.", "Author": "Doug Ferguson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Spieth shot a 1-over-par 73 on Saturday, but still held a one-shot lead over Smylie Kaufman and a cast of challengers that also includes Day and 58-year-old Bernhard Langer.", "title": "Jordan Spieth struggles again, still holds lead after third round of Masters", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/9/jordan-spieth-stumbles-masters-holds-lead/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/09/AP_391466013144.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/09/AP_391466013144.jpg", "title": "Jordan Spieth struggles again, still holds lead after third round of M", "description": "Spieth shot a 1-over-par 73 on Saturday, but still held a one-shot lead over Smylie Kaufman and a cast of challengers that also includes Day and 58-year-old Bernhard Langer.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jordan Spieth, The Masters"}, "article_summary": "\u201cUnderstand this is the position I wanted to be in after 54 holes and not think about the finish to today\u2019s round,\u201d Spieth said.\nAUGUSTA, Ga. \u2014 What looked to be another march to the Masters title for Jordan Spieth suddenly turned into a walk on the wild side on Saturday.\nThe biggest surprise was Langer, who won the first of his two Masters in 1993, three months before Spieth was born.\nHe had a one-shot lead over Smylie Kaufman, Spieth\u2019s junior golf buddy who is playing in the Masters for the first time.\nUltimately, Spieth was still in the lead for the seventh consecutive round at Augusta National \u2014 one away from another green jacket \u2014 but he sure made it hard on himself."}
