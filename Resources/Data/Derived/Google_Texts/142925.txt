Charles Krauthammer accused President Obama of “one deception after another” over ObamaCare Monday on "Special Report With Bret Baier."

Referring to President Obama’s interview with NBC News in which the president apologized to those losing their health care due to the Affordable Care Act, saying the law was not appropriately crafted, Krauthammer said, "All you had to do to craft the law appropriately was to have a line that would say anybody who has insurance and likes it will keep it."

Instead, the syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor added, “The crafting was done precisely to throw people off insurance and the president said exactly the opposite.

"This is one deception after another."
