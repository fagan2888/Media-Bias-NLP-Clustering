Ski patrol contacted the San Miguel County Sheriff\u2019s office, which dispatched a search and rescue team.\n\nThe rescue team found the injured man and prepared him to be airlifted. The skier was taken to the Telluride Airport where an emergency medical crew was waiting.\n\n\u201cWe were able to get to him, and he didn\u2019t have to spend the night out there cold and injured. The next guy might not be so lucky,\u201d Sheriff Deputy Mike Kimball Jr. said in a statement. \u201cDo not ski into Bear Creek if you are not prepared for self-rescue, period.\u201d\n\nThe man was wearing a helmet and an avalanche beacon.
