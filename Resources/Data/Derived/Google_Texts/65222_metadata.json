Photo: Anthony Johnson\n\nPeter V'landys has described as \"complete rubbish\" claims Racing NSW is still yet to foot the Werribee quarantine bill from Gordon Lord Byron's visit for The Championships this year at the same time the international scouting mission for next year's showpiece heats up.\n\nFairfax Media understands Racing Victoria is squabbling with its northern counterpart over an alleged outstanding fee, believed to be about $20,000, from Gordon Lord Byron's two-week quarantine stay at Werribee in March.\n\nRacing NSW is yet to establish a permanent quarantine centre and used Werribee, a hotbed of activity during the Melbourne spring carnival, to help lure this year's international visitors after covering their travelling expenses to Australia.\n\nBut relations between the country's two premier racing states have soured over Gordon Lord Byron's visit almost nine months ago, with chief executive V'landys adamant Racing NSW has settled the amount quoted for the Irish star's visit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about the claim, V'landys said: \"It's complete rubbish and muck-raking. We were quoted an amount and have paid the amount in total. They've asked for more and naturally we've asked for more documentation why.\n\n\"We have paid the fees that were quoted and there's some fees that weren't quoted and we're in discussions with [them about]. In fact, we actually paid in excess of what we were quoted - but we're questioning some of the amounts they've added onto it.\"\n\nIt is believed Racing Victoria asked a substantial amount, as high as $80,000 in total, for Gordon Lord Byron's stay at Werribee. The two states are already heavily invested in the bitter struggle for the vision rights from NSW and Victorian racing that is dividing broadcasters TVN and Sky Channel.\n\nGordon Lord Byron and Hana's Goal were the only two international horses to travel to Sydney for the inaugural The Championships in April. Both provided priceless exposure around the world for the Sydney carnival, having returned home with group 1 wins.\n\nGordon Lord Byron won the George Ryder Stakes before Hana's Goal ploughed through the wet to claim the All Aged Stakes, becoming the first Japanese horse to win in Sydney.\n\nRacing NSW and the Australian Turf Club have intensified efforts to attract more stars from around the globe for the fast-approaching The Championships in 2015 after the NSW government pledged $10 million in August to guarantee the event's short-term future.\n\nV'landys said a hit list of \"six or seven\" horses had been drawn up and every indication was the arrivals would far outstrip the international representation for the inaugural Sydney racing showpiece.\n\n\"We're certainly having discussions with the connections and we're very, very happy with the response we're getting from these people,\" V'landys said. \"We have the chance of getting six or seven international horses.\n\n\"We're talking both Asia and Europe - with two in Europe and quite a few in Asia. We're overwhelmed with the response we're getting from them. I'm pretty confident we'll get a lot more than the two [this year]. We want to limit and we don't want too many, but the response we're getting [is incredible].\"\n\nThree-time Melbourne Cup runner-up Red Cadeaux has been mentioned as a potential Sydney Cup coup after trainer Ed Dunlop hinted he would be open to an Australian return next year. The 150th running of the Sydney Cup will offer an inflated $1.6 million in prizemoney.\n\nBut the Dubai carnival looms as a more logical option for the globetrotter after he arrived back at his Newmarket base in Britain over the weekend.
