A new 13th edition of its biennial study entitled: \u0093The U.S. Weight Loss & Diet Control Market\u0094 has been released.\n\n\n\n\u0093Flat seems to be \u0093the new growth\u0094 in the U.S. weight loss market, affected by consumer mega-trends such as the new mantra to \u0093eat clean\u0094 and shun highly processed foods and artificial ingredients and preservatives in favor of fresh produce. Dieters are also confused, bombarded with a dizzying variety of weight loss options, tools and claims. Programs have to be compelling to cut through all the apathy.\u0094, according to Research Director, John LaRosa.\n\n\n\nMajor Report Findings:\n\n\n\nMarketdata analysts estimate that the total U.S. weight loss market was worth $64.0 billion in 2014, up 2.3% over the prior year. In 2013, the market\u0092s value actually declined, by 0.8% to $62.56 billion. We project basically the same level of growth this year in 2015, a 2.4% gain to $65.49 billion.\n\n83% of America\u0092s 108 million dieters favor \u0093do-it-yourself\u0094 weight loss programs accessed from home online or by phone, via diet books, smartphone apps or celebrity diet plans (fad diets). We expect this rate to remain above 80% in 2015.\n\nThree mega-trends are hurting commercial programs such as Weight Watchers: \u0093clean eating\u0094, the use of free and low-cost diet/fitness apps, and stronger competition from medical programs that are taking advantage of insurance coverage of obesity counseling under Obamacare.\n\nSurprisingly, Herbalife, an MLM company, is now the #2 weight loss company in the World, by sales, with estimated North American sales of weight loss products of $596 million in 2014 (meal replacements), second only to Weight Watchers and larger than both Jenny Craig and NutriSystem.\n\nThere is a paradigm shift taking place: with less emphasis on diet products (soft drinks, artificial sweeteners, Rx drugs) and more emphasis on services (counseling, surgery, diet programs, health clubs, etc.). Diet services now account for 52% of the total market\u0092s value, vs. 48% for foods and other products. Weight loss PRODUCT sales fell by 0.1% in 2014, versus a 4.2% increase in SERVICES revenues.\n\nA major development affecting this market was the 2014 implementation of \u0093Obamacare\u0094 (The Affordable Care Act). The ACA mandates insurance coverage of obesity screening and counseling in 23 states, for persons with a BMI of 30+. This benefit has to date not been adequately explained and communicated to physicians and the general public, but is a game changer for medical weight loss programs. Consumers can literally pay zero out of pocket versus $1,000-$1,500 for a 3-4 month commercial program. But, counseling can only be by \u0093qualified providers\u0094 (MDs, PAs, Nurses, RDs)\u0097personnel that commercial programs mostly don\u0092t use for coaching.\n\nMLM (multi-level marketing) has become a major force in the distribution of weight loss products in the United States, valued at an estimated $2.2 billion. Diet products sold via MLMs represented 8.3% of a total $26 billion in diet product sales, up from just 1.6% in 2001.\n\nContrary to popular belief, diet and fitness apps for the smartphone are NOT the PRIMARY reason for lower enrollments at the large commercial chains. The thing that dooms diet companies more than anything else is bad management and not serving customers well. This is the case at Weight Watchers, where they have no special programs for: overweight Hispanics, African-Americans, teens, persons with food allergies, pre- and post-menopausal women, diabetics and seniors. Huge potential exists but companies must do the work to create custom plans, and communicate this to prospects. Good counselors are a key asset.\n\nConvenience and price is now crucial. There are 1,900 (and growing) retail drugstore mini-clinics at CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid now offering weight loss plans. It\u0092s critical for diet companies to reach dieters where they shop, work out, and work, 7 days a week. Mini-clinics have developed their own weight loss programs, some based on the DASH diet (#1 rated diet last four years). This represents new competition for commercial diet companies.\n\nMeal replacements is one of the bright spots\u0097popular because they are safe, easy to private label, and they fit in well with DIY or structured programs. Marketdata estimates that 6.5 million Americans use them. OTC, non-prescription diet pills constituted a $2.05 billion market, compared to a $3.3 billion market for meal replacements, but lately diet pills growth has been faster than meal replacements.\n\nThe 2015 \u0093diet season\u0094 is shaping up to be a rough one. Factors: lots of winter snowstorms hurt attendance in northern states, the DIY trend, plus complacent dieters, weak disposable income, and a lack of compelling new programs or innovations by most diet companies. \u0093The U.S. weight loss market is moving in two directions: retail and medical. Within retail, MLM is still strong as a distribution method. Within medical programs, growth is taking place via franchising, but the opposite is true for commercial programs, where high overhead makes it tough to operate franchised brick & mortar centers at a profit.\u0094, according to John LaRosa.\n\n\n\nAbout The Study\n\n\u0093The U.S. Weight Loss & Diet Control Market\u0094, 13th Edition, April 2015, is a 435-page multi-client, off-the-shelf market research study.
