If Pistorius is acquitted of murder, he could still be sent to jail for years if it\u2019s found he acted negligently in Steenkamp\u2019s death. Pistorius has admitted firing the four shots that killed Steenkamp on Valentine\u2019s Day last year.\n\nPistorius says he mistook his girlfriend, a model and budding reality TV star, for an intruder and killed her accidentally. The prosecution alleges the athlete intentionally killed her after a loud argument, which was heard by neighbors.\n\nMasipa was explaining her reasoning behind the upcoming verdicts in the case against Pistorius, and said there were \u201cjust not enough facts\u201d to support the finding of premeditated murder in Steenkamp\u2019s fatal shooting.\n\nAs the judge spoke, Pistorius wept quietly, his shoulders shaking as he sat on a wooden bench.\n\nMasipa earlier told Pistorius he could remain seated on the bench while she read her verdict out and until she asked him to stand for the judgment. She then proceeded to explain her assessment of the testimonies of some of the 37 witnesses in the trial, including Pistorius\u2019 testimony in his own defense.\n\nIn that assessment, Masipa described Pistorius as a \u201cvery poor witness\u201d who had lost his composure on the stand and was at times \u201cevasive\u201d, but she emphasized that did not mean he was guilty of murder.\n\nEarlier, the 66-year-old judge cast doubt on witness accounts of hearing a woman\u2019s screams, a key part of the prosecution\u2019s case. Masipa said \u201cnone of the witnesses had ever heard the accused cry or scream, let alone when he was anxious,\u201d apparently acknowledging the possibility of the defense\u2019s argument that Pistorius had been the person screaming in a high-pitched voice after discovering he had fatally shot Steenkamp.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A South Africa judge ruled Thursday that probable cause had not been established to convict the Olympian of murder", "title": "Murder charges against Oscar Pistorius dropped", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A South Africa judge ruled Thursday that probable cause had not been established to convict the Olympian of murder", "title": "Murder charges against Oscar Pistorius dropped", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/murder_charges_against_oscar_pistorius_dropped/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/oscar_pistorius.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A South Africa judge ruled Thursday that probable cause had not been established to convict the Olympian of murder", "title": "Murder charges against Oscar Pistorius dropped", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/oscar_pistorius.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Gerald Imray and Christopher Torchia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Olympics, Oscar Pistorius, reeva steenkamp, South Africa", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0df8\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Olympics, Oscar Pistorius, reeva steenkamp, South Africa, NewsPRETORIA, South Africa (AP) \u2014 The judge in Oscar Pistorius\u2019 murder trial appeared to be heading for a culpable homicide finding Thursday after ruling out both premeditated murder and murder verdicts in the shooting death of the double-amputee Olympic athlete\u2019s girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.\nJudge Thokozile Masipa said prosecutors have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Pistorius, 27, is guilty of premeditated murder.\nPistorius has admitted firing the four shots that killed Steenkamp on Valentine\u2019s Day last year.\nIf Pistorius is acquitted of murder, he could still be sent to jail for years if it\u2019s found he acted negligently in Steenkamp\u2019s death.\nAs the judge spoke, Pistorius wept quietly, his shoulders shaking as he sat on a wooden bench."}
