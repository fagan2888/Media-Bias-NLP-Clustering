The Daily Show recently poked fun at the Republican Party's efforts to draw female voters for the Nov. 4 midterm elections by using parodies of The Bachelor and Obamacare commercials, gender stereotypes and a sexually explicit meme and also making a big ol' mess.

In a parody video titled "Democalypse 2014 - Winning the Lady Vote," the show's Senior Women's Issues Correspondent and comedienne Kristen Schaal, also known for roles on 30 Rock and Flight of the Conchords, states that "Republicans have finally figured out what's most important to women."

"Menfolk! Women don't see candidates as potential leaders!" she said in the segment, which aired on Wednesday. "We see them as possible soul mates."

According to results of a YouGov poll published on Sept. 29, if the election were held today, about 48 percent of female voters would choose a Democratic candidate, while 30 percent would pick a Republican one. The survey also found that Democrats were especially popular with unmarried women, showing that 52 percent of them would vote for a candidate from the party.
