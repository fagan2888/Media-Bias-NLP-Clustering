Specifically, Mrs. Clinton claimed it was difficult to pay for her mortgages and her daughter\u2019s education when she had her husband wrapped their White House run \u2014 comments that were met by shock and even outrage from many in the nation, who accused her of playing populist politics and pointed to her family\u2019s millions in wealth.\n\nIn his interview, Mr. Simmons waxed on \u2014 a bit sarcastically.\n\n\u201cThe 1 percent pays 80 percent of all taxes,\u201d he said, Mediaite reported. \u201cFifty percent of the population of the U.S. pays no taxes. The 1 percent provides all the jobs for everybody else. If the 1 percent didn\u2019t exist, there would be chaos and the American economy would drop dead. Try being nice to rich people. I don\u2019t remember the last poor person who gave me a job.\u201d\n\nMr. Simmons is a vocal conservative who publicly supported Mitt Romney for president in 2012. On top of that, he\u2019s pretty blunt.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Simmons also said: \u201cPeople often confuse, at least in my estimation, my pride and self-confidence with arrogance. Because they are not used to people who have an in-your-face, \u2018take it or leave it, this is how I am\u2019 point of view. I\u2019m more like an animal in the jungle that [urinates] on the ground and doesn\u2019t ask your permission. \u2018This is me, this is my territory.\u2019 It\u2019s simply defining who I am and what I stand for. \u2026 Others simply hold their opinions to themselves and never say who they are. \u2026 You will always know who I am. You don\u2019t have to like it; that\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "KISS lead singer Gene Simmons is decidedly not taking a page out of Hillary Clinton's book, and rather than trying to hide his wealth or run from his riches is instead publicly flaunting it -- saying simply that living the 1 percent lifestyle is amazing.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "KISS lead singer Gene Simmons is decidedly not taking a page out of Hillary Clinton\u2019s book, and rather than trying to hide his wealth or run from his riches is instead publicly flaunting it \u2014 saying simply that living the 1 percent lifestyle is amazing.", "title": "KISS rocker Gene Simmons touts 1 percent life: \u2018It\u2019s fantastic\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/11/kiss-rocker-gene-simmons-touts-1-percent-life-its-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/11/fea1bdbf3952010e510f6a706700ad62.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/11/fea1bdbf3952010e510f6a706700ad62.jpg", "description": "KISS lead singer Gene Simmons is decidedly not taking a page out of Hillary Clinton's book, and rather than trying to hide his wealth or run from his riches is instead publicly flaunting it -- saying", "card": "summary", "title": "KISS rocker Gene Simmons touts 1 percent life: \u2018It\u2019s fanta"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
