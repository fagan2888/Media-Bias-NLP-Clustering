I had been perplexed by Rob Bironas’ actions on the night he died, knowing his reputation as an all-around good guy. However, after news of the toxicology report, I am no longer surprised.

The article stated he had a blood-alcohol level of .218 and that “Valium was also detected, but at a level so low to have a negligible effect.” But I know firsthand about a little-known side effect of Valium, “extreme rage,” especially when combined with alcohol.

Thirty-four years ago, just before going out partying with friends, I took a 2-milligram (low dose) Valium from my new prescription. With my “negligible” dose of Valium and a few drinks, the world seemed to disappear, and to this day I do not remember most of that night. My memory begins when I woke up in ICU the next morning. Over the years in talking to witnesses, I now know I was in an extreme rage and could easily have killed anyone who crossed me. To this day that scares me to death. I no longer drink alcohol, nor will I touch Valium.

I hope Mr. Bironas’ family understands that he probably had no idea of how much he had to drink and no realization of what he was doing. Please let everyone know that Valium and alcohol can be deadly, no matter the dosage!
