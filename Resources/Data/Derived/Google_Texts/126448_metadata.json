Bush and the Republicans more than President Barack Obama and the Democrats for the country's economic problems is dropping.\n\nFollow @politicaltickerFollow @psteinhausercnn\n\nThirty-six percent of those questioned rate the current economic conditions as good. That's up four percentage points from December and it is the highest level since January 2008, a year before Obama entered the White House. Sixty-four percent continue to say the economy is in poor shape.\n\n\"Economic confidence seems particularly high in the Midwest, which might give an early boost to the Democratic Party's chances of holding on to two key Senate seats in Iowa and Michigan,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.\n\nFive years into Obama's presidency, only a third of the public believes that Obama and the Democrats are primarily responsible for the country's current economic problems.\n\nMore Americans continue to blame former President Bush and the Republicans. But the number who say the GOP is more responsible - now at 44% - has dipped below the 50% mark for the first time since Bush left the White House. Fourteen percent blame both parties equally.\n\nThe CNN survey came on the eve of the release by the Labor Department of the January jobs report.\n\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from Jan. 31-Feb. 2, with 1,010 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.\n\n\n\nCNN Political Editor Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington (CNN) -- Although nearly two-thirds of Americans still give the nation's economy a thumbs down, the percentage who rate the current economic conditions as good now stands at its highest level in six years, according to a new national poll.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "CNN Poll: Is Bush still to blame for economy?", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/06/cnn-poll-is-bush-still-to-blame-for-economy/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/111004051021-cash-money-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Washington (CNN) -- Although nearly two-thirds of Americans still give the nation's economy a thumbs down, the percentage who rate the current economic conditions as good now stands at its highest level in six years, according to a new national poll.", "title": "CNN Poll: Is Bush still to blame for economy?"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "cnn/orc poll, economy, polls, cnn political unit", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd440d\"", "article_summary": "The CNN survey came on the eve of the release by the Labor Department of the January jobs report.\nMore Americans continue to blame former President Bush and the Republicans.\nFollow @politicaltickerFollow @psteinhausercnnThirty-six percent of those questioned rate the current economic conditions as good.\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from Jan. 31-Feb. 2, with 1,010 adults nationwide questioned by telephone.\nFive years into Obama's presidency, only a third of the public believes that Obama and the Democrats are primarily responsible for the country's current economic problems."}
