If they are realistic, they realize that appealing primarily to white rural Christian fundamentalist males over 55 has its limitations. As a result, some of them have been making an attempt at youth outreach. But when social conservatives try to flaunt their hipster credentials and demonstrate that they aren\u2019t as old, as white, as male, as uptight and sexually repressed as you think, the results can be embarrassing or awkward. And in many cases, their message is still one of repression.\n\nBelow are nine examples of attempts to use \u201chipster\u201d imagery to sell a socially conservative or Republican message.\n\n1. Chicks on the Right\n\nMiriam Weaver, aka Mockarena, and Amy Jo Clark, aka Daisy, the Indiana-based Republicans who publish the Chicks on the Right website, acknowledge that the Republican Party has an image problem in the United States. They assert that they started their blog because \u201cconservatism needs a big-time makeover\u201d and they are tired of conservatives being stereotyped as \u201cstodgy old white guys.\u201d Just to show you how hip they are, Daisy and Mockarena (who host a political talk show on WIBC-FM in Indianapolis) declare that they prefer skinny jeans, miniskirts and stiletto heels over a more buttoned-up conservatism. But once readers get past the fun imagery, Chicks on the Right is full of the usual Christian right clich\u00e9s one hears nonstop on AM talk radio: caring about the poor is \u201csocialism,\u201d the ACLU is anti-religion and anti-family, Sarah Palin is a \u201ctrue patriot,\u201d health insurance should not cover female contraception, etc. Chicks on the Right is an obvious attempt to lure young women over to the Republican Party, but Daisy and Mockarena certainly aren\u2019t trying to accomplish that with a lot of original ideas.\n\n2. 1Flesh\n\nAs backward and retrograde as they are, Christian right websites that favor a hipster look can be good for comic relief. 1Flesh.org would be funny if the site weren\u2019t promoting a blatantly irresponsible message. Full of MTV-ish graphics, the site describes 1Flesh as \u201ca grassroots movement dedicated to bringing great sex to the entire universe through the power of organic family planning.\u201d But it\u2019s actually a far-right Christian fundamentalist site that encourages unprotected sex and urges young couples to avoid using \u201cunnatural\u201d contraception methods such as condoms and birth control pills (thus increasing the risk of unplanned pregnancies). The phrase \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d is often used on the right, but when it comes to encouraging responsible sexual behavior, 1Flesh fails miserably.\n\n3. Jason \u201cMolotov\u201d Mitchell and Illuminati Pictures\n\nFilmmaker/videographer Jason \u201cMolotov\u201d Mitchell and his wife Patricia, aka DJ Dolce, are big on youth outreach and alternative rock imagery. Molotov has tattoos, DJ Dolce has a nose stud, and Molotov heads an independent film/video company called Illuminati Pictures. But when it comes to religion and politics, no one will mistake them for ex-members of Rage Against the Machine any time soon. Molotov and Dolce are far-right Christian fundamentalists and Tea Party admirers who openly support the draconian Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which previously proposed the death penalty for homosexual acts (the most recent version of the bill called for life in prison instead of execution). Molotov is on friendly terms with one of the bill\u2019s most vocal supporters: Ugandan anti-gay crusader Martin Ssempa, whom Molotov has described as a \u201cgreat guy.\u201d Molotov is also a vocal birther, promoting the ludicrous notion that President Obama isn\u2019t really a U.S. citizen.\n\n4. Christian Nymphos\n\n1Flesh.org isn\u2019t the only website using sexual imagery to sell Christian conservatism. Another is Christian Nymphos, which bills itself as a site that promotes \u201cmarried sex, spicy the way God intended it.\u201d This amusing site stresses that being a nymphomaniac is a positive \u2014 that is, providing one is married. Christian Nymphos addresses a long list of sexual topics, which is certainly a departure from all the fundamentalists who don\u2019t think sex should even be discussed in public. Some of their positions are relatively liberal: For example, the site says nothing in the Bible expressly forbids anal sex or oral sex among married couples, and they aren\u2019t necessarily against softcore BDSM for married heterosexuals. However, the site is very anti-porn and opposes all sex outside of marriage, kinky or vanilla.\n\n5. The Cool Conservative\n\nFed up with what they consider the \u201ccultural coastal elites of Hollywood and Manhattan,\u201d some modern-day Republicans insist that liberals and progressives don\u2019t have the market cornered on either fun or intellect. One of the sites that likes to think of itself as having a hip, humorous, intellectual bent is the Cool Conservative, which describes itself as an \u201copinion and intelligence depot for the savvy, witty and well-informed\u201d and asserts, \u201cIt is the movement of the left and the establishment media that have decided that liberals are cool and that conservatives are nerdy and stodgy. ENOUGH OF THAT!\u201d But for a site that prides itself on intellect, the Cool Conservative says a lot of ludicrous things \u2014 for example, Obama is anti-military (never mind the fact that he ordered 17,000 more troops deployed in Afghanistan in 2009), the Affordable Care Act is socialized medicine (never mind the fact that it was greatly influenced by private insurance companies and the Republican ideas of the Heritage Foundation and Mitt Romney) and Obama promotes illegal immigration (never mind the fact that deportations reached an all-time high under his administration). If one equates \u201ccoolness\u201d with blatant disregard for facts, the Cool Conservative is the essence of cool.\n\n6. You Can Run International\n\nThe far-right television evangelists who rallied Republican \u201cvalues voters\u201d back in the 1980s \u2014 James Robison, Jimmy Swaggart, Pat Robertson, the late Jerry Falwell, among others \u2014 had no kind words for rock music, which they considered music of the devil. To them, Christian rock was a contradiction in terms. But Bradlee Dean, founder of Christian rap-metal/alternative metal band Junkyard Prophet and the Minnesota-based youth outreach ministry You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International (YCRBYCHI), doesn\u2019t see it that way. His website youcanruninternational.com has an in-your-face, alt-rock look you won\u2019t find at the more staid PatRobertson.com. However, the bitterly anti-gay Dean (who has strong ties to Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann) is preaching very much the same far-right fundamentalist message Falwell and Swaggart were preaching 30 years ago \u2014 although Falwell probably wouldn\u2019t have liked Dean\u2019s tattoos.\n\n7. Pastor Mark Driscoll and the Mars Hill Church\n\nPastor Mark Driscoll, founder of the Mars Hill megachurch in Seattle, has made a point of distancing himself from the old television evangelist style of the 1980s. Driscoll wears jeans and biker boots rather than business suits and power ties in the pulpit, embraces the use of rock music in a church setting, sometimes uses profanity, and believes in using technology and social media as part of a Generation X and Generation Y outreach. But one need only spend some time at MarsHill.com to realize that Driscoll \u2014 despite his taste for alternative rock and casual attire \u2014 is every bit as fundamentalist and far-right as Swaggart or Robertson. Driscoll maintains a neo-Calvinist approach, preaching angrily against gays, feminists and any Christians he considers insufficiently fundamentalist.\n\n8. SexWithinMarriage.com\n\nAlthough SexWithinMarriage.com doesn\u2019t address quite as wide a variety of sexual topics as ChristianNyphos.org, it has a similar focus: candid sexual talk for married Christian evangelicals. The website bills itself as \u201chot and monogamous, just as God intended,\u201d and the site is full of headlines like, \u201cIs It OK Not to Swallow?,\u201d \u201cWant More Sex? Go to Bed Naked,\u201d \u201cIs Mutual Masturbation OK for Married Christians?,\u201d \u201cWhy Do Some Wives Like Their Hair Pulled?\u201d and \u201cShould Christians Mix Alcohol and Sex?\u201d The site even has an article on introductory BDSM for Christians. Unfortunately, SexWithinMarriage.com excludes singles from all the fun the site describes, unless, of course, they quit being single.\n\n9. Rey Swimwear\n\nDespite the fact that bikinis have been around since 1946, and became common on American beaches in the 1960s, actress/fashion designer Jessica Rey equates bikinis with a lack of modesty. She has been promoting her 1950s-influenced Rey Swimwear line since 2008. Citing the late Audrey Hepburn as an inspiration, Rey\u2019s site poses the question: \u201cWho says it has to be itsy bitsy?\u201d (a reference to Brian Hyland\u2019s 1960 hit \u201cItsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\u201d). There\u2019s nothing wrong with Rey making money selling one-piece swimsuits or offering them as an option for women, and the fact that the suits are manufactured in California instead of a sweatshop in Bangladesh deserves huge applause. But the key word is \u201coption\u201d: Rey\u2019s campaign against bikinis comes across as judgmental, giving the impression she is trying to shame women into not wearing them. If Rey thinks bikinis are too revealing, one can only imagine what she thinks of the nude and topless sunbathing that is perfectly legal on the beaches in Barcelona.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They want so badly to be hip \u2014 and yet they fail so spectacularly", "title": "\u201cHipster\u201d Christianity: 9 hilarious attempts by the religious right to be cool", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "They want so badly to be hip \u2014 and yet they fail so spectacularly", "title": "\u201cHipster\u201d Christianity: 9 hilarious attempts by the religious right to be cool", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/21/9_absurdly_embarrassing_attempts_by_the_religious_right_to_appear_hipster_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-21-at-8.35.07-AM-1280x605.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They want so badly to be hip \u2014 and yet they fail so spectacularly", "title": "\u201cHipster\u201d Christianity: 9 hilarious attempts by the religious right to be cool", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-21-at-8.35.07-AM-1280x605.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Henderson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Christianity, hipster, Religious Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f31\"", "article_summary": "1FleshAs backward and retrograde as they are, Christian right websites that favor a hipster look can be good for comic relief.\nBelow are nine examples of attempts to use \u201chipster\u201d imagery to sell a socially conservative or Republican message.\nTo them, Christian rock was a contradiction in terms.\nSexWithinMarriage.comAlthough SexWithinMarriage.com doesn\u2019t address quite as wide a variety of sexual topics as ChristianNyphos.org, it has a similar focus: candid sexual talk for married Christian evangelicals.\nThe phrase \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d is often used on the right, but when it comes to encouraging responsible sexual behavior, 1Flesh fails miserably."}
