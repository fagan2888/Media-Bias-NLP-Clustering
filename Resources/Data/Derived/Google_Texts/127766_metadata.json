That helps explain the dramatic partisan reversal in another question CNN asked \u2014 about which party respondents would vote for in their congressional district. Two months ago, Democrats had a 50\u201342 percent lead on that critical \u201cgeneric ballot\u201d question. Now, Republicans have taken a 49\u201344 lead. Other private polls taken in the last few days confirm the trend of the CNN poll.\n\nOf course, Democratic leaders insist that Obamacare won\u2019t hurt their party in the 2014 elections. House speaker Nancy Pelosi told a conference call with reporters this week that the bill she once said had to be passed \u201cso that you can find out what is in it\u201d was \u201cworth the trouble, it\u2019s going to be a glorious thing.\u201d She insisted it would help Democrats pick up House seats next year.\n\nSenate majority leader Harry Reid doesn\u2019t go so far as to rhapsodize like Pelosi about Obamacare, but he still insisted to The Hill newspaper on December 18 that \u201cfor sure it will be a net positive\u201d in the elections.\n\nPelosi and Reid have a point: A lot can happen politically over the next ten months. The economy could pick up significantly, although that\u2019s unlikely given all of the economic uncertainty President Obama has injected into business decisionmaking. Obamacare might stabilize and start to report enough success stories that public confidence improves, although that\u2019s more likely to happen after the midterm elections than before it. Republicans in some key states could repeat some of their 2012 mistakes: They could nominate either inartful disasters (think Todd Akin) or establishment moderates who prompt some Tea Party voters to drift into backing third-party candidates (think Denny Rehberg of Montana, who saw a Democratic senator win reelection with 48.6 percent of the vote while a Libertarian won nearly 7 percent).\n\nBut then again, things could always get worse for Democrats. At this same point before the 2010 midterms, Democrats held a six-point advantage in the generic-ballot test. Then Obamacare was rammed through Congress in the spring of 2010 and, as its details came to be known, Democrats became more unpopular. In the November elections it was Republicans who won the nationwide House vote by six points, picking up an astonishing 63 seats.\n\nWhat worries Democrats the most is that their base voters will be unenthusiastic about voting in a year when President Obama isn\u2019t himself on the ballot. The CNN poll has some evidence backing up that fear. It finds that only 22 percent of Democrats are currently extremely or very enthusiastic about voting. At the same time, 36 percent of Republicans can\u2019t wait to find a polling booth and register their discontent.\n\nPresident Obama is, as of now, a drag on Democratic candidates. A full 55 percent of adults say they are more likely to vote for a congressional candidate who opposes Obama than for one who backs his program.\n\nNumbers like that can have a real impact in swing states. Take Colorado, which was a key to Obama\u2019s victory in 2012 when he won it with 51.5 percent of the vote. But this month\u2019s Quinnipiac poll found Obama\u2019s approval in the state at just 36 percent. That has helped make Democratic senator Mark Udall\u2019s seat competitive. His \u201cdeserves re-election\u201d number has tumbled down to 41 percent, with 47 percent now saying he doesn\u2019t deserve a second term.\n\nRight now, Democratic control of the House looks more out of reach than ever and the Democrats\u2019 Senate majority is more in jeopardy than ever before. So far, Democrats are relying on patchwork fixes to Obamacare and they are refusing to address the internal contradictions of the Rube Goldberg machine they\u2019ve built. We\u2019ll see just how long Democrats who see themselves as vulnerable to defeat continue to accept the \u201chappy talk\u201d of leaders like Pelosi and Reid.
