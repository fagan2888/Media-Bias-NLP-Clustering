We need them pushing us to reform education, and rein in the cost of government-funded health care and retirement benefits. We need them to fight with us over the right amount of immigration and gun control; over the right level to set the minimum wage; over the right price to put on carbon pollution.\n\nDemocrats need Republicans to argue that military action is sometimes necessary and even just, and that our right to privacy must be balanced with our desire for security. We need them to remind us about the importance of faith, family, and personal responsibility. We need them to call us out when we\u2019re acting smug, self-righteous, and morally superior (oh, you didn\u2019t think people noticed?)\n\nDemocrats have plenty of other problems, too. Our politicians can be overly cautious, packaged, and calculating; a little too close to Wall Street and too tied to Washington. Our presidential candidates hover around the age of 70, our bench of talent is too shallow, and the dropoff in young voters since 2008 is one of the reasons we got our asses handed to us in the off-year elections of 2010 and 2014, costing us control of Congress as well as dozens of governorships and state legislatures.\n\n\n\nStill, for all of our faults and challenges, the Democratic Party is a functioning institution. Our leaders in Congress command a high degree of respect and loyalty among Democrats in the House and Senate. Our primary is a contest between a candidate of the center-left and the far-left who have both showered praise on the leader they\u2019re vying to succeed. And though Barack Obama has had his share of mistakes and disappointments, he has also quietly and steadily become one of the party\u2019s most beloved and consequential presidents of all time. If Obama could run for a third term against any candidate we\u2019ve seen, he would easily win.\n\nThe Republican Party, on the other hand, is no longer a functioning institution. It is a failed state, overrun by a nihilistic insurgency that is about to depose the establishment conservatives who let them in through the front door. It is a party that cannot govern itself, let alone the rest of the country.\n\nIn Washington, there is much pearl-clutching and think-piecing about how the storied party of Lincoln and Reagan could have possibly been hijacked by the likes of Donald Trump and former Zodiac Killer Ted Cruz\u2014as if, until this campaign, the Republican Party had been humming along smoothly as a big tent full of cheery capitalists enthused about freedom; as if we didn\u2019t know about the crazies they hide in the attic between elections.\n\nBut of course, we did know. Many of us have seen this chaos coming for quite some time.\n\nI first saw it in 2008, when the Republican Party\u2019s original grifter, Sarah Palin, told an angry mob that Barack Hussein Obama \u201cdidn\u2019t see America like they did\u201d; that he was \u201cpalling around with terrorists,\u201d plural. I saw it when she stood by and said nothing as the mob shouted \u201ctreason!\u201d and \u201cterrorist!\u201d I saw it in the look on John McCain\u2019s face when he was booed at a town hall meeting after telling a woman that Obama was a \u201cdecent family man,\u201d and not an untrustworthy Arab, like she believed\u2014a look that said, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d\n\nI saw the chaos coming in the early years of the Obama administration, when the opposition was less guttural but just as strident; when the Republican leadership ordered its members to oppose every part of the president\u2019s agenda; when they openly strategized that the path back to power required denying Obama a single moment of bipartisan cooperation\u2014even during a national crisis; even before he announced what was in a proposal; even when he offered a health-care plan that looked just like the Republican alternative to Hillarycare in 1993; a plan that was nearly identical to the reform that had just been passed by the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney.\n\nI saw the insurgency take shape in the apocalyptic response to a piece of legislation so radical that it maintained America\u2019s system of private health insurance. But this time, it wasn\u2019t enough for Republican politicians to simply oppose Obamacare\u2014to say, \u201cI think it costs too much because of X\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think it will work because of Y.\u201d Instead, they were advised by party strategists to tell their constituents that Obamacare was \u201ca government takeover\u201d because \u201ctakeovers are like coups\u2014they both lead to dictators and a loss of freedom.\u201d\n\nWhat followed were the absurdist claims that Obamacare included death panels. We heard perpetually confused brain surgeon Ben Carson say that the bill was \u201cthe worst thing that happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d We watched a congressman interrupt the President of the United States during a live national address to call him a liar for claiming that Obamacare wouldn\u2019t insure illegal immigrants\u2014which, by every account, was 100 percent true.\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that Tea Partiers took to the streets? Is it really so shocking that one of them waved a sign outside the Capitol which threatened gun violence if Republicans failed to stop the Affordable Care Act? And when the bill still passed with a majority of votes in both houses of Congress\u2014a radical strategy that Obama learned about from the Constitution\u2014is it terribly surprising that Tea Partiers were swept into power on a wave of anti-government rage that was stoked by Fox and Rush and millions of dollars in bullshit ads?\n\nWe saw what came next. Over and over, President Obama would try to negotiate with Speaker Boehner on taxes and spending. The negotiations would fail. And Official Washington would blame the two men for not re-creating its favorite wet dream: Ronald Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neill, solving the world\u2019s problems with a glass of whiskey and a handshake after a hard day\u2019s work.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

He\u2019d say the Speaker reminded him of the Republicans with whom he used to play cards and cut deals in the Illinois state Senate. Obama also knew the truth about Boehner: He was a man who wanted to compromise, but couldn\u2019t. The Tea Partiers wouldn\u2019t let him. The only Obama plan they\u2019d ever pass would have to give Republicans 100 percent of what they wanted\u2014all spending cuts, no taxes, full repeal of Obamacare, defunding Planned Parenthood, and on and on. If these demands weren\u2019t met, they would shut down the government, or force a default on our debt that would cause an even bigger crisis than the Great Recession. And if Boehner chose to go around the Tea Party\u2014if he decided to pass anything with the help of Democratic votes\u2014the Tea Party would choose a new Speaker.\n\nFor a long time, Boehner decided to keep his job. He thought he could appease the hostage-takers, even though he was one of the hostages. And most establishment Republicans followed the same strategy\u2014wink, nod, give the crazies just a little bit of what they want.\n\nIn the 2012 election, I watched Mitt Romney, the man who was once my moderate governor, say that 47 percent of Americans \u201cbelieve that they are victims\u201d and that he could \u201cnever convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d I watched him publicly embrace the endorsement of a man who funded an investigation to prove that the President of the United States was a Kenyan-born imposter\u2014a decision that helped legitimize Donald J. Trump, the monster who now haunts America\u2019s waking nightmare.\n\nI saw Jeb Bush, who once called it an \u201cact of love\u201d to accept undocumented immigrants, say that America should only accept terrorized refugees who are Christian. I saw Marco Rubio, who once had the courage to work with President Obama to reform immigration, say that President Obama has hurt and weakened America\u2014deliberately. And even now, as the party now faces the prospect of nominating a xenophobic demagogue who was, of all things, a Clinton donor, elected Republicans stand quietly by and repeat their hostage statements:\n\n\u201cI intend to support the nominee,\u201d says Paul Ryan, moments after he called out Trump\u2019s flirtation with the KKK. \u201cI intend to support the nominee,\u201d says Mitch McConnell, as he rallies the Senate to block hearings for Obama\u2019s Supreme Court choice before even knowing who it is\u2014one final attempt to delegitimize this President on his way out the door. \u201cI intend to support the nominee,\u201d say the presidential candidates, who, at the last debate, couldn\u2019t even bring themselves to condemn Trump for the hate and violence he\u2019s incited at his rallies. And now, finally, after scenes of chaos at a rally that had to be canceled in Chicago, Rubio and Kasich are wavering on that pledge with that same mixture of shock and sadness we saw from John McCain at that Town Hall in 2008: \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a funny thing about appeasement. The conservative hawks are right\u2014it doesn\u2019t work. At the end of the day, the Tea Party did force John Boehner out of office. No one clapped for Jeb. No one cared about Mitt\u2019s speech. Little Marco is on life support. John Kasich is 0-20. And the party is left to choose between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump: the crazy insider vs. the crazy outsider; one of the most hated men in Washington vs. one of the most hateful men in America. And even if Hillary beats them in November, which I believe she will, the forces that have been unleashed will not go quietly into the night. You can already hear what they\u2019ll say in order to rob her of the same legitimacy they tried to steal from Obama: \u201cShe\u2019d be in jail if his Justice Department didn\u2019t protect her.\u201d\n\nIn the last few months, I\u2019ve become frustrated, and at times scared, by this stark reality\u2014which, I can tell you, doesn\u2019t happen easily to an Obama Kool-Aid drinker like me. What\u2019s worse is that I can\u2019t seem to tear myself away from it all\u2014the Nazi-like oaths, the dick-measuring debates, the Twitter taunting. You start to understand why the crazy is so addictive.\n\nI was asked to offer some commentary one of these debates recently, and before I left for the studio, I started scrolling through the news to make sure that I was up to date on Donald Trump\u2019s latest reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s latest performance. But when I arrived at the studio, the guest before me was a man named Brent Brown, a lifelong Republican who had voted against Obama twice, and was particularly vocal in his opposition to Obamacare. Brown also had a serious autoimmune disease that nearly killed him because he couldn\u2019t afford treatment. And the Affordable Care Act saved his life. And he wrote this beautiful letter to Obama that ends with, \u201cThank you for serving me when I didn\u2019t vote you. Thank you for being my President.\u201d\n\nI sat there and watched the clip of Brent introducing Obama at a rally in Milwaukee that day, and then being interviewed by Chris Hayes. His voice was halting, a little unsure, like it was the first time he had ever spoken in public. And I thought about what it took for him to get there\u2014to beat his illness, to write that letter, to go to that rally, to sit in front that television camera, to say, \u201cYou know what? I changed my mind.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of courage and grace you rarely see in public life, but it probably exists in more places than we imagine.\n\nThe President often says, \u201cWe are not as divided as our politics suggests.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "GOP primary, Barack Obama, Tea Party, Donald Trump, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201603131320, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "GOP primary, Barack Obama, Tea Party, Donald Trump, Democratic Party", "pageNum": 1, "title": "How the Republican Party Became a Failed State", "tags": "entity:politicalevent/gop_primary,entity:person/barack_obama,entity:organization/tea_party,obsessional:donald-trump,entity:organization/democratic_party", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The GOP let its extremist insurgency in through the front door.", "title": "How the Republican Party Became a Failed State", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/13/how-the-republican-party-became-a-failed-state.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/03/13/how-the-republican-party-became-a-failed-state/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1457985495953.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "The GOP let its extremist insurgency in through the front door.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jon Favreau", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T13:20:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jon-favreauhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/03/13/how-the-republican-party-became-a-failed-state", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"How the Republican Party Became a Failed State\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/13/how-the-republican-party-became-a-failed-state.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/03/13/how-the-republican-party-became-a-failed-state/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48599516.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/03/13/how-the-republican-party-became-a-failed-state\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-13T13:20:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jon Favreau\",\"tags\":[\"gop_primary\",\"barack_obama\",\"tea_party\",\"donald-trump\",\"democratic_party\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jon-favreau", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "The Republican Party, on the other hand, is no longer a functioning institution.\nI\u2019m a Democrat who believes that we need a healthy Republican Party\u2014a party that\u2019s strong in the places ours is weak.\nTEA PARTY JIHADISThe GOP let its extremist insurgency in through the front door.\nDemocrats need Republicans to point out where tax dollars are being wasted, programs are being abused, and regulations aren\u2019t worth the cost.\nAt the end of the day, the Tea Party did force John Boehner out of office."}
