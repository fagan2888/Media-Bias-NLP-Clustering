Tom Steyer, billionaire hedge-funder and former Obama bundler, has now become the biggest super PAC contributor of 2014, with a recent donation of $15 million to his own super PAC, NextGen Climate Action Committee.

Mr. Steyer had pledged to spend at least $50 million of his own money to support environmentalist Democrats in the 2014 midterms. He surpassed that amount in September and has so far given $55 million to environmental super PACs.

Earlier this year Mr. Steyer also gave $5 million to the liberal Senate Majority PAC.

Mr. Steyer has given $41.6 million to the NextGen Climate Action Committee this cycle. NextGen has sponsored millions of dollars worth of political advertisements in important Senate races as well as environmental organizations and state committees including a $925,000 contribution to the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund.
