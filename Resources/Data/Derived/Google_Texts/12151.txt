DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Chase Elliott won the Xfinity Series season opener at Daytona International Speedway on Saturday for his first victory at NASCAR’s most famous track.

Elliott took the lead from Joey Logano on the final restart with 13 laps to go and held off the fellow Sprint Cup regular on the last lap. Logano got a strong run on the outside a few hundred feet from the finish line and then banged the side of Elliott’s No. 88 Chevrolet several times, but he couldn’t get past.

Elliott, who will start the Daytona 500 from the pole, edged Logano by 0.043 seconds. It was Logano’s third second-place finish in three races during Speedweeks.

“Dang it. I’m sick of finishing second,” Logano said.

Kasey Kahne was third, followed by Elliott Sadler and Austin Dillon. Elliott, Kahne and Sadler gave JR Motorsports three of the top four spots.
