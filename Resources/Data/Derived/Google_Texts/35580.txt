Gale Sayers told the Chicago Tribune on Saturday that he did not consent to a lawsuit filed on his behalf Friday in U.S. District Court in Chicago that alleges the NFL was negligent in handling his repeated head injuries.

Sayers, the Hall of Fame Bears running back, said he spoke with an attorney Thursday at the behest of former Bears safety Shaun Gayle, but he did not agree to sue the NFL.

“I had about one half of a concussion in all of the years that I played,” said Sayers, whose seven-year career ended prematurely in 1971 because of severe knee injuries. “I didn’t say any of the things he said in the paper.”

Sayers said the attorney is John F. Winters of Winters, Salzetta & O’Brien, LLC in Chicago.

“I didn’t sign anything. … I talked to the attorney, but there wasn’t nothing to it,” Sayers said. “I talked to Shaun and I said: ‘Let me think about it.'”
