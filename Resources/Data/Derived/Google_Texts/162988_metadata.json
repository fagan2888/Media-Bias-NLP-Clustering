This month, three of its five neurosurgeons, including the chair, gave notice of their intent to leave April 1.\n\nIn addition, the chiefs of ophthalmology and oral surgery have left, along with six hospitalists \u2014 doctors who specialize in the medical care of hospital patients. The hospital also confirmed that Dr. Christopher Colwell, who heads emergency medicine, and Dr. Jeff Johnson, a top trauma surgeon, are leaving for other jobs.\n\nThe departures raised questions about Denver Health\u2019s ability to continue operating as a Level I trauma center, one of only a few in Colorado. Current and former Denver Health doctors who spoke to The Denver Post also voiced concerns ranging from reduced operating room staffs to the hospital\u2019s commitment to serving the needy and the state of its partnership with University of Colorado Hospital.\n\nSome described the situation as a crisis, with a medical staff disconnected from the administration, a de-emphasis of academics and research and a growing emphasis on making money.\n\nResponding to doctor concerns, the hospital administration recently implemented a series of changes, which included dismissing its chief clinical officer and agreeing not to change its physician compensation system.\n\nHospital chief Arthur Gonzalez offered assurances in a memo that the University of Colorado would provide neurosurgeons to Denver Health. Neurosurgery is vital to Denver Health\u2019s ability to retain its Level I status.\n\n\u201cDenver Health is absolutely and unequivocally committed to its mission,\u201d Gonzalez told The Post, adding that caring for the needy, education and research all belong to that mission.\n\nHe acknowledged, though, that the hospital \u201cis going through immense change\u201d because of the federal Affordable Care Act, which provided a Medicaid boost but may take money back from other sources, and potential losses in state payments to hospitals.\n\n\u201cFor example, we are more focused on strategic direction, metrics and accountability than ever before in our 155-year history,\u201d he said.\n\nDenver Health is trying to make 4 percent more than it spends yearly to finance a $485 million capital plan, a challenge that Gonzalez said keeps him awake at night. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make some tough choices sometimes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe doctors who resigned in the last eight months departed for varying reasons, and \u201cit would be inaccurate to paint all of these people with the same broad brush,\u201d he said.\n\nOne veteran physician said he believes Denver Health\u2019s partnership with University Hospital is under strain \u2014 though officials at both hospitals say it remains strong.\n\nDenver Health, which treated 222,687 patients last year, depends heavily on the help of medical residents from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Those residents rely on Denver Health\u2019s deep bench of experienced physicians, which has been thinned by departures.\n\nDr. Ernest Moore, a 40-year physician at Denver Health and its interim trauma medical director, said a loss of medical residents would have \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could not provide the level of patient care we have without the residents from the University of Colorado,\u201d he said.\n\nThe risk for Denver Health, Moore said, is that the University system, which operates the Anschutz Medical Center in Aurora and has acquired other Front Range hospitals, no longer needs it as it once did.\n\nThat risk rises, he said, if Denver Health is seen as providing \u201ca sub-optimal environment\u201d for medical resident training.\n\nMark Couch, chief of staff for the University medical school, responded that the university remains committed to Denver Health, which has about 200 of its medical residents in various training programs there.\n\n\u201cWe value that relationship and support their mission,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important location for us.\u201d\n\nGonzalez said maintaining a strong partnership with University is a top priority for Denver Health. \u201cWe have enjoyed a long history of collaboration, and that will not change,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Gregory Jurkovich, Denver Health\u2019s former surgery chief, said neurosurgeons grew concerned about the safety of severely injured patients while he worked there \u2014 and they recently took those concerns to the university.\n\n\u201cI was told by them, by the neurosurgeons themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nJurkovich was recruited by Moore and lasted 3 \u00bd years before leaving in what was called a voluntary separation.\n\nHe said Denver Health changed rapidly after Gonzalez replaced Dr. Patricia Gabow at the helm in 2012.\n\nDr. Ken Bellian, the hospital\u2019s new chief clinical officer under Gonzalez, \u201ctold me I was not a team player in the direction Denver Health wanted to go. It was never explained to me what that meant,\u201d Jurkovich said.\n\n\u201cI in the large part agreed with the efforts Denver Health was trying to make. I just didn\u2019t like the way they were going about it,\u201d he said. He found the administration \u201clargely disrespectful of the clinicians, particularly those who were hospital-based.\u201d\n\nMany of the doctors who left or gave notice after Jurkovich departed had worked under his supervision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging work,\u201d Jurkovich said. \u201cA largely indigent patient population, multiple languages, resource constraints.\u201d For some, he said, \u201cthe ability to function in that environment just became too difficult with all those other constraints.\u201d\n\nHospital administrators are taking steps to stop the bleeding.\n\nThe memo circulated about 10 days ago by Gonzalez and Dr. Bill Burman, president of the medical staff, announced \u201ca decisive plan\u201d to deal with recent events. It ended a controversial new payment plan for doctors.\n\nIts elements also included neurosurgery coverage from the university, a promise to work with doctors \u201cto reformulate the physician leadership structure at Denver Health\u201d and to eliminate the job of Bellian, who had been given wide latitude to manage the hospital.\n\nThe memo blamed \u201cproblems inherent in the way that role was structured.\u201d\n\nBellian declined to comment.\n\nColwell, who is leaving Denver Health for San Francisco General Hospital, said the medical staff went to Gonzalez to discuss \u201cfinding ways to work together and focusing on our mission and values,\u201d including Bellian\u2019s elevated authority. \u201cCertainly a fair part of the staff wondered if that should be part of the structure,\u201d he said.\n\nHe predicts Denver\u2019s venerable hospital will emerge from its current challenges as a healthy institution.\n\n\u201cI think the future of Denver Health is very bright,\u201d he said.\n\nMoore said he is not worried that the hospital will change its fundamental mission of top-quality care for all.\n\nBut he said that scheduling surgeries has become an issue, particularly for patients who need more than one.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the frustration arises,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the problem areas is access to the operating rooms for secondary operations.\u201d\n\nGonzalez responded that \u201cthere has been no reduction in operating room space or capacity,\u201d but \u201cif we are inundated with trauma or urgent surgeries, elective surgeries sometimes have to be delayed or rescheduled.\u201d\n\nHospital officials say they are close to hiring a new chief of surgery.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Why are so many doctors leaving Denver Health?", "title": "Why are so many doctors leaving Denver Health?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/13/why-are-so-many-doctors-leaving-denver-health/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Denver_healthp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Denver_healthp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T14:34:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T20:34:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Physicians heading the departments of medicine and surgery at Denver Health Medical Center left last year and have not yet been replaced.\nHospital chief Arthur Gonzalez offered assurances in a memo that the University of Colorado would provide neurosurgeons to Denver Health.\n\u201cI in the large part agreed with the efforts Denver Health was trying to make.\n\u201cI think the future of Denver Health is very bright,\u201d he said.\nThe departures raised questions about Denver Health\u2019s ability to continue operating as a Level I trauma center, one of only a few in Colorado."}
