In this age of technology, it’s mind-boggling to think that as many as one in five patients are misidentified at hospitals nationwide. Or that antibiotic-resistant infections — many attributed to doctors not washing their hands — cause 23,000 deaths a year.

These were among 10 critical health issues presented Monday to an audience of about 275 people, including 10 strategically picked CEOs and entrepreneurs who must now decide whether they can create a viable company in 10 days.

10.10.10, the first-of-its-kind event, has rallied the city of Denver and health care systems, including Kaiser Permanente and Celebration Health Florida Hospital, to support entrepreneurs.

“Entrepreneurs hold the key to unlocking a huge market opportunity. That is what they do,” said Tom Higley, a serial entrepreneur who dreamed up the idea three years ago. “They have a vision. They’re able to execute and deliver on that vision. That is a resource that hasn’t been explored in a way we’d like it to be.”

Kelly Dunkin, vice president of philanthropy at Colorado Health Foundation, pitched the epidemic of childhood obesity by showing how in the past few decades, national rates jumped from a few states with a high of 10 percent to 14 percent obese children to more than half the states having childhood obesity rates above 25 percent.

“If we don’t do anything about this, this generation of kids will be the first to live sicker and shorter lives than their parents,” she said.

The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives, or CHIME, pointed out the high cost of misidentifying patients or duplicating their records — it can cost $1,000 to fix a record. CHIME president Russ Branzell

mentioned something even scarier: “If I can’t identify you, how can I make sure your information is protected?” he said.

David De Jesus, with Florida Hospital, which will offer experts and data to entrepreneurs, said he flew in to witness the event because he sees Denver as a leader in digital health.

“Denver has progressed far more than other states. We’re really looking for opportunities to create an alliance,” said De Jesus, the hospital’s digital health principal architect. “Overall, all these problems are a national endeavor. Not just local.”

The 10 wicked problems presented were:

• Alzheimer’s disease

• Childhood obesity

• Patient engagement

• Antibiotic resistance

• End-of-life care

• Pandemic weapons and bioterrorism

• Patient and data matching

• Health guide maps

• Health data

• Patient mobility and independence

The entrepreneurs will work 10 days straight and return Feb. 26 to present their findings and indicate whether they will spend the next nine to 10 months pursuing a startup.
