While the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has led to an unprecedented increase in health care coverage, particularly in the nation's poorest communities, many immigrants are still facing serious challenges in getting coverage.

More than 400,000 people have seen the insurance plans they purchased through the PPACA insurance exchange cancelled in 2015 due to questions over their immigration status. That is a dramatic increase over the 109,000 such cancellations last year.
