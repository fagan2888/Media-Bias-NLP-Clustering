Seriously. Well, this happened:

so basically Obama & Huff were geared up to make fun of Matt Drudge & then they realized they were wrong halfway through their propaganda — Chuck Peters (@sayata) March 23, 2014

Bingo.

As Twitchy reported, Matt Drudge on Friday tweeted that he had just paid the Obamacare penalty, which he called a “Liberty Tax.” The White House, the Left and media lapdogs (concentric circles on a Venn diagram) swiftly began to mock and ridicule Matt Drudge, attempting to brand him a liar.

Not understanding small biz pays taxes quarterly reflects poorly on White House and #ACA allies http://t.co/X06qU9miT3 via @BreitbartNews — Bruce Gilbert (@HIXworks) March 23, 2014

3) Many Left wing hacks (disguised as Journalists) shamed themselves attacking @DRUDGE & entrepreneurs: http://t.co/gTONoDKStM — nextinstinct (@nextinstinct) March 23, 2014

Yep. More from The Washington Times:

What each critical tweeter and pundit failed to realize was that Mr. Drudge, as the self-employed proprietor of The Drudge Report, files taxes as a small business on a quarterly basis. The IRS requires self-employed business owners to file annual returns and pay estimated quarterly taxes. When entrepreneurs like Mr. Drudge file their 2014 first quarter taxes, they have to pay the individual health care mandate if they are not getting Obamacare coverage.

Huh. Fancy that.

@Gre8Scott @instapundit @DRUDGE Did you expect them to have a better understanding about taxes than they do about everything else? — Kevin O'Connell (@tank_demon) March 23, 2014

Reality, like taxes, is hard!

Matt Drudge followed up on Sunday. Hey, White House and lapdogs, check this out:

Truth. Boom.

What say you, White House?

@DRUDGE @WhiteHouse rebuttal? — Dáve Phillíps (@Radiocop) March 23, 2014

Will the White House and its lapdogs beclown themselves further? All signs point to yes.
