Twitter/Screenshot\n\nSpicy food is good for lots of things, from helping with weight loss to simply tasting delicious. But for one man living in Orland Park, Ill., just outside of Chicago, it can be credited with saving his life.\n\nThirty-year-old Randy Schmitz doesn\u2019t believe he would have discovered a cancerous brain tumor in its early stages if it wasn\u2019t for sampling the Flashbang hot sauce from Pepper Palace in Myrtle Beach, S.C. while on vacation last August. After sampling the hot sauce, which is packaged like a grenade and contains Carolina Reaper, Scorpion, Ghost, and Habanero peppers, Schmitz fell the ground and experienced a seizure. He was immediately rushed to the hospital, where an MRI scan detected the tumor.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t tried that, I think something eventually would have triggered the seizure and I would have found out, but the cancer tumor would\u2019ve grown in my head,\u201d Schmitz told the Chicago Tribune. The seizure and his subsequent diagnosis cut his vacation short; he flew home to undergo surgery to remove the 2.5-inch-by-1.5-inch tumor, which rested on his brain\u2019s left frontal lobe. By discovering the tumor, Schmitz was able to undergo radiation and chemotherapy early enough to survive.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the hot sauce caused the seizure. Schmitz only tasted it off the tip of a toothpick, but with its spiciness and the fact he had to wait five minutes before drinking any water, it could be possible. Dr. Jeffrey Raizer, medical director of neuro-oncology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Schmitz was operated on, said the stressed and dehydrated condition he was in after the tasting matched possible triggers for seizures. \u201cIf you eat a habanero, it\u2019s a big jolt to your system,\u201d he told the Tribune.\n\nOrland Park man credits hot sauce with triggering seizure that may have saved his life http://t.co/vNwwN1eiOO pic.twitter.com/qxuPV84dXm \u2014 Chicago Tribune (@chicagotribune) March 13, 2015\n\nWith only a month left of chemotherapy left, Schmitz took it upon himself to send Pepper Palace an email thanking them for saving his life. The company, ecstatic about the news, sent him a box of products, including hot sauce, t-shirts, and golf balls.\n\nWhile it might be better that Schmitz stays away from the Flashbang hot sauce, he might find the others inside the box useful for prevention. Research into capsaicin, the active chemical in chili peppers, has turned up evidence that it could force cancer cells to kill themselves, a process called apoptosis. Nevertheless, let\u2019s hope Schmitz doesn\u2019t develop cancer again.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hot, sauce, causes, seizure, illinois, man, leads, diagnosis, malignant, brain, tumor", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Randy Schmitz, 30, experienced a seizure soon after trying Pepper Palace's Flashbang hot sauce.
