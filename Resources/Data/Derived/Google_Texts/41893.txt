President Obama fielded a seemingly unexpected question about revoking Bill Cosby’s presidential medal of freedom at a press conference Wednesday, and took a moment to speak out about the allegations against the comedian with a clear zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault. Explaining that there was “no precedent” for stripping a recipient of the medal of freedom — a move supported by more than 10,000 people who signed a White House petition — the president decided to share his (careful, measured) opinion in lieu of entertaining the petition.

“I’ll say this,” Obama began. “If you give a woman, or a man for that matter, without his or her knowledge, a drug, and then have sex with that person without consent, that’s rape.”

“I think this country, any civilized country,” he went on, “should have no tolerance for rape.”
