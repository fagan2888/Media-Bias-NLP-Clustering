The spider was a black widow \u2014 the most poisonous spider in North America \u2014 and they have been found in grapes sold in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\n\n\u201cI saw the legs moving frantically,\u201d Duckhorn reportedly said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen bugs on fruit before, and I thought, \u2018That is a very big spider.\u2019 Nothing I\u2019d ever seen before.\u201d After notifying a store employee, Aldi removed all grape items from its stores in the Milwaukee area. Another consumer from Pennsylvania, Yvonne Whelan, had already brought a bag of grapes home to eat when she noticed a spider leg creeping over a grape as she washed them in the sink. Black widow spiders have been found in several other states, including Michigan and Minnesota.\n\nEarlier in November, venomous Brazilian wandering spiders were also found in packs of bananas. Consi Taylor had bought Colombian fair trade bananas at a store in England, and was biting into one when she found a swarm of hatching baby spiders. \u201cI had a closer look and was horrified to see they were spiders,\u201d Taylor told The Sun. \u201cThey were hatching out on the table, scurrying around on my carpet.\u201d She and her family evacuated the house and had it fumigated after she found out they were Brazilian wandering spiders, which were ranked as the world\u2019s most poisonous spiders according to the Guinness World Records of 2010. However, baby Brazilian wandering spiders do not pose much of a threat to humans.\n\nBecause farmers have attempted to cut back on pesticide use, insects are more likely to infest produce. Be sure to double check any fruit you purchase for mold-like white patches. According to the National Institutes of Health, black widow spiders can be found throughout the U.S. but are most common in the South and West. They are often found in outdoor structures like sheds, stone walls, woodpiles, or barns. Within fifteen minutes to an hour of getting bitten, a dull muscle pain spreads throughout the body. Black widow bites can be fatal if left untreated, and are especially dangerous for young children and the elderly. If bit by a black widow spider, seek emergency medical attention immediately.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "black widow grapes, spiders, fruit", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Black widow spiders were found in packaged grapes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.", "title": "Black Widow Spiders Found Crawling In Grapes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/black-widows-infest-grapes-poisonous-spiders-found-crawling-fruit-several-states-263600", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/23/black-widow-spider.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black widow spiders were found in packaged grapes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.", "title": "Black Widow Spiders Found Crawling In Grapes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/black-widows-infest-grapes-poisonous-spiders-found-crawling-fruit-several-states-263600", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/23/black-widow-spider.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/23/black-widow-spider.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-11-23T18:47:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-23T18:47:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Black widow spiders were found in packaged grapes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3bc\"", "article_summary": "Black widow spiders have been found in several other states, including Michigan and Minnesota.\nEarlier in November, venomous Brazilian wandering spiders were also found in packs of bananas.\nHowever, baby Brazilian wandering spiders do not pose much of a threat to humans.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, black widow spiders can be found throughout the U.S. but are most common in the South and West.\n\u201cI had a closer look and was horrified to see they were spiders,\u201d Taylor told The Sun."}
