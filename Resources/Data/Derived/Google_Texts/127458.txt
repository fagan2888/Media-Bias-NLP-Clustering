The Bob L. Burger Recreation Center in Lafayette will reopen for regular operating hours starting at 5 a.m. Monday after closing Saturday due to a chemical leak sent 22 people to the hospital.

Air quality tests measured by the Lafayette Fire Department throughout both Saturday and Sunday showed “normal air quality throughout the pool, fitness and public areas of the facility,” the city announced Sunday afternoon.

The pool area will remain closed to the public until further testing is completed and analyzed by the Boulder County Health Department. That testing is scheduled for Monday.

All other programs, with the exception of aquatic classes, will run as scheduled, according to city officials.

On Saturday, fire and hazardous materials crews were called to the rec center in response to people suffering from coughing, nausea and vomiting.

The Recreation Department plans to continue to investigate the cause of Saturday’s evacuation.

The center will be open Monday from 5 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
