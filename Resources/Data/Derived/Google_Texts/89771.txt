ALBUQUERQUE — Who would have thought?

If Colorado State beats New Mexico Saturday, the Air Force Falcons will lock up the title in the Mountain Division of the Mountain West Conference and, with one week still to go in the regular season, secure a berth in the league championship game on Dec. 5.

A CSU win isn’t crucial for the Falcons, though, because Air Force still would have its fate in its own hands if the Rams lose.

If New Mexico beats CSU, the division title will come down to next Saturday’s Air Force-New Mexico game, also in Albuquerque. If the teams both finish 6-2 in the league, New Mexico would get the title-game berth because of the head-to-head win.

In the wake of Air Force’s 37-30 win over Boise State Friday night, here are the Mountain Division standings as of Saturday morning:

Air Force 6-1

New Mexico 4-2

Boise State 4-3

Utah State 4-3

Colorado State 3-3

Wyoming 1-6

San Diego State can lock up the Pacific Division berth with either a win over UNLV Saturday night or a Nevada loss to Utah State.

Before getting on to the CSU stories from the week, one thought: If Mike Bobo was New Mexico’s coach, they’d be “Bobo’s Lobos.”
