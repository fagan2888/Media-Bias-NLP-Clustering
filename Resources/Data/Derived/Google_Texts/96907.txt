The Affordable Care Act never seems to leave the headlines, so when does Obamacare end?

If you’re looking for an expiration date on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), you aren’t likely to find one. It’s the law, and barring a significant legislative move, it’s here to stay. But there are some deadlines you should be aware of when shopping for health insurance, considering an insurance change or simply as a consumer of the health care system.

Here’s your guide to purchasing health insurance.

ACA Timeline

The Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare, was signed into law more than four years ago. Since then, several important dates have served as benchmarks in the evolution of ACA health care reform.

2010: The ACA was signed into law; a Patient’s Bill of Rights went into effect and no-cost preventive care began for Americans under some health care plans.

2011: Free preventive care was extended to Medicare recipients, and some also received a 50% discount on brand-name prescriptions.

2012: The Supreme Court determined that the upcoming Medicaid expansion — designed to give more low-income Americans access to the state-sponsored health coverage — would be optional for states.

2013: The first open enrollment began in October 2013, allowing Americans to enroll in ACA-compliant health insurance plans and have access to primary tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies to make such plans more affordable.

ACA Deadlines and Important Dates

With 2014 drawing to a close, it’s once again time to consider your health insurance coverage, and there are several important dates to be aware of:

Nov. 15, 2014: Open enrollment begins for the 2015 calendar year

Dec. 15, 2014: The last date you can enroll for coverage effective Jan. 1, 2015

Dec. 31, 2014: Coverage ends for all 2014 Marketplace plans

Jan. 1, 2015: Coverage can begin for 2015 plans

Feb. 15, 2015: ACA open enrollment for 2015 ends

If you’re enrolling in a new plan, you’ll also want to pay attention to the date you sign up, as it will affect the date your coverage begins.

Coverage start dates:

Jan. 1, 2015 for plans purchased during open enrollment before Dec. 15, 2014.

Feb. 1, 2015 for plans purchased between Dec. 16, 2014, and Jan. 15, 2015.

March 1, 2015 for plans purchased between Jan. 16 and Feb. 15, the date open enrollment ends.

What is open enrollment?

Open enrollment is the period when you can sign up for new health insurance or make changes to your existing plan. For plans purchased on the federal Obamacare marketplace and state exchanges, it runs through Feb. 15, 2015.

Open enrollment is also available for people who receive health insurance through their employers, though the dates vary from company to company. If you’re unsure of when open enrollment is available at your job, talk to your human resources department or direct supervisor.

Obamacare and the implementation of the ACA have been filled with important dates and deadlines, and with open enrollment coming around annually, that isn’t going to change anytime soon. Your best bet as a health care consumer is to stay informed and ask questions when you’re unsure of a date, definition or how something affects you.
