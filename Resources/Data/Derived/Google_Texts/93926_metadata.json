But a false accusation prompted kicker Brandon McManus to speak up.\n\n\u201cthanks for the 0 points you loser,\u201d an angry fantasy player messaged McManus on Twitter. \u201cJust like the same amount of TDs that trash QB of yours had today.\u201d\n\nMcManus politely tweeted back, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was wrong. I obviously had one point,\u201d McManus later said, referring to his extra point on a fourth-quarter touchdown.\n\nNFL players have grown accustomed to being pawns in the chess game of millions of fantasy general managers. In recent years, most have purposely stayed on their side of a line that has become increasingly blurred by the billion-dollar daily fantasy sports (DFS) world, led by the Boston-based DraftKings and New York-based FanDuel, which control 95 percent of the fantasy sports market.\n\nThe two sites have inundated the mainstream media with advertising and promotion. Although the legality of such sites has been challenged, it hasn\u2019t precluded pro sports teams, including the NFL, from becoming partners.\n\nThe conflict of interest is apparent and growing. Money talks, though, and the eye-popping value and popularity of fantasy sports betting sites has spoken loudly.\n\nAs have the players.\n\nLack of regulation\n\nAll NFL personnel are banned from betting on sports. Fantasy sports are fair game, however, so long as employees do not accept prizes of more than $250.\n\n\u201cThis prohibition is intended to avoid any appearance of impropriety which may result from participation in fantasy football games by individuals perceived to have an unfair advantage due to their preferential access to information,\u201d the league\u2019s policy states.\n\nAlthough DraftKings and FanDuel have remained adamant that daily fantasy sports do not constitute gambling \u2014 they\u2019re games of skill, they say, not chance \u2014 the real players fail to see the difference.\n\n\u201cI think it is a conflict of interest, for sure, because of the fact that we do have inside information,\u201d said Broncos tight end Arthur Lynch. \u201cI don\u2019t think the fantasy league would come after us, but I think the NFL could. I know we\u2019re not allowed to gamble, and it\u2019s essentially the same thing.\u201d\n\nMichael McCann, a legal analyst and writer for Sports Illustrated, believes the bigger issue is the NFL\u2019s regulation, or lack thereof, of fantasy sports participation.\n\n\u201cIf you play for the Broncos and you know one of the running backs may be a little more injured or might get more playing time, that would be beneficial,\u201d McCann said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re only going to get $250, I don\u2019t know what the incentive is there to really exploit that. But that assumes that this $250 rule is actually enforced.\u201d\n\nAccording to the league, responsibility to report to the NFL any known or suspected violations is essentially on the honor system. If there is reason to believe any employee has violated the policy, the league will investigate. But there is no policing and feasibility of doing so, with online aliases and different IP addresses, would make it nearly impossible.\n\nMost Broncos players say they do not participate in fantasy sports.\n\nThe advent of social media, though, has given fantasy players a direct connection to the real players.\n\n\u201cI see people get blown up about it all the time,\u201d McManus said. \u201cEven our fans go into the game and say \u2018Oh, I need so and so.\u2019 You know you\u2019re going to get it. I don\u2019t think they realize their fantasy is our reality.\u201d\n\nRunning backs C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman, whose names and images are typically front and center on weekly fantasy projections, have attempted to make it clear, on numerous occasions, that they have little regard for fantasy football. Broncos wide receiver Andre Caldwell said he does not engage with fans playing fantasy football.\n\n\u201cThey talk noise and try to figure out who\u2019s playing and who\u2019s starting,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cThey hit us up all the time and talk noise when you don\u2019t play well.\u201d\n\nTight end Owen Daniels has received his fair share of insults too. Applying logic rarely helps, so he usually opts to keep quiet.\n\n\u201cSome people have been like, \u2018You cost me such and such money, you cost me $1.2 million!\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018If you would have won $1.2 million, would you have given me any amount of that money?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re saying I didn\u2019t earn it for you, then if you had won, I did earn it for you. So I need a cut.'\u201d\n\nRise fast, but not smooth\n\nAdvertisements for DraftKings and FanDuel often run back to back during commercial breaks of NFL telecasts. Billboards, signage on public transportation, radio spots offering promo codes and promising big payouts are hard to miss. Plastered on the Broncos\u2019 videoboard at Sports Authority Field, right next to the game score, is the DraftKings\u2019 logo, with block lettering that reads \u201cPLAY FREE.\u201d\n\nAlthough the NFL forbids teams from owning a stake in the fantasy betting sites, team owners are allowed to personally invest in them, and their franchises are allowed to sign advertising deals with them. Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones have personal stakes in DraftKings. Twelve NFL teams, including the Broncos, have advertising agreements with DraftKings. Sixteen others are aligned with FanDuel.\n\nAccording to research firm IEG, the partnerships with DraftKings and FanDuel are worth an estimated $6 million to $7 million for each team.\n\nIn September, the NFL Players Association agreed to a partnership with DraftKings that allows the company to use active players for both in-product and advertising campaigns. DraftKings also gained the right to negotiate separate deals with players, which it did with Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThe rise of DFS, which is projected to have five million people playing for money in the U.S. this year, has been swift. But it hasn\u2019t been smooth.\n\nFive states have banned participation, the New York attorney general is pushing to shut down DraftKings and FanDuel, and Massachusetts has sought regulation of DFS. Many other class-action lawsuits have been filed, including one by Washington Redskins wide receiver Pierre Gar\u00e7on, who is suing FanDuel for using his likeness without permission. Garcon has encouraged other players that appear on FanDuel\u2019s site to join.\n\n\u201cI would,\u201d said Broncos defensive end Malik Jackson. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s like me using your name and your likeness and not giving you anything. But that\u2019s the league. They feel they pay us enough so they can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nFor better or worse, fantasy sports has created a new reality for the real players.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "How fantasy sports have altered reality of Broncos, other NFL players", "title": "How fantasy sports have altered reality of Broncos, other NFL players", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/21/how-fantasy-sports-have-altered-reality-of-broncos-other-nfl-players/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__0422046fe36fb528810f6a7067005ed7p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__0422046fe36fb528810f6a7067005ed7p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T13:56:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:03:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fantasy Football"}, "article_summary": "The advent of social media, though, has given fantasy players a direct connection to the real players.\nNFL players have grown accustomed to being pawns in the chess game of millions of fantasy general managers.\nIn September, the NFL Players Association agreed to a partnership with DraftKings that allows the company to use active players for both in-product and advertising campaigns.\nMost Broncos players say they do not participate in fantasy sports.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the fantasy league would come after us, but I think the NFL could."}
