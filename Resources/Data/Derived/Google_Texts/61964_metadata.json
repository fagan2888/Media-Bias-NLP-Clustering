That might have something to do with having just written a new book of poems for each of the 101 two-letter words that allow Scrabble players to run words alongside words, multiply their scores, and deploy those valuable X\u2019s and Q\u2019s and Z\u2019s for the most points possible.\n\nSince we had lunch a couple of weeks ago to talk about \u201c101 Two-Letter Words\u201d \u2014 a four-line poem for each tiny word, accompanied by a Roz Chast cartoon \u2014 each iPhone ding signifying a new word has filled me with dread. \u201cInveighs\u201d for a triple-word plus the seven-letter bonus. \u201cMoisten\u201d as an opening play. \u201cZeal\u201d run alongside \u201cpiranhas.\u201d Most irritating, a late charge to steal a game by three points, 414-412, when I thought I might have had him.\n\nThe book reads as sneaky smart as Merritt\u2019s game, and that shouldn\u2019t be any surprise. As the singer/songwriter of the Magnetic Fields and the mastermind of a bevy of musical offshoots like the Sixths, Gothic Archies and Future Bible Heroes, I\u2019d make the case that Merritt has written more great songs in the last 25 years than most anyone. They\u2019re songs of lust and longing, of jealousy and the heart, sometimes heartbreaking and funny at the same time, and all of which would feel right at home in the Great American Songbook.\n\n\u201c101 Two-Letter Words\u201d has that same mordant wit. They\u2019re pretty irresistible, whether your taste runs to creepy folk tales, sexual perversion, or you just have a dictionary or punctuation fetish. You\u2019ll learn the difference between an \u201cai\u201d and an \u201cal.\u201d You might finally be able to define \u201cza,\u201d \u201cka\u201d and \u201cxu.\u201d And it may even improve your Words With Friends game \u2014 provided, of course, that you\u2019re not playing with Merritt. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nHow did your obsession with two-letter Scrabble words get started? Was it simply playing lots more Words With Friends while leading a touring musician\u2019s life?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tour carrying a large book because I keep having to carry things on the airplane. So I carry only small books, and then I run out of book in the middle of the flight. Or often we change planes. So, although I read a lot, sometimes I have nothing to do for hours on end on tour, so I started playing a lot of Scrabble and Words With Friends online. I quickly found that I wasn\u2019t very good at it, chiefly because I couldn\u2019t remember all those dang two-letter words. And I started writing myself little mneumonic poems about them \u2014 and eventually it occurred to me that I could just write all of them and publish it.\n\nHad you always been a Scrabble person or was this a new hobby?\n\nI was a precocious 10-year-old Scrabble player, but I\u2019m not tournament quality at all.\n\nSerious players probably knew all of these. But it feels like the rest of us started playing that way with Words With Friends. Somehow I played the game different off the board.\n\nI think the tournament players always know all of the two-letter words and always use them in clever ways. The \u201cax,\u201d \u201cox,\u201d and \u201cex\u201d tricks are very important, I think.\n\nAnd then you learn the other ones \u2026\n\n\u2026 where would we be without \u201cxi\u201d and \u201cxu.\u201d\n\nWhen I Googled the list of two-letter words, I didn\u2019t even know what those meant. Still couldn\u2019t tell you what \u201cka\u201d or \u201cki\u201d or \u201cjo\u201d or \u201cxu\u201d means, or even how to pronounce some of them.\n\nThe Scottish ones in particular were all new to me \u2026\n\nYou simply have to memorize them in some ways, the same way you have to just learn the words that work with a \u201cq\u201d and no \u201cu.\u201d It\u2019s not like the game makes you use them in a sentence.\n\nI was thinking I should do a very small companion book of \u201cq\u201d without \u201cu\u201d \u2026\n\nThat could be the online extra. \u201cQat,\u201d \u201cfaqir,\u201d \u201csuq\u201d \u2026\n\nI\u2019m just waiting for them to say, \u201cOh my god! We need an online extra! Quick, do the \u2018q\u2019 without \u2018u\u2019.\u201d Or there\u2019s the four new ones \u2014 the new Scrabble Dictionary came out with four additional two-letter words. But the online version doesn\u2019t recognize those yet. So I\u2019m safe for now.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to update all of our apps. So you must have had a similar process of figuring out this list and realizing you had to have a way to keep them all in mind. That\u2019s when you started working out mneumonic devices for them.\n\nQuickly I had 3 x 5 cards. Then I had 3 x 5 cards on the wall.\n\nWhich means it was fun right away if it turns into a project like that. What were the words you didn\u2019t know, that you had to look up and figure out?\n\nThe Hebrew letter \u201cpe,\u201d for example. And \u201cxu,\u201d the Vietnamese hundredth of a dong. But you know, foreign currencies are good to know in Scrabble because there\u2019s those Turkish words \u2014 the \u201cq\u2019s\u201d without \u201cu\u2019s\u201d that are good to know.\n\nThat explains what a \u201csuq\u201d must be.\n\nA \u201csuq\u201d is a bazaar or a marketplace. (laughs) S-U-Q.\n\nSee? Another Scrabble word that if I had to use it in a sentence, it would be a massive embarrassment \u2026\n\nLet\u2019s go to the \u201csuq.\u201d Well, I read in the new Scrabble Dictionary there\u2019s a new spelling of \u201ckayak,\u201d which is apparently closer to what\u2019s considered the correct organization of the Inuit word \u201ckayak\u201d \u2014 Q-A-J-A-Q.\n\nYou\u2019d have to have a free letter for that.\n\nYou have to have a blank. Yeah.\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten quite obsessed!\n\nWell, yeah, yeah. Actually, I\u2019ve stopped doing the crossword puzzle. I used to do the Times crossword Monday through Friday. I could never quite get Saturday, and Sunday \u2026\n\nWhat kind of a player are you? Are you aggressive? Defensive? Like to open the board up or use the tw0-letter words and keep it tight?\n\nI like to spoil the triple-word score for the other player.\n\nBy putting a \u201cc\u201d close to it or something?\n\nYes, a \u201cc\u201d or a \u201cv.\u201d A \u201cc\u201d and \u201cv\u201d are the two letters that don\u2019t appear in any of the two letter words.\n\nNot enough people know that trick.\n\nI was thinking I should have put that little tidbit in the book. It doesn\u2019t say that anywhere in the book.\n\nI don\u2019t know, maybe we should keep it a secret and leave it out of the story.\n\nThe amazing thing about some of these words is that \u201cxi\u201d or \u201cxu,\u201d however you pronounce that, have such a narrow definition and use that it almost proscribes your verse. You have to define them simply so people know what they are. And then some of the other words are some of the most generic, widely used words in the English language: \u201cis\u201d and \u201cto\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201che.\u201d And for those you really need to narrow down a universe of infinite possibilities when you go to write, to narrow, these massive words down to four lines.\n\nWell, when I was in sixth grade I was doing a written test and somehow the test was really easy for me \u2014 I knew the material really well \u2014 but during the test I sort of forgot what the indefinite article was coming before a vowel sound and I had to rework my sentences, all of the sentences, so that the word \u201can\u201d didn\u2019t appear, because I couldn\u2019t remember what it was. Was it \u201cab,\u201d \u201cad,\u201d \u201cag,\u201d \u201cah\u201d? Fortunately, that\u2019s the last time that happened.\n\nDid you find that those super-common words were the ones that represented the biggest challenge, or was it the ones that are rarely used and more uncommon?\n\nI think the easier words were easier because I didn\u2019t have to define them so much. Whereas the difference between an \u201cem\u201d and an \u201cen\u201d \u2014 the difference between an n-dash and an m-dash \u2014 is subtle enough that probably most copy editors couldn\u2019t rattle it off and everyone else seems to get it wrong much of the time.\n\nYou\u2019re able to probably work a lot of your own playful obsessions into these. Music, certainly. I imagine punctuation is one of those things that you are super-interested in. Several of these reference philosophy as well.\n\nOne thing I get to talk about obliquely is music with \u201cdo,\u201d \u201cre,\u201d \u201cmi,\u201d \u201cfa,\u201d \u201cso,\u201d \u201cla,\u201d and \u201cti.\u201d But I\u2019m not saying the same old thing I usually say in interviews: \u201cAuthenticity is a crock of shit\u201d and that kind of thing.\n\nSo what\u2019s a crock of shit in the verse, poetry or Scrabble world?\n\nHmm. I don\u2019t know if there is any analog to the authenticity fetish that affects a very small amount of the music world, but unfortunately it seems like a lot of people are coming into contact with. I discovered last night that someone had written a scholarly paper on me and people allegedly like me in the indie-rock world, and the paper was called \u201cThis Little Ukulele Tells the Truth.\u201d Which is a quote from me. But the author seems unaware that it\u2019s a joke.\n\nAre you suggesting the indie-rock world is devoid of humor?\n\nI am. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not the only part of the music world devoid of humor.\n\nDid any of these words stymie you? Or any that you dreaded and delayed and put off to the end?\n\n\u201cSi.\u201d S-I. Kind of a hard concept that \u201csi\u201d is the substitute for \u201cti\u201d \u2014 the seventh degree of the scale. People who don\u2019t know the scale like the back of their hand may not easily remember it. They are mneumonic devices. So I ended up with \u201cMa could drink a si of tea but then she has to pee.\u201d\n\nWere there favorite discoveries when you learned what some of these were? I didn\u2019t know what the \u201cai\u201d was \u2014 it\u2019s a three-toed sloth. I think that may have been my favorite. And then it pops up in several of the poems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At Words With Friends, that is.
