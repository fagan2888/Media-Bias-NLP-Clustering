Most of the shows will feature discussion of either the disappearance of Malaysia Air Flight 370 or the apparently imminent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, or both. Only Meet the Press has prioritized domestic politics this week by giving its first segment to Barack Obama\u2019s chief political adviser to discuss the upcoming midterms. (Be prepared to get a lot of sunshine blown up your kilts on the day before St. Patrick\u2019s Day in that interview.) CNN\u2019s State of the Union will get to it later with Reince Priebus, but John McCain will most likely be discussing Ukraine and his anger over the failure of the Senate to pass an aid package this week.\n\nOtherwise, the politics will have to wait for the roundtable segments, but that may not even be true on Face the Nation, where America\u2019s favorite retired airline pilot Sully Sullenberger offers his expertise on a story that needs it more than most. I might watch the MTP roundtable, though, as my friend Jon Ralston will take part in it. Get ready for more foreign-affairs talk today than you\u2019d normally hear in three months of Sunday shows.\n\nABC\u2019s This Week: Rep. Peter King (R-NY); Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT); roundtable includes Matthew Dowd, Michael Eric Dyson, William Kristol, Katrina vanden Heuvel, and Greta Van Susteren.\n\nCBS\u2019 Face The Nation: Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI); Tom Donilon; roundtable includes Capt. Sully Sullenberger, former NTSB chair Mark Rosenker, and Bob Orr.\n\nCNN\u2019s State of the Union: Former DNI John Negroponte; airline experts Colleen Keller, Steven Wallace, and Richard Aboulafia; Sen. John McCain; Reince Priebus; roundtable includes Charles Blow, Ana Navarro and Ron Brownstein.\n\nFox News Sunday: Rep Michael McCaul (R-TX), former NTSB managing director Peter Goelz; Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Bob Corker (R-TN); roundtable includes George Will, PBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff, Karl Rove, and Juan Williams.\n\nNBC\u2019s Meet the Press: White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer; Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Dick Durbin (D-IL); roundtable includes Robert Gibbs, Heritage Foundation\u2019s Israel Ortega, Jon Ralston of \u201cRalston Reports,\u201d and New York Times Washington Bureau Chief Carolyn Ryan.\n\nNote: Allahpundit is on vacation until March 24th.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Mysteries.", "title": "Open thread: Sunday morning talking heads", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/16/open-thread-sunday-morning-talking-heads-117/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-16T12:01:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-15T18:43:42+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, Crimea, Flight 370, midterms, mystery, Russia, Sunday, talk shows, Ukraine,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cad\"", "article_summary": "Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Bob Corker (R-TN); roundtable includes George Will, PBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff, Karl Rove, and Juan Williams.\nABC\u2019s This Week: Rep.
