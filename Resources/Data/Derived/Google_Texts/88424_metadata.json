Heather Fitzenhagen, R-Fort Myers, would allow patients to stay in the surgical centers for up to 24 hours. Also, in a change made during Tuesday's meeting, the subcommittee approved allowing \"recovery care centers,\" which would be facilities where patients could stay for 72 hours after surgery.\n\nThe facilities would not be available to patients who need intensive-care services, coronary services or critical-care services.\n\nRep. Greg Steube, a Sarasota Republican who proposed adding recovery care centers to the bill said the House approved the same idea last year. But hospital-industry officials argued against the bill, in part because they said it could hurt hospitals financially.\n\nMark Delegal, a lobbyist for the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, said profitable services would be \"exported\" from hospitals to the other facilities. Hospital officials said they would be left to care for unprofitable patients, such as people who lack insurance.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Despite objections from the hospital industry, a House panel Tuesday approved a bill that would allow patients to stay overnight at ambulatory surgical", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/overnight-surgery-centers-get-house-help", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201308/stock_inside_hospital.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Despite objections from the hospital industry, a House panel Tuesday approved a bill that would allow patients to stay overnight at ambulatory surgical", "title": "Overnight Surgery Centers Get House Help"}, "wordCount": 256, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Overnight Surgery Centers Get House Help"}, "nid": 9874, "datePublished": "2015-03-11", "story_id": 392282177, "keywords": "ambulatory centers, ambulatory surgical centers, overnight stay, Florida Legislature 2015", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0642\"", "article_summary": "Despite objections from the hospital industry, a House panel Tuesday approved a bill that would allow patients to stay overnight at ambulatory surgical centers and would open the door for longer-term \"recovery care centers.\"\nRep.
