Paul Sedillo of Loveland looks at a 1941 Willys Coupe on display at the Blue Light Special car show Sunday at The Ranch. The show drew hundreds of vehicles from throughout the region.

Sometimes, even the car experts have to deal with the downside of owning fine-tuned, yet vintage, machines.

They break.

At the Loveland Road Knights Blue Light Special car show on Sunday at The Ranch, the faint syrupy whiff of burning coolant could still be detected at the front of the 1941 Willys Coupe owned by Larry Malisani of Arvada.

Minutes earlier, he had driven a short route around the hundreds of cars on display, cars from dawn of the automobile industry to muscle cars of the late 1960s. Then, the engine sprung a leak, sending bright green antifreeze spraying. That engine, a 502-cubic-inch monster that generates 1,250 horsepower, was shut back down. Hood ajar, the Coupe became an object for show and tell — and a little smell.

More than 500 vehicles took part in the show, which started Friday and continued through Sunday behind the exhibition buildings at The Ranch.

Cars that entered had to be from model year 1972 or earlier, but that did not prevent owners from pairing a vehicle with a theme much more modern. A 1960s Chevy, painted bright orange, also had a stuffed clownfish — a la "Finding Nemo" — on the console between the front seats.

Event organizers added an awards banquet Sunday afternoon to offer awards to the top cars and owners who attended.
