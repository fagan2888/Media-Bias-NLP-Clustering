Since conservatives have long been focused on cutting the top marginal tax rate on income without raising the deficit, their tax plans usually involve cutting taxes on the rich \u2014 and therefore raising taxes on some nonrich group.\n\nThis was a problem for Mitt Romney in 2012. He ran on a tax plan that gave high earners at least $86 billion in annual tax cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center. Yet Mr. Romney insisted that his plan would be revenue neutral, meaning it would not raise or lower the deficit. This implied that he would raise taxes on somebody else, which became a significant political problem.\n\nSubsequent conservative tax proposals, including one released Thursday, have recognized and sought to avoid this trap \u2014 and failed.\n\nLast fall, Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, released a tax plan that reflected a message from conservative reformers: Conservatives should abandon the quest for a top income tax rate below 30 percent, so they can focus their tax-cutting energy on the middle class. Senator Lee\u2019s tax plan would drastically increase the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $3,500, giving a big tax cut to middle-income families with children. He\u2019d still cut tax rates at the top, but only to 35 percent.\n\nWhen you also include the Medicare tax (but not the Obamacare Medicare surcharge, which Mr. Lee wants to repeal), the Lee plan would mean a top effective tax rate of 37.9 percent, compared with 43.4 percent today. Like Mr. Romney, Senator Lee tries to get more revenue out of high-income taxpayers by broadening the tax base. And like Mr. Romney, he ends up giving them a net tax cut anyway, because his base broadening doesn\u2019t raise as much revenue as his top rate cut costs, again according to the tax center\u2019s analysis.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf high earners get a tax cut under the Lee plan, and middle-income families with children pay less, who\u2019s paying more? The tax center says \u201cnobody\u201d: All income groups get a tax cut under the Lee plan, which is a $2.4 trillion net tax cut over 10 years. The largest cut as a share of income goes to high earners.\n\nThe economist Robert Stein recognizes that a deficit increase of this size doesn\u2019t work, and in \u201cRoom to Grow,\u201d a collection of conservative reform proposals released Thursday by the YG Network, he proposes some tweaks to the Lee plan so that it\u2019s truly revenue neutral. The release of \u201cRoom to Grow\u201d is a moderately big deal in conservative circles: Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, attended an event celebrating its release.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Stein\u2019s first idea is to apply Senator Lee\u2019s 35 percent tax rate to all taxable income above $36,250 for single filers, or $72,500 for married couples. Indeed, that would raise a lot of revenue; income in that band is currently taxed at 25 percent. It would also mean, when you add on the 15.3 percent payroll tax for Social Security and Medicare shared by employers and employees, that most people with moderate incomes would in effect be paying about 50 cents of every additional dollar they earn to the federal government.\n\nIn addition to probably being an unpopular idea, such a high marginal tax rate would be a significant work disincentive for middle-income people, particularly for the spouse who earns less in a two-income household. It\u2019s a surprising proposal, since much of the rest of \u201cRoom to Grow\u201d focuses on finding ways to encourage people to work.\n\nRecognizing that a 35 percent income tax rate on people making less than $40,000 a year isn\u2019t likely to fly, Mr. Stein offers two other revenue-raising ideas: limiting the mortgage interest deduction more sharply, or reducing the tax preference for municipal bonds. These won\u2019t work, either. The entire cost of the mortgage deduction (which Senator Lee already proposes to partly eliminate) is $72 billion in 2014; the municipal bond tax preference costs $27 billion. But according to the tax center, Senator Lee\u2019s tax plan would cost $138 billion this year relative to current policy, so Mr. Stein\u2019s proposals aren\u2019t enough to fully offset that.\n\nThough the federal government\u2019s fiscal picture has improved in the last few years, a long-run fiscal gap remains. The bad memory of the deficits caused by the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 lingers. There is no room, politically or fiscally, for net tax cuts. But conservatives find it hard to talk about taxes through any framework other than how to cut them.\n\nReformists are urging conservatives to trade one kind of tax cut message for another. But they have yet to find a way to pay for the tax cuts they propose.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140522155322, "twitter": {"description": "A Republican proposal fails to solve a basic math problem: Cutting taxes for someone means raising them for someone else, or raising the deficit.", "title": "There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Free Tax Cut", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/upshot/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-free-tax-cut.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002896484"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jbarro", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/business/23UP-Taxes/23UP-Taxes-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/upshot/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-free-tax-cut.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002896484", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/upshot/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-free-tax-cut.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 22, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Tax Policy Center", "keywords": "Income Tax,YG Network,Tax Policy Center,Stein  Robert,Lee  Michael S (1971- )", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Josh Barro", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/business/23UP-Taxes/23UP-Taxes-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Lee, Michael S (1971- )", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JOSH BARRO", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A Republican proposal fails to solve a basic math problem: Cutting taxes for someone means raising them for someone else, or raising the deficit.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/business/23UP-Taxes/23UP-Taxes-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A Republican proposal fails to solve a basic math problem: Cutting taxes for someone means raising them for someone else, or raising the deficit.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/josh_barro/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-05-23", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Lee, Michael S (1971- )", "published": "2014-05-22", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "23up-taxes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140523123112, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/upshot/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-free-tax-cut.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/business/23UP-Taxes/23UP-Taxes-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Republican proposal fails to solve a basic math problem: Cutting taxes for someone means raising them for someone else, or raising the deficit.", "title": "There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Free Tax Cut"}, "pdate": 20140522, "des": "Income Tax", "articleid": 100000002896484, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Free Tax Cut", "col": "Settling Accounts", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5bb\"", "article_summary": "The tax center says \u201cnobody\u201d: All income groups get a tax cut under the Lee plan, which is a $2.4 trillion net tax cut over 10 years.\nSenator Lee\u2019s tax plan would drastically increase the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $3,500, giving a big tax cut to middle-income families with children.\nHe ran on a tax plan that gave high earners at least $86 billion in annual tax cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center.\nPhotoIf high earners get a tax cut under the Lee plan, and middle-income families with children pay less, who\u2019s paying more?\nReformists are urging conservatives to trade one kind of tax cut message for another."}
