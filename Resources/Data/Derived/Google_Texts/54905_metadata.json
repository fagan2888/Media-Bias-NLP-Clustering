He was, however, dry tinder \u2014 he calls Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d his \u201cfoundational book\u201d \u2014 and now is ablaze, in an understated, upper-Midwestern way. This 55-year-old manufacturer of plastic products from Oshkosh is what the tea party looks like.\n\nJohnson was one of the first Tea Party candidates, a genuine political neophyte who heard the call to higher office over the mortal threat of Obamacare and launched his campaign through Tea Party rallies all over Wisconsin. At an early Madison Tea Party rally, Johnson waved the bloody shirt of the victimized conservatives to the ecstatic crowd:\n\nWe need to elect true conservatives, not politicians but citizen legislators, people who actually listen to us. People who will tell the truth and in the end will do what actually needs to be done. And we need the level of involvement and commitment that is being demonstrated out here today. Because in the end, folks, we will need to out organize the community organizers\u2026Folks this is a fight for freedom. This is not somebody\u2019s else\u2019s fight this is our fight. And this is a fight that we absolutely must win. So may God help us and may God continue to bless the greatest nation in the history of mankind\n\nAll the religious stuff at the end there notwithstanding, he, like most Tea Partyers, is a hardcore social conservative. When Will said that Johnson was a fan of the famous atheist Ayn Rand, he wasn\u2019t kidding. In a video interview for the Ayn Rand Institute the Atlas Society he complains that Americans are suffering from Stockholm syndrome, saying that Obamacare is \u201cthe greatest assault on freedom in my lifetime.\u201d He describes how he went to the Supreme Court to be with those who were begging the justices to leave one last crumb of freedom: the freedom to purchase a product of one\u2019s choice.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s pretty much the extent of Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s definition of freedom. If any starry-eyed libertarians think his love of \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d might lead him to be concerned with government overreach in anything but the economic realm, they\u2019re going to be disappointed. Like most of the Tea Party he is fully on board with the most authoritarian policies of the federal government.\n\nHe is the perfect Tea Party senator, far more in line with the real sentiments of the largely older, white, traditional conservatives who make up that movement than an iconoclast like Rand Paul.\n\nSo what to make of his scolding the people who put him in office at last week\u2019s Republican Leadership Conference?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Movement's favorite son now says he \"never joined a group.\" Here's what's behind Johnson's new crusade (UPDATED)", "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Movement's favorite son now says he \"never joined a group.\" Here's what's behind Johnson's new crusade (UPDATED)", "title": "Tea Party\u2019s double agent: Sen.
