Louis Zamperini, whose B-24 crashed into the Pacific in May 1943. Zamperini survived 47 days in an open life raft at sea, only to be captured by the Japanese and sent to a POW camp, where he was tortured until his August 1945 release.\n\nMuch has been made of Jolie's pivot from actress to director, but despite the terrific acting and gorgeous cinematography, the result is somewhat unsatisfying. The re-creation of the brutality Zamperini suffered at the hands of his captors \u2014 especially a sadistic guard known as the Bird, played by Japanese pop star Miyavi \u2014 is relentless to the point of stomach-turning. And while Jolie overdocuments Zamperini's physical suffering, she offers too little evidence of the inner drive that enabled the onetime U.S. Olympic runner to withstand such torment and live to the age of 97.\n\nUp-and-coming English actor Jack O'Connell (300: Rise of an Empire) does a fine job of breathing life into the energetic younger Zamperini, embodying his inner steel. But his performance cannot transcend the script: Though based on Laura Hillenbrand's magnificent best-seller Unbroken and adapted by a small army of writers (including the legendary Coen brothers), it fails to offer true highs and lows, rendering the retelling a bit monochromatic.\n\nJolie has proved that she can direct a movie. With this second project behind the camera, however, she may have bitten off more than we can chew. \u2014M.G.", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:AARP.org", "Division1": "Division:AARP.org", "page_title": "4 New Films to Unwrap on Christmas", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-01-09T17:32:48.377-05:00", "keywords": "Unbroken, Louis Zamperini, Miyavi, Tracey Ullman, Angelina Jolie, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Big Eyes, Emily Blunt, Stephen Sondheim, Selma, Ava DuVernay, David Oyelowo, The Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Supreme Court, Tim Burton, Rob Marshall, Christine Baranski, Into the Woods", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Meg Grant", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "These period pieces and an all-star musical are certain to enlighten and entertain you over the holidays.", "s43": "31.Entertainment|MyPersonalTime", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Entertainment/Movies for Grownups", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Politics and Society/Newsmakers/Celebrities", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "These period pieces and an all-star musical are certain to enlighten and entertain you over the holidays.", "title": "4 New Movie Releases to Unwrap on Christmas - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2014/new-movies-releases.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/2014-12/200-selma-holiday-movie-roundup.imgcache.rev1418750099315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2014/new-movies-releases", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "entertainment", "IALevel2": "movies-for-grownups", "IALevel3": "info-2014", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-26"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccba\"", "article_summary": "Up-and-coming English actor Jack O'Connell (300: Rise of an Empire) does a fine job of breathing life into the energetic younger Zamperini, embodying his inner steel.\nWith this second project behind the camera, however, she may have bitten off more than we can chew.\nJolie has proved that she can direct a movie.\nMuch has been made of Jolie's pivot from actress to director, but despite the terrific acting and gorgeous cinematography, the result is somewhat unsatisfying.\nZamperini survived 47 days in an open life raft at sea, only to be captured by the Japanese and sent to a POW camp, where he was tortured until his August 1945 release."}
