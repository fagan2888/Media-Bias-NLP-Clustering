What does Obama want us to ignore by getting in a dither over transgender bathrooms?\n\nThe scandals in his administration, for which he has not been held accountable, continue to be a cauldron of corruption, simmering beneath the surface. New evidence keeps bubbling up out of the darkness into the light, even though he has successfully stone-walled on all of them.\n\nEveryone knows he lied about Obamacare to start with. Now, he has been caught spending billions on Obamacare which he was not authorized to do. He lied about \u201cFast and Furious.\u201d He and Hillary could have saved Ambassador Stevens and the others who died at Benghazi, if they had just said the word. He lied and misled the American people concerning the Iran deal.\n\nLies, lies, lies. Then there is Hillary\u2019s e-mail scandal, for which the administration is culpable. Eventually, the details of the scandals will be revealed, and perhaps, in the name of justice, he and Hillary will be prosecuted for their crimes against this nation.\n\nTransgender bathrooms, indeed!!\n\n- JANETTE GREGG, Fort Walton Beach", "article_metadata": {"description": "Magicians use that old sleight-of-hand trick to amuse or abuse their audience.
