K Street bisects the nation\u2019s capital on a route that stretches from Georgetown through the city\u2019s business district into a working-class neighborhood. But \u201cK Street\u201d has long been invoked as shorthand for the monied lobbyists who ply influence in the city from offices scattered along the avenue or nearby.

According the Center for Responsive Politics, the ACA was one of the most lobbied bills in Congress over the last decade with more than 1,250 organizations registered on more than 5,000 issues.\n\nBut what\u2019s missing from this discussion are the hundreds of groups that lobbied an obscure office in the White House to influence the regulations implementing the ACA: the President\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Since the 1960s, the meat of policymaking has steadily shifted from crafting statutes to writing and issuing regulations \u2014 and both the news media and a great deal of academic scholarship seems to have missed that shift.\n\nYet how a law is put into practice can matter almost as much as whether there\u2019s a law at all. We\u2019ve recently seen examples of the power of executive-branch rules and regulations in everything from Obama\u2019s attempt to change immigration policy to the provision of ACA subsidies that led to the recent Supreme Court ruling in King v. Burwell. For example, the Dodd-Frank legislation, which passed in the aftermath of the Great Recession, contained more than 300 provisions that required or authorized new agency rulemaking.\n\nIn a forthcoming study in the American Political Science Review, we uncover suggestive evidence that when interest groups lobby OIRA, they influence the legally binding regulations that result. Specifically, we find that when groups send a consistent message to OIRA officials, that rule is more likely to change.\n\n[The week in SCOTUS: Who gets to decide what a law means?]\n\nWhy lobby OIRA (and what is it again)?\n\nWhy lobby OIRA? OIRA is charged with reviewing \u201csignificant\u201d government agency regulations, including those issued by federal agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, or the Department of Labor, before they become law.\n\nTake for example the most heavily lobbied rule in our study, the Department of Education\u2019s rule on Gainful Employment Measures. According the rule\u2019s abstract, the rule sought to \u201cestablish measures for determining whether certain postsecondary educational programs lead to gainful employment in recognized occupations, and the conditions under which those educational programs remain eligible for the student financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.\u201d With enormous financial stakes involved, lobbying groups and OIRA held 17 individual meetings with 43 interest groups and lobbying firms with almost 200 individuals present.\n\nOIRA is also authorized to offer \u201csuggested policy changes\u201d to the issuing agency, so that the agency can modify its rules to better fit \u201cPresidential priorities\u201d and other goals. Most close observers think that agencies rewrite rules to reflect OIRA\u2019s \u2014 and presumably the president\u2019s \u2014 preferences.\n\n[Cass Sunstein on how government regulations could be a lot simpler.]\n\nBeyond this, we know surprisingly little about how lobbying OIRA actually changes policy.\n\nDoes lobbying OIRA change the law?\n\nThis stage of regulatory policymaking can be pivotal. We examined all regulations reviewed by OIRA from January 2005 through June 2011. We find \u2014 using plagiarism software, similar to what a college professor might use to check for violations across student papers \u2014 that (1) draft Final Rules that agencies submit to OIRA for review and (2) Final Rules promulgated after OIRA\u2019s \u201csuggested changes\u201d often differ substantively. In other words, agencies appear to rewrite the rules \u2014 and therefore, reshape the law \u2014 based on OIRA\u2019s suggestions.\n\nOf course, many rules receive no lobbying while OIRA is reviewing them. But when interest groups do lobby OIRA about a rule, OIRA is more likely to suggest changes to that rule. What\u2019s more, when only business groups lobby \u2014 unopposed by public interest groups \u2014 the rule is especially likely to change. For example, a rule titled \u201cNondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel\u201d saw lobbying only by major airlines, as well as their trade association. Numerous changes occurred between the draft and the final rule, including the exemption of certain aircraft from the requirement to provide an on-board wheelchair, laxer requirements regarding which parts of a terminal need to be accessible to individuals with disabilities, and a restriction of the number of armrests on an airplane that need to be movable.\n\nWe did not find similarly strong effects when public interest groups lobby unopposed, which only occurred in a handful of cases.\n\nBoth news stories and scholarly research too often ignore how much corporate, political, and interest groups can affect laws after they\u2019re passed. The president shapes the law through a variety of strategies like OIRA\u2019s review of agency regulations. And lobbyists know it \u2014 and don\u2019t give up their pursuit until the final regulations emerge. Most media and scholarly accounts miss the significant shift that has occurred from statutory to regulatory policymaking since the 1960s. If you\u2019re interested in understanding how the statutory sausage is made, keep your eyes on rulemaking, all the way through the president\u2019s OIRA review process for agency regulations.\n\nSimon F.
