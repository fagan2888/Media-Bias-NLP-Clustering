(Damian Dovarganes/AP)\n\nAll is forgiven if you\u2019re not familiar with the \u201ctake care\u201d clause in Article II of the Constitution about the presidency, the words that say \u201che shall take Care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d The Supreme Court hasn\u2019t fooled with it in many years. The words are buried below the State of the Union clause, and the business of receiving \u201cAmbassadors and other public Ministers.\u201d They lack resonance; they sound polite.\n\nBut their meaning, traced back through hundreds of years of history and translated into today\u2019s colloquial English is indeed a command: They mean \u201cMr. President, don\u2019t act like a king\u201d \u2014 administer the law, but don\u2019t dispense with it or change it.\n\nIs the president acting like a king? It\u2019s one of those questions ordinary people have asked in recent years, but not the Supreme Court. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a been a bit of an abstraction, until last week, when suddenly the justices, or some of them at least, took an interest.\n\nWhen the court decided to review a lower court order temporarily blocking President Obama\u2019s 2014 decision to defer deportations of \u201cdreamers,\u201d an action he took in the wake of Congress\u2019s failure to pass the \u201cDREAM Act,\u201d the court surprised everyone by dusting off the clause and asking for arguments about whether, in doing so, the president had \u201cfaithfully\u201d executed the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\n\nThat the justices would review the case, decided on less lofty grounds in the lower courts, was expected. The question about the \u201ctake care\u201d clause was not.\n\nOne law professor called it a \u201cbombshell.\u201d\n\n[Supreme Court to review Obama\u2019s power on deportation policy]\n\nTo be clear, administration lawyers regard the Constitutional question as absurd. The president followed the law, they say. He didn\u2019t change it.\n\nBut Texas and 25 other states believe they have a smoking gun: after announcing the immigration \u201cguidance\u201d on dreamers, Obama came out and said: \u201cI just took an action to change the law.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama's response to deportation protesters back in 2014 may come back to haunt him in the upcoming Supreme Court review of his immigration actions. (C-SPAN)\n\nThe fact that the court asked the question does not mean it will answer it. It\u2019s long shot. If it does answer it, and if it answers it broadly, the decision could alter the presidency in ways neither Obama nor his successors will like.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s fair to ask, what is it? Here\u2019s a primer.\n\nUnlike presidents, English monarchs, as legal scholar Zachary S. Price wrote in the Vanderbilt Law Review, enjoyed the right to change laws, \u201cto suspend (either permanently or temporarily) the operation of existing statutes, or grant dispensations\u201d for particular individuals. If the king or queen wanted to let someone import French wine despite a legal prohibition, they just did it \u2014 sometimes in exchange for cash. If they wanted to let someone celebrate religion without regard to the rites of the Church of England, they just did it. Sometimes they\u2019d even let someone get away with murder, the law notwithstanding.\n\n\u201cThe power to dispense,\u201d wrote historian Carolyn A. Edie, gave the royals a \u201clicense to act as if the law dispensed with did not exist.\u201d\n\nKing James II went a little too far in 1686, dispensing with a religious test \u201cto bring Catholics into the church, the army and the government,\u201d Edie wrote, \u201ca policy calculated by everyone except James himself to arouse fear and hostility in his subjects\u2019 hearts.\u201d\n\nIt did just that. Soon he was fleeing the country, replaced by William of Orange and his wife Mary, and the Glorious Revolution. The royal dispensing power disappeared.\n\nAnd it became part of English common law that the \u201cprincipal duty of the King is, to govern his people according to law.\u201d All this was familiar stuff to the drafters of the Constitution, particularly the lawyers among them. It wasn\u2019t a crown that made a monarch; it was power, the power to dispense with the laws of Parliament.\n\nKing James II. (Wikimedia)\n\nThe delegates who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 to consider a new form of government started out with few firm ideas of what exactly they wanted to do. But they knew what they did not want to do: create anything resembling a monarchy.\n\nThey worried so much about public perception on the monarchy issue that they broke their silence one day during their convention to deal with a rumor that deeply alarmed them. The story appeared in August of 1787, that they were preparing to create a monarchy and install a monarch, specifically Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, the second son of George III, apparently a man in need of a job. Panicky at the suggestion that after having thrown off the shackles of a monarchy, they were about to create one, they put out their first and only communique: \u201cTho we cannot affirmatively tell you what we are doing,\u201d it said, \u201cwe can, negatively, tell you what we are not doing \u2014 we never once thought of a king.\u201d\n\nIndeed, they were taking steps to do just the opposite, creating an elected presidency with a set term, separating the powers, and defining, albeit with little detail, the power of the office and the limits on its power.\n\nThey were not starting entirely from scratch. New York\u2019s constitution, among others, included the language, applied to the governor, that he shall take care to faithfully execute the laws.\n\nIt was a grant of \u201cauthority, not to make, or alter, or dispense with the laws, but to execute and act the laws,\u201d one of the chief architects of the presidency, James Wilson, would write later.\n\nWhat of the word \u201cfaithfully?\u201d That\u2019s tough because it entails motive, which entails a little mind-reading. The \u201cterm \u2018faithfully,\u2019 particularly in eighteenth-century usage, seems principally to suggest that the President must ensure execution of existing laws in good faith,\u201d wrote Price, \u201ca meaning consistent with the Clause\u2019s core purpose of ensuring congressional supremacy. Yet the word also implies that executing laws \u2018faithfully\u2019 could be different from executing them strictly.\u201d\n\nRandy Barnett, a scholar at Georgetown University who helped lead the challenge to Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and who teaches contracts law, puts it in the context of a contract. \u201cWhat distinguishes good faith from bad faith performance of a contract is not the exercise of discretion but is the motive or purpose for which discretion is exercised,\u201d he wrote. If discretion is being exercised as a pretext to avoid the spirit of the contract, that\u2019s bad faith.\n\nEveryone, including the courts, agrees that the \u201ctake care\u201d clause gives some flexibility to the president, a kind of prosecutorial discretion. Presidents \u201cdon\u2019t have to enforce the law in every particular case,\u201d Price, an expert on the clause at the University of California\u2019s Hastings Law School, said in an interview with The Post. There are limits to the government\u2019s resources. And the laws are often vague, or have gaping holes. \u201cThe power of executing the laws necessarily includes both authority and responsibility to resolve some questions left open by Congress that arise during the law\u2019s administration,\u201d wrote Justice Antonin Scalia in a 2014 environmental case. \u201cBut it does not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not to work in practice.\u201d\n\nBut how does all this fit in with the immigration case? And why might Obama be at least theoretically vulnerable to a charge that he acted in bad faith, as opposed to, for example, simply exercising prosecutorial discretion, as the government\u2019s lawyers argued.\n\nAs Texas and its allied states argued in the lower court, Obama had tried for months to get Congress to enact the \u201cDREAM Act.\u201d\n\nFailing that, in June 2012, a frustrated president announced that he was moving ahead on his own.\n\n\u201cI have said time and time and time again to Congress that, send me the DREAM Act, put it on my desk, and I will sign it right away \u2026. In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we\u2019ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places\u201d and \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people. Over the next few months, eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama is announcing executive orders on gun control, but how does that work? Here's a look at how the White House, Congress and the Supreme Court have roles \u2014 and limitations \u2014 in executive orders. (Julie Percha,Jackie Kucinich,Rebecca Schatz/The Washington Post)\n\nIn November 2012, the administration then proceeded to implement initiatives that would offer three years of deportation relief to as many as 4 million undocumented parents of U.S.-born children as well as to another group of younger illegal immigrants. Administration lawyers called it \u201cguidance\u201d \u2014 picking and choosing and prioritizing deportations.\n\nPresident Barack Obama responds as he is interrupted while announcing that his administration will stop deporting and begin granting work permits to younger illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and have since led law-abiding lives on June 15, 2012, during a statement at the White House. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nThe states challenging Obama used Obama\u2019s own words as evidence that this exercise in discretion was, in fact, an end run around Congress, a pretext for dispensing with the immigration laws already on the books, which the \u201cDREAM Act\u201d would have changed. Obama as much as admitted it, they claimed.\n\nOn the one hand, he said repeatedly that he lacked the power to do anything in the absence of a change in law, and then, when the law didn\u2019t change, he went ahead and did it anyway.\n\nFor example, in a Univision Town Hall in March 2011 he was asked this:\n\nIn the spirit of your push for immigration reform, would you consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminals? Remember, these are your words: \u201cThis is not about policy. It\u2019s about people.?\u201d\n\nTo which he replied:\n\nWell, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I\u2019m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I\u2019m required to follow the law.\n\nAfter Obama announced the deferrals, The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker Glenn Kessler called it a \u201croyal flip-flop on using executive action on illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more damaging, and also cited by Texas, was Obama\u2019s response to hecklers, after he announced his immigration policies in the wake of the Dream Act\u2019s failure, who accused him of not doing enough.\n\n\u201cListen, you know \u2014 here. Can I just say this, all right? I\u2019ve listened to you. I heard you. I heard you. I heard you. All right? Now I have been respectful, I let you holler. All right? So let me just \u2014 nobody is removing you. I have heard you, but you have got to listen to me, too. All right? And I understand you may disagree, I understand you may disagree. But we have got to be able to talk honestly about these issues, all right? \u201cNow, you\u2019re absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That\u2019s true. But what you are not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law. Point No. 2, the way the change in the law works is that we\u2019re reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally.\u201d (Italics added)\n\nIn the view of Texas and others, Obama admitted both that he had no power under the law and that he thus, in his words, \u201cchanged the law\u201d while pretending that he wasn\u2019t. Bad faith.\n\n\u201cThere generally wouldn\u2019t be any evidence of bad faith,\u201d Georgetown University Law Professor Randy Barnett, who formulated the winning Commerce Clause argument in the Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act, said in an interview. \u201cBut here we have public declarations [from Obama] that \u2018I don\u2019t have the authority, I don\u2019t have the authority, I don\u2019t have the authority\u2019 and that \u2018Congress won\u2019t act, Congress won\u2019t act, Congress won\u2019t act\u2019 and then you also have the enactment of what looks like legal rules, not just discretion, but whole classes of people who are exempt from the law, the very same law the president was urging Congress to pass\u2026.it suggests that he\u2019s not acting in good faith.\u201d\n\nIn their response to the lawsuit, Department of Justice lawyers dismissed the \u201ctake care\u201d claim as \u201cradical,\u201d one that would yield \u201cabsurd\u201d results of the government having to deport every single illegal in the country. In order to make a case, they argued, the challengers would at the very least have to show that the administration \u201chas acted inconsistently with the statutes Congress has enacted,\u201d which they can\u2019t, because it didn\u2019t.\n\nEven then, the issue is statutory, not constitutional. \u201cThe [Homeland Security] Secretary\u2019s discretion to grant deferred action draws upon the Secretary\u2019s broader discretion in enforcing the Nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2026. Congress has authorized the Secretary to \u2018establish such regulations; . . . issue such instructions; and perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his authority\u2019 under the statute\u201d and \u201cthat is all the administration did.\u201d\n\nHow that squares with Obama\u2019s original statements that he needed the DREAM Act to do what he ultimately did, may be a question for the likes of Justice Scalia at oral argument.\n\nWhen the U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen in Brownsville, Tex., issued an order blocking the policies, he did not reach the question raised by Texas on the \u201ctake care\u201d clause. He based his decision to issue a temporary order on the likelihood that the administration breached the rules set out by the Administrative Procedure Act. Nor did the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals deal with the take care clause, as it\u2019s a principle of constitutional adjudication that if a case can be resolved on statutory grounds, any constitutional issue should be avoided.\n\nThen, suddenly last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and in the fine print of its order, said it also wanted to know whether the immigration guidance \u201cviolates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, Article II, section 3.\u201d\n\nNo one knows how many justices agreed to add that question. And nobody knows whether, in the end, the court will try to answer it and if so, what the answer will be. With so many ways to avoid it, including the great case killer called \u201cstanding\u201d\u2014 the states must show they are legally entitled to sue \u2014 it\u2019s a long shot.\n\nBut for the first time in memory, that question \u2014 is the president acting like a king, asked so often in politics of Republican and Democratic administrations, may wind up squarely before the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court surprised everyone last week when it asked whether Obama's \"dreamers\" immigration policies ran afoul of the \"take care\" clause of the Constitution.
