And that's what I intend to do.\u201d\n\nObama goes on to list what he believes are his administration\u2019s biggest accomplishments this past year, including an unemployment rate that has dropped to 5 percent, millions of Americans who are now signed up for health insurance under Obamacare, and the United States\u2019 participation in the historic climate deal reached in Paris,\n\nThis year, the president\u2019s agenda is concerned with urging the GOP-led Congress to approve a trade deal, signing an executive order on gun control and closing Guantanamo Bay, reports ABC News.\n\n\u201cThe president has some more tricks up his sleeve,\u201d said Bill Burton, a former White House aide who was among the first campaign workers hired by Obama when he launched his bid for the presidency. \u201cHe\u2019s more likely to sprint to the finish line than go away and whimper.\u201d\n\nConservatives have seen enough \"tricks\" from the Obama White House. It\u2019s why they\u2019re counting down the days to November 8, 2016. When the president has attempted to use mass shootings as justification to chip away at Second Amendment rights, for instance, Americans have ignored him and rushed to gun stores. As for closing Gitmo at a time when terrorism has produced some of its deadliest carnage yet, Americans have made it clear they want the prison to continue operating.\n\nWith neither Congress nor the public on his side on his most prioritized issues, is the president willing to place his liberal agenda above his legacy?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama has a few controversial New Year's resolutions..05/27/2016 8:34:07AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Obama has a few controversial New Year's resolutions.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Obama Intends to 'Squeeze Every Ounce of Change' He Can Into Final Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/12/28/obama-intends-to-squeeze-every-ounce-of-change-he-can-into-final-year-n2097390", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/355/e2e386c1-a74f-47a0-bbf2-58d340844a56.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Obama has a few controversial New Year's resolutions.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Obama Intends to 'Squeeze Every Ounce of Change' He Can Into Final Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/12/28/obama-intends-to-squeeze-every-ounce-of-change-he-can-into-final-year-n2097390", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/355/e2e386c1-a74f-47a0-bbf2-58d340844a56.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Intends to 'Squeeze Every Ounce of Change' He Can Into Final Year, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s more likely to sprint to the finish line than go away and whimper.\u201dConservatives have seen enough \"tricks\" from the Obama White House.\nAhead of his last State of the Union address on January 12, President Obama emailed his supporters Sunday with news that he has plenty of New Year's resolutions to take care of during his final year in office:\"I've got 12 months left to squeeze every ounce of change I can while I'm still in office.\n\u201cThe president has some more tricks up his sleeve,\u201d said Bill Burton, a former White House aide who was among the first campaign workers hired by Obama when he launched his bid for the presidency.\nWith neither Congress nor the public on his side on his most prioritized issues, is the president willing to place his liberal agenda above his legacy?\nWhen the president has attempted to use mass shootings as justification to chip away at Second Amendment rights, for instance, Americans have ignored him and rushed to gun stores."}
