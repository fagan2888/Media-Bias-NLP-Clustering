Eric Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, spoke at a press conference Sunday, condemning the murder of two NYPD officers by a deranged gunman. At the press conference, Carr said:

“Anyone who’s standing with us, we want you to not use Eric Garner’s name for violence because we are not about that. These two police officers lost their lives senselessly. I [give] condolences to the families and we stand with the families.”

Carr was supported at the press conference by Rev. Al Sharpton and Eric Garner’s widow, Esaw Garner.
