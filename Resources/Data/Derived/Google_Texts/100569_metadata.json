InteHealth recently achieved 2014 Edition Modular EHR Inpatient and Ambulatory ONC Health IT Certification. \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Raritan Bay Medical Center to our growing list of providers using the InteHealth Patient Portal. The Medical Center is a leading provider and we are proud of our new partnership with them,\u201d said InteHealth CEO Anthony McCarley.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act outlines the importance of transitioning patient medical records from paper charts to computerized data for providers and patients. A digital or electronic medical record (EMR) is inherently more easily shared across healthcare providers, can contain more personal health information and allows for increased efficiency and organization of care. Equally important, EMR coupled with online \u2018portals\u2019 enables individuals to access their own information, ensure its accuracy and better monitor their health.\n\nA patient portal is a secure online website that gives patients convenient 24-hour access to personal health information from any location with an Internet connection. Accessing the portal through a username and password, patients can view information such as laboratory and radiology results, and chart these results over time. MYRBMC is regulated by a set of standards defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Incentive Programs that governs the use of electronic medical records. The goal of the CMS program is to reduce cost and improve quality as envisioned by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis new patient portal MYRBMC.rbmc.org greatly enhances patient-hospital communication and patient safety, empowers patients, supports care between visits, and, most importantly, improves patient outcomes,\u201d says Ferrara. \u201cWe are pleased to be providing secure access to healthcare information that\u2019s just a click away for our RBMC patients and their families.\u201d\n\nAbout Raritan Bay Medical Center\n\nWith hospitals in Old Bridge and Perth Amboy Raritan Bay Medical Center (RBMC) is a New Jersey state-designated primary stroke center, a recipient of the American Stroke Association and American Heart Association Get with the Guidelines\u00ae - Stroke Silver Plus and Heart Failure Gold Performance Achievement Awards, recognizing the optimal care of stroke and heart failure patients.
