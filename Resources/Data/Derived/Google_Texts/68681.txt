If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound? And does anyone care?

That’s sort of what Ray Eisenring, of Spring Hill, was asking for days; only in his case a tree fell and made a sound, but it remained where it fell — on his neighbor’s roof.

And he said he couldn’t find anyone who seemed to care. Eisenring said he called Hernando commissioners, county staffers and others to no avail. That’s when he notified Hernando Today, which tried to get to the root of the problem.

The result: On Friday afternoon, a representative from the lending institution which owns the unoccupied, foreclosed home on 5124 Juliet Court, hired a contractor to remove the tree.

The pine tree fell two weeks ago during a bad storm. Eisenring is upset because he wants to sell his house. But who, he asks, would want it if after seeing a 60-foot pine tree atop his neighbor’s house?

Especially when it’s about 5 feet from his property line.

He said the fallen tree was a potential safety hazard; Eisenring and his wife have seen children climb it to reach the roof.

Building official Jim Friedrichs went to the house Friday afternoon at about the same time the tree was being removed. Except for possibly a broken truss, the home had minimal damage, Friedrichs said.

After looking at the tree, Friedrichs said he believed the downed tree was a safety hazard and, if the lender had not removed it, the county likely would have stepped in.

“A good scenario all the way around,” Friedrichs said, adding that taxpayers did not have to pay for any of the procedure.

Friedrichs said such situations don’t always end so amicably.

“We take it seriously and we understand (Eisenring’s) concern,” Friedrichs said.
