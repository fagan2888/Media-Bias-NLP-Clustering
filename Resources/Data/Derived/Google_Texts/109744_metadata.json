The full demand is: \u201cImmediate demilitarization of Campus Safety. Includes, but is not limited to: removal of bulletproof vest from uniform, exclusion of military and external police rhetoric from all documents and daily discourse, increased transparency and positive direct connection to the student body.\u201d\n\nThe effect of removing bulletproof vests would simply be to make public safety officers more vulnerable to attack. It is also unclear how a campus police would exclude \u201cpolice rhetoric\u201d from internal communications, under student supervision.\n\nThe demands appear to be shaped by the ideology of the Black Lives Matter movement, which began last year in response to alleged incidents of police violence against black people, including the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown as he attacked a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has demanded radical changes in policing across the country\u2013often, according to both federal and local officials, to the detriment of public safety in urban communities.\n\nThe students have given the university until Friday to consider their demands. Meanwhile, they plan to continue occupying the three-story administration building.\n\nOther campus protests have resulted in the capitulation of university administrators, most notably at the University of Missouri, where protests prompted the resignation of both the university president and chancellor within hours of each other early last week. A dean of students at Claremont McKenna College also resigned last week.\n\nBrenda Gazzar of the Los Angeles Daily News reports that Veitch has the support of the university trustees. She quotes an open letter by Chris Calkins, chair of the Occidental College Board of Trustees: \u201cFrom the very beginning, Jonathan has focused on creating a more diverse and inclusive institution\u2026He has been tireless in raising money for scholarships; hiring a diverse faculty and staff, and furthering the mission of the college.\u201d\n\nGazzar reports that Occidental\u2019s administration has not only tolerated the demonstrators, but praised them: \u201cWe applaud the socially conscious spirit of these students. They are bringing attention to an important movement and helping our community have a difficult but necessary conversation about race, identity and culture,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nPresident Barack Obama attended Occidental College from 1979 to 1981 before transferring to Columbia University.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Students at Occidental College who have occupied an administration building have demanded campus safety officers not wear bulletproof vests.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Students at Occidental College who have occupied an administration building have demanded campus safety officers not wear bulletproof vests.", "title": "Students Demand 'No Bulletproof Vests' for Safety Officers", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-18-at-5.16.43-AM.png", "height": 600}, "updated_time": "2015-11-18T05:56:13-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/18/students-demand-no-bulletproof-vests-occidental/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Students at Occidental College who have occupied an administration building have demanded campus safety officers not wear bulletproof vests.", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-18-at-5.16.43-AM.png", "title": "Students Demand 'No Bulletproof Vests' for Safety Officers", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Black Lives Matter, campus protest, million student march, Occidental College, oxy, Police, Universities,Big Government, Breitbart California, Education,students demand", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-11-18T05:24:44-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-11-18T05:56:13-07:00", "tag": "Universities", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Education"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe118d\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStudents at Occidental College who have occupied an administration building this week have demanded that campus safety officers stop wearing bulletproof vests.\nThe full demand is: \u201cImmediate demilitarization of Campus Safety.\nPresident Barack Obama attended Occidental College from 1979 to 1981 before transferring to Columbia University.\nIncludes, but is not limited to: removal of bulletproof vest from uniform, exclusion of military and external police rhetoric from all documents and daily discourse, increased transparency and positive direct connection to the student body.\u201dThe effect of removing bulletproof vests would simply be to make public safety officers more vulnerable to attack.\nThe students have given the university until Friday to consider their demands."}
