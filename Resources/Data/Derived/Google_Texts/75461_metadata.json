The company has not narrowed down how many people were affected though, and agents said thousands may not realize it until later this year.\n\nJohn Wing said he and one of his employees in Rowlett got a check from Blue Cross, just a day after CBS11 first reported their story. The company was not giving them credit for having paid deductibles for doctors and prescriptions. It left Wing and others with bills from doctors, and medicines sitting unclaimed at pharmacies because computers showed insurance wouldn\u2019t cover them.\n\nBlue Cross fixed what it called a glitch, but said each case would have to now be made whole on an individual basis.\n\nIt could be months though, according to insurance agent John Stacy, before some people even know they were affected by the problem.\n\n\u201cThe deal is the breadth and scope is completely unknown,\u201d he said.\n\nStacy sells insurance to small businesses and said he believes nearly 40 of his clients are affected by the problem. He\u2019s pretty sure his own policy is part of the issue. His concern is by the time someone realizes they are affected, they are already receiving bills from a provider.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re being asked to float 10-thousand dollar hospital bills for two or three months, and then all is made normal?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really hard to make that whole.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross said last week it was working hard to update impacted accounts. A letter obtained by CBS11 that was sent to one customer, said \u201cDue to increased volumes and unprecedented changes with the Affordable Care Act we realize some members have not been able to fill their prescribed medications. We Apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d\n\nThe company said last week that skyrocketing complaints to the Texas Department of Insurance this year were due in part to a large influx of new customers through the ACA. Complaints now total 385 through last week, more than double the 162 received in all of 2013.\n\nOther companies are also seeing complaints rise. Unitedhealthcare has 226 this year, already more than last year\u2019s total. Cigna has 17, nearly triple its 2013 total. The latter also attributed the number to more customers, and federal healthcare exchange plans that have a smaller network of approved doctors. Confusion about which doctors are actually participating in the plan, may be contributing to more complaints.\n\nUnited also is aggressively trying to control costs to out of network doctors, primarily specialists, possibly causing more complaints. In a statement the company said \u201cWe constantly strive to deliver satisfactory experiences for members, one important aspect of which is to encourage them to use in-network providers to avoid unnecessary out-of-pocket costs.\u201d\n\nTDI is looking at the individual complaints coming in. The Office of Public Insurance Counsel, which advocates for insurance customers in Texas, did not immediately respond to questions Wednesday about any awareness or involvement in the issue.\n\n(\u00a92014 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
