Digging into the numbers, she found that falls occurred most frequently between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., with a peak time around 4 a.m. That period is when the phlebotomist typically enters the room to draw blood or a nursing assistant comes by to check vital signs. Medicated patients often awoke in a daze and, when the clinicians left, would climb out of bed to use the bathroom. Tumbles were all too common.\n\n\u201cYou disturb them, wake them up and they\u2019re groggy; then they try to get up and go to the restroom by themselves,\u201d Lee explains. \u201cThey overestimate their ability to function and walk, resulting in a fall.\u201d\n\nClinical leaders retooled the rounding efforts within the unit to add an extra layer of protection, particularly between 3:30 and 5 a.m. Now, both nurses and nursing assistants check patients every hour, instead of on alternating hours. An extra nursing assistant is kept as a \u201cvariable rounder\u201d to respond immediately when a patient is in distress.\n\nBecause they know someone will be by more frequently, patients are more likely to wait for help before tryting to get out of bed.\n\nRounding clinicians keep a keen eye out for certain risks in the room \u2014 what Lee calls the four Ps: potty, personal items, pain and positioning. Mats are placed on the floor to cushion falls, beds are positioned at a low height with their safety rails up, and belongings are left within arm\u2019s length. Patients who are considered at high risk for falls receive an extra buzzer to alert staff, in addition to those built into the beds.\n\nThe intervention was implemented in September and by December falls had dropped to 1.19 per 1,000 patient days. There were no falls with injury during that time.\n\nUMMC is further educating and engaging at-risk patients with posters placed throughout the hospital and educational chats with family members.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a partnership with the patient,\u201d says Tejal Gandhi, president and CEO of the NPSF. \u201cUnlike some other types of errors, the patient\u2019s involvement, engagement and partnership are really critical in this because the patient is the one who has to know what they can and can\u2019t do, and what\u2019s safe from an activity standpoint.\u201d\n\nThe Joint Commission estimates that each patient fall results in an extra 6.3 hospital days, and an added cost of about $14,000. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identifies falls as preventable events that should never occur. It deems them hospital-acquired conditions and limits reimbursement for treating the consequences.\n\nUMMC hopes to spread its best practices to all inpatient units across the organization starting this summer. It\u2019s also implementing a hospitalwide tool to assess every inpatient\u2019s risk for falling, says Terri Gillespie, R.N., chief nursing executive and chief nursing officer of the adult hospitals and clinics. Called the Hester Davis Scale for falls risk assessment and developed by nurses at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the tool helps nurses to collect details about patients, including age, mental or physical disabilities, and medications that may lead to confusion or dizziness. Based on that information, the scale produces an individualized plan, with suggested interventions such as alarms or signs warning staff of an increased fall risk.\n\nLee says one of the biggest challenges in addressing UMMC\u2019s falls issue was finding nurses with the skills and commitment to spearhead the effort.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part is finding the right person to put in those roles because they\u2019ve got to own it, believe it and stay on top of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI went through a lot of people before I got the right ones in there.\u201d\n\nGillespie says it\u2019s important for the C-suite to buy into the effort, but it\u2019s the bedside clinicians who have to own such improvement efforts. \u201cI think this sort of goes back to Nursing 101, as I would call it,\u201d Gillespie says. \u201cIf you just get back to basics and commit to seeing your patients on a frequent schedule, answering call lights within a defined amount of time, you can reduce the number of falls. It doesn\u2019t take lots of bells and whistles to make a significant improvement, if you just get back to the basics, and do them with a purpose.\u201d\n\nNPSF\u2019s Gandhi hopes the UMMC award encourages other organizations to share what they\u2019ve learned about reducing patient falls. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of different interventions out there and yet, despite all of this, we still have falls,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the things that we struggle with in health care is people don\u2019t necessarily promote their successes as well as they ought to, so this is one way we\u2019re trying to address that.\u201d\n\nExecutive Corner\n\nThe four Ps of falls prevention\n\nWhen nurses round at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, they keep an eye out for four factors that might lead to possible falls with injury:\n\n1. Positioning\n\nIs the patient placed in a comfortable position in his or her bed?\n\n2. Potty\n\nDoes the patient need to use the washroom, and is the pathway clear to the facility?\n\n3. Pain\n\nIs the patient in any sort of discomfort that may require movement or any other assistance?\n\n4. Placement\n\nIs the bed placed at a proper height, with rails up, the trash within reach, and any other needed items at arm\u2019s length?\n\nThe top 10 factors contributing to falls\n\nWorking with seven hospitals since 2011, the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare has strived to eliminate preventable falls. Using a set of measurements and solutions, those taking part in the \u201cPreventing Falls with Injuries Project\u201d have reduced all falls by 35 percent, and those with injury by 62 percent. The center compiled a list of the 10 most common factors causing falls from that work. Erin DuPree, M.D., chief medical officer and vice president of the center, says it\u2019s important to determine which factors are in play for each unique hospital, rather than just tackling all 10.\n\n\u201cThe old way would have been taking this list and trying to fix all of them, as opposed to taking more time up front to actually measure those contributing factors, and discover which ones actually matter in each local project area,\u201d she says. \u201cThe benefit is that a few targeted solutions lead to dramatic improvements, instead of just throwing everything at the wall and hoping it solves the problem.\u201d\n\n\n\n1 | Patient fell while toileting.\n\n2 | Some medications increase the risk of falling when combined with toileting.\n\n3 | Patient did not know, forgot or chose not to use a call light.\n\n4 | Fall prevention education given to patient and family was not used or inconsistent.\n\n5 | Patient is not aware or has not acknowledged a risk for fall.\n\n6 | Assessment tool is not a valid predictor of actual fall risk.\n\n7 | There is a variance in risk assessment ratings by different caregivers.\n\n8 | Prescriptions are not assessed for risk of contributing to falls.\n\n9 | Inconsistent or incomplete communication of patient risk for falls exists between caregivers.\n\n10 | Poor culture of standardization of practice and application of interventions exists.\n\nSource: The Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare, 2014", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Patient Safety Foundation honored the University of Mississippi Medical Center, in Jackson, with its Stand Up for Patient Safety Management Award at its annual meeting in April, acknowledging its tremendous efforts to reduce falls.
