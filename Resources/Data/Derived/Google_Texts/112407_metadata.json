John Adams was one of few elected Republicans who dared question Gov. John Kasich. And now because of term limits he is out.\n\nAdams is one of the limited-government legislators who thought Kasich\u2019s 2010 election heralded a sea change in Ohio. The governor\u2019s proposed\n\ntax hike on drilling for gas and oil, increased state spending and the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare disabused them of the notion.\n\nAs assistant majority floor leader in the House, Adams fought to block Obamacare expansion in the Legislature and gathered signatures for a formal protest when Kasich expanded Medicaid unilaterally.\n\nHe and other conservatives worked for meaningful labor law, defined-benefit pensions and municipal tax structure reform.\n\nWith Kasich loyalists running the Ohio Republican Party and Kasich happy to lean on his bully pulpit, Adams\u2019 contrarian leadership will be missed.\n\n\u2013Jason Hart, Ohio Watchdog\u2013\n\n#13 Scott Wagner\n\nWhen he first got to Harrisburg, newly elected State Sen. Scott Wagner couldn\u2019t help but notice a few of the portraits of former state lawmakers hanging in the hallway of the Pennsylvania Capitol.\n\nAlongside portraits of lawmakers who served with honor were four who had been convicted of crimes. Nobody seemed to care much about it until Wagner, R-York, introduced a resolution condemning the practice of hanging portraits of dishonored lawmakers.\n\nThe portraits didn\u2019t come down, but not long after plaques were affixed to those four portraits chronicling their misdeeds.\n\nSince then, Wagner has helped spur the ouster of the Senate majority leader, challenged public-sector unions, pushed for public pension reform and urged lawmakers to re-evaluate everything, including the Capitol\u2019s electric bill.\n\nWagner\u2019s penchant for speaking bluntly \u2014 he compared union leaders to power-hungry dictators like Hitler \u2014 has been criticized. The criticism is unlikely to silence him.\n\n\u2013Andrew Staub, PA Independent \u2014\n\n#14 Bloggers in the Heitman case\n\nKristy Herron, Susie Taylor and Andrew Howe used their blogs to raise questions establishment media didn\u2019t about the death of an Oak Ridge School District employee.\n\nTraditional media initially didn\u2019t do much investigating in the case. Just last month, the same coroner who ruled that Alex Heitman committed suicide in 2011 recently lost his job due to allegedly tampering with a dead body.\n\nHeitman\u2019s family said that before his death he had discovered taxpayer money had been used to buy methamphetamine.\n\nThe three bloggers, none of whom knew Heitman, and none of whom are journalists by training, refused to accept the suicide ruling blindly. There was no coroner\u2019s report, they wrote, and law enforcement has been far less than transparent in providing information.\n\nA growing number of people in Oak Ridge now believe Heitman didn\u2019t take his own life and two area newspapers eventually had to re-examine the case.\n\nHerron, Taylor and Howe say traditional media avoid bringing negative attention to their communities. Blogging, they contend, is necessary for communities to stay informed and offers the opportunity for candid discussion of community problems.\n\n\u2013Chris Butler, Tennessee Watchdog.org\u2013\n\n#15 The Confidential Source\n\nOne of our best people for 2014 is the Confidential Source.\n\nThat means Watchdog really can\u2019t name this best person of the year. It\u2019s confidential \u2014 and we\u2019ve agreed to keep the identities secret. But you know who you are.\n\nYou make many of our investigative reports possible. We appreciate your tips, information, observations, complaints and concerns. Sometimes\n\nyour emails and calls turn into great stories, sometimes not. Yet they are always deeply appreciated.\n\nAlong with gratitude and praise, here are a few tips of our own:\n\nWe like records and hard evidence. The more, the merrier. Since we can\u2019t name you as a source, we must find other ways to prove the story is true.\n\nThere are conspiracies in the world, but we\u2019re not part of them. When we tell you that your identity will be kept confidential, you can trust us. Our professional reputation is at stake.\n\nSome of you prefer to be anonymous as well as confidential. However, there are times we really need to ask you questions about the information you\u2019ve sent our way. Sometimes we must drop otherwise promising stories because we can\u2019t verify details.\n\nThanks again \u2014 and we look forward to hearing from you again in 2015.\n\n\u2013Mark Lagerkvist, New Jersey Watchdog\u2013\n\n#16 Greendale Village Board of Trustees\n\nThe Greendale (Wis.) Village Board of Trustees stood up to its own parents and its Board of Education in 2014.\n\nThe Greendale Board of Education had asked that polling places be removed from schools after parents, reacting to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn., argued they increased the risk of gun violence.\n\nSandy Hook parents themselves had never asked for voting to be moved somewhere else after the deaths of 26 people.\n\nConcerned about voter disenfranchisement and added costs, village board members asked that taxpaying residents weigh in on a nonbinding referendum on the November ballot. Advocates, worried taxpayers without children would tip the scales in the other direction, asked the board to quash the referendum.\n\nThe village board refused until the school board agreed to withdraw its request to remove the polling places.\n\n\u2013Adam Tobias, Wisconsin Reporter\u2013\n\n#17 Brandon Presley\n\nWith the shifting gusts of public and political opinion, politicians generally spin like a weather vane.\n\nBut despite headwinds from two governors and the Secretary of Energy, Brandon Presley, commissioner for the Public Service Commission\u2019s Northern District, has remained steady and straight.\n\nPresley is one of the few elected officials in the state to decry the oft-delayed \u201cclean coal\u201d Kemper Project power plant. When the other two members of his commission voted to allow Mississippi Power to continue work on the plant, he was Dr. No.\n\nA plant that was supposed to cost $2.8 billion now has a price tag of $6.1 billion and counting, making it one of the most expensive power plants per kilowatt hour in U.S. history. Construction, already a year behind schedule, has cost Mississippi Power ratepayers millions of dollars in increased power rates.\n\nPresley, a Democrat and the former mayor of Nettleton, has gotten PSC opinion to blow in his direction. Earlier this year, the PSC told Mississippi Power until the plant is proven to be in commercial operation it will not hold hearings to decide whether Mississippi Power or ratepayers will pay for building Kemper.\n\nPresley didn\u2019t waver from his convictions and that\u2019s laudable.\n\n\u2013Steve Wilson, Mississippi Watchdog\u2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "Second in a series on the good guys of 2014, who worked for small government and lower taxes.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Second in a series on the good guys of 2014, who worked for small government and lower taxes.", "title": "COUNTDOWN!
