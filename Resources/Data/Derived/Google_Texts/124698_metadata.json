They have performed with the dancehall star Sean Paul, pop stars like Beyonc\u00e9 and Jennifer Lopez and others.\n\nThey started Brukwine in 2012 as \u201ca workout, first and foremost,\u201d Marrow said.\n\nIn a dimly lit long room, participants faced mirrors in rows. Some were wearing Brukwine-emblazoned short shorts, tops, leggings or hats. A trained assistant known as a Brukwine Gyal guided them through stretches. Then, after many of the women put on pumps, platforms and stilettos, a second Gyal led hip-isolation practice to \u201cEvery Gyal a Mine,\u201d by Demarco.\n\nLike belly dancing, Brukwine involves hip movements that call for lots of muscle independence.\n\nBailey stepped to the front in golden stilettos. She drew cheers from the boisterous crowd and began demonstrating the routine of the day, which she and Marrow choreographed for a song called \u201cTouch You,\u201d by Konshens.\n\nBailey counted slowly as the class followed along with her steps and the rhythmic hip gyrations called \u201cwines,\u201d which she said were \u201cthe basis of our whole workout.\u201d The wines, varying in speed, are performed with a circular flow punctuated by a complementary move called a \u201ctick,\u201d a jerk of the hips resembling the ticking motion of a clock.\n\n\u201cGet that hip in it,\u201d she told the class, which went through some rounds before taking it from the top with the music at a club-like volume. Then Marrow, in neon pink stilettos, walked the class through the next piece in the routine at an easygoing pace. It included more steps, a neck and body roll and a \u201cdrop,\u201d in which everyone squatted down and sprang back up.\n\nDevin Edwards, 33, an administrative assistant, said she had been to almost every class for more than a year and was in much better shape as a result.\n\n\u201cGyms are boring \u2014 this is not,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cIt\u2019s sexy to work out in heels,\u201d she added, and some say it makes the routine more strenuous.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/hffit28.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4148\"", "article_summary": "A trained assistant known as a Brukwine Gyal guided them through stretches.\nThen Marrow, in neon pink stilettos, walked the class through the next piece in the routine at an easygoing pace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sexy to work out in heels,\u201d she added, and some say it makes the routine more strenuous.\nThey started Brukwine in 2012 as \u201ca workout, first and foremost,\u201d Marrow said.\nBrukwine is all about breaking out and moving the hips \u2014 something that the creators, Tamara Marrow, 35, and Autavia Bailey, 34, know all about."}
