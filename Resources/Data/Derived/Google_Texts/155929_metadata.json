Kathy Campbell of Lincoln says she expected the battle to be tough and knew Gov. Pete Ricketts opposed expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised with Gov. Ricketts\u2019 comments and his position, because he was pretty clear about that position, I think, during the campaign,\u201d Campbell tells Nebraska Radio Network in an interview.\n\nThe Unicameral moved to table LB 472 until the end of the legislative session after only three hours of debate. Similar measures to expand Medicaid under provisions of the Affordable Care Act in the past failed to overcome filibusters mounted against them.\n\nCampbell heard the same arguments against the measure: skepticism over whether the federal government would continue to pay 90% of the cost, worry about how the United States Supreme Court might rule on another crucial case against the Affordable Care Act, and the cost of expansion.\n\nCampbell expresses frustration supporters couldn\u2019t convince enough senators about the financial benefits of expansion. She cites a University of Nebraska-Kearney study that projects Medicaid expansion could bring in $2.2 billion in federal funds to the state by 2020, more than offsetting the cost of expansion.\n\nExpansion would have extended the state Medicaid health insurance program to approximately 77,000 needy Nebraskans without health care coverage. Campbell says there really isn\u2019t any alternative to provide them coverage. She agrees with the governor that more money needs to be given to the state\u2019s community healthcare clinics, but is quick to add that with only one clinic in western Nebraska, they cannot meet the need.\n\nGoing into debate, the stances of veteran senators were well known. What wasn\u2019t known was how the 18 freshmen senators would vote.\n\nCampbell says she worried she didn\u2019t have the votes going into the debate, especially with the uncertainty of the freshmen and the opposition of the governor. She says a few freshmen have spoken to her since the vote to ask questions about expansion.\n\nThe issue, though, is dead for this session.\n\n\u201cBut, looking at next year, I still have to believe that if there\u2019s interest among some of the freshmen to talk to me about this proposal, it\u2019s worth exploring.\u201d\n\nAUDIO: Brent Martin reports [:45]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nebraska Radio Network", "description": "Even after defeat for three straight legislative sessions, the sponsor of the bill to expand Medicaid in Nebraska says she won\u2019t give up.
