Under the law, anyone without a plan in place by February 15th will face fines.\n\nFor many, the process is confusing and even daunting, but if you haven\u2019t signed up yet and would like to, there\u2019s still time. A non-partisan group called \u201cEnroll Virginia\u201d is offering free help over the phone or in person for anyone who has not chosen a health coverage plan.\n\n\"And hopefully, when they see what we have and hear what we have to say they will have a change of heart if they\u2019re sitting on the fence and at least talk to us because they\u2019ll have the knowledge, the accurate information to help them make an informed decision,\" says Lois Caliri, an outreach specialist with Enroll Virginia.\n\nCaliri says you have to call to make an appointment to meet with a specialist in person or by phone. Enroll Virginia is a non-partisan organization founded by the Virginia Poverty Law Center and other legal aid organizations.
