A 32-year-old Tampa man is in custody and facing murder charges in a Jan. 19 drive-by shooting, the Tampa Police Department said.

Gerald Cheatham, 4212 E. Osbourne Ave., was arrested at his home this afternoon when the U.S. Marshals Task Force determined he was hiding there with several other people. The task force surrounded the house and ordered the occupants out, and Cheatham surrendered after several minutes, police said.

Cheatham was sought in the shootings of brothers Benny Brown, 22, and Braden Brown, 26, about 12:30 a.m. Jan. 19 at Main Street and Rome Avenue. Benny Brown died of his injuries after gunfire came from a white car that passed by the men as they stood outside. Braden Brown’s injuries weren’t considered life-threatening.

Cheatham was charged with second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm from a vehicle. He is being held without bail, according to jail records.
