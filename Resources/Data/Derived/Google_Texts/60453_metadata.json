A group of boys from Hilton College in the KwaZulu-Natal province \u2014 the white and black sons of South Africa\u2019s elite \u2014 had taken a picture of themselves participating in a mock gang rape and it ended up on Instagram. Their \u201cvictim\u201d was a boy dressed in the school uniform of St. Anne\u2019s Diocesan College, a nearby girls\u2019 boarding school.\n\nWhile the scene was captured in a curiously modern fashion, its implied brutality was as old as time. There was a small public uproar, but it soon died down. The boys received no more than a slap on the wrist for their staging of a simulated rape. None were expelled.\n\nI thought about that picture again this month, when Oscar Pistorius was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, after a South African appeals court overturned last year\u2019s manslaughter verdict against him.\n\nMr. Pistorius, who went to an elite high school in Pretoria, has much in common with those privileged Hilton students. South African boys of their class seem raised to believe that they can get away with egregious acts of violent misogyny. Until recently, Mr. Pistorius appeared, like them, to have escaped censure.\n\nBecause he is such a singular figure \u2014 the double amputee who became an athletic phenomenon, competing for his post-apartheid country against able-bodied athletes in the 2012 Olympics \u2014 it has been easy to see Mr. Pistorius as an exceptional figure. But viewed in context, his violence toward his partner makes him seem not unique but entirely a product of his South African-ness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, not all South African men are violent, but an extraordinarily high proportion are. According to a 2009 survey by South Africa\u2019s Medical Research Council based on more than 1,700 interviews, more than one in four men admitted to rape, and of those, 46 percent said that they had raped more than once. Earlier research, conducted in three of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces, found that between about a fifth and a quarter of women had been physically abused by their intimate partners.\n\nViolence against women is often pathologized as a \u201cblack\u201d issue, or a problem of poverty, in South Africa. But the stories of Mr. Pistorius and the Hilton boys, as well as the statistics, suggest that sexual violence crosses boundaries of race and class. The global auditing firm KPMG estimated in 2014 that gender-based violence costs the South African economy about $3 billion a year (calculated at the time of the report), or roughly 1 percent of gross domestic product, in a country struggling to achieve economic growth.\n\nDespite this, South Africa does not have a coherent national strategy aimed at preventing the epidemic of violence. Over the last 20 years, the government has passed a slew of laws aimed at punishing perpetrators of rape and intimate-partner abuse, but it has failed to root out the culture that permits violence against women. In another society, the conviction of Mr. Pistorius might serve as a turning point \u2014 a moment when public desire to end violence lines up with the government\u2019s desire to fix the underlying issues that cause violence. But not here.\n\nThere is evidence that when boys are consistently taught to respect women and girls, over time their behavior improves. For example, a program in South Africa known as the IMAGE Study has found that combining gender training with microfinance initiatives (to empower women economically) has been enormously successful. Intimate partner violence decreased by 55 percent in the rural province where the project had its trial.\n\nYet South Africa lacks political leadership on the issue. Last year, the government of President Jacob G. Zuma appointed Susan Shabangu as minister of women. In a previous post, as deputy safety and security minister in 2008, Ms. Shabangu was heavily criticized for urging police officers to shoot to kill criminal suspects. Four years later, she was the mining minister during the monthslong labor dispute that led to the Marikana Massacre, in which the police killed 34 miners. This hardly seems a good r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for an official tasked with reducing violence, in the home or otherwise.\n\nOthers in the nonprofit sector who are better qualified find their efforts hampered by the overwhelming demand for services. Gender violence projects are also not easy to win funding for. Although South Africa is classified as a middle-income country, activists found themselves in the absurd situation last year of having to appeal to international donors to keep open the doors of the country\u2019s oldest center for rape survivors.\n\nFrustrations mounted when, soon after taking office, Ms. Shabangu suspended a national council that had been working on a plan to end gender-based violence. Initiatives like school-based training and education, adding more social workers and domestic violence shelters, and plans for private-sector funding of call centers and cellphone hotlines have been shelved.\n\nThe minister\u2019s attitude and her department\u2019s abysmal lack of direction have disappointed activists who had hoped that a spate of high-profile deaths of women like Anene Booysens, a 17-year-old whose brutal rape, killing and mutilation shocked the nation in 2013, and Zanele Khumalo, a model whose murder case was tried in the courtroom next to Mr. Pistorius\u2019s last year, would provide new political impetus.\n\nSouth Africans can\u2019t afford to be disheartened. Every day, on average, 118 women report to the police that they had been raped. And every day, three women are killed at the hands of a partner. That is the South Africa of Mr. Pistorius.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pistorius may have failed, finally, to get away with murder. But as long as there are boys growing up who, like the Hilton College students, think rape is a joke, activists have no choice but to continue their campaign \u2014 with or without government backing.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151214062826, "twitter": {"description": "Men\u2019s domestic violence toward their partners is an issue the government is choosing to ignore.", "title": "South Africa\u2019s Pistorius Problem", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/opinion/south-africas-pistorius-problem.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004084647"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/14/opinion/edmsimangart/edmsimangart-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/opinion/south-africas-pistorius-problem.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004084647", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/opinion/south-africas-pistorius-problem.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "South Africa\u2019s Pistorius problem", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 14, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Sex Crimes,South Africa,Pistorius  Oscar,Social Conditions and Trends", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Sisonke Msimang", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/14/opinion/edmsimangart/edmsimangart-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Pistorius, Oscar", "slug": "15msimang-INYT", "byl": "By SISONKE MSIMANG", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Men\u2019s domestic violence toward their partners is an issue the government is choosing to ignore.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/14/opinion/edmsimangart/edmsimangart-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Men\u2019s domestic violence toward their partners is an issue the government is choosing to ignore.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 14, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-12-15", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Social Conditions and Trends", "published": "2015-12-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "South Africa", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151215031805, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/opinion/south-africas-pistorius-problem.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/14/opinion/edmsimangart/edmsimangart-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Men\u2019s domestic violence toward their partners is an issue the government is choosing to ignore.", "title": "South Africa\u2019s Pistorius Problem"}, "pdate": 20151214, "des": "Social Conditions and Trends", "articleid": 100000004084647, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "South Africa\u2019s Pistorius Problem", "col": "Op-Ed Contributor", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "PhotoIn October, a scandal broke at one of South Africa\u2019s most prestigious private boarding schools.\nThat is the South Africa of Mr. Pistorius.\nViolence against women is often pathologized as a \u201cblack\u201d issue, or a problem of poverty, in South Africa.\nMr. Pistorius, who went to an elite high school in Pretoria, has much in common with those privileged Hilton students.\nUntil recently, Mr. Pistorius appeared, like them, to have escaped censure."}
