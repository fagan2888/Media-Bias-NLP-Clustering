To be sure, there were good deals for consumers in the first year of the ACA.\n\nBut the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Sara Collins, who co-authored this report, says for individuals earning about $30,000, or say $60,000 for a family of four, those deals could be hard to find.\n\n\u201cPeople are paying more than they would have if they had gotten a plan from an employer,\u201d she says.\n\nCollins\u2019 report raises an important question: Are the ACA subsidies generous enough to make insurance affordable? The federal government is on track to spend at least $11 billion in financial assistance this year.\n\nSharon Long with the Urban Institute says a chunk of people who buy their own coverage\u2014in and off of the exchanges\u2014are still struggling.\n\n\u201cAmong those who are buying coverage on their own, almost half report they are satisfied with their coverage. But that means about half are not satisfied,\u201d she says. For the unsatisfied, the big problem is price, says Long.\n\nAnd, she adds, that\u2019s the case for more than half of the 41 million Americans who remain uninsured.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/09/18/health-care/how-affordable-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/obamacare.PNG?itok=R2XexhVi", "type": "article", "description": "A new survey suggests many Americans find their ACA coverage affordable.", "title": "How affordable is the Affordable Care Act?"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "GOIJIDBaBll5W4R/956+3YI4EuecQ6np8F9z0BS2YBOumsnDOw8LIyOTytEou1VxY94rYpttWS6j/QwoV/UDUw==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc5f\"", "article_summary": "- Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesA survey out on Thursday suggests many Americans who signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) find their coverage affordable.\nCollins\u2019 report raises an important question: Are the ACA subsidies generous enough to make insurance affordable?\nYudelmy Cataneda, Javier Suarez and Claudia Suarez sit with Yosmay Valdivian, an insurance agent from Sunshine Life and Health Advisors, as they and others try to purchase health insurance under the Affordable Care Act at a store set up in the Mall of America.\n\u201cAmong those who are buying coverage on their own, almost half report they are satisfied with their coverage.\nAnd, she adds, that\u2019s the case for more than half of the 41 million Americans who remain uninsured."}
