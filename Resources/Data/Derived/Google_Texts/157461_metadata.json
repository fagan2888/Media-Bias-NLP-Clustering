But as an examination of the actual statistics (taken from the CIA\u2019s World Fact Book), as the blog FirstOneThrough shows, the Palestinians are a lot better off than many, including many among their Arab brethren:\n\nPopulation Growth rate : Gaza (#13) and the West Bank (52) have among the highest population growth rates in the world. (snip)\n\nBirth rate : Gaza (#35) and West Bank (67) are much higher than many Arab and Muslim countries: Yemen (#39), Jordan (53), Tunisia (112) and Turkey (114)\n\nDeath rate : Palestinians have the lowest death rates in the world Gaza (#220) and West Bank (#215). Jordan ranks 212, Tunisia 167, Turkey 162 and Yemen 153.\n\nNet Migration : Compared to the world and the volatile Middle East, West Bank (#84) and Gaza (#108) are fairly stable, compared to Jordan (5), Yemen (37), Turkey (71) and Tunisia (161).\n\nLife expectancy at birth : West Bank (#91) and Gaza (#109) have higher life expectancies than Jordan (#117), Turkey (124) and Yemen (175) and about the same as Tunisia (92).\n\nInfant Mortality : Palestinian Arabs have much lower infant mortality rates with Gaza (#105) and West Bank (#117) much lower than Yemen (38), Tunisia (78), Turkey (84) and Jordan (104).\n\nUnemployment : the Arabs in West Bank (#169) and Gaza (170) have high unemployment for people aged 15-24, as it has one of the highest percentages of its population under 20 years old, like Yemen. Turkey ranks #101, Jordan 133, Tunisia 151 and Yemen ranks 188.\n\nLiteracy rate: Gaza (96.4%) and the West Bank (95.6%) compare very favorably to other countries including Jordan (93.4%), Tunisia (88.3%) and Yemen (63.9%), while lower than Turkey (98.8%).\n\nMaybe it is time for Turkey to take care of its own.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/01/those_poor_palestinians.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Those poor Palestinians!"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd751e\"", "article_summary": "(snip)Birth rate : Gaza (#35) and West Bank (67) are much higher than many Arab and Muslim countries: Yemen (#39), Jordan (53), Tunisia (112) and Turkey (114)Death rate : Palestinians have the lowest death rates in the world Gaza (#220) and West Bank (#215).\nLiteracy rate: Gaza (96.4%) and the West Bank (95.6%) compare very favorably to other countries including Jordan (93.4%), Tunisia (88.3%) and Yemen (63.9%), while lower than Turkey (98.8%).\nJordan ranks 212, Tunisia 167, Turkey 162 and Yemen 153.\nInfant Mortality : Palestinian Arabs have much lower infant mortality rates with Gaza (#105) and West Bank (#117) much lower than Yemen (38), Tunisia (78), Turkey (84) and Jordan (104).\nTurkey ranks #101, Jordan 133, Tunisia 151 and Yemen ranks 188."}
