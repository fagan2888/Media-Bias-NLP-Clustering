I hope the GOP candidates were taking notes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speech was clear, simple and powerful \u2013 all the ingredients necessary to appeal to a wide and general audience, which is a good thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Republican Party]\n\nOf course, Democrats \u2013 most notably and tearfully House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2013 called the speech condescending, which is actually such an elitist thing to say. Pelosi and others know perfectly well that any open-press speech in the House chamber has an audience far, far beyond the members of Congress who happen to be breathing the same air as the speaker at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Pelosi really did have tears in her eyes that day, perhaps the real reason was a sentiment closer to regret or longing. Or even shame. Because to watch Netanyahu was to see a contrast with America\u2019s current leadership that is painful for many of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a communicator. Netanyahu opened with thanks, respect and deference, sincerely noting that he was addressing \u201cthe most important legislative body in the world\u201d \u2013 a phrase that brought pride to my heart as an American \u2013 before spending several minutes enumerating his genuine appreciation for all that the Congress and the president have done for Israel. It was downright elegant.\n\n\n\n\n\n[READ: Netanyahu: Nuclear Deal 'Paves Iran's Path to the Bomb']\n\nHe went on to deliver one clear, efficient line at a time. More often than not, it appeared that each of Netanyahu\u2019s paper pages (wasn\u2019t it fun to see someone using paper instead of a teleprompter?) contained just one sentence, maybe two \u2013 the kind of short paragraphs that make speeches easy to listen to.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid he give a history lesson? Yes. Is the eloquent sharing of knowledge an act of condescension? Hardly. It can be a great act of leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\nNetanyahu didn\u2019t tell us what Israel \u2013 and the world \u2013 are up against when it comes to Iran; he showed us. He showed us with stories as well as facts, all the while weaving in finely calibrated reminders that his people know something about enemies who seek to destroy entire populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Democrats]\n\nAnd he did all this while sounding, well, American. His mastery of American English is proved by the fact that his word choice is not soaring, but grounded. And it is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does not mean that the speech lacked poetry, by the way. Netanyahu masterfully included lines that quite intentionally appealed to the ear. Indeed, his use of repetition of words is a literary technique used by poets. For instance, there was this line:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this:\n\nThis deal won't be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd also:\n\nIf Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.\n\nAnd of course the speech\u2019s final crescendo began with a quote from great American poet Robert Frost. To an English major from New England like myself, it was the \u201cyou had me at \u2018hello\u2019\u201d moment. The quote from \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d \u2013 one of the most famous and loved American poems \u2013 provided an important nod to our culture, the perfect bookend to a speech that was deeply respectful of our country while pressing us to change course on an important issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Congress]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "opinion-blog/blogentries", "keyword": "Decision 2016 [News]", "title": "GOP 2016 Hopefuls Can Learn a Lot From Netanyahu's Speech to Congress", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "GOP presidential hopefuls can learn a lot from Benjamin Netanyahu's excellent speech to Congress.", "title": "Bibi Knows Best", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2015/03/05/gop-2016-hopefuls-can-learn-a-lot-from-netanyahus-speech-to-congress", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/92/740ca5a4f9f6207e9db2acf2015d1f/media:797c5e8972f14475aef50f31bb737a36USIsraelNetanyahu.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP presidential hopefuls can learn a lot from Benjamin Netanyahu's excellent speech to Congress.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP 2016 Hopefuls Can Learn a Lot From Netanyahu's Speech to Congress"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 5, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,TJS,Netanyahu, Benjamin,Congress,Israel,Iran,nuclear weapons,2016 presidential election,Decision 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "GOP presidential hopefuls can learn a lot from Benjamin Netanyahu's excellent speech to Congress."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda55a\"", "article_summary": "Netanyahu didn\u2019t tell us what Israel \u2013 and the world \u2013 are up against when it comes to Iran; he showed us.\nThe speech was clear, simple and powerful \u2013 all the ingredients necessary to appeal to a wide and general audience, which is a good thing.\nBecause to watch Netanyahu was to see a contrast with America\u2019s current leadership that is painful for many of us.\nAnd of course the speech\u2019s final crescendo began with a quote from great American poet Robert Frost.\nIf Pelosi really did have tears in her eyes that day, perhaps the real reason was a sentiment closer to regret or longing."}
