Many of those deaths are preventable.\n\n\u201cDepression is not normal. Effective medication and therapies are available to return people to normal psychological function and reduce their risk of suicide,\u201d said Mark Pollack, M.D., chairperson of the Rush University Medical Center Department of Psychiatry in Chicago.\n\n\u201cThis is a treatable illness. People shouldn\u2019t have the false assumption that they have to live their life like this,\u201d said John Zajecka, M.D., clinical director of the Woman\u2019s Board Depression Treatment and Research Center at Rush University and Medical Center.\n\n\u201cDespite all the treatments we have today, suicide rates have increased. You would think we\u2019d see a reduction,\u201d said Zajecka, who is a member of the scientific advisory board of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) and leader of the new study.\n\nThe suicide rate nationwide has been increasing gradually since 2000, with 41,149 suicides taking place in the U.S. in 2013 (the most recent year for which data is available), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC reports that an estimated 1.3 million attempted suicide in 2013 and about 9.3 million adults had suicidal thoughts during that period.\n\nThe danger is even greater for high school-aged children: In 2013, eight percent of students in grades nine to 12 attempted suicide and 17 percent seriously considered doing it, according to the CDC.\n\nAdolescents\u2019 high risk of suicide is part of the reason why the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a draft recommendation that children ages 12 to 18 be screened for major depressive disorder.\n\nPollack believes that better screening for suicidal thoughts among patients at all ages could help prevent suicides, noting that most people who kill themselves had interactions with some kind of medical professional in the months immediately before the suicide.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a reluctance in medical and other settings to ask about suicides and risk factors like depression,\u201d he said. There is a mistaken notion that asking an individual about suicide will \u201cput the idea in their heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, patients are often relieved to be able to talk about these distressing thoughts. Screening for suicidality can be a life-saving intervention.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that barriers to access to mental health care remain, despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which required that insurers\u2019 mental health coverage be comparable to other medical coverage.\n\nAbout one-third of people the U.S. find mental health care inaccessible, and more than four in 10 see cost as a barrier to treatment, according to a new study.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure people with mental health issues have ready access to care,\u201d Pollack said.\n\nAccess to mental health services is critical, given that more than 90 percent of people who commit suicide are suffering from at least one psychiatric disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and abuse of alcohol and/or other drugs, according to the AFSP.\n\nExternal stresses, such as job loss, financial strains, divorce, or bullying, add to the risk of suicide. \u201cEnvironmental stressors like these in association with an underlying psychiatric disorder can be a particularly lethal combination,\u201d Pollack says.\n\nMilitary veterans are particularly at risk, with 22 killing themselves on average each day, said Pollack. \u201cMore veterans have died by suicide in the last decade than by military combat,\u201d he observes.\n\nPeople who have attempted suicide in the past are at greater risk to do it in the future. Individuals who have contemplated particular means for killing themselves \u2014 including those with ready access to firearms or those who have stockpiled pills \u2014 are at particular risk.\n\nFurther, those who talk about life not being worth living, being a burden, wishing they were dead, or plans to harm themselves are in danger of harming themselves. According to the AFSP, somewhere between 50 and 75 percent of people who commit suicide give warnings to someone beforehand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that people who do it, don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cActually, the opposite is often true. A lot of people show up in medical offices in the weeks and months before they attempt to kill themselves, suggesting there are opportunities to intervene.\u201d\n\nIf someone is expressing suicidal thoughts and feelings, refer the person for help immediately. \u201cIf somebody is actively suicidal and talking about killing themselves, it\u2019s a medical emergency that required urgent intervention,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cI would get them into an acute setting \u2014 an emergency room or a medical or mental health provider\u2019s office immediately.\u201d\n\nInvestigators are working to develop novel interventions that may provide rapidly acting, effective treatment for individuals at the brink of killing themselves.\n\nZajecka is studying the use of eskatamine (a formulation of the anesthetic katamine) to treat depression and significant suicidal thoughts in people who either seek help in an emergency room, are referred for hospitalization by a health care provider, or are self-referred.\n\nStudies show that ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects when it\u2019s administered intravenously, but the time and effort needed for IV medications makes that method impractical for treating suicidal episodes. Instead, the study will evaluate eskatamine delivered in a nasal spray.\n\nIn a new study half the patients will receive eskatamine in four-day intervals, beginning with their hospitalization, and the other half will receive a placebo. (Both groups also will receive standard antidepression treatment.)\n\nAll the patients will undergo a psychiatric assessment an hour after receiving the drug or placebo to evaluate the degree of their suicidal feelings. The researchers will compare the results of the evaluations to see if the group receiving eskatamine shows greater improvement than the placebo group.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things we can do as doctors is provide hope and let people know there are treatments out there and never give up,\u201d Zajecka said. \u201cHope is so important in this.\u201d\n\nSource: Rush University Medical Center/Newswise\n\n\n\nDepressed young man photo by shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new national study hopes to determine if a new form of treatment can reduce depression symptoms, including suicidal ideation, quickly.
