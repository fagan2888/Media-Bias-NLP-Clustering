Miller submitted a question, but two key parts of her question were removed surrounding data collection on her children:\n\nWhat is the process for parents to review what data has been or will be collected on our kids?\n\nWhat are parents options for opting out of data collection on our kids?\n\nMiller also asked why \"parents across the state [have not] heard of Common Core until the month of its implementation?\" and also commented that parental input was never requested.\n\nMiller's questions were never answered.\n\nBowie writes that once Small broke the rules, astonishingly, the engaged father\n\n\"was pulled out of the meeting, arrested and charged with second-degree assault of a police officer.\"\n\nUnless the dad here decided to attack the security guard after he was removed, the video certainly shows no \"assault.\" Miller noted that the question came as the meeting was coming to a close.\n\nFortunately, Ann Miller has a video of the incident, which clearly illustrates Small speaking up, and being removed for his efforts. As the father was being led away by a security guard, he said to the audience,\n\n\"Don't stand for this. You are sitting here like cattle.\" Then he said, \"Is this America?\"\n\nBowie writes that Small\n\n\"was taken to the Towson precinct and detained. Small was charged with second-degree assault of a police officer, which carries a fine of $2,500 and up to 10 years in prison, and disturbing a school operation, which carries a fine of $2,500 and up to six months.\"\n\nHopefully, Small's story will not go unnoticed by the complicit mainstream media. His only crime was being an engaged father.\n\nFollow Renee Nal on Twitter @ReneeNal and Facebook.\n\nCheck out her news and political commentary on Liberty Unyielding, Gather and TavernKeepers.com for news you won't find in the mainstream media.
