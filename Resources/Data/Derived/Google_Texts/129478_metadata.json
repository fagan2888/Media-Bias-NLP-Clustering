Their presidential primary has amply demonstrated their Base\u2019s profound disaffection. You can call it anger, you can call it delusion \u2013 you can call it a tuna fish sandwich. But when 70+% of your voters don\u2019t like anyone having anything to do with anything you\u2019ve been doing \u2013 you absolutely call it a problem.\n\nAnd when it\u2019s this big, it\u2019s a problem for the Party \u2013 not their voters. There\u2019s an old banking joke: If someone owes the bank $10,000 \u2013 that someone has a problem. But if someone owes the bank $10 million \u2013 the bank has a problem. 70+% is the bank having a problem.\n\nThe Party remains somewhere in Egypt \u2013 along the banks of Denial. It likes to dismiss these people with incredibly flattering terms like \u201cCrazies.\u201d And elected officials these people actually like with terms of endearment like \u201cJackass.\u201d Because you always go far when insulting the majority of your voters.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner is turning in his gavel and leaving Congress \u2013 apparently because everyone thinks he\u2019s done a phenomenal job. And on his way out the door he is denouncing his voters for having \u201cunrealistic expectations.\u201d He would know \u2013 they have them in large part because his Party and their campaign minions set them every election cycle when they\u2019re lying to get votes.\n\nThey last October ran thousands of ads promising to defund ObamaCare and President Barack Obama\u2019s unConstitutional fiat amnesty. People then ridiculously expected them to defund ObamaCare and Obama\u2019s amnesty. Talk about \u201cunrealistic expectations.\u201d Immediately after the election, the GOP funded both. And are now saying to their voters what Otter said to Flounder in Animal House: \u201cYou f***ed up \u2013 you trusted us.\u201d\n\nAll of this is part of a larger problem. The GOP appears to be at best utterly indifferent to \u2013 at worst complacently complicit with \u2013 this President\u2019s all-encompassing, omni-directional unConstitutional overreaches. He and his many, many political bureaucrats are every second of every day dramatically exceeding their legal bounds to exponentially grow government. And the GOP has done just about nothing to stop any of it.\n\nWe the People gave the GOP the Congress \u2013 and thus the power of the purse. Yet every time a potential political scrap looms anywhere way out on the distant horizon \u2013 the GOP Leadership goes into a preemptive cringe. And screeches from their crouch that they pinky-swear-promise they absolutely will not use their power of the purse. One would think that if you from a deep sleep shook awake Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he would reflexively yell \u201cNo shutdown!\u201d\n\nWhat HAS the GOP done? Well, they sued ObamaCare. Which is at best extra-Constitutional \u2013 I don\u2019t recall any of our Founders mentioning calling the trial bar as a remedy to tyranny. But there is a non-shutdown, Constitutional remedy at their disposal \u2013 they can impeach bureaucrats.\n\nA government shutdown (which is really only ever like a 13%-of-the-government shutdown) is inarguably high profile \u2013 and thus the merest mention thereof causes Republicans to run for a corner in which to collectively cower. A Presidential impeachment is also very visible.\n\nBut the American people\u2019s initial response to impeaching a bureaucrat would most likely be \u201cWhat? Who?\u201d The repeal of these faceless cogs in Obama\u2019s Machine would allow the GOP to not just pretend to oppose this President\u2019s agenda \u2013 but ACTUALLY oppose this President\u2019s agenda. In a way that has little prospective political cost \u2013 and thus shouldn\u2019t cause their fragile constitutions any discomfort. And it affords them opportunities to message on the concepts and advantages of legal and less government.\n\nArguably no bureaucrat deserves impeachment more than Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head Gina McCarthy. Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Gosar rightly thinks it\u2019s time.\n\nFor far too long, Congress has allowed unelected bureaucrats and executive branch officials to slowly bend and break the laws of this country in order to further their own partisan political agendas. We have reached a breaking point where the American people have no faith in the fundamental checks and balances put in place by our founders to protect our liberties and freedoms.\n\nOn numerous occasions, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy broke the law by lying to Congress in order to force misguided and overreaching regulations, which have no scientific basis, down our throats. Perjury before Congress is perjury to the American people and an affront to the core principles of our Republic and the rule of law\u2026\n\nLying to Congress is not an unserious thing. This Administration\u2019s first Attorney General, Eric Holder, was found in Contempt of Congress for withholding information therefrom. A problem with a Contempt of Congress charge for the Attorney General is \u2013 the Attorney General is the one who is supposed to mete out punishment. When the Executive Branch is supposed to discipline itself,\u2026.\n\nImpeachment bypasses this self-dealing. Congress impeaches \u2013 the bureaucrat goes. Miss McCarthy repeatedly lied about policies that are incredibly damaging to just about every sector of the private economy. She repeatedly lied so as to protect and advance their anti-capitalism agenda \u2013 at the expense of the rule of law and Congressional oversight. She needs to go.\n\nThe GOP should remove her \u2013 and use the process as an opportunity to detail the very obvious case for why. And when they see the sky doesn\u2019t come crashing down upon them \u2013 they should feel liberated to lather, rinse and repeat with all manner of McCarthy\u2019s out-of-control colleagues.\n\nAnd as an added bonus \u2013 their Base will love it. It is the very good policy \u2013 that is also very good politics. If the GOP wants to save themselves from a fate worse than Trump \u2013 they should get busy doing it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "The national Republican Party is currently in the midst of a slow-motion train wreck.
