But organizers say after handing out more than 5,000 coats last week, they now have less than 500.\n\nNearly 285,000 lives have been touched by the generosity of Oklahomans, many kids who didn't have to go through the winter helpless against the bone-chilling wind.\n\n\"One guy lost his job,\" Francine Robinson said. \"He said he and his family didn't have anything.\"\n\nRobinson knows what it's like to be cold, that's why she's returning the favor by volunteering.\n\n\"One lady, she had twins, and do you know we found two coats that matched for the twins?\" Robinson said.\n\nBut after the first snap of winter last week, Catholic charities handed out all its leftover inventory from last year.\n\nAnd the weather is only getting colder from here.\n\nDistribution coordinator Becky Wisdom said the program needs about 10,000 coats to meet their 15,000 a year average.\n\nShe said the light jackets they have now just won't cut it.\n\n\"A coat is something that you want your child to have on when he's waiting at the bus stop,\" Wisdom said.\n\nAnd when the supply runs low like it is now?\n\n\"It's heart wrenching,\" Wisdom said. \"It's difficult to send somebody away.\"\n\n\"Every year, I think we're not going to have enough coats to satisfy the need this year, and Tulsa always comes through,\" John Rothrock said.\n\nYale Cleaners takes the donated coats, cleans them, mends them and ships them to Catholic Charities to be handed out.\n\nRothrock said with all of the outreach programs this time of year, this is a need that most people can meet, especially those with children.\n\n\"They start out small and they grow, and grow and grow, and need a bigger and bigger and bigger coat, so really it's a great fit; it's a natural process,\" Rothrock said.\n\nHe said knowing that a child's eyes will light up when they find the perfect fit is worth the trip to the closet.\n\n\"When you see the kids come in and they try on a couple of coats, and they find that one that fits just right, usually it's the mom's face that lights up. In this weather, it's difficult to stay warm, and when you give back, it kind of warms your heart, too,\" Wisdom said.\n\nRothrock said the most needed items are small children's coats and plus-size coats for adults.\n\nYou can drop off your new or gently used coats at any Yale Cleaners in the Tulsa area.\n\nGo here to find a drop-off location\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "If you haven't already, you'll be breaking out your heavy coat soon.
