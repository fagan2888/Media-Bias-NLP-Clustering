So the final amount awarded to contractors since the launch of healthcare.gov may be more than $1 billion.\n\n\u201cThe torrent of late spending \u2014 almost $352 million of $1 billion in awards to the top 10 contractors \u2014 indicates the magnitude of the work still to be done as opening day approached,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Peter Gosselin reported, \u201cand helps explain the information technology problems that have dogged the exchange system since its launch.\u201d\n\nThe Bloomberg figure may come as a shock to many Americans. Indeed, despite the GAO stating earlier that its data was incomplete, the $394 million estimate has been widely reported as the final cost for the launch of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut based on Obamacare-related payments to at least 10 firms involved in building the federal online health insurance marketplace, the GAO\u2019s figure may be way off, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn aggregate, the 10 firms won a third of their health law-related contract dollars in the six months ended Sept. 30,\u201d Gosselin wrote.\n\n\u201cBesides showing the rush to issue contract awards in the months leading up to the opening of exchanges, the (Bloomberg Government) analysis also revealed that the implementation of the health law is costing substantially more than generally is portrayed,\u201d he added.\n\nAs of this writing, the $1 billion-plus website was still not functioning as designed.\n\n(H/T: Zero Hedge)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The to-date cost of the glitchy Obamacare website has topped $1 billion, easily surpassing the $394 million originally estimated by the Government Accountability Office, according to a Bloomberg Government analysis.
