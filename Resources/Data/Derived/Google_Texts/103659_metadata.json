If so, what are the key factors contributing to the shortage and what should be done to best address the issue?\"\n\nExperienced acute care nurses remain in high demand, according to a 2015 report, and demand for nurses with bachelor degrees continues to inch upward. By many accounts the healthcare hiring field remains robust for nurses, particularly as a variety of roles open up in the community for nurses interested in population health.\n\nThe first blog post examines the conflicting opinions of groups that say the U.S. will be facing a nursing surplus by 2020 and those which claim that the nation is perpetually short of qualified nurses.\n\n\"The increased emphasis on specialization may contribute to specific types of shortages in nursing,\" Judy Burckhardt, Ph.D., R.N., dean and professor, Nursing and Healthcare Programs at American Sentinel University, said in a announcement about the blog series. \"For instance, trends stemming from the Affordable Care Act have created an increased demand for nurses with specialized skills in case management, informatics, nursing education, leadership, and infection prevention.\"\n\nThe second post discusses opportunities in the workplace that lead some experienced nurses to cycle out of bedside patient care and into administrative positions, information management, case management and other new roles. The essay also touched on the difficulties new nurses have acquiring clinical experience in a workplace that demands that nurses already be experienced.\n\nThe final two blog posts will run by February 2 and will address the education pipeline and factors affecting supply and demand.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the announcement\n\n- read the first and second blog posts\n\nRelated articles:\n\nExperienced nurses hold edge as acute care job market opens up\n\nHospital demand for nurses with bachelor's degrees on the rise\n\nMore nurses work in the community instead of hospitals\n\nLeaders step up recruitment strategies in wake of nursing shortage", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new\u00a0blog series\u00a0by American Sentinel University examines the current\u00a0nurse shortage, its causes and possible solutions.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A new\u00a0blog series\u00a0by American Sentinel University examines the current\u00a0nurse shortage, its causes and possible solutions.", "title": "The nursing shortage: Opportunities and challenges", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/nursing-shortage-opportunities-and-challenges/2016-01-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Sentinel University,HR & Workforce Management,Nursing shortage,registered nurses", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5af3\"", "article_summary": "A new blog series by American Sentinel University examines the current nurse shortage, its causes and possible solutions.\nExperienced acute care nurses remain in high demand, according to a 2015 report, and demand for nurses with bachelor degrees continues to inch upward.\n\"The increased emphasis on specialization may contribute to specific types of shortages in nursing,\" Judy Burckhardt, Ph.D., R.N., dean and professor, Nursing and Healthcare Programs at American Sentinel University, said in a announcement about the blog series.\nIf so, what are the key factors contributing to the shortage and what should be done to best address the issue?\"\n\"For instance, trends stemming from the Affordable Care Act have created an increased demand for nurses with specialized skills in case management, informatics, nursing education, leadership, and infection prevention.\""}
