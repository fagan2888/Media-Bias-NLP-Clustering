In simple terms, providers will be given a fixed amount for taking care of a given patient population. Then every dollar they can avoid spending on patient care \u2014 while upholding quality standards \u2014 is one more dollar they can keep as profit. In a sense, doctors will no longer be paid for the patients they see; they\u2019ll paid for patients they don\u2019t see.\n\nAnd the best way to save dollars spent on patient care is to either keep patients healthy in the first place or to make sure sick patients stay well enough to avoid ER visits and hospital readmissions.\n\nSense.ly is one of a new wave of companies addressing various aspects of patient wellness and engagement. Sense.ly\u2019s uses a virtual nurse named Molly, who acts as the provider\u2019s point of contact for patients. This allows patients to give and receive information from their provider without having to drive to the clinic or hospital.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup has now raised a new $1.25 million in venture funding from Launchpad Digital Health, Eastlink Capital Management, and several angel investors, Sense.ly CEO Adam Odessky tells VentureBeat.\n\nThe investment will be used to \u201cbuild out Sense.ly\u2019s products, further expand the team, and broaden the company\u2019s customer base,\u201d Odessky says. He adds that the new funding comes as Sense.ly has signed up several new hospital customers to use its platform. It now has ten large paying clients, Odessky says.\n\nSense.ly\u2019s platform combines advanced sensor capabilities and an avatar-based mobile technology to reach outpatients. A congestive heart failure or diabetes patient might check in with a caregiver by entering into a Q&A session with \u201cMolly\u201d on their PC, tablet, or smartphone.\n\nMolly then passes on the information she receives to an IBM Watson supercomputer, which will link the symptoms to probable causes, then provide recommendations. If Watson determines that videoconference with a real doctor is in order, Sense.ly will set that up.\n\nThe platform can also connect with sensors applied to the extremities, so a clinician can keep a constant eye on movement and other metrics.\n\nThe platform reduced patient calls by 28 percent in a recent pilot program, Sense.ly says, while physicians increased their productivity by saving nearly a fifth of their time every day.\n\nSense.ly was incubated within Orange S.A., the leading France-based telecom and technology company, and launched independently in 2013. It is currently a member of the LaunchPad Digital Health accelerator program; previously, it was a graduate of the Alchemist Accelerator.\n\n\u201cSense.ly\u2019s technology has applications across a broad spectrum of medical conditions and represents an exciting new tool in our efforts to address the growing burden of chronic diseases,\u201d University of California, San Francisco\u2019s Dr. Van Selby said in a statement.\n\nYou can Sense.ly in action in this video:\n\nAI.
