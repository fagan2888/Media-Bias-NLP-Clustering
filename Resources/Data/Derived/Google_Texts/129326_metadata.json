Progress is being made,\" Falk said.\n\nFalk wouldn't comment on whether she thought federal officials might approve either of two requests by GOP Gov. Scott Walker to let customers bypass the federal health-care exchange.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Walker requested consumers be allowed to use federal subsidies to buy any health plan offered in Wisconsin.\n\nThat request would represent a substantial change of policy for the Affordable Care Act, which limits subsidies to those meeting certain standards and offered through the exchange.\n\nBut the Walker administration also has asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to include Wisconsin in a pilot program to help consumers go directly to insurers to buy the health plans available through the online exchange.\n\nThis so-called direct enrollment option is included in Obamacare as it was originally written.\n\nSo, technically, it is already available as an option in Wisconsin and other states \u2014 it just hasn't been used much here and elsewhere because of the larger federal computer problems.\n\nTo make direct enrollment more viable, the federal government also has launched pilot programs last month in Florida, Ohio and Texas.\n\nFalk said those states were chosen for the test programs because they have the largest uninsured populations among the states using the federal exchange.\n\n\"It was kind of a soft launch,\" Falk said.\n\nSchwartzer said he hoped federal officials would grant both administration requests, including the broader one to open up the insurance subsidies to any plan sold in Wisconsin.\n\nWith the sizable problems in the federal exchange, that made sense, he said.\n\nInsurance executive Kevin Hayden disagreed. Hayden, chief executive officer of Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin and a former state health secretary, said it was too early to go that route.\n\nHayden, whose company offers plans on the exchange, said he might support the change if the exchange doesn't keep improving and continues to frustrate companies and consumers.\n\n\"Let's see how the marketplace works,\" Hayden said.\n\nIn other remarks at the luncheon, the state's deputy of health services defended Walker's separate proposal to respond to the glitches in the exchange by waiting three months to drop some 72,000 patients off the state's BadgerCare Plus health care coverage and waiting to bring 83,000 other poorer patients onto the coverage.\n\nKevin Moore said the three-month delay would help the Department of Health Services make a smoother transition with both of these groups.\n\n\"There's a distinction between being able to do it and being able to do it right,\" Moore said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) issued a separate statement Tuesday noting that state taxpayers would save money if Walker would accept federal funds to expand BadgerCare Plus to both groups rather than choose between them.\n\n\"Wisconsin continues to pay a price for Governor Walker's insistence on putting politics ahead of what's best for our state,\" she said.\n\nWalker, in turn, has said he sees it as too risky for state taxpayers to accept expanded federal Medicaid funds because the funds might not always be available.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Obamacare sign-up hits 7,200 in Wisconsin as system shows improvement", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/obamacare-sign-up-hits-7200-in-wisconsin-as-system-shows-improvement-b99160909z1-235275561.html", "image": {"width": 603, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99160909z.1_20131210222550_000_g6u3sn8h.1-1.jpg", "height": 626}, "type": "article", "description": "About 7,200 Wisconsin residents so far have signed up for health coverage through new online federal insurance marketplaces.", "title": "Obamacare sign-up hits 7,200 in state as glitches lessen"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99160909z.1_20131210222550_000_g6u3sn8h.1-1.jpg", "title": "Obamacare sign-up hits 7,200 in Wisconsin as system shows improvement", "description": "About 7,200 Wisconsin residents so far have signed up for health coverage through new online federal insurance marketplaces.", "card": "summary", "site": "@journalsentinel"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe646b\"", "article_summary": "With the sizable problems in the federal exchange, that made sense, he said.\nDan Schwartzer, deputy state insurance commissioner, said there are signs the insurance exchange is working somewhat better after weeks of a troubled rollout for the federal law known as Obamacare.\nTwo weeks ago, Walker requested consumers be allowed to use federal subsidies to buy any health plan offered in Wisconsin.\nFalk said those states were chosen for the test programs because they have the largest uninsured populations among the states using the federal exchange.\nHayden, chief executive officer of Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin and a former state health secretary, said it was too early to go that route."}
