The companies have been the subject of numerous media reports about drug pricing. The panel plans to examine price increases on recently acquired off-patent drugs, as well as pharmaceutical industry mergers and acquisitions that in some cases have affected the cost of such medications. The committee also will explore the Food and Drug Administration's role in the approval process for generic drugs and the agency's distribution protocols. [snip] Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., the committee's ranking minority member, said congressional action is needed because some recent drug price hikes \"have looked like little more than price gouging.\"\n\nFunny \u2013 just nine short months ago, the government was bragging that Obamacare was driving the price of prescription drugs down.\n\nObamaCare has led to substantial savings in prescription drug costs and a strong increase in the use of preventive services, administration officials announced Tuesday. \u201cOur parents and grandparents on Medicare saved more than $15 billion on prescription drugs since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010,\u201d Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell [said.] Those savings amount to nearly $1,600 per person enrolled in Medicare \u2014 an increase from about $1,400 in average savings last year.\n\nAfter insisting this was the greatest thing since sliced bread, Claire insulted Missouri voters, saying we should shut up and trust those brighter than we.\n\n\u201cI think there has been \u2026 a lot of noise about the mandate that people have gotten so focused on that they don\u2019t realize that there\u2019s going to be more access and affordability and more choices,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd now she has been proven spectacularly wrong.\n\nFunny \u2013 Sen. McCaskill was upset that Republicans were misleading people back in 2013:\n\n\u201cI think we just want people to get the right information, instead of the misinformation that Republicans love to spread about this reform,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cScaring people, misleading people, this is a free market solution and we hope people take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nWho is it doing the misleading and scaring?\n\nThis attack was as predictable as the sunrise.\n\nRead more from Tim and friends at The Aviary www.tbirdnow.mee.nu.
