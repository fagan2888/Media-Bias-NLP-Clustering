The city made three loans to then-property owner Thistle Community Housing totalling $1.42 million.\n\nIn 2011, however, Thistle defaulted on a bank loan for the Blue Vista project, owing the city $988,000 in affordable housing funds and $70,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds upon foreclosure. At that point, 28 affordable and 35 market-rate homes were built out of the originally planned total of 198 homes.\n\nWhen the council decided to do away with affordable housing requirements for all major residential developments, they kept Blue Vista's requirement at 51 percent affordable housing, hoping the city might one day get what it paid for.\n\nOakwood Homes is the new owner of the unfinished portion of Blue Vista and they would like to make a deal with the city. On the undeveloped east side of Blue Vista Oakwood Homes plans to build 59 market-rate houses, ranging from 1,600 to 2,250 square feet with price points in the low $300,000s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the western side, Oakwood Homes would donate four plots of land, each platted for a four-unit building. A non-profit developer, like Habitat for Humanity, would construct 20 affordable units on the land, bringing the ratio of affordable housing to 35 percent of the development.\n\nThirty-five percent \"is more than three times the normal requirement under the former (development requirements), but less than the 51 percent that Thistle was trying to achieve,\" Longmont housing and community investment manager Kathy Fedler wrote in a memo to the council.\n\nThe only cost to the city would be waiving development fees of approximately $9,000 for each of the 20 affordable homes, or $180,000. Additionally, it would mean the city would have to accept that the outstanding loan amounts of $988,000 and $70,000 are never going to result in 51 percent affordable housing at Blue Vista.\n\nKaren Antonacci: 303-684-5226, antonaccik@times-call.com or twitter.com/ktonacci", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28538001/new-affordable-housing-deal-blue-vista-table", "modificationDate": "2015-07-26T09:40:53-0600", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By Karen Antonacci \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "The Longmont City Council is set to the discuss the historically troubled Blue Vista development at the regular public meeting on Tuesday.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28538001:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-26T10:30:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28538001/new-affordable-housing-deal-blue-vista-table", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Longmont City Council is set to the discuss the historically troubled Blue Vista development at the regular public meeting on Tuesday.", "title": "New affordable housing deal for Blue Vista on table"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The Longmont City Council is set to the discuss the historically troubled Blue Vista development at the regular public meeting on Tuesday.", "title": "New affordable housing deal for Blue Vista on table", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28538001/new-affordable-housing-deal-blue-vista-table", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-26T10:30:00-0600", "endDate": "2025-07-25T13:52:41-0600", "sailthru.title": "New affordable housing deal for Blue Vista on table", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Karen AntonacciStaff", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-07-25T13:56:14-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f99\"", "article_summary": "The Longmont City Council is set to the discuss the historically troubled Blue Vista development at the regular public meeting on Tuesday.\nIf you go What: Longmont City Council meeting When: Tuesday, July 28, 7 p.m. Where: Council Chambers, 350 Kimbark St.\nAdditionally, it would mean the city would have to accept that the outstanding loan amounts of $988,000 and $70,000 are never going to result in 51 percent affordable housing at Blue Vista.\nBlue Vista opened in 2007, on Quail Road just south of the Longmont Recreation Center.\nWhen the council decided to do away with affordable housing requirements for all major residential developments, they kept Blue Vista's requirement at 51 percent affordable housing, hoping the city might one day get what it paid for."}
