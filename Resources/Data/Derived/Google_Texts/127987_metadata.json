Kendal plays for the Bridgepointe Elementary School basketball team.\n\n\u201cI was the only third grader they let on the team last year,\u201d said the fourth-grade student. \u201cI just like basketball. I like to watch Kentucky play.\u201d\n\nAnother participant, 10-year-old Maven Campbell, said he wanted to compete in the skills contest as a way to practice. As a homeschooled student, he said he doesn't play on a team, but practices at his friends' houses.\n\nTrophies were awarded to the top three finishers of each age and gender. The top two in each bracket can advance to the district competition in Jasper, Ind. All participants received a medal.\n\nThe Optimist Club hosts the event in conjunction with the Clarksville Parks Department. The event is part of the club\u2019s winter Saturday Morning Program schedule. In conjunction with the parks department, they offer free activities and trips for students in grades one to eight.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the few events we do as part of the International Optimist Club,\u201d said event organizer Mickey Higdon. \u201cWe\u2019ve established a lot of our own activities.\u201d\n\nRunning every Saturday into March, The Saturday Morning Program provides a free activity for youngsters. Upcoming events include swimming at the New Albany YMCA\u2019s indoor pool, roller-skating at Jammerz Rollerdrome, and a trip to a University of Louisville baseball game.\n\nInformation on the program and pre-registration can be found on the parks department website at clarksvilleparks.com.\n\nThe Clarksville Optimists also sponsors a Challenger Baseball team for mentally and physically challenged players on Thursday nights in May and June.\n\n\u201cWe had 98 players last year,\u201d Higdon said. \u201cLast year we had from ages four to 64.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo Courtney Austin, 10, is unimpressed with Clarksville Parks Department marketing and program coordinator Ken Conklin\u2019s attempts at blocking before the Clarksville Optimist Tri-Star Basketball skills contest on Saturday.
