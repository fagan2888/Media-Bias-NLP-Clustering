The chicken wars have a new winner. Chick-fil-A beat out its much larger competitor, Kentucky Fried Chicken, in total sales last year – a first, industry watchdog, Technomic, reported.

Despite having fewer stores, the Georgia-based fast food chain racked up $5 billion in sales in 2013, while the Col. Sanders empire raked in $4.22 billion, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.

The family-oriented Chick-fil-A franchise is also closed on Sundays and has been the target of numerous left-wing protests for their support of traditional marriage values.

“Our founder, Truett Cathy, made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia,” a Chick-fil-A spokesman said, calling the decision “part of our recipe for success,” according to Breitbart News. “He has often shared that his decision was as much practical as spiritual. He believes that all franchised Chick-fil-A operators and their restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest, spend time with the family and friends, and worship if they choose to do so.”

With legions of dedicated patrons, the average Chick-fil-A store earned $3.2 million in 2013, more than three times the typical KFC franchise, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, which attributed the superior sales figures to the franchise’s popular breakfast servings, higher traffic and wide menu selection. The Christian Post, meanwhile, lauded the chain’s friendly staff, humble philosophy and consistently high-quality, tasty food.

The earnings report meant that KFC, owned by YUM! Brands, had to drop the phrase, “leader in the U.S. chicken segment,” from its annual report. Chick-fil-A, meanwhile, plans to open more than 100 new restaurants this year, Businessweek reported.
