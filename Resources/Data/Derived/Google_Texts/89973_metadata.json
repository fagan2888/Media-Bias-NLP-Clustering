Meanwhile, some industry watchers wonder whether the nation\u2019s biggest health insurer might be interested in entering the industry\u2019s consolidation sweepstakes.\n\nReuters, citing tweets from CNBC, reported on Thursday that UnitedHealth \u201cwas looking to bid for Cigna (CI)\u201d even as Cigna and Anthem (ANTM) have reportedly rekindled merger talks. Last month, Cigna spurned a $47.5 billion takeover from Anthem.\n\nAnother mega-merger, between Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), is already in the works.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s stock price rose more than 2% to 122.12 in afternoon trading Friday. Shares set a new high of 124.11 on June 26. The company boasts a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98.\n\nAll of this plays out as UnitedHealth prepares to report Q2 earnings before the open on Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of $1.59, up 12% from the previous year. Revenue is seen climbing 9.5% to $35.66 billion. If those results hold up, it would mark the third straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for UnitedHealth.\n\nDuring the first quarter the company grew earnings 33% and revenue 13%. It was the biggest earnings gain since the second quarter of 2012 and the biggest top-line increase in at least three years.\n\nQ1 results featured another strong performance from UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum Health Services platform, which delivered a 15% year-over-year revenue gain to $13 billion. Optum includes a managed care business, software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service provider.\n\nThe PBM unit, OptumRx, will get much bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran. That deal, announced on March 30, is expected to close during the fourth quarter.\n\nThe combined entity will serve 65 million customers, which should give UnitedHealth\u2019s PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs and make it more competitive with CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), analysts say.\n\nMeanwhile, UnitedHealth and other managed care stocks appear to have gotten a lift from last month\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the health care subsidies allowed by the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.\n\nIn a research report, Trefis said the decision \u201cbenefits insurers such as UnitedHealth\u201d partly because ObamaCare customers \u201cmay not be able to afford private health insurance without the subsidies.\u201d\n\nMaintaining the subsidies \u201cmeans that the private health insurance market should be able to sustain its growth going forward,\u201d Trefis said. \u201cFurthermore, UnitedHealth should be able to maintain its industry-leading market share in private health insurance, which is a major business for the company. \u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "UnitedHealth Group should log solid if slower growth when it reports Q2 earnings on Thursday.
