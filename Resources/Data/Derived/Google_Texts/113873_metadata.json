The Republican presidential front-runner\u2019s campaign events have been scarred with altercations involving protesters, among other problems.\n\n\u201cThe ugly, divisive rhetoric from Donald Trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is not only wrong but dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not leadership. That is political arson.\u201d\n\nShe called for Americans to stand together to resist those who seek to divide the country.\n\n\u201cIf you see bigotry oppose it. If you see violence condemn it. If you see a bully stand up to him,\u201d she said, moments before a heckler interrupted her speech.\n\nThe Community Coalition Concerned for Black Life, a group of clergy, academic, and civil rights leaders, invited presidential candidates to the town hall at Olivet Institutional Baptist Church. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Democratic primary opponent, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, visited last week.\n\nAs president, Mrs. Clinton said she would work to support small businesses \u2014 particularly those owned by women and minorities \u2014 and set aside funds to invest in historically black colleges.\n\nRace still plays a significant role in who gets ahead, she said.\n\n\u201cSomething is very wrong when black kids get arrested for petty crimes but white kids get off for doing exactly the same thing,\u201d she said, drawing big cheers.\n\nPolicing practices have been a key concern on the national stage, and it's an issue that resonates strongly in Cleveland. It was here in 2014 when a white police officer shot and killed Tamir Rice, a black 12-year-old who was playing with what turned out to be a pellet gun. A grand jury declined to indict the officer.\n\n\u201cHe should be alive today,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, told the Cleveland crowd.\n\nShe then introduced a host of mothers who lost children to violence, including at the hands of police officers. Among the women who joined Mrs. Clinton were Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, and Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner.\n\nIn 2012, Trayvon was 17 when he fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Sanford, Fla. Mr. Garner, 43, died after 2014 encounter with police, yelling \u201dI can\u2019t breathe\u201d after a white police officer wraps his arm around Garner\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cThey are calling on all of us, they are inspiring us to stand up for real criminal justice reform to hold police accountable and prevent other young people from facing their death,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nShe promised to take on the gun lobby to bring about reforms, such as comprehensive background checks.\n\nMrs. Clinton also called for federal dollars to train local police departments on how to de-escalate violent situations. Heavy-duty equipment, such as tanks, which have militarized police forces, need to be pulled back or even taken back, she said.\n\nAfter the event, Amelia Jenkins, a member of the church for 52 years who lives in Maple Heights, Ohio, said she appreciated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support of historically black colleges as well as her frank talk on other issues.\n\n\u201cThe other thing I was impressed by was her focusing on the police killing so many black youngsters and getting away with it. It\u2019s all over the country. It\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d she said, calling Tamir Rice\u2019s death a \u201csore in our hearts.\u201d\n\nAmong those waiting to hear Mrs. Clinton was Jannie Blunt of Cleveland, who wore a pin with a picture of the former secretary of state and carried a copy of her autobiography, Living History. Mrs. Clinton signed the volume when she visited Cleveland during her 2008 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI brought it back hoping that she would sign it again,\u201d Ms. Blunt said, of the book.\n\nThe registered Democrat supports Mrs. Clinton because of her knowledge of the presidential post and \u201cadherence to Democratic values.\u201d The fact that she would be the first woman president doesn't hurt.\n\n\u201cWhether Clinton or Sanders wins I will be happy. I would prefer Clinton because I think Sanders will have a much harder time working with a Republican Congress,\u201d Ms. Blunt said. \u201cShe's a little bit more middle of the road, which in a country like this we need to be able to give and take.\u201d\n\nMs. Blunt doesn't want another \u201ceight years of fighting the way we fought for Obamacare,\u201d also known as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPhillip Brown and his mother, Vera Brown, both of Cleveland, were first in line waiting to enter the church and see the candidate they support. Mr. Brown thinks Mrs. Clinton will act as a \u201cbridge\u201d to solve issues of injustice involving police and also represent women and minorities.\n\nStephanie Eafford of Cleveland brought her nine-year-old daughter Angelina Lynch to the town hall.\n\n\u201cIt was important to her; she wanted to come out and see Hillary Clinton. She's been watching her every day,\u201d Ms. Eafford said, who said she's still deciding who she will vote for.\n\nThe Block News Alliance consists of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Blade of Toledo, Ohio.
