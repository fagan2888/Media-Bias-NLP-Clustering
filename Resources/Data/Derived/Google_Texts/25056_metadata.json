Smith of Kansas City, issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits Missouri officials from enforcing a state law, adopted last year by legislators who said they wanted to protect consumers shopping for health coverage.\n\n\u201cThe state law obstructs the federal purpose\u201d by imposing onerous restrictions and requirements on people who help consumers, including groups designated as \u201cnavigators\u201d under federal law, the judge said.\n\nJudge Smith\u2019s ruling applies just to Missouri, but lawyers said it had implications for more than a dozen other states that had adopted similar laws or regulations, including Florida, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. The laws typically require licensing of counselors and navigators and limit what they can do.\n\nSidney D. Watson, a law professor at St. Louis University who supports the federal health law, said: \u201cThis is a very important decision. It means that certified application counselors and navigators can focus on helping consumers rather than jumping through bureaucratic hoops. They can do the important work that needs to be done to help people sign up for health insurance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe state laws have been promoted by Republican state legislators and by some insurance agents who say the counselors do not have the training and education needed to steer consumers through the complexities of health insurance.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case included St. Louis Effort for AIDS, a patient education and advocacy group, and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri.\n\nMissouri stands out among states that have put up significant obstacles to President Obama\u2019s health law. It declined to create an insurance exchange, leaving the job to the federal government. And it has forbidden state and local officials to cooperate with the federal exchange.\n\nJudge Smith said that the plaintiffs had already complied with federal rules for insurance counselors, but that the state had imposed a number of additional licensing requirements.\n\n\u201cIt seems obvious these additional requirements obstruct the federal government\u2019s operation of the federally facilitated exchange,\u201d Judge Smith said. For that reason, he said, the state law is pre-empted by the Affordable Care Act, which has supremacy under the federal Constitution.\n\nThe Missouri law, he said, prevents counselors from doing some of the very things they are supposed to do under the federal law, like providing consumers with information about the strengths and weakness of different health plans, including those sold in the private insurance market outside the exchange.\n\nChris Cline, a spokesman for the Missouri insurance commissioner, John M. Huff, said the department was reviewing the ruling.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140123223850, "twitter": {"description": "A federal court found that the state imposed onerous restrictions on people helping consumers navigate the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Missouri Obstructing Health Law, Judge Rules", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/politics/missouri-obstructing-health-law-judge-rules.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002668210"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/politics/missouri-obstructing-health-law-judge-rules.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002668210", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/politics/missouri-obstructing-health-law-judge-rules.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Missouri Obstructing Health Law, Judge Rules", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 23, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Smith  Ortrie D,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Obama  Barack,Missouri", "news_keywords": "Missouri", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A federal court found that the state imposed onerous restrictions on people helping consumers navigate the Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A federal court found that the state imposed onerous restrictions on people helping consumers navigate the Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-01-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Missouri", "published": "2014-01-23", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "geo": "Missouri", "slug": "24health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140127113829, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/politics/missouri-obstructing-health-law-judge-rules.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A federal court found that the state imposed onerous restrictions on people helping consumers navigate the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Missouri Obstructing Health Law, Judge Rules"}, "pdate": 20140123, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002668210, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Missouri Obstructing Health Law, Judge Rules", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb093\"", "article_summary": "Sidney D.
