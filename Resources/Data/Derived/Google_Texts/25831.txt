ROCHESTER, Minn. (WKBT) -

I-90 users can expect lane closures for the next several days during construction on Dresbach Bridge.

According to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, westbound motorists will see the right lane closed Monday through Wednesday. Reasoning for the closure is the delivery and placement of concrete girders.

Single lane traffic will remain on I-90 during the construction. Although the lane is only temporarily closed, the Dresbach Bridge Project is expected to continue through 2016.

Weather conditions could delay or expand the process.
