Her jail term was cut short because of good behavior and participation in a work program.\n\nWearing a gray suit and clutching a stack of folders, Wright strode out of the jail and into the waiting SUV driven by her husband, Jason Trowbridge.\n\n\"I have no comment,\" she said.\n\nThe scandal erupted a year ago in Kennebunk, a small town known for its beaches, New England charm and proximity to former President George H.W. Bush's seaside estate in Kennebunkport.\n\nWright's prostitution business came as a surprise to her fitness clients but not to police officers who'd become suspicious after fielding complaints about groaning, loud music and men coming and going from an office Wright rented across the street from her studio.\n\nAccording to police, her business partner, Mark Strong of Thomaston, watched the sexual encounters unfold in real time on a computer in his insurance business office. In a twist at her sentencing, Wright divulged that her business partner had tricked her into believing she was a secret operative investigating sexual deviance.\n\nProsecutors didn't buy Wright's story, saying investigators continue to believe the 30-year-old Wright was \"a willing participant\" in the prostitution business.\n\nDetailed records over an 18-month period indicated Wright made $150,000 tax-free. She also collected more than $40,000 in welfare benefits, prosecutors said.\n\nStrong, a 58-year-old married father of two, acknowledged having an affair with Wright and helping her start the fitness studio but said he didn't profit from the prostitution. He was convicted of 13 counts related to promotion of prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Sharp on Twitter at https://twitter.com/David_Sharp_AP", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Maine Zumba instructor at center of prostitution scandal is released from jail after 6 months", "title": "Zumba instructor in prostitution bust leaves jail", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/zumba-instructor-in-prostitution-bust-leaves-jail/article_6728a269-76af-5eb6-b833-5a1d15b5b156.html", "image": {"width": 350, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/11/3119b4fc-9f96-5460-bb85-48e489aa01fc/5332121121a5c.image.jpg?resize=350%2C512", "height": 512}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Maine Zumba instructor at center of prostitution scandal is released from jail after 6 months", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news,ap", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news,ap"}, "article_summary": "Prosecutors didn't buy Wright's story, saying investigators continue to believe the 30-year-old Wright was \"a willing participant\" in the prostitution business.\nHe was convicted of 13 counts related to promotion of prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail.\nAccording to police, her business partner, Mark Strong of Thomaston, watched the sexual encounters unfold in real time on a computer in his insurance business office.\nIn a twist at her sentencing, Wright divulged that her business partner had tricked her into believing she was a secret operative investigating sexual deviance.\nHer jail term was cut short because of good behavior and participation in a work program."}
