Burwell at 10 a.m. will be on Wednesday, March 4, as the only set of arguments for that day.\n\nThe Court accepted the case, previously known as Halbig v. Burwell, back on November 7, 2014. King v. Burwell challenges to ability of the federal government to offer tax credits to qualifying insurance payers in states where the federal government is running health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe Court also took the case despite the Obama administration\u2019s desire for a full appeals court to review a finding in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nCurrently, the federal government runs health insurance exchanges in 34 states. The tax credits go to people who most likely can\u2019t afford to buy insurance at full prices on the exchanges. So a ruling that holds the subsidies are unconstitutional could have an adverse effect on Obamacare\u2019s future.\n\nIn July, a divided three-judge panel struck down tax subsidies provided to residents of 34 states who purchased new health care plans on exchanges established by the federal government.\n\nWhat also interesting about the King v. Burwell case was that the Justices voted on it at a private conference on a Friday morning and announced granting the case the same day.\n\nThat is another scenario for the current cases under consideration about same-sex marriage bans. The Justices will hear appeals from the Sixth Circuit and Louisiana on Friday, January 9, 2015, in their private conference. In all, at least five cases upholding the bans will be in front of the Justices on that Friday morning.\n\nOn November 6, 2014, a decision of the Cincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that appeals about state-approved same-sex marriage bans should be left to the political processes, with voters and legislatures deciding the issue.\n\nThe ruling from Judge Jeffrey Sutton went against a series of rulings against the bans in other federal courts, setting up a likely acceptance of the cases in the Supreme Court.\n\nIf at least four Justices vote in private to accept the same-sex marriage cases, the announcement could come late on January 9, or on Monday, January 12, when the Court is scheduled to release orders. The Court has two other conference days scheduled in January, but a further delay would make it less likely that the case will be argued in the current term, which ends in late June 2015.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nHow Thomas Paine\u2019s other pamphlet saved the Revolution\n\nAmerica\u2019s first rock star: Benjamin Franklin in France\n\nWhat Elvis told Richard Nixon at the White House\n\nFive items Congress deleted from Madison\u2019s original Bill of Rights\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "The issues of Obamacare funding and the legality of same-sex marriage bans now have official dates on the Supreme Court schedule for the start of the New Year.", "title": "Supreme Court sets two important dates for the New Year", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/12/supreme-court-sets-two-important-dates-for-the-new-year/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/800px-Supreme_Court_US_2010.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/800px-Supreme_Court_US_2010.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-24T11:25:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-24T11:34:39+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Share:EmailThe issues of Obamacare funding and the legality of same-sex marriage bans now have official dates on the Supreme Court schedule for the start of the New Year.\nThe Court also took the case despite the Obama administration\u2019s desire for a full appeals court to review a finding in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\nThat is another scenario for the current cases under consideration about same-sex marriage bans.\nThe Court accepted the case, previously known as Halbig v.
