Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, recently said those who oppose abortion and support the right to keep and bear arms \"have no place\" in his state.\n\n\"Who are they? Are they these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that\u2019s who they are and they\u2019re the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that\u2019s not who New Yorkers are,\" he said.\n\nCuomo has backtracked from that statement somewhat, claiming that his comments were \"distorted\" and taken out of context.\n\nBut Cuomo is not the only Democrat to make outrageous comments.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also said the IRS should be used to shut down the Tea Party, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, R-Wash., said lawmakers would \"definitely\" go after the NFL's tax-exempt status if it doesn't pressure the Washington Redskins into changing their team name.\n\nOne conservative group responded by calling Schumer a \"fascist\" who opposes free speech.\n\nVulnerable Senate Democrats have also asked the IRS to essentially help them win their upcoming elections by targeting conservative groups.\n\nAs we recently reported, Mike Dickinson, a Democrat looking to unseat Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., said the FCC should monitor and regulate Fox News.\n\nIn early February, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called freedom a \"buzzword.\"\n\nThese are just a few of the many examples one can point to, and when combined with Obama's repeated promises to rule by executive action, are enough to present a terrifying overview of the modern Democrat Party.\n\nRelated:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you like this article, you can follow Joe on Twitter @jnewby1956, visit and like his Facebook page, or subscribe to receive email updates when a new article is published.\n\nFor hard-hitting conservative commentary, please visit Joe's blog, the Conservative Firing Line.
