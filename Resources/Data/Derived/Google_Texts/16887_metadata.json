The audit by the Inspector General released this month revealed that the agency does not have the technical ability to record death information on \u201cnumberholders\u201d who exceed \"maximum reasonable life expectancies,\" including people who were born before the Civil War.\"We obtained Numident data that identified approximately 6.5 million numberholders born before June 16, 1901 who did not have a date of death on their record,\" the report says.The inspector general says that the numbers given to long-dead people were used fraudulently to open bank accounts and that thousands of those numbers were also used by illegal immigrants to obtain work, according to CNS.\u201cIt is incredible that the Social Security Administration in 2015 does not have the technical sophistication to ensure that people they know to be deceased are actually noted as dead,\u201d said Sen. Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican. \u201cTens of thousands of these numbers are currently being used to report wages to the Social Security Administration and to the IRS.\u201cPeople are fraudulently, but successfully, applying for jobs and benefits with these numbers. Making sure Social Security cleans up its death master file to prevent future errors and fraud is a good government reform we can all agree to.\u201dCalling it \u201ca major problem,\u201d Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the Homeland Security Committee's ranking Democrat, said that the scandal exposes Americans to identity theft and is throwing taxpayers\u2019 money down the drain.\"It is simply unacceptable that our nation\u2019s database of Social Security numbers of supposedly living people includes more than six and a half million people who are older than 112 years of age, with a few thousand having birth dates from before the Civil War,\u201d said Carper.\u201cPreventing agency errors by keeping track of who has died is a relatively simple problem that the government should pursue as a high priority.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ssa, audit, millions, dead", "pubdate": "2015-03-10T09:09:10", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "An audit of the Social Security Administration shows some 6.5 million people on the agency's rolls are 112 or older, raising the ire of Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson.\r\nThe SSA's inspector general says that in all these cases the dates of death have not...", "title": "Audit: 6.5 Million on Social Security Are Over 112 Years Old", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/ssa-audit-millions-dead/2015/03/10/id/629253/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=f2042559-f172-4258-bd04-00378b5dbc0f&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/ssa-audit-millions-dead/2015/03/10/id/629253/", "description": "An audit of the Social Security Administration shows some 6.5 million people on the agency's rolls are 112 or older, raising the ire of Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson.\r\nThe SSA's inspector general says that in all these cases the dates of death have not...", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Audit: 6.5 Million on Social Security Are Over 112 Years Old"}, "epoch": 1425978550, "keywords": "ssa, audit, millions, dead", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2015-03-10T09:09:10"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/ssa-audit-millions-dead/2015/03/10/id/629253/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Audit: 6.5 Million on Social Security Are Over 112 Years Old"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca40c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTens of thousands of these numbers are currently being used to report wages to the Social Security Administration and to the IRS.\u201cPeople are fraudulently, but successfully, applying for jobs and benefits with these numbers.\nThe audit by the Inspector General released this month revealed that the agency does not have the technical ability to record death information on \u201cnumberholders\u201d who exceed \"maximum reasonable life expectancies,\" including people who were born before the Civil War.\nMaking sure Social Security cleans up its death master file to prevent future errors and fraud is a good government reform we can all agree to.\u201dCalling it \u201ca major problem,\u201d Delaware Sen.
