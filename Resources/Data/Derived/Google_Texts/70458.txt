Authorities say inmates took two employees hostage at a maximum security state prison in South Carolina, but they were released without suffering serious injuries.

Corrections Department spokeswoman Stephanie Givens told our sister station WIS-TV that the hostage situation lasted around six hours Saturday at Kirkland Correctional Institution in Columbia.

Givens wouldn't disclose any other information including how many inmates were involved or how they managed to take the hostages, saying the State Law Enforcement Division is investigating. She did say the employees were not seriously hurt, but did not identify their jobs or give their names.

Kirkland Correctional Institution has about 300 prisoners.
