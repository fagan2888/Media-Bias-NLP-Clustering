Sen. Ted Cruz slammed President Obama’s recent speech, in which he claimed outright that America wasn’t at war with Islamic terrorists, and said the commander-in-chief sounded less like the leader of the free world and more like an “apologist” for terror groups.

Mr. Cruz’s remarks on Fox News: Mr. Obama’s “bizarre, politically correct doublespeak … [is] simply not befitting a commander-in-chief,” Mediaite reported.

Mr. Cruz also said Mr. Obama’s refusal to call Islamic terrorists with their religiously-affiliated label — Islamic — makes him sound like “an apologist” for the likes of the Islamic State, al Qaeda and other terror-tied organizations that seek to further Shariah law, Mediaite reported.

He was then asked to respond to the president’s claim that labeling the terrorists as Islamic would only give them what they want and undermine the world’s efforts to root them out and destroy them. The Texas senator, in reply, called that logic ridiculous.

“What undermines the global effort is for the president of the United States to be an apologist for radical Islamic terrorists,” Mr. Cruz said, the news blog reported.
