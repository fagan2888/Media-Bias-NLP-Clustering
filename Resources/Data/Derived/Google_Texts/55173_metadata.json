The figure represents the majority of all biopharmaceutical R&D spending \u2013 both public and private \u2013 in the United States.\n\nThe new R&D numbers, the result of a recent survey of PhRMA member companies, are highlighted in the newly released PhRMA 2015 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile as well as a new industry chart pack, Biopharmaceuticals in Perspective.\n\nDespite ongoing economic challenges, the biopharmaceutical industry continues to be one of America\u2019s most research-intensive industries. According to a recent analysis from ndp\u2502analytics, the biopharmaceutical industry leads the manufacturing sector in innovation and economic contributions. Biopharmaceutical companies on average invest as much as six times more in R&D, relative to their sales, than the average U.S. manufacturing firm. In 2014, PhRMA member companies invested nearly 24% of domestic sales into R&D.\n\n\u201cWhat the Industry Profile tells us \u2013 unequivocally \u2013 is that the commitment of America\u2019s biopharmaceutical companies to solving the world\u2019s most vexing medical challenges has never been more resolute,\u201d stated John Castellani, president and CEO, PhRMA. \u201cOur companies are tireless in their efforts to develop new innovative, life-saving medicines for patients \u2013 and these numbers are proof of that determination in action.\u201d\n\nThe industry\u2019s ongoing commitment to R&D was evident in the record number of 51 new medicines brought to U.S. patients last year. Forty-one of those approvals were by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and 10 medicines were approved by FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Among the CDER approvals, 41% were identified as first-in-class treatments \u2013 meaning they use a completely new approach to fighting a disease \u2013 and more than 20% were personalized medicines.\n\nThe industry\u2019s pledge to R&D is further evidenced by the robust biopharmaceutical pipeline; more than 7,000 medicines are in development globally. A 2012 analysis of the biopharmaceutical pipeline revealed 70% of medicines are potential first-in-class treatments.\n\nThe road to bringing a new FDA-approved medicine to market is a long and formidable one, however, the association noted. Only 12% of drug candidates that enter clinical testing are eventually approved for use by patients. On average, it takes at least 10 years and more than $2.6 billion to bring a new medicine from the research pipeline to patients.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_thumbnail_image/04-2015/phrma2.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michael Johnsen", "description": "A new PhRMA report released Monday found that branded manufacturers invested $51.2 billion last year in R&D.", "og": {"image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_medium_image/04-2015/phrma2.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "title": "New PhRMA industry profile reports 7,000 medicines currently in development"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new PhRMA report released Monday found that branded manufacturers invested $51.2 billion last year in R&D.", "title": "New PhRMA industry profile reports 7,000 medicines currently in development", "url": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/new-phrma-industry-profile-reports-7000-medicines-currently-development", "image": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-04/phrma2.jpg", "site": "@drugstorenews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-21 01:01:00", "sailthru.title": "New PhRMA industry profile reports 7,000 medicines currently in development", "keywords": "phrma, rd, branded, pharmaceutical, video, short", "google-site-verification": "qD-DLdnS9RBbjYJ-MITi4cSvUByohsoX4WClEJJuv7I", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-04/phrma2.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd13\"", "article_summary": "According to a recent analysis from ndp\u2502analytics, the biopharmaceutical industry leads the manufacturing sector in innovation and economic contributions.\nThe new R&D numbers, the result of a recent survey of PhRMA member companies, are highlighted in the newly released PhRMA 2015 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile as well as a new industry chart pack, Biopharmaceuticals in Perspective.\nDespite ongoing economic challenges, the biopharmaceutical industry continues to be one of America\u2019s most research-intensive industries.\nThe industry\u2019s pledge to R&D is further evidenced by the robust biopharmaceutical pipeline; more than 7,000 medicines are in development globally.\nThe figure represents the majority of all biopharmaceutical R&D spending \u2013 both public and private \u2013 in the United States."}
