Two children and an adult were killed in a wrong-way crash in Alvarado early Sunday.

Police say a pick-up truck struck a car about 1:26 a.m. on U.S. Highway 67 near County Road 810 and Baker Lane, about 42 miles southwest of Dallas. The car had an adult and three children inside.

Investigators say the pick-up truck was traveling the wrong direction on the highway before the crash. They believe alcohol was a factor and may file criminal charges.

The driver of the car — Maranda Abshire, 22, of Alvarado — and two children died in the crash, according to police. They were pronounced dead at the scene. Another child was flown to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The driver of the pick-up truck was also flown to a local hospital. Police did not release his name or condition.

On the Alvarado Police Department’s Facebook page, police said “our thoughts and prayers are with those involved and their loved ones during this extremely difficult time.”
