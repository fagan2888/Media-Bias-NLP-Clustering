The Soldier’s Cafe, or Soldatenkaffee, the Nazi-themed restaurant in Indonesia’s West Java city of Bandung has reopened after a one year closure. Owner, Henry Mulyana, in an effort to broaden the theme of the restaurant, he has added some British, French, the US, Japanese and Dutch military items to the Nazi memorabilia that dominated the decor.

In addition, British PM Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin portraits hang alongside Adolf Hitler’s image.

Mulyana told AFP, “From the beginning I have said that the SoldatenKaffee is not a Nazi cafe. This cafe’s theme is World War II,” Mulyana said at the reopening. “All aspects of the SoldatenKaffee are legal. We have a lot of customers from Europe and they don’t have a problem with the World War II theme, because it is seen here from a historical perspective,” he said.

Soldatenkaffee became a controversy globally for it’s Nazi-theme, including a large flag with the swastika and a giant picture of Adolf Hitler and waiters at the cafe who dressed in uniforms similar to those worn by officers of the Schutzstaffel (SS), the Nazi paramilitary.
