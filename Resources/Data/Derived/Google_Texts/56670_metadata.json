Like a quilt, the Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America (AFA) sews together 2,400 member organizations across the nation, all of them dedicated to meeting the needs of people with Alzheimer\u2019s. At its Concepts in Care conference today in New York city, the AFA emphasized memory screening for early detection of the progressive brain disorder and common form of dementia, which now affects five million Americans.\n\nBert E. Brodsky, founding chairman of AFA, talked to Medical Daily outside a hotel conference room packed with health care professionals and laypeople hoping to learn more about the nation\u2019s sixth leading cause of death. Brodsky explained why he created AFA.\n\n\u201cThe simple concept is you take programs throughout the country, you try and funnel them up to AFA, and then you try to transplant ideas from agency to agency,\u201d said Brodsky, who also founded Sandata Technologies, LLC. If there\u2019s a great program in Chicago, then, AFA will get wind of it naturally enough and tell all the other agencies about it, too.\n\nA vital man sporting what looked like a Florida tan, Brodsky said another reason for beginning AFA was to raise awareness and to \u201cexpose what\u2019s happening.\u201d Funding was one other consideration, since many organizations will not give grants to a local organization. Bringing the funds into a national organization allows AFA to disseminate money to regional and local groups, as need be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about the here and now,\u201d Charles Fuschillo, president and chief executive officer of AFA, told Medical Daily. \u201cKnowing that the cure is not in sight, we want to ensure that individuals get the answers they need, and the best tools to take care of a loved one or somebody in their program or companies.\u201d\n\nConnection\n\nIn fact, the AFA helpline receives \u201cthousands and thousands of calls,\u201d in Fuschillo\u2019s words, and it is staffed by licensed social workers who are dementia care professionals. \u201cAnd if we need to make a referral in any state in the nation, for care, for research, we\u2019re able to do that in any state through our member organizations,\u201d explained the former New York state senator, who sponsored a number of laws intended to protect the health of citizens while in office.\n\nHis current plans for AFA include expanding the organization's outreach, growing its research funding capability, and increasing the number of member groups to 3,000 by the end of the year. And, now that the helpline is bilingual, he\u2019s hoping to make it a 24/7 service, so people \u2014 whether they be patients, caregivers, family members, friends, or programs \u2014 can call in any time and talk to a live person and be referred to care, educational services, or training, as need be.\n\nMeanwhile, Fuschillo runs a tight ship. \u201cMore than 84, 85 cents on every dollar goes back into our programs, so we\u2019re conscious of every dollar we receive,\u201d he said. This claim is far from unsubstantiated. Less than two percent of the 1,000,000 charities operating in the nation today meet the standards of accountability and effectiveness set by the Independent Charities of America for its \u201cBest in America\u201d seal. AFA is one of them.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nEarly Detection\n\nFirst and foremost: Urge your congressional representatives to provide more funding to Alzheimer\u2019s research and caregivers, says Fuschillo. The current appropriation of $500 million to Alzheimer\u2019s may sound like a lot, but it is not enough to meet current needs and with more people becoming ill each day, will not meet future needs.\n\n\u201cGet a memory screening,\u201d Amanda J. Secor, AFA\u2019s director of communications, told Medical Daily. \u201cThink of it as a routine health check-up.\u201d She explained how memory screenings are part of the Medicare annual wellness visit now, so for anyone 65 and older there\u2019s no reason not to get screened.\n\nIn fact, Medical Daily took the test, a five- to 10-minute series of questions and answers which the social worker made sure to explain \u201cis not a medical diagnosis.\u201d Anyone who does poorly on the exam would go get checked out by a doctor; any number of medical problems, other than Alzheimer's, cause poor memory. But if you did discover you had Alzheimer\u2019s, you would have time. Time to talk with your family about what happens when you arrive at the later stages of disease. Early detection gives you the chance to begin early treatment, discuss your future care, or simply set your financial house in order. For some people, it could even mean the opportunity to enroll in a clinical trial for a new drug that might cure the disease.\n\nIn any case, early detection would help you learn what's to come, how to cope. \u201cMy mother had Alzheimer\u2019s and I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it,\u201d Brodsky told Medical Daily. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to deal with it, how do you learn? That\u2019s why I started AFA.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alzheimer's, memory test, early detection, screening", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America emphasizes memory screening for early detection of the progressive brain disorder.", "title": "Learn If You Have Alzheimer's While You Can Still Do Something About It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/take-memory-test-learn-your-alzheimers-diagnosis-early-afa-recommends-333612", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/alzheimers-quilt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America emphasizes memory screening for early detection of the progressive brain disorder.", "title": "Learn If You Have Alzheimer's While You Can Still Do Something About It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/take-memory-test-learn-your-alzheimers-diagnosis-early-afa-recommends-333612", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/alzheimers-quilt.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/alzheimers-quilt.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-15T16:58:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-15T16:58:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America emphasizes memory screening for early detection of the progressive brain disorder."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc890\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re all about the here and now,\u201d Charles Fuschillo, president and chief executive officer of AFA, told Medical Daily.\n\u201cMy mother had Alzheimer\u2019s and I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it,\u201d Brodsky told Medical Daily.\n\u201cGet a memory screening,\u201d Amanda J.
