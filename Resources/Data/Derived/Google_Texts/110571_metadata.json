The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services this week released the companies' requested rate hikes in the form of a publicly searchable database.\n\nThe data reflect any rate hike requests of more than 10 percent on Affordable Care Act plans. If finalized, the higher rates would take effect on Jan. 1. Of the 15 products for which insurers requested rate hikes, all but two are for individual plans.\n\nThe highest planned increase, 55.5 percent, came on individual plans of from Assurant Health, also known as Time Insurance Co. and John Alden Life Insurance Co. Mary Hinderliter, vice president of Assurant Health, would not say how many Louisiana customers would be affected by that increase. \"As part of a public company with sales in nearly every state, Assurant Health does not share that level of detail about our business,\" Hinderliter said.\n\nOverall, the median increase requested by companies seeking to raise premiums beyond 10 percent came in much lower, at 17.6 percent. The reasons that the companies gave for the higher rates included increased medical costs, higher-than-expected patient morbidity, increased use by patients and the expense of medical technology in treating patients. Aetna, which along with Coventry Health and Life has requested a rate increase in its small group preferred provider plans, said \"the cost for inpatient hospital admissions has increased 12 percent\" and pharmaceuticals \"have gone up 22 percent.\"\n\nFor 152,000 people in Louisiana, the rate boost could average 11.4 percent to 26 percent, according to plan data submitted by six of the insurers: Aetna Health, United Healthcare Life, Louisiana Health Cooperative, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, Humana Health Benefit Plan of Louisiana and HMO Louisiana, a subsidiary of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana.\n\nCenters for Medicaid and Medicare Services said the rates will be finalized in October and, it warns, many are subject to change before then. Approved rates are to be published no later than Nov. 1.\n\nThe proposed rates don't include tax credits that are awarded to customers whose incomes and family size make them eligible for help on their premiums. In 2015, the agency said, eight in 10 people who purchased plans through HealthCare.gov received an average premium tax credit of $263 per person per month.\n\n\"In addition, 8 in 10 consumers in the HealthCare.gov states had access to a plan for less than $100 per month after tax credits, and around 7 in 10 had access to a plan for less than $50 a month,\" the agency wrote in its news release.\n\n2016 health insurance rate hike requests over 10 percent Company Name Product Name Requested Rate increase Time Insurance Company 2016 INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL PLAN \u2013 Individual \u2013 31434LA020 55.45% Aetna Health Inc.
