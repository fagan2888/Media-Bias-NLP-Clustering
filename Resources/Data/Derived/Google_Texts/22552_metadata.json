That being said, he still had some issues with Republicans, like how, Maher claimed, the entire GOP victory was all about a continuing resentment of the \u201cfirst black president.\u201d\n\nMaher said their entire strategy was \u201cscrew Obama, we hate Obama,\u201d and was amazed that it actually worked. Senator Bernie Sanders said it\u2019s very easy to beat up on Obama instead of talking about big issues that affect the country. Maher pointed out how few Democratic candidates said anything positive about Obama and said they just suck.\n\nHe argued they didn\u2019t have that hard of a record to run on, and when actual Democratic policies were on the ballot, voters approved them. Maher said the Democrats were just horrible and \u201ctreated Obama like a teenager treats his mother.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below, via HBO:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher broke down this week's midterm elections by venting some of his frustrations with the Democratic Party, saying rather bluntly that \"Democrats suck\"", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Capture5.jpg", "title": "Bill Maher: \u2018Democrats Suck,\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re Horrible\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill Maher broke down this week's midterm elections by venting some of his frustrations with the Democratic Party, saying rather bluntly that \"Democrats suck\" and \"they're horrible\" if they can't even beat the current crop of Republicans.", "title": "Bill Maher: 'Democrats Suck,' 'They're Horrible'", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Capture5.jpg", "creator": "@feldmaniac", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-11-07T22:52:01+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bill Maher broke down this week\u2019s midterm elections by venting some of his frustrations with the Democratic Party, saying rather bluntly that \u201cDemocrats suck\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re horrible\u201d if they can\u2019t even beat the current crop of Republicans.\nMaher said the Democrats were just horrible and \u201ctreated Obama like a teenager treats his mother.\u201dWatch the video below, via HBO:Please enable Javascript to watch.\nMaher pointed out how few Democratic candidates said anything positive about Obama and said they just suck.\nSenator Bernie Sanders said it\u2019s very easy to beat up on Obama instead of talking about big issues that affect the country.\nHe argued they didn\u2019t have that hard of a record to run on, and when actual Democratic policies were on the ballot, voters approved them."}
