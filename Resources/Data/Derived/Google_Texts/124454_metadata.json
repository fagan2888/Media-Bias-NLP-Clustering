A staunch environmentalist, Steyer has donated $20,253,000 to the super PAC he founded to help elect more lawmakers who support action on climate change. Steyer also gave $500,000 to Senate Majority PAC. CE Action Committee (formerly NextGen Committee) spent millions in 2013 to support Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) in his successful special election bid and to help Democrat Terry McAuliffe win the Virginia governorship. Steyer told Bloomberg Businessweek that he wants to push climate change into election conversations in 2014 and beyond. \"If you look at the 2012 campaign, climate change was like incest -- something you couldn't talk about in polite company,\" he said. Steyer was not a super PAC donor in the 2012 election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louisiana Gov.
