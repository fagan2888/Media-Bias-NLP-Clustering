This includes individuals who are awaiting trial, convicted of a crime, on probation, under home confinement, incarcerated in jail or prison, under community residential supervision, or on parole. Many justice involved individuals are eligible for Medicaid if they meet the state\u2019s financial and non-financial eligibility (including citizenship or eligible immigration status and state residency).\u201d\n\n\n\nHHS also sent out a letter to state health officials in Medicaid expanding states as \u201cguidance\u201d on the new policy and how \u201cjustice-involved\u201d individuals can be eligible for Medicaid.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration has taken major steps to make our criminal justice system fairer, more efficient, and more effective at reducing recidivism and helping formerly incarcerated individuals contribute to their communities,\u201d the press release said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on Thursday that it is expanding Medicaid coverage to give \u201caccess to health care\u201d to 96,000 people who face a prison sentence or have been incarcerated \u2013 or \u201cjustice-involved\u201d individuals \u2013 as part of the federally designated National Re-Entry Week (April 24-30).", "title": "Feds Expand Medicaid to Cover 96,000 \u2018Justice-Involved\u2019 Individuals in Obamacare States", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/feds-expand-medicaid-cover-96000-justice-involved-individuals-obamacare", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/inmates.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-02T12:45:53-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-02T12:45:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-02T12:45:53-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on Thursday that it is expanding Medicaid coverage to give \u201caccess to health care\u201d to 96,000 people who face a prison sentence or have been incarcerated \u2013 or \u201cjustice-involved\u201d individuals \u2013 as part of the federally designated National Re-Entry Week (April 24-30).", "title": "Feds Expand Medicaid to Cover 96,000 \u2018Justice-Involved\u2019 Individuals in Obamacare States", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/feds-expand-medicaid-cover-96000-justice-involved-individuals-obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/inmates.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on Thursday that it is expanding Medicaid coverage to give \u201caccess to health care\u201d to 96,000 people who face a prison sentence or have been incarcerated \u2013 or \u201cjustice-involved\u201d individuals \u2013 as part of the federally designated National Re-Entry Week (April 24-30).", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The issue brief includes this definition of a \u201cjustice involved\u201d individual:\u201cJustice involved individuals include anyone who is currently or has been involved with the criminal justice system.\n\u201cToday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services strengthened access to health care for individuals transitioning from incarceration back to their communities,\u201d the press release stated.\nMany justice involved individuals are eligible for Medicaid if they meet the state\u2019s financial and non-financial eligibility (including citizenship or eligible immigration status and state residency).\u201dHHS also sent out a letter to state health officials in Medicaid expanding states as \u201cguidance\u201d on the new policy and how \u201cjustice-involved\u201d individuals can be eligible for Medicaid.\n\u201cNew Medicaid guidance released today updates decades-old policy and clarifies that individuals who are currently on probation, parole or in home confinement are not considered inmates of a public institution.\n\u201cThe Obama administration has taken major steps to make our criminal justice system fairer, more efficient, and more effective at reducing recidivism and helping formerly incarcerated individuals contribute to their communities,\u201d the press release said."}
