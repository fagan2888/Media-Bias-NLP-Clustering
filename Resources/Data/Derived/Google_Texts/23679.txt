West Palm Beach football mom Ladi March is a new expert on Palm Beach County’s fragmented mental health system. She sees huge needs, especially in the area of supportive housing, and she’s energized to get something done, for the good of her son and for the good of the entire community.

In high school, her son, Donel Elam, attracted 27 college invitations because of his gridiron success. But all of that evaporated as Elam began to develop apparent schizoaffective disorder.

As the Post’s Wayne Washington reported, March recently urged Palm Beach County Commissioners to help her create a place where people with serious mental illness can spend as much as a year or two getting stabilized on the right medications, undergoing therapy, and preparing themselves to become self-supporting, productive members of society.

When someone has a psychotic break, a short-term stay at a crisis unit isn’t adequate, said Liz Downey, executive director of the Palm Beach County branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

“Our state government needs to fund residential facilities for people with mental illness. A five-day or even a two-week stay in a Baker Act facility is not doing it,” Downey said. “It’s something we need to invest in.”

Making the dream a reality won’t just require money for land and a building. It will require a dedicated source of reimbursements for services.

For that, it’s up to state legislators. They must include raises for mental health providers in next year’s Medicaid budget.

Legislators must also expand eligibility for Medicaid, so that people who don’t earn enough to get Obamacare subsidies have a fighting chance.

About 1 percent of the population suffers with schizophrenia. About 2.6 percent are bipolar. Ignoring the needs of people with mental illness won’t make them go away.

Do you agree that the state has been neglecting its mental health system?
