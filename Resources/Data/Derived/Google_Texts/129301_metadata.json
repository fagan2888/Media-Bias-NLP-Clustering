Known for their strong political feelings, the band has appeared at numerous rallies and have advocated for numerous causes. Anti-Flag has released nine full-length albums and recently released A Document of Dissent, which is 26 songs spanning their career. Justin Sane took some time to speak with Wells On Music regarding his influences, Barack Obama, and a new Anti-Flag record in the works.\n\nScroll below video to read the interview.\n\n\n\nKevin Wells: What bands were you listening to when you started playing guitar?\n\nJustin Sane: That\u2019s an awesome question. My favorite band probably at that time was Black Flag, the Black Flag Damaged album. And you can hear it in my solos, especially some of my noisy solos in the early days of Anti-Flag, like on the Die for the Government record or on Underground Network is a really good example where I was just really influenced by the way Greg Ginn played guitar. I was also listening to The Clash and Sex Pistols when I was learning to play guitar. It\u2019s really interesting that I was really drawn to lead guitar more than rhythm. You know, there\u2019s so many basic rhythms for rock n roll, especially in the Sex Pistols\u2019 stuff, but those were rhythms I didn\u2019t learn for years, like ten or 15 years after I started to play guitar because I was so drawn to playing lead.\n\nKW: Was Black Flag the band that initially got you into punk music?\n\nJS: You know, it kind of was because, well, it\u2019s kind of a twisted tale in a way. I was the youngest of nine kids. I had older brothers and sisters who were listening to punk rock in the late 70s. My brother brought home a Ramones record from California probably around like \u201979, somewhere in that ballpark. So, I was just a little kid. I was born in 1973, but I remember listening to that record. He had gotten into punk rock. He was playing Sex Pistols and the Ramones and at the same time some of my other brothers and sisters were listening to KISS and John Denver. [laughs] I have this whole spectrum of John Denver and Bob Marley to the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, and Kiss.\n\nSo, I had this kind of early baptism into punk rock from just sitting around the house with my brothers and sisters listening to the Ramones and Sex Pistols. Then though, I kind of, as people do and as young kids do, I just found what was going on with my friends. You know, my friends were listening to Michael Jackson and Huey Lewis and the News. I was drawn into that stuff. Then around sixth grade, my sister Lucy was like, \u201cHey, you should come listen to this.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget it. She took me up to her room and she put on Black Flag Spray Paint the Walls, which is such a classic 53-second song. I thought it was the funniest thing I heard in my life. It was just this obnoxious, ridiculous punk rock song about noise and a guy screaming about spray painting walls. It didn\u2019t seem to have any meaning to me other than the fact that they were just trying to be obnoxious and ridiculous. That immediately appealed to all of my sensibilities. [laughs]\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nThat was, for me, what kicked off, like, oh yeah, there\u2019s something here. I wanna be a part of whatever that is. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I want to be a part of it.\n\nKW: Anti-Flag is obviously a highly political band. Can you talk a little about how your parents influenced your social consciousness?\n\nJS: Well, yeah, you don\u2019t get to be the youngest of nine kids by accident. What happens is you grow up in an Irish-Catholic family. [laughs] If you know anything about the Catholics, they don\u2019t believe in birth control. So, my parents had nine kids, but another part of Catholicism, for some people, is the idea of liberation theology. Liberation theology is basically the idea that all people should be taken care of and that you should fight for the poor and you should fight for the people who have less than you do.\n\nMy parents were obviously good Catholics, they had nine kids, but they were also swept away in this idea of liberation theology. They were civil rights leaders. They were anti-nuclear activists. They were environmentalists. You know, my mother was organic farming in the 1970s. My parents were always really progressive, really ahead of their time. They had a vegetarian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the mid-70s. At that time, Pittsburgh was a meat and potatoes kind of town.\n\nSo, they had a really big influence on me politically, just thinking about helping other people and standing up for people who couldn\u2019t stand up for themselves. My father is from Ireland and both of my mother\u2019s parents are from Ireland. I\u2019m actually an Irish citizen. I am a U.S. and Irish citizen, but the conflict in Northern Ireland really influenced my parents as far as standing up for people who are oppressed. My parents are really interesting in that they were the kind of people who early on were reaching across that Protestant-Catholic line. They were like, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got to break down this barrier between Protestants and Catholics.\u201d They did. They had a massive influence on the band.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone can really meet my parents without walking away with some incredible influence that just seems to permeate out of them. They\u2019re the kind of people I think are ahead of their time. They had a huge influence on the band and they were really supportive of the band. At the time, our drummer\u2019s parents were kind of like fighting him at every step of being in the band and my parents were like, \u201cHey, you can practice in our garage.\u201d [laughs] It was a very interesting dynamic. And we weren\u2019t a rich family. It was really working class. I would say our family was poor. Somehow, our parents always found a way to help us to follow our passion. Yeah, that was really important to the band.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nKW: I remember reading when Obama got elected, I think you said you were going to take kind of a wait and see approach on Obama. What are your thoughts on his presidency up to this point?\n\nJS: I\u2019m not even sure about \u201cwait and see,\u201d to be honest with you. I wrote an op-ed for a publication actually before Obama got elected. My basic argument in that op-ed was look, if we don\u2019t vote for Obama, we\u2019re going to get war all the time with John McCain. When you look at John McCain\u2019s history, his solution to every single problem in the world is war. It\u2019s incredible. It is absolutely incredible when you look at John McCain\u2019s history. He advocates for the use of military force in every major conflict [laughs] in the world. And my other argument was, look, the Supreme Court is really important. Do you want John McCain appointing people to the Supreme Court [who] might take away a woman\u2019s right to choose, etcetera, etcetera, or do you want Barack Obama, somebody who might give us a chance?\n\nThat said, I had no expectations for Obama to be good and he\u2019s lived up to every low expectation I had of him and more. You know, on one hand he gives a speech about equality and egalitarianism and raising the minimum wage and workers\u2019 rights, then the next minute, he literally goes off to a dinner with Jamie Dimon, one of the biggest bankers in the country, and does a fundraiser with Goldman-Sachs. That\u2019s Barack Obama. He\u2019s a politician and he\u2019s out for himself. I\u2019ve met a lot of politicians in my life, including Nancy Pelosi and a number of others, and my basic take on politicians is that they\u2019re egomaniacs. Any politician who really gets high in the political structure is not a good person.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s history, his past, is that he worked for one of the worst most corporate friendly law firms in Chicago. His main backers for his political ambitions were bankers. Barack Obama is very much a part of the power structure. I don\u2019t have any admiration for the man. I mean, I just really don\u2019t, but I will say this. We could have Mitt Romney or we could have John McCain and I think we would be in a worse place. I really believe that and ultimately, what led me to that conclusion was that I voted for Ralph Nader twice. The second time I voted for Ralph Nader [laughs], we got George W. Bush instead of Al Gore and I really believe if Al Gore won the election, there would never be an invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nUltimately, I believe elections do matter, but I believe that we do have to advocate for a change in other ways as well.\n\nKW: Would you ever consider running for political office?\n\nJS: You know, man, I just don\u2019t think anyone would vote for me. [laughs] I really don\u2019t. We\u2019ve been in that game in the respect that any time we appear with a politician, their opponents march out this just blitzkrieg of propaganda against that politician saying, \u201cThey appeared with these guys and they hate America. Look, they have an upside down flag.\u201d So, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have any chance. And it\u2019s just such an ugly game.\n\nI think I am more effective as an artist and as an activist and giving a voice to people who don\u2019t have a voice and agitating in that way.\n\nThere was time where I thought, \u201cYou know, maybe I\u2019d be okay as a politician,\u201d but I don\u2019t think so. I just got home from a good couple weeks of touring and it\u2019s really nice just to come home and get a break, you know, catch my breath and not be surrounded by people all the time. Even though the best part of touring is all of the people you get to meet, it\u2019s really great to be able to come home and just be alone and be myself.\n\nI think that in that respect, it\u2019s got to be a really hard job to be someone who has to be in the public spotlight 24 hours a day. I don\u2019t have that type-A personality where I\u2019m going to be up 21 hours a day, seven days a week doing a job. That\u2019s not me. I think that probably wouldn\u2019t fit into my personality so well.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nKW: Okay, back to music. A Document of Dissent was released yesterday on Fat Wreck Chords. What made you want to release a \u201cBest of\u201d album?\n\nJS: A big part was just Fat Mike. [laughs] We were in Australia, or somewhere like that, maybe it was Europe, and we got onto an airplane and Fat Mike was on the airplane. [laughs]. He was like, \u201cHey, man, it\u2019s been like 20 years, you guys should do a \u201cBest of\u201d record.\u201d That was part of it. That\u2019s the great thing about having friends, they make you think of things maybe you wouldn\u2019t normally think about. He wanted to put it out. He\u2019s always been a great friend to us and he was excited about it and had been thinking about it.\n\nThat was certainly part of it and it really, for me, got me thinking about the life of the band and where we came from and where we are today. And then ultimately going back and listening to those old records I hadn\u2019t listened to in ten years or maybe longer. Once I started listening to those again, it\u2019s an interesting journey to follow just the musical progression of the band and the political thoughts of the band.\n\nIn that respect, I thought this could be an interesting piece for people who have an interest in Anti-Flag. You can see a progression in ideas and a progression musically. There\u2019s certainly a big shift in the band in those respects. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. It\u2019s given us a chance to work with our friends over at Fat. I think the best part about being in this band is the relationships we\u2019ve made and the friendships we\u2019ve made and maintained. I mean, it\u2019s incredible that we\u2019ve maintained these friendships over such a long time. You meet people that have an impact on you for the rest of your life. That\u2019s special.\n\nKW: How did you guys decide on the songs to include on the album?\n\nJS: Ultimately, what it came down to, more or less, and this was a really hard process for me, it came down to the songs that were most influential to us at the time. We left off a song from For Blood and Empire. We left off the song, I\u2019d Tell You, but I\u2019m Dead, was a really hard choice for me. Even now, I am still struggling with that. That was such an important song for me at the time, but it came down to the fact that we could only pick so many songs and we wanted each record to be represented. In the end, the basic framework for the songs came down to the songs that were most influential at the time and when we played in that era, those were the songs that really connected with people. In a way, some of them are not even my favorite Anti-Flag songs, but they\u2019re songs that connected with people in that time. So, we decided to go in that direction with it.\n\nKW: Would you consider releasing more albums on Fat again?\n\nJS: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know. I think that the invitation is always there and the opportunity to work with friends is the best. Anti-Flag has records on so many different labels. It really comes to down to the fact that we have a lot of relationships with really great people in punk rock. As a result of that, we end up making records with a lot of different people, but yeah, whether we do another record on Fat remains to be seen. It\u2019s something that really interests me and I think it\u2019s a possibility, but I honestly right now couldn\u2019t tell you.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nKW: I have heard that you are working on another solo record. Is this correct?\n\nJS: That\u2019s the rumor. [laughs] As far as solo records go, I did a solo record years ago. I\u2019m always writing songs. It feels like every time I\u2019m ready to release something solo or sit down and record a solo record, some sort of obstacle comes up. I\u2019m gonna do some solo shows in the fall. I think if there was ever a time when I would do a solo record, it would be in this next year. So, that\u2019s a possibility. Actually, to be honest with you, I was really looking at recording a solo record over the holidays at the end of [last] year and I hurt my voice. I had vocal surgery at the beginning of the year and that tripped me up. The good news is the vocal surgery went perfect and it\u2019s like I never had a problem at all. My voice is right back where it was. I feel really lucky for that.\n\nKW: Are you working on any new Anti-Flag material?\n\nJS: Yeah, there is a lot of new Anti-Flag stuff in the works. We\u2019ve been working on demos for the last couple of months. We kind of built, like a lot of bands do nowadays, it\u2019s so economical to build your own studio. It\u2019s something that\u2019s a real reflection of how things have changed with technology in the last ten years or so. So, yeah, we\u2019ve just been working in our little one-room studio and working on new songs and we\u2019ll definitely have a new record for next year. I\u2019m really excited about it. I think it\u2019s something that is a real reflection of who we are today and the way that we sound now.\n\nDoing that \u201cBest of\u201d release was interesting because it has kind of given me a sense, musically, how the band has progressed and changed to a certain degree and I think for the better. It\u2019s exciting to see how we progressed as musicians. It\u2019s exciting for me to hear how my voice has changed. I can actually sing now. In the past, it was just like kind of grunt out whatever you get out of your throat. It\u2019s a very different thing today. And there have been a lot of musical influences that have crept in since we started.\n\nOne of the main things we\u2019ve talked about, other than the ideological stance and what kind of statement that we want to make today, it\u2019s also the idea that, you know, let\u2019s make a record that really sounds like we sound right now. That\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna go after with the next record we make.\n\nKW: Will Anti-Flag be doing any more U.S. touring this year?\n\nJS: We\u2019re not. I mean, one of the things we decided collectively at the end of last year was that we would take this year off, from a live standpoint, and focus on making a record. That\u2019s sort of the direction we\u2019ve been taking. So, we picked a few specific dates we\u2019ll be doing. We were invited to do Coachella, which is really exciting for us and a new experience. We\u2019re excited to do some festivals we were invited to do in Europe, but in general, we decided to take the year off.\n\nWe were invited to do Seeger Fest in New York City in Central Park. That was two nights ago we played that. And that kind of kicked off us doing some dates in the states. That was an incredible experience. I saw Pete Seeger play with Arlo Guthrie, who is Woody Guthrie\u2019s son, in a county park outside of Pittsburgh when I was in first or second grade. It\u2019s one of my first experiences seeing music live and seeing music that was really political. I think Pete Seeger was a real pioneer in marrying a message to music, especially popular American music. That music has stayed with me for my whole life. It\u2019s really had an influence on me the way I conduct myself with other people, the kind of songs I write, the things that are important to me. I actually met him that day as a little kid. I remember that interaction and I remembered thinking, \u201cWow, this guy just played for all these people and he\u2019s taking the time to talk to me, this little kid. That really stayed with me.\n\nThe entire [Seeger Fest] experience was incredible. We played with some really incredible musicians. To play in the middle of Central Park, I never imagined that that would be part of my musical repertoire in my life. Overall this year, we picked some special things to do, things that were really meaningful to us. Outside of that, we just decided to really focus on writing a new record. I guess next year, we\u2019ll really go after it.\n\nA Document of Dissent is available now on Fat Wreck Chords.
