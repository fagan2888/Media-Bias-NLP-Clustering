Fortunately those living there now seem nice and even possibly related.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the new legalization has the same rationale that may be used as part of Obama\u2019s expected mass legalization program:\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement is not part of that broader executive action, but includes an element that the administration is considering for wider use. In some proposals, temporary parole, like that planned for the Haitian relatives, could be offered to a much larger group of close relatives of American citizens who are in the United States illegally.\n\nHowever, Haitians who snuck into the United States illegally are not included. Yet.\n\n\u201cWhich countries are next on President Obama\u2019s list?\u201d demanded Senate Judiciary ranking member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa in a stinging statement. \u201cWill there be medical screenings before entry? Will work permits be granted automatically? How will this affect American workers?\n\nSpeaking to the Miami Herald, an administration official did not try to hide that the action was taken in lieu of legislation.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform would have solved this problem not just for Haitians but for all other nationalities who are waiting in the immigrant visa backlog because it would have substantially increased the numbers of family immigrant visas available and people would have been able to come in as permanent residents. As it hasn\u2019t happened, we are proceeding with this program.\n\nForget it Chuck. Americans \u2013 as intended \u2013 are becoming so inured to extralegal action by this administration that this will provoke hardly a yawn, and not even that from the mainstream press.\n\nHaiti is a miserable place, where hundreds of thousands died in the 2010 earthquake. But there are many places suffering horribly in the world.\n\nAmerica the most compassionate country on earth. If a law gets in the way of a decision to target Haitians for relief, it\u2019s the job of Congress, not Obama, to change it.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06f1\"", "article_summary": "Their entry has to have been petitioned by \u201cfamily\u201d members already in the United States.\nHowever, Haitians who snuck into the United States illegally are not included.\nIn some proposals, temporary parole, like that planned for the Haitian relatives, could be offered to a much larger group of close relatives of American citizens who are in the United States illegally.\nIf a law gets in the way of a decision to target Haitians for relief, it\u2019s the job of Congress, not Obama, to change it.\nPresident Obama Friday made a downpayment on the sweeping immigration \u201creform\u201d he is expected to unilaterally declare once the elections are out of the way, permitting up to around 100,000 prospective Haitian immigrants to bypass immigration law and enter the country."}
