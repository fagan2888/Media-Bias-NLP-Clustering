Times writer Philip Galanes brought the usual fan-club tone. \u201cMr. President, I have to tell you: Right now I\u2019m sweating. Does it bum you out to be the guy who stresses out most people he meets?\u201d Obama replied \u201cActually, I\u2019m very easygoing.\u201d\n\nThis exchange was the most unctuous genuflection of the feature:\n\nGALANES: I\u2019ve probably watched too many YouTube videos of you lately, but as amazing as you\u2019ve been in your pop culture moments \u2013 that tear for Aretha, singing \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d \u2013 I think you\u2019re the first president in my life who is fully a man of his times. You\u2019ve been the parents at Newtown, the boy who might have been Trayvon. You\u2019ve been the Dreamers and their anxious parents. Has it been hard for you personally to represent such grief and hope?\n\nOBAMA: One thing you have to keep in mind is that I\u2019m probably the most recorded, filmed and photographed person in history up to now. Because I\u2019m the first president who came along in the digital age. Every leader is a funnel for the culture he lives in. And despite the exotic name and weird background, I grew up as an ordinary middle-class kid. The cultural touch points that shaped you are the same ones that shaped me. And the fact that that was true until I was 45 probably differentiates me from most presidents.\n\nAnd then Obama launches into how someone else in politics is an intransigent ideologue in the minority:\n\nOBAMA: For somebody like L.B.J., who fastened onto a political career early, it probably changed the way he experienced culture and presented himself. It never felt like a burden to me. What\u2019s felt like a burden is seeing how politics has changed in ways that make it harder for Washington to work. There are a set of traditions, a constitutional design that allows someone like L.B.J. or F.D.R. to govern. And when those norms break down, the machinery grinds to a halt. That\u2019s when you feel burdened. When you say, \u201cHere\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d I\u2019ve made my argument; the majority of the population agrees with me. Yet we\u2019re confronted with endless filibusters and polarization that forbids us from getting stuff done.\n\nObama explained he \u201cHad to do\u201d a comedic interview to sell signing up for ObamaCare: \u201cWhen I want to sign young people up for health care, I\u2019ve got to do \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d which ended up being our biggest draw. Now, the flip side of this is the Trump phenomenon, where celebrity itself becomes a credential. If you are famous, then you have merit.\u201d\n\nOn the front of the Sunday section, they promoted Obama talking about how even he wouldn\u2019t vote for the Fox News caricature of Obama. (Please. Obama would vote for himself every time\u2026.his high impression of himself comes out all over this interview.)\n\nGALANES: Last subject: Bryan\u2019s movie made me rethink legacy. It\u2019s not just the achievement; it\u2019s the flavor of it, too. L.B.J.\u2019s legacy is not just civil rights and Vietnam, but also his hunger to be loved and win. President Bush\u2019s legacy is not only 9/11 and the Iraq War, but also his susceptibility to advisers. What\u2019s the flavor of your legacy?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, it\u2019s very hard for me to engage that.\n\nCRANSTON: I can.\n\nGALANES: You think it would be braggy?\n\nOBAMA: No, it\u2019s that there\u2019s me, and then there\u2019s this character named \u201cBarack Obama\u201d who is slightly different on Fox News than he is on MSNBC.I wouldn\u2019t vote for the Barack Obama on Fox News probably.\n\nCRANSTON: He\u2019s terrible.\n\nOBAMA: What a loser! No, it\u2019s hard to see yourself in that way. The one area that I do feel confident about is the notion of an inclusive nation, that everybody is part of this story. That\u2019s a running theme I\u2019ve been faithful to throughout my presidency.\n\nIn the \u201cTimes Insider\u201d feature, they asked Galanes how he prepared for this joint interview, and Galanes oozed over the fictional Obama autobiography: \u201cI started with Mr. Obama\u2019s memoir, Dreams From My Father, which I recommend highly. It led me pretty directly to the emotional spine of our discussion: two fatherless boys \u2014 Bryan and Mr. Obama \u2014 searching for their identity in the world; the fathers they became; and the work they do.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note.
