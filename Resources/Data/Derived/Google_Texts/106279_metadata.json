Simple, right? Not always. Dealing with health insurance companies and health care providers, such as doctors and hospitals, is complex. The process for newly insured patients can be confusing and comes with high stakes: One wrong step can result in a hefty medical bill. Avoiding pitfalls requires understanding the basics of health insurance and how to use it.\n\nNewly insured? You\u2019re not alone.\n\nAbout 11 million adults were newly insured in 2014, according to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. About half of these people are under age 35, and most of the newly insured are low- to middle-income earners, so cost is a definite concern.\n\nEven with insurance, medical care costs money. But you can better manage these costs by understanding how to use your policy.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know if you're new to health insurance:\n\n1. Your insurer\u2019s website is a good source of information.\n\nRegister through your insurer\u2019s website. Here you can find important information such as the directory of in-network providers, information on specific claims and how close you are to hitting your annual deductible\u2014 the amount of money you must put toward your care before your insurer starts picking up a greater portion of the tab.\n\n\u201cMost health insurance companies have made attempts to improve their websites, both for patients and providers,\u201d says Claire Freeman, founder and CEO of Compass Co-Pay, a patient advocacy firm.\n\nREAD MORE: 7 Health Insurance Terms You Should Know\n\n2. Your insurance network is a select group.\n\nYour insurance company contracts with medical providers to offer services at a discounted rate. These doctors and facilities are your insurance network, and you\u2019ll receive the greatest benefits of your policy with them. Go outside of that network, and you\u2019ll pay more for care. Always double-check your insurer\u2019s website to be certain a provider is in your network.\n\nREAD MORE: What Do In-Network and Out-of-Network Mean?\n\n3. You still have some control over medical costs.\n\nThe amount you pay at the receptionist\u2019s desk, called your copay, may be your first thought when it\u2019s time to go to the doctor, but there are other factors at play in how much you\u2019ll pay for medical care. If you have a deductible, it makes sense to price shop for health care by calling ahead to get cost estimates and weighing these against the quality of service you can expect. Also, choosing generic drugs over brand-name drugs and even negotiating medical bills after the fact can go far in saving you on out-of-pocket costs.\n\nREAD MORE: How to Negotiate Your Medical Bills\n\n4. Some services are free.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (ACA), numerous preventive services and screenings are free under your insurance, including blood-pressure screenings, annual well-woman visits and immunizations. Make sure you tell your doctor that you\u2019re interested in receiving such free screenings when you set up your appointment, as you are likely to see a charge if she provides services or counseling outside of the list.\n\nREAD MORE: Your Guide to Free Screenings Under the ACA\n\n5. The explanation of benefits (EOB) is an important document.\n\nYour insurer will send you a document called an explanation of benefits (EOB) that shows how it processed payments to your medical provider, including any balance that may be left.\n\n\u201cMany people routinely make it a habit to toss out their EOB,\u201d says Freeman, who says the document is a valuable tool. Freeman recommends you check it, looking for errors or problems that could lead to unnecessary medical bills. Compare it with the billing statement from your doctor and look for:\n\n\u25cf total amounts charged, and whether there are duplicate charges;\n\n\u25cf dates of service;\n\n\u25cf how much is being applied to your deductible;\n\n\u25cf whether the \u201cpatient responsibility\u201d on your EOB matches what the provider is billing you for.\n\n6. Insurance claims can still be denied.\n\nThere are many reasons your insurer may refuse to pay a claim, including preventable coverage issues, such as failing to get a referral for a specialist, or mistakes made by your medical provider\u2019s billing office. If a health claim is denied, call your insurer to find out why and what you can do to change that. If you believe it was denied without good reason, you can appeal the decision.\n\n7. Have more questions? Call customer service.\n\n\u201cYour health insurance website and customer service representatives are your best source of information\u201d when you have questions about your coverage, Freeman says. Don\u2019t worry about your question being \u201cdumb\u201d (it isn\u2019t) and make time to call, even if you\u2019re busy, she adds.\n\nUsing a new health insurance policy wisely requires taking deliberate and well-informed steps, whether it\u2019s your first time with insurance under the ACA or your first policy ever. Take some time to understand your coverage and ask questions to avoid unexpected medical bills and make the most of your health care spending.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-03 07:02:23 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "You pay your premium, get your insurance card and go to the doctor.
