That has changed some of the information used to set premium rates.\n\nThe comments were similar to expectations that Bertolini had laid out in April when announcing the company's first quarter earnings report.\n\nBertolini said that customers are disenrolling from exchange plans on a regular basis but that the company still expects to have 450,000 exchange customers at year end. He said that while he did not know the reason for these customers leaving, he suspected that it was due to the out-of-pocket costs before members reach their deductibles.
