As for being the worst time ever, that may have something to do with the more than 80 concertgoers who were treated for dehydration, drug overdoses, and alcohol poisoning.\n\nNearly as soon as the concert began at around 8 p.m. last night, the ambulances began to show up. According to Boston EMS Deputy Superintendent Michael Bosse, the patients were being brought in for \u201cmostly heat and alcohol-related symptoms,\u201d but there was also \u201ca lot of underage drinking\u201d and \u201csome illicit drugs,\u201d although he couldn\u2019t clarify what in particular, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nMedical emergency teams declared a \"Phase 2 MCI,\" a code representing over 30 individuals needing to be taken to the hospital. Of those treated, 50 were able to be attended to on site, but a further 36 patients needed to be transported to the local hospital, The Globe reported.\n\nDespite the large amount of alcohol consumption and use of drugs, many of the patients suffered from conditions caused by the hot, cramped conditions. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t breathe if you were on the floor,\u201d explained 19-year-old concert goer Mike Santostefano to The Globe. In the words of Santostefano, \u201ca lot of people couldn\u2019t handle themselves.\u201d The teen explained how a large number of those who didn\u2019t normally do drugs, did so at the show last night. \u201cYou get really hot in there and you just pass out. You couldn\u2019t breathe. It was claustrophobic. People get dehydrated, \u201d Roison Saratonion, 18, who had left the concert early, told The Globe.\n\nUnfortunately, this combination of alcohol and drug abuse has become a recurring problem at EDM concerts. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this type of behavior, alcohol, abuse of other drugs before,\" Boston Police Superintendent in Chief William G. Gross told The Globe. In May, 29 people were reported to be hospitalized due to similar health conditions at an Avicii concert in Toronto, Canada, The Star reported. According to those in attendance at the Toronto show, many concertgoers were getting sick before the Swedish performer even graced the stage. In August of last year, three drug overdoses occurred at DJ Zedd\u2019s show at the House of Blues in Boston. Unfortunately, a 19-year-old-woman did die of a suspected \"Molly\" overdose at this concert.\n\nStill, despite the recent number of hospital admissions and even deaths that have occurred at or during EDM concerts, some young concertgoers believe that everything is being blown out of proportion. \u201cI bet there were rock and roll concerts in the '70s that were more out of hand than this,\u201d Matt Mogavero, 18, told The Globe. Others left early because the scene was \u201cpretty young\u201d and filled with people \u201cthat can\u2019t just come to a concert like this and enjoy the music for what it is,\u201d Steve Watkins, 28, told The Globe.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "boston, avicii, concert, ends, over, 80, needing, medical, treatment, dehydration, molly, and", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Over 80 Avicii fans needed medical help for dehydration, drug, and alcohol-related conditions after attending the Wednesday night concert in Boston.", "title": "Boston Avicii Show Ends In Over 80 People Needing Medical Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/boston-avicii-concert-ends-over-80-needing-medical-treatment-dehydration-molly-and-alcohol-overdoses", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/concert.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Over 80 Avicii fans needed medical help for dehydration, drug, and alcohol-related conditions after attending the Wednesday night concert in Boston.", "title": "Boston Avicii Show Ends In Over 80 People Needing Medical Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/boston-avicii-concert-ends-over-80-needing-medical-treatment-dehydration-molly-and-alcohol-overdoses", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/concert.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/concert.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-26T15:48:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T15:48:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Over 80 Avicii fans needed medical help for dehydration, drug, and alcohol-related conditions after attending the Wednesday night concert in Boston."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb5a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this type of behavior, alcohol, abuse of other drugs before,\" Boston Police Superintendent in Chief William G.
