The Dexter writer-activist makes clear from the start that he admires new Congresswoman Debbie Dingell so much he considers her \"as my actual representative.\n\nThat's because, on just about any topic or issue you could name, Debbie Dingell does represent my views. She\u2019s as solid a progressive as you could ever hope to meet. . . . I sat down with Congresswoman Dingell last week to talk about her first 100 days, the issues that she\u2019s already working on, and what things are on the horizon.\n\n\n\nDebbie Dingell: \" I don\u2019t think white males should be discriminated against either. . . . We\u2019ve got to figure out a way that we treat everybody equally.\"\n\nBelow are snatches of his Eclectablog conversation with the 61-year-old House member who won the seat her husband, John, held for more than 59 years -- the longest congressional tenure ever.\n\n\u25ba Freshman year: I\u2019ve really kept my head down. It is really important to me that people know that I\u2019m just a hard worker and that I understand that my last name means nothing, that I\u2019ve got to earn my stripes. I\u2019ve got to show people that I am a hard worker with abilities.\n\n\u25ba Gender equity: I know what it\u2019s like to be discriminated against as a woman. In my first job interview, the man who interviewed me said, \u201cWhy would a woman want to work at General Motors?\u201d I have been sexually harassed in the workplace. And I have seen other forms of gender discrimination. . . .\n\nWomen should be paid equally for equal work. . . . We have to continue to shine a light on the fact that there are women who are not being paid an equal wage for equal work.\n\n\u25ba \"Still facing discrimination:\" People do not understand that there is regular discrimination going on. I, as woman, feel it. Blacks feel it every day. I live for the day when no one asks me a gender-based question or a race-based question. I think it\u2019s great that you, as a younger generation, have not had to deal with a lot of things that we\u2019ve lived with. But the reality is that women today, as well as African Americans, are still facing discrimination in different ways.\n\nAnd, by the way, I don\u2019t think white males should be discriminated against either. And there are times when they feel discriminated against. We\u2019ve got to figure out a way that we treat everybody equally.\n\n\u25ba Personal crusade: The issue that will become one of my signature issues is long-term health care. I wasn\u2019t looking to become an expert on the issue but, when John became seriously ill, I began dealing with a system that is really broken. . . . Navigating a broken system that\u2019s not integrated, dealing with insurance companies and doctors, and misdiagnoses, and access to services, and how you\u2019re going to deal with a myriad of problems was a real eye-opener for me. He became sicker and, frankly, almost died because I could not get him the care that he needed, even knowing the care that he needed. And I know that I am luckier than most people. . . .\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does nothing to deal with long term care. . . . This Is my number one issue.\n\n\u25ba U.S. automakers: We can build a car better than anybody in the world and compete. But you can\u2019t compete on an unlevel playing field against the Bank of Japan or the Japanese government. And we need a government that\u2019s going to fight for us the way the Japanese government fights for its manufacturers. . . .\n\nAny trade that is negotiated that doesn\u2019t include or address currency manipulation is not something that I can support or that anybody from Michigan, I think, should support.\n\n-- Alan Stamm", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_Debbie_Dingell_16723.jpg", "description": "\"My last name means nothing,\" says John Dingell's wife. \"I\u2019ve got to earn my stripes.
