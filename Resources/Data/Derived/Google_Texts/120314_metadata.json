These little snippets are intended for readers to explore the technology being made right here. One company at a time, of course.\n\nBrackitz\n\nIf you think there\u2019s nothing techie about construction toys that work without batteries, you probably think STEM has something to do with vegetation. Inspired by his children\u2019s struggle to move from blocks to more complex engineering toys, Chris Cochella developed Brackitz, which encourages kids to turn wood planks into 3-D contraptions that don\u2019t collapse when touched. It\u2019s like Tinkertoys but without the pokey sticks. While it\u2019s up to the child and parent to discuss and explore the STEM of the toy (the science, technology, engineering and math applications), just by building stuff a child learns about physics, architecture and other abstract math. Guess that saying is true: If you leave it in the playroom, they will build.1685 South Colorado Blvd., Suite S-133 in Denver2014Chris CochellaMade it to several 2015 toy award lists, including Academics\u2019 Choice Dr. Toy\u2019s Best Classics and Kidscreen\u2019s Best of Toy Fair.720-446-5558 or sales@brackitz.com\n\nAre you a Colorado tech business in the consumer world?
