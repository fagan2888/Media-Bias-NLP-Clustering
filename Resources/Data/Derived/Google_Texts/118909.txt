When explaining his criticism of President Obama's speech this week at a Maryland mosque during Saturday night's Republican debate, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) worked in a claim that the Obama administration is discriminating against Christian groups.

Rubio criticized Obama for claiming that there is "widespread discrimination against Muslim Americans" before later mentioning discrimination against Christians.

The Florida senator referenced the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have sued the federal government over the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers offer health plans that cover contraceptives.

"I do believe it is important to recognize -- you want to talk about religious discrimination in America. I don't think Barack Obama's being sued by any Islamic groups, but he is being sued by the Little Sisters of the Poor," Rubio said.

He added that there are Christians with "traditional values" who face discrimination as the government forces them to "violate their conscience."
