These were the years when a declining-in-influence \u201cT.R.L.\u201d would play 30-second snippets of music videos so unimaginative as to be not even worth that much time, post-Madonna\u2019s peak but before the rise of Beyonc\u00e9. MTV gave Video Music Award nominations to artists who\u2019d never consistently make it onto their air (Johnny Cash, the White Stripes, Fatboy Slim) in the early 2000s, simply because there weren\u2019t enough people doing interesting things with the medium to fill out a category.\n\nWho would have guessed that the music video would become the most vital sort of art in 2013? The year\u2019s two most resonant single cultural moments both revolved around music videos. At the Video Music Awards this summer, Miley Cyrus\u2019s twerking on Robin Thicke was in fact an homage to his \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d video, which had been a smash online; her dancing at the beginning of the performance and the general aesthetic was directly taken from her \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d video. And Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s recent album drop was so striking in part because it included a music video for every song; part of the reason one had to buy it as soon as possible was to experience the visuals for each track.\n\nCyrus and Beyonc\u00e9, in very different ways, proved that the music video matters. In Cyrus\u2019s case, she was able to advance, through a consistent visual aesthetic, her new persona as a sexually frank and drug-using twentysomething; in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s case, she put forward a diverse slate of videos with entirely different looks and dance moves.\n\nThanks to YouTube and sites like it, music fans no longer need to wait for MTV to broadcast videos in order to see their favorite artist\u2019s clip. Indeed, placing the power to choose what to watch in the hands of the viewer, rather than that of an MTV producer with relationships to artists and labels, has meaningfully changed the game. Music-video streams online now count toward a song\u2019s chart success \u2014 this is how \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d whose video features Miley Cyrus, nude, atop the titular destruction device, became the singer\u2019s first number-one. So an anodyne video is hardly worth making at all. Look at the case of Katy Perry, whose \u201cPrism\u201d album release has been burdened with dull videos with whiplash-inducing changes in persona. In the \u201cRoar\u201d video, Perry is a jungle goddess; in \u201cUnconditionally,\u201d she\u2019s in a sort of \u201cDangerous Liaisons\u201d milieu. Why? She fully commits to neither.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kanye's \"Bound 2\" video and Miley's exploits on the wrecking ball were the things that impacted us most in 2013 VIDEO", "title": "The year music videos made a comeback", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Kanye's \"Bound 2\" video and Miley's exploits on the wrecking ball were the things that impacted us most in 2013 VIDEO", "title": "The year music videos made a comeback", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/26/the_year_music_videos_made_a_comeback/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/year_in_videos.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kanye's \"Bound 2\" video and Miley's exploits on the wrecking ball were the things that impacted us most in 2013 VIDEO", "title": "The year music videos made a comeback", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/year_in_videos.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Best of 2013, Beyonce, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The year\u2019s two most resonant single cultural moments both revolved around music videos.\nWho would have guessed that the music video would become the most vital sort of art in 2013?\nCyrus and Beyonc\u00e9, in very different ways, proved that the music video matters.\nThese were the years when a declining-in-influence \u201cT.R.L.\u201d would play 30-second snippets of music videos so unimaginative as to be not even worth that much time, post-Madonna\u2019s peak but before the rise of Beyonc\u00e9.\nThanks to YouTube and sites like it, music fans no longer need to wait for MTV to broadcast videos in order to see their favorite artist\u2019s clip."}
