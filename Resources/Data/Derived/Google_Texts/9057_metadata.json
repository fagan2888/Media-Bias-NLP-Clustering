According to the Washington Free Beacon, they also cannot determine if the amounts were correct, or even if they went to the right individuals.\n\nThe report began with this statement:\n\n\u201cCMS\u2019s internal controls did not effectively ensure the accuracy of nearly $2.8 billion in aggregate financial assistance payments made to insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act during the first 4 months that these payments were made. We determined that CMS\u2019s internal controls for calculating and authorizing financial assistance payments were not effective.\u201d\n\nThey added that despite previous recommendations of how to address these issues, they are still unable to determine if the \u201cnew calculation methodology allows for the type of discrepancies\u201d they uncovere,d and that \u201ca significant amount of Federal funds are at risk.\u201d\n\nSubsidies like these may no longer be allowed at all, depending on the results of a long-awaited ruling on King V Burwell, a case heard before the Supreme Court this past March.\n\nAt issue is whether Obamacare allows subsidies to states that did not set up state insurance exchanges.
