Associated Press/Matthew Mead\n\nCorporate acquirers anxious for growth are looking to small companies as a way to offset the hum-drum pace of the economy, which could mean more competition for private equity firms at the lower end of the market.\n\nMore than 70% of the acquisitions made by the 25 most active corporate acquirers in the first half\u2013an industry-diverse list that includes insurer Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., technology giant Google and real estate brokerage Realogy Holdings\u2013were deals valued at less than $50 million, according to data from research firm Sutton Place Strategies LLC. Combined, those 25 companies did 99 such deals.\n\nConversely, among those top 25 most active acquirers, there were six deals valued at more than $1 billion in the first half.\n\nSutton Place founder Nadim Malik said during the first half mergers and acquisitions overall increased 17%, but within the smaller segment\u2013deals with enterprise values of between $5 million and $50 million\u2013it was up 25%.\n\n\u201cLarge companies, whether they are mature or growing, need to supplement their growth organically with acquisitions, which may mean smaller deals than they have historically looked at,\u201d said Mr. Malik.\n\nNormally, the interest of corporate acquirers is welcome news for private equity firms, which often look to such entities to provide potential exit opportunities. But in this segment of the market, these companies may only serve as further competition.\n\nSome private equity firms mine the smaller end of the market for companies in fragmented industries that can be built up through further acquisitions. More private equity firms also may be looking at the space as ample liquidity in the marketplace has served to juice up deal prices upstream.\n\nMr. Malik said activity at the smallest end of the market will continue apace.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot of economic forecasts predicting that the economy is heating up,\u201d he said. \u201cCorporate buyers are still going to need to look for acquisitions to grow.\u201d\n\nHealth care in particular may be a sector that continues to see significant activity, given the changes underway as a result of the Affordable Care Act, said Mr. Malik.\n\n\u201cAnytime there is a shift or transition in an industry because of regulations, there is an opportunity for firms that understand it to acquire and for others to get out of it,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Hillary Canada at hillary.canada@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Corporate acquirers anxious for growth are looking to small companies as a way to offset the hum-drum pace of the economy, which could mean more competition for private equity firms at the lower end of the market.", "title": "Corporate Acquirers Have Big Appetites for Tiny Companies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/10/17/corporate-acquirers-have-big-appetites-for-tiny-companies/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FB603_BITES_P_20141017150020.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Corporate Acquirers Have Big Appetites for Tiny Companies", "description": "Corporate acquirers anxious for growth are looking to small companies as a way to offset the hum-drum pace of the economy, which could mean more competition for private equity firms at the lower end of the market.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Hillary Canada", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Corporate acquirers anxious for growth are looking to small companies as a way to offset the hum-drum pace of the economy, which could mean more competition for private equity firms at the lower end of the market.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-17T20:20:37-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/10/17/corporate-acquirers-have-big-appetites-for-tiny-companies/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-17506", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Corporate acquirers anxious for growth are looking to small companies as a way to offset the hum-drum pace of the economy, which could mean more competition for private equity firms at the lower end of the market.", "title": "Corporate Acquirers Have Big Appetites for Tiny Companies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/10/17/corporate-acquirers-have-big-appetites-for-tiny-companies/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FB603_BITES_P_20141017150020.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-17506", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-17T20:04:24-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfbd\"", "article_summary": "Corporate acquirers have been feasting on tiny companies.\nNormally, the interest of corporate acquirers is welcome news for private equity firms, which often look to such entities to provide potential exit opportunities.\nMore private equity firms also may be looking at the space as ample liquidity in the marketplace has served to juice up deal prices upstream.\nSome private equity firms mine the smaller end of the market for companies in fragmented industries that can be built up through further acquisitions.\nBut in this segment of the market, these companies may only serve as further competition."}
