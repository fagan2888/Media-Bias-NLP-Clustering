The Bay County Islamic Society hosted their annual open house Saturday.

They wanted to connect with people of all faiths.

The Bay County Islamic Society events coordinator says Islam is a very peaceful religion, and this event was a great way of showing that.

"I think it's always better to get it from the source, knowledge from the source, rather than reading or seeing on tv beacuse it could be a little bit of a distorted view," said Michael Wright, Panama City Resident.

"This is a very good opportunity for us to get to know each other. To get to know your neighbor. Muslim neighbor, jewish neighbor, regardless, christian neighbor, a human being who is your brother in humanity or sister in humanity," said Amr Dabour, Imam.

Dozens attended and saw different displays and enjoyed Middle Eastern delicacies.

People had a chance to tour the mosque, exhibits and an opportunty to watch a prayer.
