You got it.\n\nThe state\u2019s outgoing Insurance Commissioner on Wednesday wrote separate but identical letters to Gov. Rick Scott, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.\n\nHe said he would delay his departure to \u201c45 days after my successor is appointed.\u201d The state still hasn\u2019t hired his replacement.\n\nThe 56-year-old had announced in January that he was stepping down. He had held the post since 2003 and originally planned to leave on May 2.\n\n\u201cI take this action to honor my commitment to facilitate a smooth transition as the 2016 hurricane season approaches,\u201d he wrote in the letters.\n\n\u201cI remain committed to continuity of leadership for the benefit of the Office of Insurance Regulation and the people of Florida whom I serve.\u201d\n\nMcCarty wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment Wednesday afternoon. A request for comment was placed with Scott\u2019s office.\n\nUnder state law, Scott and Atwater must first agree on a candidate, who then must be approved by one other Cabinet member. The Office of Insurance Regulation is under the Department of Financial Services, which Atwater heads as CFO.\n\nBut Scott and Atwater each favor two different candidates: Retired executive Jeffrey Bragg and state Rep. Bill Hager, a former Iowa insurance commissioner, respectively.\n\nThey decided to take more applications for the job after the March 29 Cabinet meeting.\n\nA new deadline for applications was April 15; 12 more contenders applied. They include Michael Bownes, a veteran general counsel for the Alabama Insurance Department. He\u2019s also past head of the Alabama Attorney General\u2019s Office of Consumer Protection.\n\nThe governor\u2019s daily schedule shows that Scott scheduled a 1 p.m. meeting with Hager on Wednesday. The next Cabinet meeting is April 26.\n\nHager, a Delray Beach Republican, has been vice chair of the House Insurance and Banking Subcommittee. He also runs a small business as an expert witness and insurance arbitrator.\n\nBragg made a high-profile misstep when Attorney General Pam Bondi asked him an Affordable Care Act question about navigators. They\u2019re application counselors who are supposed to help people get health insurance.\n\nBragg said he didn\u2019t know to what Bondi was referring.\n\nHe\u2019s had senior positions with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and mega-insurer Zurich. He also was director of the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "adam putnam, bill hager, department of financial services, gov. rick scott, jeff atwater, jeffrey bragg, kevin mccarty, michael bownes, office of insurance regulation, pam bondi", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.6 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "SaintPetersBlog", "description": "Kevin McCarty is telling his bosses:\u00a0You need more time?
