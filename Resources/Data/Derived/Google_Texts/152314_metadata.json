The pledge is both heartening because it keeps the international negotiating process moving, and depressing because, even if we achieve it, it is (according to most scientists) far too little to avert climate catastrophe.\n\nSo the question remains: is there any imaginable way that U.S. political action could go further? Or are we betting the planet on a potpourri of rules and regulations may not even be fully implemented?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany economists argue that a tax on carbon is the ultimate climate solution. In this view, the failure of markets to charge appropriate prices for carbon causes everyone to burn too much of it. Let government add a tax \u2014 ideally a steadily rising one \u2014 and the problem is solved.\n\nThe argument certainly has a logic to it. And a carbon tax has the advantage of being both economy-wide and simple to enforce. But in the real world, would it actually save us from climate catastrophe? There are good reasons to believe that it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe first is that a carbon tax would be only one factor in the total prices of fossil fuels, and in the case of oil, a small one. As a rule of thumb, each dollar per ton of a carbon tax adds about a penny per gallon to the price of gas at the pump. So a carbon tax that rises $15 a ton per year (as has been pro-posed by Rep. Jim McDermott Jim McDermottLawmakers urge Obama not to send shoulder-fired missiles to Syria GOP group promises ObamaCare replacement plan \u2014 soon Sanders fundraising for 3 House candidates MORE) would raise gasoline prices by about 15 cents a gallon per year, a modest fraction of the current price.\n\nFor at least the next decade, the signal from such a tax would be lost in the volatility of other, larger components of the pump price. And after that, its impact would likely be limited. Even if there were no political backlash, as there was recently in Australia, the cumulative tax rise over thirty years would be around $4.50 a gallon, meaning that (other things being equal) the price of gas in the U.S. in 2045 would be below the average price in Europe today. That might nudge Americans out of their Jeep Wranglers, but not out of their Mini-Coopers.\n\nEven if fuel prices went higher than that, a look at the last twenty years suggests that price signals alone aren\u2019t a wise climate bet for the next twenty. Between 1994 and 2014, the global price of oil tripled, yet U.S. oil burning barely budged. While higher prices spurred efficiency and reduced per capita consumption, they didn\u2019t cut aggregate use because our population and economy steadily grew. And now that oil prices have plummeted, and whatever impact higher prices made in the past could easily be wiped out.\n\nCutting aggregate use of fossil fuels is, of course, what\u2019s required. Indeed, the math says that aggregate use has to verge toward zero by mid-century. So there\u2019s little time to lose in installing an effective and reliable carbon reduction tool.\n\nIf a carbon tax is a bad bet, is there a better one? Fortunately, there is: a declining carbon supply limit, with allocation driven by the market. Permits would be sold not to emitters, but to companies that bring carbon into our economy. To avoid leakage, there\u2019d be no offsets or trading. And to avert political backlash, the money raised by selling permits would be returned equally to every American with a Social Security number.\n\nUnlike a carbon tax, a declining carbon supply limit would send two messages to the market rather than one. A carbon tax says to the market, \u201cFossil fuels will get more expensive.\u201d Many polluters can live with that, knowing they can shift higher costs to consumers or use fossil fuels more efficiently. By contrast, a declining supply cap sends a price signal and a physical one: \u201cIn the not-too-distant future, fossil fuels won\u2019t be available at any price.\u201d That makes everyone get serious about carbon reduction and substitution.\n\nThis brings us to the bill introduced recently by Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D) of Maryland. Called the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act, the 27-page measure combines a descending supply limit with dividends. Van Hollen introduced a similar bill in 2009, but it was lost in the battle over cap-and-trade. Now it stands alone as the only bill that would physically limit carbon burning while retaining broad popular support.\n\nIn the present political climate Van Hollen\u2019s proposal won\u2019t get very far, but it merits our attention nonetheless. It reminds us that, when nature\u2019s voice is finally heard, there is a way to kick our carbon habit that\u2019s guaranteed to work. Let\u2019s remember that when hurricanes and heat waves strike, droughts linger and forest fires rage.\n\nBarnes is the author of With Liberty and Dividends For All.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Are we betting the planet on a potpourri of rules and regulations may not even be fully implemented?", "description": "Are we betting the planet on a potpourri of rules and regulations may not even be fully implemented?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Are we betting the planet on a potpourri of rules and regulations may not even be fully implemented?", "title": "Don\u2019t bet the planet on carbon taxes", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/238263-dont-bet-the-planet-on-carbon-taxes", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/238263-dont-bet-the-planet-on-carbon-taxes", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-09T17:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Peter Barnes", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Jim McDermott,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-09T17:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/238263-dont-bet-the-planet-on-carbon-taxes", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Are we betting the planet on a potpourri of rules and regulations may not even be fully implemented?", "card": "summary", "title": "Don\u2019t bet the planet on carbon taxes"}, "dcterms.title": "Don\u2019t bet the planet on carbon taxes"}, "article_summary": "Unlike a carbon tax, a declining carbon supply limit would send two messages to the market rather than one.\nIf a carbon tax is a bad bet, is there a better one?\nAnd a carbon tax has the advantage of being both economy-wide and simple to enforce.\nFortunately, there is: a declining carbon supply limit, with allocation driven by the market.\nIn the present political climate Van Hollen\u2019s proposal won\u2019t get very far, but it merits our attention nonetheless."}
