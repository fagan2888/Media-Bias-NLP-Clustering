What do you think of Dobrev's stance on Obamacare?

With a shutdown closing the federal government for the first time since the mid-1990s because Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on the future of Obamacare, the focus on President Barack Obama’s landmark legislation has only intensified in recent days.

To show her support for Affordable Care Act (ACA) and to encourage people to use the Health Insurance Marketplace to find quality medical care plans, “Vampire Diaries” actress Nina Dobrev posed topples with a sign covering her breasts that read: #getcovered.

Dobrev wrote the following message to accompany her Instagram picture:

“Im Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered ,Because w/o it, youre naked.”

According to Us Weekly, Dobrev isn’t the only celebrity standing behind the president’s healthcare law (although she is the only one who posed topless to show her support). Rosario Dawson, Connie Britton, Kerry Washington and Kate Bosworth also showed their support for Obamacare with their own homemade signs. Us Weekly notes that the actress’ picture has helped the #getcovered campaign gain nearly 94,000 likes.

Perhaps it was seeing Dobrev topless that encouraged people to visit the Health Insurance Marketplace or maybe it was a real concern about finding a decent medical care plan, either way traffic surges and glitches marked the debut of the federal website HealthCare.gov (the website is running even though the federal government isn’t).

Dobrev isn’t the first celebrity to stand behind President Obama in an unusual way. Actor Samuel L. Jackson showed his support for 44 in a campaign video entitled “Wake the F**k Up.” The video was a parody of the children’s book “Go the F**k To Sleep.”
