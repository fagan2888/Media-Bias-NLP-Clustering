Each state works with the federal government to hammer out a program tailored to its own needs. Since 2010, Obamacare has enabled states to loosen their limits on who qualifies. Now Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid program accepts people with incomes under 139% of the Federal Poverty Level\u2014an individual earning below $16,300 or a family of four earning below $33,700, for example.\n\nSince the expansion took effect in January 2014, Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate has gone from 20% to 9%\u2014a major drop. Of the state\u2019s 4.4 million total residents, Medicaid now insures 1.2 million\u2014400,000 of whom are new sign-ups under the expansion. Another 100,000 have signed up for private plans using kynect, Kentucky\u2019s online insurance exchange where residents can shop for a policy that fits their particular needs and apply for tax credits to help subsidize it. Anybody who refuses this policy, in return pays a modest fine.\n\nBevin and Medicaid\n\nKentucky\u2019s conservative new governor Matt Bevin is a businessman who sees government overreach as a toxic drag on economic liberty. Unsurprisingly, he\u2019s vowed to replace the Medicaid expansion with something that will \u201cbring relief from Obamacare to the taxpayers of Kentucky.\u201d Since outgoing governor Steve Beshear used broad authority to bypass the legislature and unilaterally okay the expansion, it\u2019s quite possible that Bevin could use this same executive leeway to undo it. Bevin plans to apply for a 1115 waiver which would enable Kentucky to eschew the typical restrictions and instead test out its very own Medicaid. But of the five states using the waiver so far, none have been permitted to lower the income threshold.\n\nHow would Bevin use the waiver? First, he might follow Indiana\u2019s lead and foist new costs on Medicaid beneficiaries. Second, he insists on dismantling kynect and pushing its 400,000 newly insured users into the federal exchange at healthcare.gov. For now, though, repealing the expansion root and branch is unlikely. It\u2019s both unpopular and politically unfeasible.\n\nWhat Bevin Gets Wrong\n\nMedicaid, Medicare, and Social Security comprise a safety net that helps keep America\u2019s most vulnerable populations\u2014persons with disabilities, the poor, the elderly\u2014from falling into a cycle of grinding poverty. That\u2019s what they do by design. There\u2019s a useful term in labor studies to describe these kinds of people: precarity. Simply put, this refers to when a person lacks stability and security in their own life such that their psychological and material welfare suffer.\n\nIf Bevin implements his goals\u2014pushing kynect signees into the federal exchange, shifting Medicaid costs to the beneficiary\u2014each kynect user\u2019s registration fee will spike from 1% to 3.5%, and the 400,000 new Medicaid sign-ups will draw fees in the form of premiums and co-pays. These changes are effectively a regressive tax and they penalize low-income earners just so Bevin can be sure they have \u201cskin in the game.\u201d Aside from being morally misguided, that\u2019s just bad policy. If we really want the poorest Kentuckians to climb the economic ladder, we ought to hawkishly contain the damages they can incur. Keeping them in a constant state of precarity lowers their odds at escaping the positive feedback loop known as a poverty trap.\n\nA Tea Partier, Bevin\u2019s beef with government programs is premised largely on how much they cost taxpayers. In the near term, though, Kentucky\u2019s expansion has a net positive economic impact. Right now, the federal government pays for it entirely. By 2021, their share will incrementally drop to 90%, leaving Kentucky responsible for the other 10%. Skeptics ignore the fact that the 90% of federal money is new revenue for doctors, hospitals, health care providers\u2014that fuels investment and job growth.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that thanks to so many newly insured people using their perks, preventive services are way up: cancer screenings, cholesterol tests, flu shots, preventive dental\u2014all have more than doubled. It\u2019s way cheaper to treat people up front than to let them develop problems that eventuate in obscenely costly E.R. trips.\n\nBevin recently took office on December 8. Let\u2019s just hope he doesn\u2019t wallow away this project, leaving half a million Kentuckians on the back burner.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Louisville Cardinal", "description": "By Simon Meiners\u2013 The Basics: What is Medicaid?
