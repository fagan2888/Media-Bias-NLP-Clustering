Good morning, fellow political junkies.

It's one month since the Affordable Care Act's health-exchange website went live and many Democrats would clearly love a do-over.

While that won't be forthcoming, they did get some handholding from Obama administration officials Thursday. But it will take more than that to quell the jitters as Democrats see what they had hoped would be a political asset in 2014, their signature healthcare legislation, threaten to become a liability.

Meanwhile, the issue that gave President Obama momentum in the 2008 Democratic primaries, Iraq, reemerges with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's visit to the White House Friday. Maliki is expected to ask for U.S. military assistance in the fight against al Qaeda-linked extremists behind a rising tide of violence in his nation. It's unclear what further assistance Obama would be willing to provide that could make a real difference.

With that, here are some of the more interesting pieces of news or analysis with political implications I ran across this morning.
