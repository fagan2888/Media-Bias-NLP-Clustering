They want what other people have and that's what this is offering.\u201d\n\nClark expects interest to grow once the kinks are worked out of the federal government's website, healthcare.gov.\n\nResponding to that demand will largely fall to Wilson, who landed in this position through a somewhat convoluted process.\n\nWhen Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican-led Legislature opted against setting up a state insurance exchange, per the ACA, the federal government had to do it.\n\nAs part of that, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced in August that it would divvy up $67 million nationwide to hire navigators \u2014 people like Wilson who are specially trained to field questions and offer guidance about enrolling in a private insurance plan once the market opened on Oct. 1.\n\nThe ACA does not affect people who are already participating in government insurance programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid. People with private insurance can tap into the service if their employer's program doesn't meet certain levels required by the ACA.\n\nFlorida was awarded $7.8 million of the HHS grants, the biggest share of which, about $4.2 million, went to Florida Covering Kids & Families, a health program at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nUSF subsequently partnered with nine regional nonprofit or consumer groups to introduce the navigators to different parts of the state.\n\nOne of those organizations was WellFlorida Council Inc., a nonprofit agency designated by the state to serve as health care consultants to 16 North Central Florida counties, including Marion.\n\nWellFlorida, in turn, subcontracted the navigator effort for Marion and Sumter counties to Heart of Florida.\n\nAccording to USF, Wilson would be one of six full- or part-time navigators WellFlorida was supposed to hire to serve its entire region.\n\nThere is one other Ocala-based navigator, according to the state Department of Financial Services, which under state law must license people interested in becoming navigators.\n\nBrandi Cooney, public relations director at Childhood Development Services, has been approved as such. CDS, however, is covering Hernando and Citrus counties, Cooney said.\n\nClark said her agency lobbied WellFlorida hard to take on the navigator's tasks.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to do it because there are so many uninsured people in Marion County,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we jumped in so fast was to make sure we could bring the best information to Marion County and because rural areas are often overlooked.\u201d\n\nTo launch the program WellFlorida provided Heart of Florida $37,800 to pay for Wilson's post, including her salary, equipment and expenses, Clark said.\n\nWilson's job frequently sends her to Sumter County, which, according to 2011 data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, has more than 8,100 uninsured people, or about 18 percent of its under-65 population.\n\nWilson was one of 35 applicants for the job and was selected from a handful of finalists who were interviewed.\n\n\u201cAnna really stood out, with her background of bringing resources to people, because at the end of the day, that's what this is all about,\u201d Clark said.\n\nWilson, who holds a master's degree in adult education, said she moved to Ocala four years ago from New York City.\n\nBefore Heart of Florida, she previously worked for Camelot Community Care in Lake and Sumter counties, locating health care providers for children with mental health issues.\n\nDuring the past six years she was in New York, Wilson worked as an assistant program director at a homeless shelter. There, too, she dealt with many people battling mental health problems and sought help for them, she said.\n\nSince it was enacted in 2010, ACA foes have latched onto almost every major piece of the law to denounce it, with the much-publicized shortcomings of the government's website being the latest issue.\n\nThe establishment of the navigators was no different.\n\nFlorida Attorney General Pam Bondi, for example, has suggested the navigator ranks could include identity thieves who would have easy access to an individual's sensitive information. The Florida Department of Health responded by barring navigators from county health departments.\n\nBondi raised those concerns as Washington was touting the funding for the navigators, weeks after a new law enacted by Florida prohibited people from working as navigators without first clearing the state's regulatory hurdles, including passing a criminal background check.\n\nAnd Tallahassee's answer was mocked by the likes of Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, who ridiculed the idea that navigators would be out to steal the identities of uninsured poor people.\n\nSome conservative opinion-makers and groups have raised the issue that a navigator organizer in New Orleans had worked for ACORN, the community group that had endorsed President Barack Obama and became a lightning rod of conservative criticism during his first term, and that one in New York was an illegal immigrant.\n\nIndividual cases such as these aside, a precedent exists for the navigator program, one linked to a Republican president.\n\nRecently, National Journal reported that the navigator program is based on the Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program, whose ranks are generally easier to join than the navigators.\n\nThe program was created in 1992, during President George H.W. Bush's administration, to help senior citizens in selecting coverage under Medicare.\n\nIt features a cadre of volunteers who provide \u201cfree, unbiased and comprehensive Medicare information and counseling to beneficiaries and caregivers,\u201d said Ashley Marshall, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, which operates the state's Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders, or SHINE, program.\n\nA few ACA critics in Congress recently argued that navigators would violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which prevents doctors and health care workers from releasing someone's medical information.\n\nProponents of the ACA noted that applicants do not supply HIPAA-protected information in the process.\n\nTo become certified, Wilson had to take a 20-hour online certification course and pass 26 separate exams.\n\nThe whole process took about a week, she said.\n\nWilson's role is to be able to explain the health plans \u2014 three of which are offered by Florida Blue and one by Aetna \u2014 without advocating for a specific one. She is barred by law from having contact with the insurers.\n\nWilson added that she had no idea the certification would be as intense as it was.\n\nSo far, she said, none of the people who have come to her for help have raised questions about the privacy of their data, or HIPAA violations or the other issues raised by critics.\n\nThe website's problems have undoubtedly made Wilson's job tougher because it's forced her to repeat the process.\n\nFor instance, Ocala resident Wanda Forbes, who is uninsured, registered such a complaint about the electronic logjam.\n\n\u201cI can't get on it,\u201d Forbes told Wilson during a recent session. \u201cThere are too many people trying to get on.\u201d\n\nAfter Wilson spent several minutes trying unsuccessfully to help her, Forbes left Heart of Florida without finishing her application, although she agreed to come back.\n\nHeather James, the agency's director of patient access, said people have been more successful filing paper applications, which means they don't have to return.\n\nThat, however, can take about as long as it does to wait on the computer, she added, meaning the process can run up to two hours to complete.\n\nHeart of Florida's initial clients, Wilson said, mostly want to know about insurance and seemed pleased by the early results.\n\n\u201cMy job is to make sure people find a health coverage plan that meets their needs and their budgets,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cThey are so happy that we know what we're doing and what we're talking about.\u201d\n\nContact Bill Thompson at 867-4117 or bill.thompson@ocala.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anna Wilson is one of a kind \u2014 literally.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-83E9762E-5085-4EBD-A5A7-3D403E8B0848-pubOS"}, "og": {"site_name": "Ocala.com", "description": "Anna Wilson is one of a kind \u2014 literally.", "title": "'Navigator' helping residents understand new health care law", "url": "http://www.ocala.com/article/20131103/ARTICLES/131109915", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.gainesville.com/global/images/fb/OS.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 160}, "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20131103, "fb": {"admins": 100004135120432, "app_id": 162010827183725}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-131109915-pubOS"}}, "keywords": "OCALA (FL),  Article"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI've been completely overwhelmed by the number of people who don't have health coverage,\u201d she said.\nIndividual cases such as these aside, a precedent exists for the navigator program, one linked to a Republican president.\n\u201cMy job is to make sure people find a health coverage plan that meets their needs and their budgets,\u201d Wilson said.\nRecently, National Journal reported that the navigator program is based on the Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program, whose ranks are generally easier to join than the navigators.\nBefore Heart of Florida, she previously worked for Camelot Community Care in Lake and Sumter counties, locating health care providers for children with mental health issues."}
