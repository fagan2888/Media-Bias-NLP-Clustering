New Mexico State Police have suspended the search for a Colorado man who went missing while reportedly searching for Forrest Fenn's hidden treasure near Santa Fe.

The Santa Fe New Mexican reports Randy Bilyeu, 54, was reported missing last week. On Friday, Santa Fe police found his dog near the Rio Grande about nine miles from where his car was parked on Buckman Road.

Bilyeu's ex-wife told the New Mexican that Bilyeu was looking for Fenn's hidden treasure chest, which is believed to contain around $2 million worth of gold and jewelry. Fenn said the treasure is hidden somewhere in the mountains north of Santa Fe.

Friends also told the New Mexican Bilyeu had purchased a raft to travel along the Rio Grande.

NMSP told KOB Monday that the search and rescue portion of this case has been suspended until there is further evidence that Bilyeu was in the area.

"Search and Rescue has exhausted all resources and have not located any clues to indicate his whereabouts," Sgt. Elizabeth Armijo told KOB.
