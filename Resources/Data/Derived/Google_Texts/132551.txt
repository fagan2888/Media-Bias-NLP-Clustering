A Deputy Sheriff was the first to arrive and was approached by a family member holding the baby.

The Deputy Sheriff immediately began CPR and continued until EMS arrived. Walton Fire Rescue continued CPR while transporting the infant to Healthmark Regional Medical Center. The baby passed away at the hospital.
