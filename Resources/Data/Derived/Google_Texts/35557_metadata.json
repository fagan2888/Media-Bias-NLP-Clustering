(Screengrab)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - Lawmakers and civil rights groups gathered together Thursday urging President Obama to issue an executive order so the nation\u2019s public lands are more inclusive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting here making up a rule and assuming that everybody is going to feel comfortable to come to the woods and go on a hike. But everyone is not going to feel comfortable, everybody hasn\u2019t always been welcome to do that. They don\u2019t know \u2013 maybe they\u2019re not interested in doing that, that\u2019s not how they like to come to the woods,\u201d University of Kentucky geology professor Carolyn Finney said at a press conference in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these kinds of questions that, for me, only get answered by building those relationships - making spaces for those other people to be in the room,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately many families don\u2019t have access to the parks,\u201d Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said. \u201cThey don\u2019t visit the parks and some don\u2019t feel welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to bring those lands \u2013those parks, all our public lands, to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe coalition\u2019s policy statement says among the ways to ensure that parks \u201cactively engage all people\u201d is through taxpayer dollars and government growth.\n\nThey are asking President Obama to issue an executive order emphasizing the need for the Department of Interior and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \"adopt guiding priorities for a more inclusive approach to conservation.\"\n\n\u201cSo concretely we're talking about, the president authorizing an action committee of ombudsmen which will oversee the multiagency implementation process,\u201d Mark Masaoka of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council said.\n\nA National Park sign. (AP Photo)\n\n\u201cOne, create a senior level position in the White House at CEQUA (Council on Environmental Quality) that will help oversee implementation of this from the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther specific things we are seeking are resources. Full-funding for the Historic Preservation Fund, the National Heritage Areas programs, and some of the specific programs for American Indians, Alaskan Natives and Hawaiians,\u201d Masaoka said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Rep.
