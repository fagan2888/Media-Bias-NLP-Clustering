The letter from the bishops suggested that the proposed rule \u201cshould be modified to state expressly\u201d what these prohibitions entail.\n\nThe Sept. 3 letter was signed by Anthony Picarello, associate general secretary and general counsel for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), and Michael Moses, associate general counsel for the conference.\n\nIt was delivered during a public comment period on a new suggested regulation dealing with subsidies to federal employee health-care plans.\n\nCurrently, the federal government is able to make contributions to health-care plans purchased by federal employees, but a long-standing provision \u2014 the Smith Amendment \u2014 states that no federal funding can be used toward plans that cover abortion.\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised over the federal government\u02bcs new proposed rule that would help fund health-care plans for members of Congress and their staff participating in the state health exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, often criticized as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe new rule does not explicitly prohibit these federal employees from receiving the funding if they choose plans that cover abortion. Nor does it mention the Smith Amendment.\n\nIn their letter, the USCCB\u02bcs representatives argued that the Smith Amendment\u2019s prohibitions on abortion funding apply in the current situation.\n\nThey emphasized that the amendment \u201cis not limited to any particular category of plans, but applies to contributions to any plan, regardless of where it is offered or purchased.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Catholic bishops warn a new federal rule could subsidize abortions for congressional\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "The U.S. Catholic bishops warn a new federal rule could subsidize abortions for congressional members and staff joining the new state hea...", "title": "Will Taxpayer Dollars Fund Congressional Abortions?", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/will-taxpayer-dollars-fund-congressional-abortions/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/USCCBweb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/will-taxpayer-dollars-fund-congressional-abortions/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/USCCBweb.jpg", "description": "The U.S. Catholic bishops warn a new federal rule could subsidize abortions for congressional members and staff joining the new state hea...", "card": "summary", "title": "Will Taxpayer Dollars Fund Congressional Abortions?"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register,", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "In their letter, the USCCB\u02bcs representatives argued that the Smith Amendment\u2019s prohibitions on abortion funding apply in the current situation.\nIt was delivered during a public comment period on a new suggested regulation dealing with subsidies to federal employee health-care plans.\nThe letter from the bishops suggested that the proposed rule \u201cshould be modified to state expressly\u201d what these prohibitions entail.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Catholic bishops have expressed alarm that a proposed government regulation fails to make clear that laws banning federal funding of abortion will be respected in congressional health-care plans.\nExisting laws require that no federal funds be used to purchase health-care plans that cover abortions for congressional members or staff, except in the cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother, the letter noted."}
