YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A top aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was shot in the head and critically injured by a stray bullet during a spate of violence that erupted on Monday before the West Indian Day parade in Brooklyn, police said.

Carey Gabay, 43, the first deputy counsel at Empire State Development, the state's chief economic development agency, was struck by gunfire at 3:41 a.m. at 1680 Bedford Avenue, not far from the parade route.

"This tragic shooting - this one by another seemingly random bullet - is the latest heartbreaking reminder that the crime of gun violence must stop," said Cuomo, who oversaw passage of the state's sweeping gun control laws.
