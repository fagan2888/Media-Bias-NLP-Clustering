Our most important health insurance program celebrated its 50th birthday in July, and two political and policy visions for Medicare\u2019s future are competing for supremacy in Washington. The winning direction will have important consequences for retirees in the decades ahead.\n\nThe question on the table is how to best pay for health care for our aging population. In 2050, the 65-and-older population will reach 83.7 million \u2014 almost double what it was in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nTotal Medicare spending is projected to rise from $649 billion in 2015 to $1.2 trillion in 2024. Much of that increase stems from our aging population, but per capita spending also is expected to quicken \u2014 the pace will be 4.1 percent from 2014 through 2024 compared with 1 percent from 2010 to 2014.\n\nThe forecast has prompted an array of proposals for change. Conservatives have proposed higher eligibility ages and a shift away from the current defined-benefit structure to a defined-contribution approach \u2014 better known as vouchers. Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush told an audience recently that we should \u201cphase out\u201d Medicare in favor of something like a voucher plan.\n\nMeanwhile, liberals advocate controlling Medicare\u2019s costs through reform of care delivery systems, cutting the cost of prescription drugs, emphasizing prevention and eliminating waste in programs like Medicare Advantage.\n\nMy perspective: We have a health care spending problem, not a Medicare problem. Medicare costs simply reflect the overall cost of our healthcare system \u2014 and the system is inefficient.\n\nThe United States spent 16.9 percent of its gross domestic product on health care in 2012, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That was far ahead of the 9.3 percent average for all OECD member nations. What\u2019s more, we get inferior results for our higher spending \u2014 our longevity is rising more slowly than in other major OECD nations. American life expectancy was 78.7 years in 2011, OECD reports, a bit behind the OECD average of 80.1 and well behind leaders like Switzerland (82.8), Japan (82.7) and Italy (82.4).\n\nClearly, there is a great deal of inefficiency that can be wrung out of the health care system. That\u2019s why restructuring benefits and shifting more costs to seniors isn\u2019t the first place to go with Medicare reform, although that\u2019s been one of the clear trends.\n\nA case in point: passage this year of the so-called \u201cdoc-fix\u201d legislation, which resolved a long-standing problem with rates used to reimburse physicians for care. The legislation was expensive, and one way that it raises money is by increasing the high-income surcharges that some seniors already pay for Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) if their modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain levels (surcharges start at $85,000 of MAGI for single filers). These surcharges were first levied in 2007 as a result of reforms passed in 2003, and they were increased to help pay for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe doc fix is just the tip of the cost-shifting iceberg. Republicans in Congress have tried repeatedly to advance a new premium-support model for Medicare that would replace the current set of defined benefits with a set amount of cash that beneficiaries could use to shop for private health insurance or a variation on traditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n\nThese Medicare vouchers would raise premiums for seniors in traditional Medicare by 50 percent in 2020 over current projections, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Other proposals have called for raising Medicare\u2019s eligibility age from 65 to 67. Again, more cost-shifting \u2014 either to employer health plans when workers delay retirement, Affordable Care Act exchanges or to Medicaid in the case of low-income seniors.\n\nSmarter approaches are available. The Affordable Care Act made a good start at reforming care delivery, aiming to improve coordination among providers, patients and caregivers. Those initiatives should be accelerated. There are also big savings to be had by restoring the federal government\u2019s ability to negotiate lower drug prices for beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 somewhere between $134 billion to $141 billion over 10 years, according to the Medicare Rights Center.\n\nBetter preventive care also could save Medicare billions. Just 10 percent of the Medicare population \u2014 the sickest enrollees \u2014 account for 58 percent of spending, according to KFF. Those numbers could be changed dramatically by making sure Americans receive good preventive care in the years leading up to Medicare eligibility, argues Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York.\n\nFried is a gerontologist who specializes in healthy aging. In a new article focused on Medicare\u2019s next 50 years, she argues that we should actually reduce the age of eligibility for Medicare\u2019s preventive health services. Her argument: Age 50 to 65 is the period of greatest risk of disability due to cancer, heart disease and stroke, obesity and diabetes \u2014 and with better preventive health care, much of it could be avoided.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicare is having a midlife identity crisis.
