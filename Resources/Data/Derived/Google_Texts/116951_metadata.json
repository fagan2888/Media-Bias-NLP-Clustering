We win when we have an ideas contest. We lose when we have a personality contest,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t fall into the progressives\u2019 trap of acting like angry reactionaries. The left would love nothing more than for a fragmented conservative movement to stand in a circular firing squad, so the progressives can win by default.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo quote William Wallace in \u2018Braveheart,\u2019 we have to unite the clans. We have to unite conservatives around a bold, pro-growth agenda that will get America back on track\u2014and then take our agenda to the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fall into the progressives\u2019 trap of acting like angry reactionaries,\u201d says @SpeakerRyan.\n\nIndeed, Ryan, continuing his determined outreach effort to conservative groups, promised that House Republicans would lead the charge this year to present alternative ideas to the American public on issues such as health care, welfare, entitlements, and taxes.\n\nBut he warned that conservatives should be wary of playing into what he sees as the White House\u2019s strategy to define Republicans as an \u201copposition party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis president is struggling to remain relevant in an election year when he\u2019s not on the ballot,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe is going to do all he can to elect another progressive by distracting the American people. So he\u2019s going to try to get us talking about guns or some other hot-button issue and not about his failures on ISIS or the economy or national security. He\u2019s going to try to knock us off our game.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take the bait,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cDon\u2019t fight over tactics. And don\u2019t impugn people\u2019s motives. It\u2019s fine if you disagree. And there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s rotten in Washington. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But we can\u2019t let how you vote on an amendment to an appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative. Because it\u2019s setting our sights too low. Frankly, that\u2019s letting the president define us. That\u2019s what he wants us to do. That\u2019s defining ourselves as an opposition party, instead of a proposition party.\u201d\n\nBefore the House can propose big reforms this year, Ryan has used the beginning part of his speakership to show what Republicans are not for.\n\nHouse Republicans failed Tuesday to override a veto from Obama striking down a bill that repealed key provisions of his signature health care law, Obamacare.\n\nWhile Ryan said he was proud to finally get a repeal bill to Obama\u2019s desk, he says the end result shows the limits of what Republicans can accomplish with a Democratic president. Ryan believes that conservatives need to be more transparent about what they can and cannot do.\n\n\u201cWe have to be straight with each other, and more importantly, we have to be straight with the American people,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t promise that we can repeal Obamacare when a guy with the last name Obama is president. All that does is set us up for failure, disappointment, and recriminations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen voices in the conservative movement demand things that they know we can\u2019t achieve with a Democrat in the White House, all that does is depress our base and in turn help Democrats stay in the White House,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to set us up for failure. I want to set us up for success.\u201d\n\nRyan already faces an immediate challenge in uniting the party: the budget.\n\nRyan has promised to bring the House back to \u201cregular order\u201d this year, when it attempts to pass 12 individual spending bills rather than combining the measures into a giant package called an omnibus, as Congress has been doing lately. Ryan said Wednesday he hopes to get the appropriations bills done by July to avoid the last-second shutdown threat that normally leads to an omnibus.\n\nThe mission is easier said than done.\n\nConservatives and some rank-and-file Republicans are signaling they won\u2019t support the spending plan if it is consistent with an agreement GOP leaders reached with Obama and Democrats last year as part of the omnibus budget deal.\n\nThe two-year agreement, negotiated by former House Speaker John Boehner, raises the 2017 budget caps by $30 billion. Ryan is concerned about rising deficits, too, he said.\n\nHe argues that the best way to control the debt is not through the appropriations process, but through reforming entitlement programs.\n\n\u201cI believe we are one presidency away from losing control of the situation,\u201d Ryan said in response to a question from a member of the audience. \u201cIf a progressive gets the White House, then we won\u2019t have the kind of entitlement reform we need to get our debt under control and to get our budget balanced. If we don\u2019t fix our entitlement programs, which are the real drivers of our debt, then we will have a real crisis on our hands. We can fix our budget mess on our own terms in a smart, reform-based, prospective way.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all part of Ryan\u2019s message to focus on long-lasting big ideas and not to get caught up in self-inflicted feuds in the short-term.\n\nIt\u2019s something Ryan is willing to risk it all for, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with losing my seat in 2018 if I\u2019ve done what\u2019s good and right for America,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis is the attitude we need to have.\u201d\n\nUpdate: In a panel later Wednesday, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, pushed back against Ryan\u2019s comments. \u201cI understand what Paul is saying, or trying to say, but let\u2019s look at the reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the Republican Party on one hand saying be realistic, which I think we should be, but don\u2019t engage in fights that you can\u2019t win. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, is telling their voters that \u2018we\u2019re going to do the things that you want us to do.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOur leadership is telling us to be realistic and it\u2019s through realism that we\u2019re going to win national elections,\u201d Labrador added. \u201cWell, guess what, we were realistic in 2012 and with all due respect, not only did we lose the presidency, we lost the Senate.\u201d More details in The Daily Signal\u2019s Natalie Johnson\u2019s report here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan urges conservatives to unite with a \u201cbold, pro-growth agenda\u201d but to be realistic in what the GOP can achieve under President Obama.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan urges conservatives to unite with a \u201cbold, pro-growth agenda\u201d but to be realistic in what the GOP can achieve under President Obama.", "title": "Paul Ryan Says Conservatives Must Avoid Progressive \u2018Trap\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RyanHA.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T21:35:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UKjcg7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan urges conservatives to unite with a \u201cbold, pro-growth agenda\u201d but to be realistic in what the GOP can achieve under President Obama.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RyanHA.jpg"}, "title": "Paul Ryan Says Conservatives Must Avoid Progressive \u2018Trap\u2019", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2016-02-03T11:15:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T21:35:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Obamacare, budget deal, John Boehner, welfare, entitlement reform, Heritage Action, 2016, speaker of the House, Obama, ISIS"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans failed Tuesday to override a veto from Obama striking down a bill that repealed key provisions of his signature health care law, Obamacare.\n\u201cIf a progressive gets the White House, then we won\u2019t have the kind of entitlement reform we need to get our debt under control and to get our budget balanced.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what House Republicans are going to do.\nRyan believes that conservatives need to be more transparent about what they can and cannot do.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with losing my seat in 2018 if I\u2019ve done what\u2019s good and right for America,\u201d Ryan said."}
