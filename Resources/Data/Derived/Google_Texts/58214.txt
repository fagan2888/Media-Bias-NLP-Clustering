A three-year-old girl has died as a result of a single-vehicle crash in rural Milton Saturday afternoon.

The accident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when the 36-year-old driver of an SUV, travelling northbound on Esquesing Line, south of No. 5 Sideroad, lost control of the vehicle, according to Halton police.

The SUV went into a ditch and struck a hydro pole, police said.

The woman, a resident of Milton, had her three-year-old daughter in the vehicle at the time of the accident, according to investigators.

ORNGE, Ontario's air ambulance service, was called and remained on standby as Halton Paramedic Services transported the victims to hospital. The girl was found with no vital signs at the scene and both victims were reported to have sustained head injuries.

According to Deputy Chief Joel Smith of the Halton Paramedic Services, one female sustained life-threatening injuries while the other had non-life-threatening injuries.

"The young girl was rushed to Milton District Hospital, but has sadly succumbed to her injuries sustained in the collision," said Det. Constable Chris Heffernen of the Halton Regional Police Collision Reconstruction Unit.

The woman was treated at hospital for minor injuries.

"Blowing snow covered Esquesing Line at the area of the collision, and appears to be a contributing factor to the collision. The occupants in the vehicle were both wearing their appropriate safety restraints," said Heffernen.

At the request of the family, police will not be releasing the girl's or her mother's names.

The Collision Reconstruction Unit is leading the investigation and Esquesing Line was closed for approximately four hours during the investigation. Union Gas responded to repair a gas line that was damaged during the collision.

Any witnesses are asked to call Heffernen or Oliver Caves of the Collision Reconstruction Unit at 905-825-4747, ext. 5065.
