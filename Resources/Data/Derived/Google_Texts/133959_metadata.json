Alem\u00e1n predicted the nation\u2019s gross domestic product will grow 2.4 percent this year and 3 percent in 2015, after an estimated 1.7 percent growth rate last year.\n\nLee Reynis, director of the University of New Mexico Bureau of Business and Economic Research, said New Mexico employment should grow around 1.4 percent per year through 2018. The state\u2019s employment grew only 0.2 percent in the 12-month period ending Nov. 30, the latest period for which Department of Workforce Solutions data are available.\n\nReynis forecast personal income will grow in New Mexico 4.3 percent this year, compared to a 1.8 percent increase in 2013. Some of that will be the result of increased spending on Medicaid funded by the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to find evidence of improvement,\u201d Reynis said. Most employment sectors are adding jobs. Nearly all sectors were losing jobs in 2010. That same year 27 New Mexico counties were losing jobs. Last year 10 counties lost jobs.\n\nBoth economists said local, state and federal government policies have slowed economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe biggest difference between this recovery and previous recoveries is that growth was much stronger,\u201d Alem\u00e1n said. Recoveries generally mean 3.5 percent growth, rather than 2 percent growth, and employment usually grows by 200,000 jobs a month instead of the 180,000 jobs the economy is generating in this recovery.\n\nThe difference is in government hiring, mostly at the state and local level.\n\n\u201cThe government destroyed 1.5 million jobs\u201d and the private sector isn\u2019t making up the difference, Alem\u00e1n said.\n\nFederal civilian and military employment constituted almost 14 percent of jobs in New Mexico before the recession. Today that segment is about 5 percent of employment, Reynis said.\n\nConcerns about federal deficits are misplaced, Alem\u00e1n said. Total federal government expenditures are now about 20 percent of gross domestic product, which is the average for 60 years, he said. The $800 billion federal deficit that Barack Obama inherited when he took office in 2009 is now down to $615 billion.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we have to do is grow,\u201d Alem\u00e1n said. \u201cOnce growth comes back strong, the deficit takes care of itself.\u201d\n\nA real concern for both economists is the labor participation rate, which reflects the number of workers who have retired or who have given up looking for work. Nationally, about 60 percent of the work force is participating, compared to almost 70 percent before the recession.\n\nA big reason is the number of baby boomers who are retiring, about 10,000 every business day. Alem\u00e1n said younger workers often do not have the skills and training to replace those older workers, which could damage labor productivity and, therefore, GDP growth in the future.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s unemployment rate would be 14.1 percent instead of the official 6.7 percent if workers who have given up looking for jobs and people involuntarily working part time were counted, Reynis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very severe problem of joblessness in New Mexico,\u201d she said.\n\nOne result is slowing population growth. New Mexico\u2019s population grew 1.4 percent in 2009 and slowed to 0.1 percent in 2013 because more people are moving out of the state than moving in, Reynis said.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s recovery is also jeopardized by the state\u2019s low wages, disparity in employment among ethnic groups, a declining middle class and a work force that is not equipped to handle 21st-century jobs, Reynis said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 New Mexico employment predicted to grow at roughly 1.4 percent a year through 2018, according to state economist", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Winthrop Quigley | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/337697/us-growth-to-be-24-percent-expert-tells-abq-audience.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/b01_jd_17jan_reynis.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "New Mexico employment predicted to grow at roughly 1.4 percent a year through 2018, according to state economist", "title": "Updated: Limited job growth for ABQ/NM but strong income growth"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Today that segment is about 5 percent of employment, Reynis said.\n\u201cThe biggest thing we have to do is grow,\u201d Alem\u00e1n said.\nReynis forecast personal income will grow in New Mexico 4.3 percent this year, compared to a 1.8 percent increase in 2013.\nLee Reynis, director of the University of New Mexico Bureau of Business and Economic Research, said New Mexico employment should grow around 1.4 percent per year through 2018.\n\u201cThe biggest difference between this recovery and previous recoveries is that growth was much stronger,\u201d Alem\u00e1n said."}
