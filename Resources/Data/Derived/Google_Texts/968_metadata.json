Working part time and going to school, his estimated income might be around $11,000 this year. He has no dependents and is moving in with us to save on expenses. He needs healthcare. He does smoke. What options does he have for healthcare?\n\nAnswer: Based on a quick calculation of your son\u2019s income, he unfortunately might fall into what some have dubbed the \u201ccoverage crater.\u201d\n\nEssentially, the term \u201ccoverage crater\u201d refers to people who make \u201ctoo much\u201d to qualify for Medicaid and \u201ctoo little\u201d to qualify for a subsidy to pay for health insurance. Let\u2019s expand on that.\n\nOriginally under the Affordable Care Act, states had to expand their Medicaid programs, or risk getting their Medicaid funding pulled by the federal government. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government essentially couldn\u2019t punish states that didn\u2019t expand their Medicaid programs by taking away their Medicaid money. Expanding Medicaid in Oklahoma would have involved changing eligibility requirements, and more people could have qualified for Medicaid.\n\nOklahoma is among about 20 states that aren\u2019t expanding Medicaid. Because Oklahoma isn\u2019t expanding Medicaid, there\u2019s a group of people \u2014 your son included \u2014 who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or a subsidy.\n\nThat\u2019s because the subsidies start for folks who make 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nYour son, based on his income of $11,000, is at 96 percent of the federal poverty level. He\u2019s not quite to 100 percent of the federal poverty level and therefore likely doesn\u2019t qualify for a subsidy. And he likely doesn\u2019t qualify for Oklahoma\u2019s current Medicaid program. Hence \u2014 the coverage crater.\n\nThis Oklahoma Watch story gives estimates, based on Census data, of just how many people fall into the coverage crater in Oklahoma:\n\nWhen the government starts helping low-wage workers pay for health insurance next year, 6,704 Oklahoma cooks will be left empty-handed.\n\nSo will 6,154 cashiers, 4,572 waiters, 4,207 housekeepers and 3,870 retail salespeople, an Oklahoma Watch data analysis shows.\n\nThey are among 109,227 uninsured Oklahoma workers whose annual incomes fall below the federal poverty level, making them ineligible for health-insurance tax credits that take effect in January.\n\nHowever, if your son made $490 more ($11,490), according to the Kaiser subsidy calculator, he could potentially qualify for a subsidy of $2,427. The cost for a silver plan, one of the four plans available through the health insurance marketplace, would be an estimated $2,657. So he would be looking at paying $230 for the year, or about $20/month for coverage.\n\nSome parents and adult children likely have questions about how to calculate household income when signing up for the marketplace. I have asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services folks about how household income is defined.\n\nI was told that if an adult child isn\u2019t counted as a dependent of his/her parents, the adult child does not include their income as household income when signing up for a plan in the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, this article from NPR has a lot of answers to questions that young people might have about the Affordable Care Act, including information on insurance coverage known as a catastrophic plan, which are available for people up to age 30:\n\nPeople up to age 30 will have the option of buying a catastrophic plan that will cover only minimal services until they meet a deductible of roughly $6,400. The premium is usually much lower than the other plans. After the deductible is met, the plan covers the 10 essential health benefits \u2014 a kind of \u201csafety net\u201d coverage in case you have an accident or serious illness, according to the Healthcare.gov website. Catastrophic plans usually do not provide coverage for services like prescription drugs or shots.
