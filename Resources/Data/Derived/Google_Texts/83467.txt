TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A gigantic, secret bunker that Albania’s communist regime built underground decades ago to survive a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union or the United States has been opened to the public for the first time.

On Saturday, Prime Minister Edi Rama led visitors, including Western ambassadors, on a tour of the never used 106-room, five-story bunker.

“We have opened today a thesaurus of the collective memory that presents thousands of pieces of the sad events and life” under communism,” Rama said, speaking at the bunker’s 200-seat hall, which was to serve as the meeting place for parliament.

The bunker was built by the late communist dictator Enver Hoxha near Tirana, the capital, in the 1970s to prepare for a possible nuclear attack by “American imperialism or Soviet social-imperialism.” Hoxha, whose regime built up to 700,000 bunkers of different sizes and tunnels all around the country, died in 1985. The communist regime was toppled in 1990.
