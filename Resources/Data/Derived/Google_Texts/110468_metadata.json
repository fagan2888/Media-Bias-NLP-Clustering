The tongue-in-cheek spot, entitled \u201cSqueal\u201d, makes the analogy between Ernst\u2019s experience castrating hogs while growing up on an Iowa farm to her goals of \u201ccutting pork\u201d in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe 30-second ad is running on cable TV in the Des Moines market, with plans to expand to other areas in the coming weeks, Ernst spokesman Derek Flowers told TheIowaRepublican.com.\n\nHere is a look at the commericial:\n\nThe full script of the ad:\n\nJoni: I\u2019m Joni Ernst. I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm. So when I get to Washington, I\u2019ll know how to cut pork. VO: Joni Ernst. Mother, soldier, conservative. Joni: My parents taught us to live within our means. It\u2019s time to force Washington to do the same; to cut wasteful spending, repeal Obamacare, and balance the budget. I\u2019m Joni Ernst and I approve this message because Washington\u2019s full of big spenders. Let\u2019s make \u2019em squeal.\n\nErnst says she will take on big spenders, like Democrat U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Braley, in Washington.\n\n\u201cAs a mother, I want to make sure that we pass along to my daughter and her generation the same great nation we inherited. To do that, we will have to get Washington to stop borrowing .40 cents out of every dollar our government spends, and repeal and replace Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare with common-sense, market-driven solutions,\u201d said Ernst.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c15\"", "article_summary": "Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst launched her first television ad of the campaign.\nHere is a look at the commericial:The full script of the ad:Joni: I\u2019m Joni Ernst.\nVO: Joni Ernst.\nI\u2019m Joni Ernst and I approve this message because Washington\u2019s full of big spenders.\nIt\u2019s time to force Washington to do the same; to cut wasteful spending, repeal Obamacare, and balance the budget."}
