Following Norway, seven other European countries fill out the top 10 as well as New Zealand (5th) and Colombia (6th).\n\n89 of the 105 countries indexed have renewable energy support policies in place in the form of regulation, economic incentives or public financing. The report also reveals that the average total primary energy supply from alternative or renewable energy sources is 36%.\n\nRoberto Bocca, Senior Director, Head of Energy Industries, World Economic Forum, comments: \u201cEnergy decisions can be simplified through a common understanding of the trade-offs they require. With clear objectives to achieve a balanced energy system that is environmentally sustainable, drives the economy and is secure, decision-makers should facilitate quicker and more cost effective transitions. The index is a tool to help in this process.\u201d\n\nWhile Brazil leads the BRIC economies (21st) followed by the Russian Federation (27th) and South Africa (59), the Index shows some rapidly growing and developed countries underperform due to soaring energy demand which casues reconsideration of renewables and CO2 reduction commitments. With the US sitting in 55th place in the index, India 62nd and China 74th, the report calls for bold action to address the lack of dwindling places of these high-income countries.\n\nArthur Hanna, Managing Director, Energy Industry, Accenture, and a Member of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Agenda Council on New Energy Architecture explained that the Index could be utilized to address such deficit from emerging economies: \u201cThe scale and complexity of the global energy industry demands a country-by-country approach to managing change. The Energy Architecture Performance Index helps nations take stock of their energy architecture challenges and identify specific focus areas coupled with best-in-class examples to use when managing their transition.\u201d\n\nMap of top performers\n\nRead the report\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: EarthTechling is proud to repost this article courtesy of The Climate Group.
