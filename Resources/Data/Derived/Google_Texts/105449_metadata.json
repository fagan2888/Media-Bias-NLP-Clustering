What\u2019s perhaps most shocking about Rubio\u2019s decision to vote for such sweeping trade legislation his staff, by not answering whether he read it therefore choosing to give off the public impression he didn\u2019t, suggests he knows nothing about, is that Rubio decided to make Obamatrade a foreign policy centerpiece of his presidential campaign. He touted his support for it and why he thinks such a deal would help America in a speech last month to the Council on Foreign Relations. That decision seems to be coming back to bite him more and more, just like his support for the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill last Congress still hurts him.\n\nThe fact that this is a \"secret\" bill makes it more suspect. Have you ever in your life heard of secret bills? The only ones I've heard about are for the intelligence budget. Never before has so-called \"trade legislation\" been labeled as secret. That convinces me that there must be some nefarious things in it. And the fact that Rubio has voted for it, apparently without even reading it, shows me he's another go-along, get-along Senator, and once again I have to ask the question of why he's suited to be the Republican nominee? Does being handsome and Hispanic make up for everything else?\n\nOrdinarily, there's nothing wrong with fast-track authority for trade negotiations. It's how trade deals get done, to prevent them from being bogged down with amendments. But with this lawless president, fast-track authority could be used to push provisions relating to anything from global warming to amnesty for illegal aliens, and a simple majority of Democrats and McConnell Republicans will be able to push it into law.
