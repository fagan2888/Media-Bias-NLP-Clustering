Tucson News Now had also learned that woman had other health problems in addition to West Nile.\n\nHealth officials urge homeowners to get rid of standing water which can attract mosquitoes. The insects can carry West Nile, but the virus is deadly for certain groups of people.\n\n\u201cRemember West Nile virus in most cases is not going to kill you. It's only when folks are older, only when folks are immune suppressed, only when folks have other complicating medical issues that can be potentially deadly,\u201d says Health Department Director, Dr. Francisco Garcia.\n\nTo submit a standing water complaint, call (520) 243-7999.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
