Jay Rodne, R-North Bend, told the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got mentally ill people who do not realize they\u2019re mentally ill, and under our warped version of civil liberties, we are allowing them to walk the streets.\u201d\n\nAt the core of the issue is severe overcrowding at the state\u2019s two psychiatric hospitals, often attributed to a tight budget. The lack of beds and qualified staff has forced many patients to wait days, even months, for treatment \u2013 often handcuffed to gurneys in chaotic emergency-ward hallways.\n\nState and federal judges call the practice psychiatric \u201cboarding\u201d; mental health advocates call it \u201cwarehousing.\u201d The state is under orders to stop it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing humane about letting our citizens suffer under a disability,\u201d said Rodne, the prime sponsor of a bill to expand the criteria for involuntary mental health treatment. \u201cWe have diverted a lot of our chronically mentally ill folks to our jails in Washington state.\u201d\n\nThe committee heard several bills Wednesday that aim to fix small pieces of the system. Rodne\u2019s would add \u201cpersistent or acute disability\u201d to the list of reasons a court may commit someone for involuntary care, allowing a person to be committed for any illness that might cause mental, emotional or physical harm.\n\nRodne also supports \u201cJoel\u2019s Law,\u201d a bill that would enable friends and family to petition courts for a person\u2019s involuntary commitment. It\u2019s named after Joel Reuter, a Seattle man with severe bipolar disorder who was shot and killed in 2013 during a standoff with police. Reuter\u2019s parents had tried for weeks to have him committed.\n\nCurrently, someone who poses a \u201clikelihood of serious harm\u201d can be committed for up to 72 hours after an initial evaluation. After that, psychiatrists can request commitments of up to 14 days, then up to 90 days, then up to 180 days.\n\nRep. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, wants to allow commitments of up to a year for patients in severe cases. Her bill would require judges to consider more of a patient\u2019s mental health background and allow outpatient programs as a less restrictive treatment option.\n\nSupporters of each bill said people should receive treatment before their conditions worsen to tragic ends.\n\nThe opposition\n\nBut some legal advocates for the mentally ill warned the bills could have huge up-front costs to the state. Others, including patients, said increasing involuntary commitments would do more harm than good.\n\nThe state doesn\u2019t need more grounds for involuntary commitments, said Mike De Felice, of the Washington Defender Association. \u201cNew grounds would simply compound existing problems and spread thin existing resources, which would result in reduced quality of care.\u201d\n\nDe Felice said the state should stress outpatient treatment, which could help cut demand for inpatient beds. But he opposed Orwall\u2019s bill, saying hospitals and treatment facilities in the state are overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly an impression that it\u2019s hard to get somebody committed in Washington state, and that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral mental health advocates urged lawmakers to consider the system as a whole when voting on the bills. Shankar Narayan, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the state shouldn\u2019t force the mentally ill into a system that doesn\u2019t provide adequate treatment.\n\nPaying for it all\n\nSen. Steve O\u2019Ban, R-Pierce County, wants to use 22 percent of the state\u2019s marijuana tax revenue for inpatient mental health treatment, including long-term housing programs.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act took effect and Medicaid was expanded in Washington, low-income residents could receive subsidized health care through the Basic Health Plan. Initiative 502, which legalized recreational marijuana statewide, required that a portion of the taxes on that drug be deposited into that account.\n\nNow that the Basic Health Plan is gone, those funds are in limbo. The state projected that pot taxes would provide $96.5 million over the next two years and another $173.5 million through 2019. In comparison, the Legislature set aside about $80 million in the 2013-15 budget for the state\u2019s mental health system.\n\nO\u2019Ban\u2019s bill was sent to the Senate this week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OLYMPIA \u2013 As they try to address multiple court orders on Washington\u2019s mental health system, legislators struggle with a conundrum: How can the state care for more people with mental illness when there\u2019s not enough room or money to treat existing patients? \u201cWe\u2019ve got a broken mental health system \u2013 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Rep.
