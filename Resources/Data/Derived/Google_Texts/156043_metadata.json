Specialty drug spending was 17 percent higher in the individual market, which includes plans sold in the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces, than it was in the employer market in 2014, the report found.\n\nThe $87 billion spent in 2012 on specialty drugs could quadruple by 2020, reaching about $350 billion, the report said.\n\nWhile the BCBSA pointed to possibly unsustainable price increases, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) shot back that the analysis was \u201canother misleading report on medicine spending that cherry-picks data\u201d to justify discriminatory treatment against patients with chronic diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Health plans often only cover drugs to treat those diseases by requiring the highest level of cost-sharing by patients, PhRMA said.\n\nOther health-care experts caution that it\u2019s an over-simplification to chalk all high drug prices up as being excessive. Dana Goldman, director of the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, helped author research finding that high prices for some drugs developed in recent years to treat cancer, HIV and hepatitis C may be warranted because they save money over the long run.\n\nAnd Ted Okon, executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance, said that research shows that while the price of specialty drugs \u201cis a problem,\u201d the cost of hospital inpatient admissions and surgeries has grown less rapidly than drug prices for cancer treatments, an indication of the new drugs\u2019 effectiveness.\n\n\u201cWe really need to find ways to link price to value,\u201d Okon said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/breakthrough-drug-prices-b57982072837/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "A Blue Cross Blue Shield Association report highlights rapidly rising prices for specialty drugs used to treat cancer, HIV and hepatitis, but some health-care experts say the high prices may be...", "title": "Breakthrough Drug Prices Are Blowing Insurers\u2019 Budgets, But Some Say The Drugs Are Worth It"}, "csrf-token": "9XOjp4Ljn3SvnqrRvFJ3FBfiqsHCaNmn03GkOYZaFLe2UiIacSJhoFd04xzUOQ6CY5Ymb0SjB6gL63g2qF31Ly2UB2d_adntmLKGJYACaKg1:9LoMmOuydUlTR3WcxYFjHbpcn_jdeQTtHypF0aykuEnMCAwxYtqudliDUCIghvuHI0dJ6lqpzJUqFXcyJC58z83E2TLej6hi1GeRG_XK6ag1", "description": "A Blue Cross Blue Shield Association report highlights rapidly rising prices for specialty drugs used to treat cancer, HIV and hepatitis, but some health-care experts say the high prices may be", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Other health-care experts caution that it\u2019s an over-simplification to chalk all high drug prices up as being excessive.\nThe $87 billion spent in 2012 on specialty drugs could quadruple by 2020, reaching about $350 billion, the report said.\nThe Blue Cross Blue Shield Association recently highlighted the issue in a report finding that spending on specialty drugs increased 26 percent - $87 per member \u2013 between 2013 and 2014.\nHealth plans often only cover drugs to treat those diseases by requiring the highest level of cost-sharing by patients, PhRMA said.\nSpecialty drug spending was 17 percent higher in the individual market, which includes plans sold in the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces, than it was in the employer market in 2014, the report found."}
