The president will also request $35 million in grants to assist states working toward creating such programs.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "The president wants to give federal employees up to six weeks of paid leave after a birth or adoption, a benefit he wants to extend to all workers.", "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The president wants to give federal employees up to six weeks of paid leave after a birth or adoption, a benefit he wants to extend to all workers.", "title": "Obama plans to push paid family and sick leave", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/obama-plans-to-push-paid-family-and-sick-leave-for-workers.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/01/14/102338584-barack-obama.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president wants to give federal employees up to six weeks of paid leave after a birth or adoption, a benefit he wants to extend to all workers.", "title": "Obama Plans to Push Paid Family and Sick Leave for Workers", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/obama-plans-to-push-paid-family-and-sick-leave-for-workers.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/01/14/102338584-barack-obama.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Politics, US: News, Politics, Barack Obama, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-01-15T05:39:04-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T05:39:04-0500", "tag": "Barack Obama"}, "pageNodeId": 102340223, "news_keywords": "President Obama, paid sick leave, paid family leave"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc164\"", "article_summary": "But employers are not required to pay their workers during leave, and often do not.\nThe plan, which Mr. Obama will include in his budget, would provide $2.2 billion in mandatory funding \u2014 not subject to annual congressional appropriations \u2014 to reimburse states that initiate paid leave programs, the White House said.\nMore than half of American workers are eligible for parental or sick leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows them to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off without losing their jobs.\nThe president will also request $35 million in grants to assist states working toward creating such programs.\n\"The president intends to ensure that the federal government is a model employer,\" Ms. Jarrett wrote."}
