A steady decline in gas prices, cheap financing for purchases and markdowns have helped accelerate the increase in sales, leading to a demand for more vehicles and growth in manufacturing.\n\nRecent transactions in the auto sector include Illinois Tool Works Inc.\u2019s (NYSE: ITW) $450 million acquisition of ZF Friedrichshafen AG\u2019s engineered fasteners and components business and Harman International Industries Inc.\u2019s (NYSE: HAR) purchase of automotive cybersecurity company TowerSec. Both deals were announced in January.\n\nJefferies LLC and Nomura Securities served as financial advisers to PGW for the deal; legal counsel for the company is Ropes and Gray. K&L Gates acted as legal counsel to LKQ.\n\nWith this transaction, PPG will divest its 40 percent minority ownership interest in PGW, which the company has held since 2008. Pittsburgh-based PPG won Mergers & Acquisitions Strategic Buyer of the Year award for 2014, when it purchased four middle-market targets.
