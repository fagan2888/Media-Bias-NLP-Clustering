The primary sponsor of the bill, Tommy Wells, says the bill is a matter of \u201csocial justice,\u201d and that he\u2019s not concerned with the legal status of marijuana insomuch as he\u2019s concerned about the 6,000 people, predominantly African-American, that are arrested for \u201cusing small amounts of marijuana.\u201d\n\nActivists are pressing for full legalization, pointing out that decriminalization will just cause the black market to expand even more, since everything that makes the possession of a small amount of marijuana possible remains illegal. But Councilman Wells says he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve growing marijuana in your home is really an issue of social justice\u2026 I\u2019m not sure that our city is ready to do that.\u201d Wells is right, growing marijuana in your own home is not a \u201csocial justice\u201d issue. It\u2019s an issue of rights and freedoms.\n\nWells\u2019 frankly half-assed attempt at liberalizing the legal regime surrounding marijuana isn\u2019t likely to even meet the narrow goal Wells set out. 91 percent of marijuana arrests in DC may be of black residents, but plenty of Beltway professionals use pot too. They just don\u2019t need decriminalization to stay off the radar of local law enforcement, which largely targets black residents in its drug war efforts (similar tactics are seen in New York City, where whites are more likely to use marijuana but non-whites are more likely to be arrested for it). Wells\u2019 effort isn\u2019t going to make it less likely local law enforcement continues to target predominantly young black men for possession of marijuana. As criminal attorney Paul Zukerberg pointed out to NBC Washington: \u201cAny amount of marijuana, even a roach, a partially burnt marijuana cigarette, is a criminal misdemeanor\u2026 Means you get arrested, your name is entered into the national criminal database, you have to go to court, hire a lawyer, and you face jail time. These are things that are permanently on your record\u2026 when you\u2019re looking to get a job.\u201d\n\nWhile Wells\u2019 bill is expected to pass and become law sometime in 2014, activists are working on a measure that would see DC residents vote on legalization in the November 2014 election. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be harassed anymore,\u201d one activist, Adam Eidinger of DCMJ 2014, told NBC Washington. \u201cPeople want rights.\u201d And whatever pretension to \u201csocial justice\u201d the DC city council may have is no replacement for that.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "What about rights and freedoms?", "title": "DC City Council Wants to Decriminalize Marijuana For \u201cSocial Justice,\u201d Not Interested in Legalizing, May Be on the Ballot Anyway", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/09/05/dc-city-council-wants-to-decriminalize-m", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13784026891525.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The city council in Washington,\nDC is considering a bill, cosponsored by a majority of the council,\nthat would decriminalize the possession of marijuana up to an\nounce, making it a \u201ccivil offense\u201d resulting in a fine, according\nto the \nlocal NBC affiliate.
