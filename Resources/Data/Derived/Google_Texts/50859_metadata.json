Criminal prosecutions have been few, and settlements with large banks, such as B of A and JP Morgan Chase have taken years to materialize.\n\nBut some experts believe DOJ has found a successful strategy that could wind up costing banks and the Wall Street firms that securitized and sold questionable mortgage securities an awful lot of money.\n\nLate Wednesday, news broke that DOJ and Bank of America were close to agreement on a civil settlement that would require the bank to pay as much as $17 billion for its role in the crisis. If the two parties come to an agreement, the eye-popping dollar figure will likely be the one thing people remember about the bank\u2019s dealings with Justice. However, a less-noticed case that actually went to trial could be Bank of America\u2019s real contribution to the history of DOJ\u2019s response to the crisis.\n\nRelated: A Modest Proposal for Eric Holder \u2013 Back Off the Banks\n\nIn a case specific to a set of mortgages underwritten by the former Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America bought in 2008, the bank challenged a Justice Department\u2019s interpretation of the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in its civil suit.\n\nDOJ, in essence, charged that the bank had committed fraud, but because it did so in a civil suit, it was only obliged to prove the charges by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d rather than the reasonable doubt standard normally applied to criminal cases.\n\n\u201cThere is something counterintuitive about making a civil penalty contingent on a criminal violation only proved by the civil standard,\u201d said Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit.\n\nAnother strange element of the case is that FIRREA reads as though it is supposed to apply to cases of fraud committed against a bank \u2013 not fraud by the bank itself. The government has argued that the fraud, while ostensibly committed by the bank, also affected the bank, and that the charge was permissible.\n\nRelated: The Next Financial Crisis Is Brewing Right Now, and Regulators Are Missing It\n\nThe approach has survived the scrutiny of several federal courts, and in recent ruling in the penalty phase of the case related to the former Countrywide\u2019s mortgage practices, Manhattan Federal District Court Judge Jed S. Rakoff ruled that BofA was liable for $1.26 billion in penalties.\n\nThe Countrywide program in question \u2013 known as the High Speed Swim Lane, or Hustle, within the company \u2013 represented only a small fraction of the firm\u2019s mortgage portfolio, meaning that penalties in cases dealing with larger programs could skyrocket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s turned out FIRREA has been a Godsend to the Justice Department, like unearthing a new toy,\u201d said Herring. \u201cThe win in the Hustle case is going to give them a lot of leverage, so I think we\u2019ll see settlements. I don\u2019t think banks want to take these cases to trial.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d Is a Bigger Problem than Ever\n\nHerring said that there is also strong speculation in the legal community that DOJ may soon start using the FIRREA strategy against Wall Street firms that packaged and sold mortgages that they knew, or should have known, were of poor quality.\n\nAnd though to many people, the mortgage crisis of the middle of the last decade may seem like ancient history, companies with potential culpability can\u2019t afford to treat it that way. That\u2019s because FIRREA offers DOJ one further advantage.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing for them is that it has a ten-year statute of limitation,\u201d said Herring. \u201cThey\u2019re not even brushing up against it.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As reports surface that Bank of America is likely to agree to a record-setting settlement for as much as $17 billion for its role in the mortgage crisis, some suspect that Wall Street firms are next on the Justice Department\u2019s hit list.", "title": "Justice Department\u2019s \u201cNew Toy\u201d Could Cost Wall Street Big Bucks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/07/Justice-Department-s-New-Toy-Could-Cost-Wall-Street-Big-Bucks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09282012_bankofamerica_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/07/Justice-Department-s-New-Toy-Could-Cost-Wall-Street-Big-Bucks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09282012_bankofamerica_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As reports surface that Bank of America is likely to agree to a record-setting settlement for as much as $17 billion for its role in the mortgage crisis, some suspect that Wall Street firms are next on the Justice Department\u2019s hit list.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6dc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s turned out FIRREA has been a Godsend to the Justice Department, like unearthing a new toy,\u201d said Herring.\nAnd though to many people, the mortgage crisis of the middle of the last decade may seem like ancient history, companies with potential culpability can\u2019t afford to treat it that way.\nThe Department of Justice has taken a lot of flak for its response to the mortgage crisis that helped lead the U.S. into the Great Recession in the middle of the last decade.\nIf the two parties come to an agreement, the eye-popping dollar figure will likely be the one thing people remember about the bank\u2019s dealings with Justice.\nThe government has argued that the fraud, while ostensibly committed by the bank, also affected the bank, and that the charge was permissible."}
