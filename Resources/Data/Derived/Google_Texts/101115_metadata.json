Do they think it\u2019s just fine that Americans die routinely of preventable and treatable illnesses because they have no insurance?\n\nHave they ever come face to face with a terrified person who discovered a lump in her breast, started coughing up blood or endured any of an array of frightening symptoms, but who did not have insurance and could only hope and pray that everything would be O.K.? I have, and it is heartbreaking.\n\nThe educator in me wonders why the same people who decry public funding for medical care have no problem with publicly funded education. Is health care a privilege, rather than a right, like education, deserved only by those who can afford it?\n\nCommon sense dictates that they both are rights. I just don\u2019t get it.\n\nCAROL ROYE\n\nOssining, N.Y.\n\nThe writer is the author of \u201cA Woman\u2019s Right to Know: How Women\u2019s Health Became a Political Pawn \u2014 and the Surprising Alliances Working to Reclaim It.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150706032101, "twitter": {"description": "A nurse practitioner writes that she is baffled by those who would overturn the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Medical Care Is a Right", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/medical-care-is-a-right.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003771152"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/medical-care-is-a-right.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003771152", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/medical-care-is-a-right.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Medical Care Is a Right", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 6, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A nurse practitioner writes that she is baffled by those who would overturn the Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A nurse practitioner writes that she is baffled by those who would overturn the Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 6, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-07-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2015-07-06", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "06Lhealth", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150706032101, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/opinion/medical-care-is-a-right.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A nurse practitioner writes that she is baffled by those who would overturn the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Medical Care Is a Right"}, "pdate": 20150706, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003771152, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Medical Care Is a Right", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "Is health care a privilege, rather than a right, like education, deserved only by those who can afford it?\nThe educator in me wonders why the same people who decry public funding for medical care have no problem with publicly funded education.\nThe writer is the author of \u201cA Woman\u2019s Right to Know: How Women\u2019s Health Became a Political Pawn \u2014 and the Surprising Alliances Working to Reclaim It.\u201d\nDo they think it\u2019s just fine that Americans die routinely of preventable and treatable illnesses because they have no insurance?\nTo the Editor:Re \u201cIf Law \u2018Is Here to Stay,\u2019 So Are Doubts About It\u201d (news analysis, front page, June 26):As a nurse practitioner and a professor of nursing at Pace University, I am baffled by those who are so eager to overturn a law that provides health care to millions of people, the Affordable Care Act."}
