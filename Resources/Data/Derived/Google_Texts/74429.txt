Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates face a polit­ic­al conun­drum over birth con­trol, and they’re turn­ing to Louisi­ana Gov. Bobby Jin­dal for the an­swer.

The party op­poses the Af­ford­able Care Act’s re­quire­ment that in­surers cov­er birth con­trol without a co-pay, say­ing it vi­ol­ates the re­li­gious free­dom of em­ploy­ers who ob­ject to cer­tain birth con­trol meth­ods. But can­did­ates don’t want to be seen as stand­ing between voters and ac­cess to birth con­trol, a los­ing polit­ic­al pro­pos­i­tion that feeds in­to Demo­crats’ “war on wo­men” re­frain.

Fa­cing that ex­act prob­lem, Jin­dal came up with an an­swer in 2012: Ad­voc­ate that birth con­trol be made avail­able over the counter. That policy, its de­fend­ers say, would ex­pand ac­cess to birth con­trol without for­cing people in­to con­flicts of con­science.

In 2014, birth con­trol is again a hot top­ic after the Su­preme Court weakened Obama­care’s birth con­trol man­date as part of the Hobby Lobby de­cision. And Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates, in­clud­ing Rep. Cory Gard­ner in Col­or­ado and Thom Tillis in North Car­o­lina, have em­braced the strategy amid at­tacks over their past stances on re­pro­duct­ive-health ques­tions.

“This is really a way of neut­ral­iz­ing the is­sue, bring­ing [the cam­paign] back to real is­sues,” said GOP strategist Bri­an Walsh. “Re­pub­lic­ans are fo­cused on the eco­nomy: jobs, kit­chen-table is­sues that fam­il­ies are deal­ing with.”

Wheth­er the strategy will trump Demo­crat­ic at­tacks re­mains to be seen””and wheth­er over-the-counter birth con­trol would de­liv­er on its back­ers’ prom­ises is a more com­plic­ated ques­tion“”but even if it does work, not every­one in the Re­pub­lic­an Party is on board.

Watch­ing Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates push over-the-counter birth con­trol has left some so­cial con­ser­vat­ives fum­ing.

Some on the Re­li­gious Right see the plan as back­track­ing on con­ser­vat­ive ideals, and they worry the am­bi­gu­ity of the pro­pos­al would make pills too easy to ac­cess.

Elim­in­at­ing the doc­tor as a middle­man and mak­ing birth con­trol easy to ob­tain could res­ult in its mis­use, the crit­ics say. Over-the-counter ac­cess to pills that could cause abor­tioins””in­ten­tion­ally or ac­ci­dent­ally””would be their worst night­mare.

RE­LATED: Would Re­pub­lic­ans’ OTC Birth Con­trol Plan Work?

“There are sev­er­al ser­i­ous health com­plic­a­tions with birth con­trol pills,” said Jen­nifer Ma­son, com­mu­nic­a­tions dir­ect­or for Per­son­hood USA. “Some pills could cause abor­tions; even aside from the mor­al im­plic­a­tions, it’s reck­less to make abor­tion and con­tra­cep­tion pills avail­able over the counter.”

The strategy has glazed over spe­cif­ics of how the policy would ac­tu­ally work, which has some on the Re­li­gious Right wor­ried about what ex­actly would be sold, and to whom.

“I’m not cer­tain when they say birth con­trol if they’re talk­ing about abor­ti­fa­cients or not,” said Con­nie Mack­ie, pres­id­ent of the Fam­ily Re­search Coun­cil Ac­tion Pact. “If it’s not clear to some pro-lifers, that could turn them off.”

Mack­ie said that while Fam­ily Re­search Coun­cil does not gen­er­ally take a po­s­i­tion on con­tra­cept­ives, the or­gan­iz­a­tion op­poses the plan, largely out of con­cern that it could al­low minors to eas­ily ob­tain birth con­trol without par­ent­al con­sent.

“Young girls need their par­ents’ and doc­tor’s guid­ance,” Mack­ie con­tin­ued. “[The can­did­ates] don’t trust that people want full con­trol over their kids, and what they take. We don’t want some guys for­cing a girl to go in and get [the con­tra­cept­ives].”

Pro­ponents of the strategy say the pills would only be avail­able to adults, but that re­stric­tion would com­plic­ate their OTC stand­ing and could be tricky to en­force.

The strategy is also res­ult­ing in polit­ic­al frac­tur­ing, with some on the Re­li­gious Right feel­ing they have been mar­gin­al­ized more broadly by their party.

“Re­pub­lic­ans have his­tor­ic­ally had an un­canny knack for do­ing whatever it takes to lose their num­bers in the polls; this would be the latest,” said Mack­ie. “It’s a polit­ic­al strategy. They should stop shop­ping around for things that ap­peal to lib­er­als and stick to their core be­liefs of life, cour­age, re­li­gious liberty, de­fense, and eco­nom­ic re­form…. [But] they get these polit­ic­al ad­visers or con­tract­ors that come in and give the wrong ad­vice.”

In Col­or­ado, those who sup­por­ted Gard­ner for his re­cord of cham­pi­on­ing per­son­hood policy””which would ban abor­tion and many forms of con­tra­cep­tion””are not pleased with his seem­ing evol­u­tion, Ma­son said. Along with ad­voc­at­ing for OTC birth con­trol, the Sen­ate can­did­ate res­cin­ded his sup­port for the state per­son­hood policy fol­low­ing its de­feat by Col­or­ado voters, but he re­mains a co­spon­sor of the fed­er­al le­gis­la­tion.

“[Gard­ner has] flip-flopped on is­sues and turned his back on the base that elec­ted him,” Ma­son said. “He’s cer­tainly not win­ning Demo­crat­ic votes, and he’s ali­en­at­ing Re­pub­lic­ans. It’s puzz­ling to us and polit­ic­ally stu­pid.”

The Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates be­lieve they’ve called Demo­crats’ bluff, for­cing them to agree and drop their at­tacks, or op­pose a pro­pos­al they say would in­crease ac­cess to and avail­ab­il­ity of con­tra­cep­tion for wo­men.

But while some Demo­crats and doc­tors groups do sup­port the idea of over-the-counter ac­cess to birth con­trol, they see it as a sup­ple­ment to the ACA’s birth con­trol cov­er­age man­date, not a re­place­ment.

“OTC avail­ab­il­ity of or­al con­tra­cept­ives will help more wo­men get the con­tra­cept­ives they need, which have long been proven safe enough to use without a pre­scrip­tion””es­pe­cially emer­gency con­tra­cep­tion,” Dr. John C. Jen­nings, pres­id­ent of the Amer­ic­an Con­gress of Ob­stet­ri­cians and Gyneco­lo­gists, said in a state­ment.

“[However], over-the-counter ac­cess should not be used as a polit­ic­al tool by can­did­ates or by elec­ted of­fi­cials.”
