( Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer )\n\nErin Bartko's husband sees another side of his soft-spoken, mild-mannered wife when she walks into a grocery store.\n\n\"When she shops, it's like she's going into battle, and usually she comes out victorious,\" Joe Bartko said.\n\nHer acumen at shaving dollars \u2014 lots of them \u2014 off her grocery store bill is no accident.\n\nErin Bartko worked for 22 years at Albertons, up until 2011, as a bookkeeper, checker and assistant front manager.\n\nIn those roles, she began understanding more about how store deals work and how the consumer can play the savings game more skillfully.\n\n\"It's kind of my adrenaline thing, that I like to save,\" said Erin Bartko, 45.\n\nCheckers notice.\n\nEvery Sunday, Erin Bartko buys two or three newspapers to compare fliers and to clip coupons, which she files in a black Trapper Keeper notebook that holds plastic pages with pockets originally intended for baseball cards. She then organizes those pages according to sections titled \"Drinks,\" \"Canned and Frozen,\" etc. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer)\n\n\"I had one lady just stand there and say, 'Wow. You really took it down far,'\" she said.\n\nHer process starts with sitting at the kitchen table to plan meals for the next week or two based on what she finds on sale in the weekly store fliers.\n\nEvery Sunday, she buys two or three papers to compare those fliers and to clip coupons, which she files in a black Trapper Keeper notebook that holds plastic pages with pockets originally intended for baseball cards. She then organizes those pages according to sections titled \"Drinks,\" \"Canned and Frozen,\" etc.\n\nFrom there, the Longmont wife and mother of two growing boys plans meals based on the interplay between what is on sale and what she can buy on sale with coupons.\n\nTo keep everything straight, Erin Bartko writes her items needed in one color; writes the store offering the best value in another color; and, finally, in another color notes if she can use a coupon with the item and how much the coupon is worth.\n\nShe is no impulse shopper.\n\nBefore she wheels her cart into the store, she props her Trapper Keeper coupon holder open on the kiddie seat of the grocery cart along with the color-coded lists. She also carries a neon green bag to hold sales fliers from stores around town as a ready reference. Then, she keeps a running ticker of how much she has spent as she shops to prevent sticker shock at the checkout.\n\nThat is the front end of her process.\n\nBut, like a supercomputer, Erin Bartko's mind processes lots of other money-saving data in the background as she serpentines through the grocery store aisles.\n\nSavvy shopper wannabes do well to remember what she remembers:\n\n\u2022Join store loyalty programs and use digital coupons along with manufacturer coupons \u2014 both clipped and printed from online sources \u2014 whenever possible in conjunction with in-store sale prices.\n\n\u2022Enroll in manufacturer reward programs, such as www.Kelloggsfamilyrewards.com, to earn free products through repeated purchases.\n\n\u2022Ask for rain checks on sold out sale items.\n\n\u2022\"Like\" grocery store Facebook sites to get early notification of upcoming sales.\n\n\u2022Remember that you do not need to buy 10 items in \"10 for 10\" deals to get the price break on one item.\n\n\u2022Shop early on weekdays for better selection and better luck finding deals in the clearance racks at the back of the store.\n\n\u2022Bring your own grocery bags and cash in on the 5-cent discount per bag some stores offer.\n\n\u2022Shop on Wednesdays at Lucky's Market and Sprout's Farmers Market because those stores on that day honor sale prices both from the last week's flier and the next week's flier.\n\n\u2022Be careful to count on a coupon only if it is for a matching brand and the correct size.\n\n\u2022Always read the unit price of products \u2014 not just the face value \u2014 to get an accurate cost comparison of how \"family size\" items and store brands versus name brands compare.\n\nFinally, Erin Bartko recommends keeping an eye out for stray coupons \u2014 in empty shopping carts, on the back of football tickets, even on the street \u2014 and recognizing them for what they are.\n\n\"My sons sometimes pick them up off the ground, give them to me, and say, 'Mom, here's some money!'\" she said.\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or at 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url":
