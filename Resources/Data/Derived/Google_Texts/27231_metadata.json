He\u2019s also handing out copies of his protest statement and addresses of legislators to his clients when they check out.\n\nThe N.C. Veterinary Medical Association and other professional organizations are also encouraging citizens to protest the proposed sales tax. For most areas of North Carolina the tax is 6.75 percent, with 4.75 percent of that going to the state and the remainder to local governments.\n\nThe new service taxes would help pay for cuts in the corporate and personal income tax rates. There is no similar provision in the House budget bill.\n\nThe bill is currently part of the debate as the House and Senate try to reconcile their budget differences. If it passed, it would take effect Thursday, Oct. 1, and generate an estimated $202.9 million for the state in fiscal 2016-17.\n\nBut a statement from the N.C. Veterinary Medical Association points out that any reduction in corporate and personal income taxes for veterinarians would likely be offset by lost income from changes in client visits and spending patterns.\n\nMelissa Crowe, office manager at Arendell Animal Hospital, said several clients have contacted legislators.\n\n\u201cClients are worried. We try to make our prices affordable and work out payment plans with people on fixed incomes, but if this goes through there will be a price increase. That\u2019s the last thing we want to do.\u201d\n\nClient Jeff Jones of Newport, who had brought his dog in for an annual check up and vaccinations, said he was against the increase.\n\n\u201cIt will have a negative effect on things like rabies protection and animal health,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Hawkes added that he\u2019s also upset because the sales tax is so random, and he\u2019s concerned it would lead to future taxes on other health care services.\n\n\u201cWhere would they stop? If it goes through, what would stop them from eventually taxing chiropractors or dentists?\u201d\n\nAutomotive mechanic Jeff McCabe with McCabe\u2019s Garage in Morehead City is also concerned about the proposal. He wasn\u2019t aware of the plan until the News-Times informed him Thursday.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard anything about it. I wouldn\u2019t like it. Rates would have to be raised, and that would all go back (on)to the consumer,\u201d Mr. McCabe said.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate proposal is part of a massive economic development and tax plan to shift more of the tax burden from income to sales taxes.\n\nThe plan to tax services would be coupled with a sweeping change in how the state allocates sales tax revenues among counties. The current formula directs most of the money to the county where a sale occurred \u2013 an approach that favors urban counties where rural residents typically do their shopping.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Brown, R-Onslow, unveiled a plan months ago that would instead divide the revenue based on each county\u2019s population. The proposal would offer a boost to small, rural counties, while urban counties could lose millions.\n\nBy taxing services such as auto repair and pet grooming, the state would increase sales tax collections and soften the blow of the new distribution plan in urban counties.\n\nSen. Brown\u2019s plan would still create winners and losers. Projections from the legislature\u2019s nonpartisan staff show that 17 counties would have less sales tax revenue by 2020 than they would under the current system that year. The change would be phased in gradually from July 2016 to June 2020.\n\nCarteret County would lose sales tax revenue under the plan.\n\nThe Senate bill offers counties a third option for making up any revenue losses: Raise their county-level sales tax through a ballot referendum.\n\nIf the legislation passes, counties could seek up to two quarter-cent sales tax hikes for education or transit or to boost their overall budget. Each quarter-cent increase would have to occur in separate elections. And no county could have a local sales tax higher than 2.5 percent \u2013 although Orange and Durham counties could keep their current 2.75 percent rate.\n\nScott Mooneyham, a spokesman for the N.C. League of Municipalities, said towns and cities are concerned that county governments could keep all revenue from hiking local sales taxes \u2013 without sharing the proceeds with municipal governments, as they do under current law.\n\nFor those interested in contacting legislators, contact information is available at www.ncleg.net.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nContact Cheryl Burke at 252-726-7081, ext. 255; email Cheryl@thenewstimes.com; or follow on Twitter @cherylccnt.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Carolina Coast Online", "description": "MOREHEAD CITY \u2014 A Senate proposal to add sales taxes to services such as veterinary care and pet grooming has prompted a veterinarian here to start a letter-writing campaign in protest.", "title": "Another sales tax?", "url": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_8a625700-2d8e-11e5-9029-33dfc723dcd4.html", "image": {"width": 432, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/carolinacoastonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/27/c276018c-2d8e-11e5-b099-2f7e248b3cfb/55aabc71d162a.image.jpg?resize=432%2C287", "height": 287}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "MOREHEAD CITY \u2014 A Senate proposal to add sales taxes to services such as veterinary care and pet grooming has prompted a veterinarian here to start a letter-writing campaign in protest.", "keywords": "tax,sales tax,arendell animal hospital,budget 2015-16,2015-16 budget,news_times,news,editors_pick,featured", "news_keywords": "tax,sales tax,arendell animal hospital,budget 2015-16,2015-16 budget,news_times,news,editors_pick,featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cb7\"", "article_summary": "The plan to tax services would be coupled with a sweeping change in how the state allocates sales tax revenues among counties.\nThe Republican-led Senate proposal is part of a massive economic development and tax plan to shift more of the tax burden from income to sales taxes.\nThe Senate plan would tax a variety of services currently exempt from charging sales tax: veterinarian visits; pet grooming; repair, maintenance and installation on personal property such as cars; and advertising.\nThe N.C.
