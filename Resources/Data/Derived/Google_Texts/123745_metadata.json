Like Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s ex-marine in \u201cDangerous Minds,\u201d Edward James Olmos\u2019s Jaime Escalante in \u201cStand and Deliver,\u201d and Robin Williams\u2019s \u201ccarpe diem\u201d\u2013intoning whistler in \u201cDead Poets Society,\u201d legendary teachers transform thugs into scholars, illiterates into geniuses, and slackers into bards through brute charisma. Teaching is their calling\u2014not a matter of craft and training, but alchemical inspiration.\n\nBad teachers, conversely, are portrayed as deliberately sadistic (as with the Sue Sylvester character on \u201cGlee\u201d), congenitally boring (Ben Stein\u2019s nasal droner in \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d), or ludicrously dim-witted (Mr. Garrison from \u201cSouth Park\u201d). These are the tropes of a common narrative, a story I\u2019ve come to call the \u201cMyth of the Natural-Born Teacher.\u201d\n\nEven in the rare cases where fictional teachers appear to improve\u2014as happens in \u201cGoodbye, Mr. Chips,\u201d the novel-turned-film, in which a bland schoolteacher named Mr. Chips comes to \u201csparkle\u201d\u2014the change is an ugly duckling\u2013style unmasking of hidden pizzazz rather than the acquisition of new skill. Others think Mr. Chips has become a \u201cnew man,\u201d but in fact, we are told, he has only peeled back a \u201ccreeping dry rot of pedagogy\u201d to reveal the \u201csense of humor\u201d that \u201che had always had.\u201d\n\nThe idea of the natural-born teacher is embedded in thousands of studies conducted over dozens of years. Again and again, researchers have sought to explain great teaching through personality and character traits. The most effective teachers, researchers have guessed, must be more extroverted, agreeable, conscientious, open to new experiences, empathetic, socially adjusted, emotionally sensitive, persevering, humorous, or all of the above. For decades, though, these studies have proved inconclusive. Great teachers can be extroverts or introverts, humorous or serious, flexible or rigid.\n\nEven those charged with training teachers\u2014the ones who, by definition, should believe teaching can be taught\u2014believe the natural-born-teacher narrative. \u201cI think that there is an innate drive or innate ability for teaching,\u201d the dean of the College of Education at Chicago State University, Sylvia Gist, told me when I met with her in 2009. The consensus seems to be, you either have it or you don\u2019t.\n\nBefore I met Magdalene Lampert, I ascribed to this view as well. My teacher friends seemed born for the blackboard. I could see it in their personalities and in how much they cared\u2014one\u2019s earnest, unabashed sensitivity; another\u2019s confident, playful devotion. Gregarious, charming, and theatrical, they commanded attention wherever they went. No wonder they decided to teach, while I\u2014shamefully serious, allergic to goofiness, prone to skepticism\u2014became a journalist. They had the magical quality of \u201cteacherness\u201d\u2014what Jane Hannaway, the director of the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research and a former teacher, described to me as \u201cvoodoo.\u201d\n\nWhen I first met Magdalene, her talent was obvious, and it did, at first, look like voodoo. It was the winter of 2009, twenty years after she taught fifth-grade math to Catherine and Richard, and she was now a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Education. We sat in her sun-soaked office, at the far end of a long table, looking at the work of a fifth-grader named Brandon.\n\nIn the course of solving a problem about the price of party ribbons, Brandon had mistakenly declared that 7\u221512 = 1.5. What, Magdalene asked me, could have made him think that?\n\nThis was probably the first time Magdalene read my mind, which is what she does after asking a question. She lowers her eyelids slightly, purses her lips, and peers into your soul. I had no idea how Brandon could have come up with 1.5, and she knew it.\n\nBut instead of giving me the answer, she wanted me to think about what might make sense (just as, back in 1989, she had wanted Richard to think about his answer, 18). She drew a longdivision sign, that \u201chouse\u201d that I remembered from fifth grade. She placed the numbers in the wrong spots: 12 under the house and 7 outside of it, to the left, as if we were asking how many times 7 went into 12 rather than how many times 12 went into 7. Putting 7 into 12, a student would find that it went in once, with a remainder of 5 (12 \u2013 7). \u201c1 R 5,\u201d he would have written, in the language of fifth grade.\n\nWhen we looked at Brandon\u2019s paper, that is exactly what we saw: a house over 12, with 7 on the outside, and then \u201c1 r 5\u201d written next to it in green marker. Brandon, Magdalene explained, must have mistakenly translated his \u201c1 r 5\u201d into 1.5. (The answer is actually 1 and 5\u22157.)\n\nIt seemed like a magic trick\u2014how quickly Magdalene moved from noticing a problem to diagnosing its source. Instead of just looking at the final wrong answer, she had translated Brandon\u2019s notes\u2014almost nonsensical to me\u2014into a logical (if flawed) path, skipped backward through his thinking, and located the original point of misfire. It took her no more than a minute.\n\nAnd what about all the other errors Brandon could have made as he struggled to find the price of those ribbons? What about the mistakes scattered through his classmates\u2019 papers, not to mention all the ones that weren\u2019t there, but could have been? This, after all, was just the work of one class, taken from one day out of the year, in one grade and one subject, by one student. I watched, captivated, as Magdalene worked through more papers, reading backward through the minds of the children, each prone to his own unique mistakes.\n\nBut the more I learned about Magdalene and her teaching, the more I saw that what looked like mind reading was in fact the result of extraordinary skill, not inborn talent. Her success did not depend on her personality, which\u2014inward, pensive, and measured\u2014was in many ways the opposite of Hollywood\u2019s mythic teachers. Instead, Magdalene\u2019s success relied on a body of knowledge and skill that she had spent years acquiring. Teaching, as she practiced it, was a complex craft.\n\nMagdalene showed me that the illusion of the natural-born teacher is at best a polite version of the old adage attributed to George Bernard Shaw: \u201cHe who can, does. He who cannot, teaches.\u201d By imagining teaching as a \u201cvoodoo\u201d mixture of personal charisma and passion, we are saying, essentially, He who has intelligence, does. He who has charm, teaches. I have come to think that this is a dangerous notion. By misunderstanding how teaching works, we misunderstand what it will take to make it better\u2014ensuring that, far too often, teaching doesn\u2019t work at all.\n\n*\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d Magdalene Lampert\u2019s decision not to correct Richard had paid off\u2014partly, anyway.\n\nHis nonsensical answer, that the car traveling at a speed of 55 miles per hour would go 18 miles in 15 minutes, remained on the board. But after Magdalene asked the class whether anyone agreed with his answer, enduring an uncomfortable pause when nobody said anything, Richard finally broke the silence.\n\n\u201cCan I change my mind?\u201d he asked her. Instead of 18, he wanted to \u201cput thirteen and a half or thirteen point five.\u201d\n\nBetter! The calculation he should have made is that, since 55 miles corresponds to 60 minutes, and half of 55 miles, 27.5, corresponds to 30 minutes, then a quarter of 60 minutes would be half again: 13.75. He was close.\n\nBut Magdalene still didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d first said 18. She needed to know exactly what had gone wrong inside his head. Pointing to the place on the chalkboard where Richard had originally written \u201c18,\u201d she asked him why he\u2019d changed his mind.\n\nHe was back in his seat. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said, \u201ceighteen plus eighteen isn\u2019t twenty-seven.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d she said, permitting herself a minor celebration.\n\nHe had it\u2014at least, most of it. Keeping her hand on the board so that it covered up the old wrong answer, 18, Magdalene pivoted so that her body faced Richard and the rest of the class. She wanted everyone to hear what she had to say. Richard had gone from stumbling to coming up with the beginnings of a proof\u2014a mathematical argument for why 18 couldn\u2019t be the answer\u2014and she wanted to draw everyone else\u2019s attention to his work.\n\nIn the back of the room, students started murmuring. \u201cNot close!\u201d one shouted out. Another student threw up his hand.\n\nMagdalene took note but did not make a move just yet. She thought about 27. The board, of course, said the correct number of miles that is half of 55\u201427.5, not 27. If he had been shooting for precision, Richard would have tried to find a number that, when doubled, equaled 27.5, not 27. But if they were talking about a real car, making a real trip, would it matter if he calculated a distance of 13.5 miles, rather than 13.75? It might, and it also might not. Still, learning to make approximations was an important skill, and Magdalene was happy with Richard\u2019s performance. He was estimating\u2014proving, even\u2014thinking mathematically.\n\nShe did not want to make Richard think he\u2019d made a mistake, but she also wanted to help him and the rest of the class reach the exact answer. After all, if she hadn\u2019t wanted the students to deal with the tricky matter of having to divide 27.5 into two pieces, she could have picked a rounder speed, like 60 miles an hour. Then the math would have been nice and clean. But one of her objectives for the year was to have students learn to convert between decimals and fractions, and to divide each of them in their heads. She had picked 55 because she wanted the class to struggle with exactly this problem, in exactly this way.\n\nHow to acknowledge Richard\u2019s good work but also, at the same time, correct it? She surveyed the growing field of raised hands. Anthony, a small boy whom Magdalene knew loved to talk, was waving his hand in the air. Awad, a quiet boy with neat, curlicue handwriting, had his hand up too. Who would keep up her ambiguous tone: accepting Richard\u2019s answer, but expanding on it? She chose Awad.\n\n*\n\nParadoxically, the institution most susceptible to the fallacy of the natural-born teacher is our country\u2019s public school system. And that\u2019s despite the fact that alarm\u2014always high\u2014over the disappointing level of our national teaching quality has recently reached a fever pitch.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment our children step into a classroom,\u201d Barack Obama said in 2007, \u201cthe single most important factor determining their achievement is not the color of their skin or where they come from; it\u2019s not who their parents are or how much money they have. It\u2019s who their teacher is.\u201d Obama was then a presidential candidate; in office, his position only strengthened. Today, thanks to policies that his administration has advanced, school districts across the country are undergoing ambitious efforts to reinvigorate their teaching force. The debate about these reforms is fierce; many people, including many teachers, oppose Obama\u2019s efforts. But their objection is not usually with his premise. They agree that teachers matter and that the quality of their work should be improved. What they dispute is how to enact the change.\n\nOne argument\u2014Obama\u2019s\u2014prescribes improvement by way of accountability. The problem with American education, this line of thinking goes, is that we have for too long treated all teachers the same: they get the same pay raises, the same evaluations, and the same job protections whether they inspire their students like Robin Williams or stultify them like Ben Stein. But the fact is that some teachers are good and some are bad. Some help children learn while others set them back.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone knows teachers are key.
