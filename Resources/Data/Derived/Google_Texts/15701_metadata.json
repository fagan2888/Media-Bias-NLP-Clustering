You don't want to force a mother to sit on a toilet stall and try to use a breast pump.\"\n\nIn many cases, though, that's exactly what happens.\n\n\"They are going into cars, going into restrooms,\" said Carol Lawrence, maternal research and evidence-based practice clinical coordinator for Lee Memorial Health System. \"A woman is expressing breast milk. That's her child's nutrition.\"\n\nNot only is that not sanitary, Lawrence said, but it's also not the calm, relaxed environment women need to effectively express breast milk.\n\nProvisions for a lactation room are separate from legislation ensuring a woman's right to breastfeed in any public or private setting. A lactation room is intended for expressing breast milk, not necessarily directly breastfeeding a child.\n\nFGCU's lactation room is a converted office space and contains a refrigerator, sink, electrical outlets, small table, lamp, fixed-back chairs and fake plants. The room opened in November for employees only, but administration decided in early February to grant access to students and employees with pre-programmed key cards. To date, no one has registered for the room.\n\nEdison State College has lactation rooms on all four of its campuses, and Lee Memorial has designated spaces at each of its facilities. Chico's FAS, the largest private company with headquarters in Southwest Florida, also has a lactation room for employees.\n\nShell Point Retirement Community, which has 960 employees, does not maintain a designated lactation room. Workers are spread across a large property, so the company finds a convenient location for that individual. In the past 12 months, four employees have requested space.\n\n\"We do not get a lot of requests, but on a case-by-case basis we take a look at where an employee is working to find a private place for them,\" said Karen Anderson, Shell Point's assistant vice president of human resources.\n\nThe law is clear on what types of businesses and organizations must provide lactation space \u2014 all of them. The only exception is employers with fewer than 50 workers, and they must prove creating a space poses an undue hardship on the business.\n\nSo if it's the law, why are mothers using their vehicles and restrooms?\n\n\"Some women don't want to bring up the issue in the workplace because it's such a private issue,\" said Fort Myers attorney Christina Schwinn, a partner at the Pavese Law Firm.\n\nA fear of retaliation also could be coming into play, Schwinn said, for mothers who request a private space for this purpose. Employers, however, cannot retaliate against mothers for raising the issue, according to Schwinn.\n\nSince the law was introduced four years ago, Schwinn said no one has even approached her with questions about their rights for a lactation room or break time during the workday to pump breast milk.\n\nNicholas Moraites, an employment attorney with the Washington, D.C. firm of Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott, believes few people are aware of the provision.\n\n\"Employees don't know they have a right to ask for it, and employers might not know they have to provide it,\" Moraites said. \"That's where HR comes in.\"\n\nA lactation room can be as simple as a converted storage closet, according to Lawrence, or more elaborate like the new room at FGCU. Carothers has read about pop-up tents in agriculture fields, converted dressing rooms in retail stores and the shell of a portable toilet, without the toilet, being positioned along transportation routes for bus drivers.\n\n\"It's anywhere a woman can have privacy,\" Lawrence said. \"If she's tense or distracted, it's more difficult for her to express her milk.\"\n\nConnect with Dave Breitenstein on Twitter (@D_Breitenstein) and Facebook (DaveBreitenstein).\n\nLactation Rooms\n\nThe Society for Human Resource Management randomly surveyed members to gauge the percentage of businesses and organizations, large and small, that provide lactation spaces:\n\n\u2022 2009: 25 percent\n\n\u2022 2010: 28 percent\n\n\u2022 2011: 28 percent\n\n\u2022 2012: 30 percent\n\n\u2022 2013: 34 percent\n\nRead or Share this story: http://newspr.es/1ncIKzy", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "FGCU has opened a lactation room on campus, a quiet place where mothers can pump milk in comfort and privacy.", "og": {"site_name": "The News-Press", "description": "FGCU has opened a lactation room on campus, a quiet place where mothers can pump milk in comfort and privacy.", "title": "Provision of Affordable Care Act makes lactation rooms required on job", "url": "http://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/fort-myers/2014/02/24/provision-of-affordable-care-act-makes-lactation-rooms-required-on-job/5794703/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-press.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FGCU has opened a lactation room on campus, a quiet place where mothers can pump milk in comfort and privacy.", "creator": "@thenewspress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/efb9650812134d6a5cd0424759ebf6b9eb172606/c=0-128-243-371&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/FortMyers/2014/02/24/lactationnumbers.jpg", "title": "Provision of Affordable Care Act makes lactation rooms required on job", "site": "@thenewspress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600073397", "fb": {"app_id": 149631068421067}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca264\"", "article_summary": "Lactation rooms (Photo: The News-Press)FGCU has opened a lactation room on campus, a quiet place where mothers can pump milk in comfort and privacy.\nThe law is clear on what types of businesses and organizations must provide lactation space \u2014 all of them.\nShell Point Retirement Community, which has 960 employees, does not maintain a designated lactation room.\nProvisions for a lactation room are separate from legislation ensuring a woman's right to breastfeed in any public or private setting.\nChico's FAS, the largest private company with headquarters in Southwest Florida, also has a lactation room for employees."}
