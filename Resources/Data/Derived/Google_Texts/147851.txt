Ben Carson gave a preview Sunday morning of what his team will be advocating at Sunday night's confab between GOP presidential campaigns on the future of debates. Carson has suggested debates be only online, but on ABC's "This Week" he added he would like to see a "substantial opening statement and "substantial closing statement," each at least a minute long."And I would like to see, you know, tighter guidelines in terms of people, when they respond to questions, you know, some people just pretty much ignore what the time constraints are and others are careful to stay within them," he told guest host Martha Raddatz.The purpose of the debates is to highlight the differences in philosophy between the candidates, he said, particularly with the crowded GOP field."You could spend time forever, combing back through history," he said. "Give me a break. We need to mature in the way we do these debates if they're going to be useful to the American people."Carson also offered detailed thoughts on foreign policy, including enforcing a no-fly zone in Syria and keeping Russian President Vladmir Putin in the loop on it.But Putin must be opposed in the Baltic region, where he is threatening after American inaction in Ukraine, he said."We need to give Ukraine offensive weapons. We need to establish a missile defense system in the Eastern bloc of countries so that we oppose him," Carson said. "Let's keep him on the run."But, he added, "our country's biggest threats come from within, from failing to address our incredible fiscal irresponsibility by allowing our populace to become enemies with each other, stirring up hatred and strife within our country."
