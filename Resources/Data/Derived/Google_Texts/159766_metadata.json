Then, there are others who claim they rarely dream, if they dream at all, as well as those who can\u2019t ever seem to remember them. But according to a recent study, published in Journal of Sleep Research, self-proclaimed non-dreamers with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder might be dreaming more than they think, as they were found to make movements and sometimes even speak during their sleep. The researchers said these actions might correspond to the content of their dreams.\n\nMost people over the age of 10 dream at least four to six times a night during REM sleep, according to the University of California, Santa Cruz. During this time, our brains become as active as they are during our waking hours, although not all parts of the brain are reactivated during REM periods, which last anywhere from five to 34 minutes, depending on which stage of sleep a person is in.There is also evidence we can dream during non-REM sleep, usually in the hour or two before waking up, when the brain becomes more activated than it was earlier in the night.\n\nStudy author Bastien Herlin, from the ICM Brain and Spine Institute in France, and his colleagues sought to test whether self-proclaimed non-dreamers aren\u2019t actually able to dream. A total of 289 participants with REM behavior disorder \u2014 which causes the dreamer to lack muscle paralysis during REM sleep, therefore \u201cacting out\u201d parts of their dream \u2014 were given a questionnaire that asked whether they dreamed. Out of the participants, 2.7 percent reported they had not dreamed for at least 10 years, while 1.1 percent said they had never dreamed.\n\nIn many of these participants\u2019 cases, however, their actions during sleep implied they were dreaming. For example, a 73-year-old participant claimed he used to recall dreams as a child but stopped at the age of 20. Meanwhile, in the sleep lab, he was talking, yelling, and moving his legs and arms, all while he was asleep. \u201c[Videos show] the patient arguing, swearing profanities, kicking, boxing, and throwing items toward an invisible individual during REM sleep, as well as fighting again in another REM sleep episode one year after, with no subsequent dream recall despite the nurse\u2019s immediate inquiry,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThe researchers also recorded his speech patterns, which were translated from French: \u201cWhat can I make to eat, I saw \u2026 You listen\u2026 (incomprehensible words, then high-pitched voice) Stay here before doing such a thing, you bitch!\u201d This participant\u2019s speech and actions are common in dream-like sequences, according to the study. Herlin believes \u201cdreaming production is universal, while dreaming recall is variable,\u201d and suggested there is no such thing as \u201cnon-dreamers.\u201d But how can we be so sure?\n\nHerlin\u2019s research is limited because dreams are a subjective experience, meaning researchers can\u2019t really know whether a participant dreams while they sleep \u2014 they can only assume the patients are dreaming based on their movements.\n\nDiscover Magazine suggests two concepts that refute the idea everyone dreams, as Herlin claims. First, while these participants may have behaved like they were dreaming, they may not have consciously been experiencing any of the dream images, sensations, and emotions that manifest from dreaming. Second, if the movements tied to REM behavior disorder are linked to a person\u2019s dreams, then a person who never dreams would never make such movements. This means that someone with REM behavior disorder wouldn\u2019t ever know they had it, because they wouldn\u2019t have dreams to act out.\n\nThat said, the question remains: Do all of us dream? It depends on who you ask.\n\nA 2003 study published in the journal Sleep Medicine found REM sleep can occur without dreaming. In a lab, self-proclaimed non-dreamers were awakened during the polysomnography (sleep test) in REM sleep. The findings revealed the group of non-dreamers could not recall any dreams after waking up during REM sleep. The researchers concluded, \u201cThese individuals might not experience dreaming.\u201d\n\nThe inability to dream or recall dreams has been seen in people who suffer injuries in specific parts of the brain. These rare cases show that it is possible for sleepers to get the usual amount of REM sleep and not dream, while being mentally healthy. Basically, we can dream in REM or non-REM sleep, and it may be possible to have REM sleep without dreaming.\n\nSources: Herlin B, Leu-Semenescu S, Chaumereuil et al.
