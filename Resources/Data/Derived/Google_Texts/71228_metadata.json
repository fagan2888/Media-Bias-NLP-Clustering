Protesters also briefly shut down part of an interstate. Five were arrested.\n\nIn New York, a man was arrested for throwing red paint that struck Police Commissioner William Bratton and his security detail.\n\nElsewhere nationwide, demonstrators were mostly law-abiding Monday night, leading marches, waving signs and shouting chants of \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d a refrain that has become a rallying cry in protests over police killings across the country.\n\nActivists had planned protests even before the nighttime announcement that Officer Darren Wilson would not be charged in Michael Brown\u2019s shooting death.\n\nThe racially charged case in Ferguson has inflamed tensions and reignited debates over police-community relations even in cities hundreds of miles from the predominantly black St. Louis suburb.\n\nRallies were planned Tuesday in many Newark, New Jersey; Portland, Maine; Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; and elsewhere. In the nation\u2019s capital, one group lay on the ground to stage a \u201cdie-in\u201d in front of Metro police headquarters. The group plans to occupy various buildings in the district over 28 hours.\n\n\u201cMike Brown is an emblem (of a movement). This country is at its boiling point,\u201d said Ethan Jury, a protester in Philadelphia, where hundreds marched. \u201cHow many people need to die? How many black people need to die?\u201d\n\nProtests could continue Tuesday in California, including in Oakland, where marchers took over Interstate 580.\n\nIn Los Angeles, demonstrations remained mostly small and peaceful, but about 200 people marching toward downtown briefly shut down Interstate 110, City News Service reported.\n\nAfter midnight, officers wearing riot gear fired hard-foam projectiles into the ground to disperse about 50 protesters downtown, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nPolice Chief Charlie Beck said Tuesday there were no injuries and no property damage during hours-long demonstrations across LA. Three people were arrested.\n\nAfter a night of rallies in Chicago, dozens of protesters upset with the grand jury\u2019s decision camped out at the doors of Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s office inside City Hall and planned to remain there throughout the day and overnight. They were holding teach-ins on political issues and \u201chealing circles\u201d for people to discuss experiences with violence in Chicago.\n\nIn New York, mostly peaceful protesters swarmed through traffic, closely trailed by police, as they marched to Times Square for a rally.\n\nAnother crowd of several hundred continued north up Columbus Avenue on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side shouting \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d\n\nThey were flanked by police on foot and in vehicles with their lights flashing. The activists stopped traffic for more than a dozen blocks.\n\nPolice said protesters briefly shut down the Brooklyn Bridge and one of the three spans of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, formerly known as the Triborough Bridge.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Olga R.
