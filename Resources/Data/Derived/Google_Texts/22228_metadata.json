His mother, Patricia Eugenia Martinez, told CNN that her son is bipolar and was hospitalized before for trying to enter North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe illegal war carried out against the nation of Iraq serves as a perfect example of how the U.S. government acts much like a Mafia enterprise, but criminally plundering entire nations of their resources, strategic reserves and economies instead of smaller scale business and individuals, and does so without a code of ethics,\u201d he said, CNN reported.\n\nHe said the electoral system in the United States \u201cis unfairly built for the benefit of the wealthy through the necessity of costly fundraising for political candidates seeking office. The democracy of this nation is an illusion and its representatives act as nothing more than power brokers for those who can offer them.\u201d\n\nMr. Martinez\u2019s legal status in North Korea is unclear and it\u2019s unknown if he\u2019s free to leave the country, CNN said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arturo Pierre Martinez, of El Paso, Texas, appeared on North Korean state media on Sunday to denounce the United States for alleged human rights violations.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Arturo Pierre Martinez, of El Paso, Texas, appeared on North Korean state media on Sunday to denounce the United States for alleged human rights violations.", "title": "Arturo Martinez of Texas slams U.S. on North Korean state media", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/14/arturo-martinez-of-texas-slams-us-on-north-korean-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/north-korea-americanjpeg-0f2a6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/north-korea-americanjpeg-0f2a6.jpg", "description": "Arturo Pierre Martinez, of El Paso, Texas, appeared on North Korean state media on Sunday to denounce the United States for alleged human rights violations.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Arturo Martinez of Texas slams U.S. on North Korean state media"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Arturo Pierre Martinez, CNN, North Korea"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac04\"", "article_summary": "Arturo Pierre Martinez, of El Paso, Texas, appeared on North Korean state media on Sunday to denounce the United States for alleged human rights violations.\nIn his statement, Mr. Martinez praised North Korea and slammed U.S. policies as unfair.\nHis mother, Patricia Eugenia Martinez, told CNN that her son is bipolar and was hospitalized before for trying to enter North Korea.\nHe said the electoral system in the United States \u201cis unfairly built for the benefit of the wealthy through the necessity of costly fundraising for political candidates seeking office.\nMr. Martinez, 29, said he illegally crossed into the country by crossing the river border with China, but said he has not been detained and is seeking asylum in Venezuela, the Associated Press reported."}
