The decisions they make are often more strongly influenced by fear or a friend\u2019s experience than by a thorough understanding of the benefits and risks of mammography.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women ages 50-74 be screened with mammography every two years and that biennial screening of women younger than 50 be considered case by case. There is no good evidence on whether women older than 75 should be screened, the task force said.\n\nYet, screening rates have not declined.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, free screening mammography is available to all women every one to two years.\n\nBut is this really free, in the fullest sense of the word? Many experts cite hidden costs \u2014 financial, medical and emotional.\n\nBefore deciding to have a mammogram \u2014 every year, every two years, starting at 40 or 50, or not at all \u2014 you should consider the possible risks and whether they are outweighed by the expected benefits.\n\nFull disclosure: Fifteen years ago, a sonogram revealed an early invasive cancer in my left breast. The cancer was not seen on the mammogram, but had I not gone for one, that sonogram would not have been done to see why I had pain in my breast.\n\nThere is no way to know whether my cancer would have disappeared or would have eventually claimed my life, but once I knew it was there, a decision to have it removed was inescapable.\n\nDespite the controversy about annual mammograms, I still advocate them. But it behooves every woman to be aware of the arguments for and against annual screening. Too few are equipped to evaluate what Dr. Lisa Rosenbaum, a national correspondent for The New England Journal of Medicine, has called \u201cconsiderable uncertainty and complex trade-offs.\u201d\n\nAlthough expert groups have issued guidelines based on reviews of the scientific evidence, disagreements among them persist, the result of differing professional perspectives, financial concerns and assessments of the medical consequences.\n\nDespite the task force guideline, the American Cancer Society, the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging continue to recommend yearly mammograms starting at 40 for women at average risk for breast cancer.\n\nThe college maintains that screening is largely responsible for the 30 percent decline in the breast cancer death rate since 1990, though advances in treatment have certainly played a role. But a recent review of the available evidence by researchers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston suggested that regular screening accounted for only a 19 percent reduction overall in breast cancer mortality.\n\nSo what are the downsides of regular screening? A false-positive result \u2014 a suspicious image on mammography that turns out to be nothing \u2014 is a major one.\n\nIf a 50-year-old woman is screened annually for a decade, she has a 50 percent chance of receiving a false-positive diagnosis somewhere along the way, according to Dr. H. Gilbert Welch and Honor J. Passow of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.\n\nThe woman receiving a false-positive diagnosis may need only a repeat examination, which may show the initial result to have been wrong. But if that, too, looks suspicious, a biopsy must be done, which happens to 2 percent of women screened.\n\nThe lesion might turn out to be benign; still, the patient has endured considerable anxiety, inconvenience and expense.\n\nAnd what if the biopsy reveals a malignancy? Then the patient faces another possible consequence of screening: overtreatment.\n\nThere are lingering questions about whether every cancer detected really warrants treatment and how extensive the treatment should be. Some cancers don\u2019t progress, some may even disappear on their own, and others may grow so slowly they would not become a problem during the remaining years of life. But doctors cannot tell with certainty which cancers are safe to leave untreated.\n\nRosenbaum cited a survey in which more than 99 percent of women knew mammography could result in a false-positive diagnosis, but only 38 percent believed this possibility should be weighed in decisions about whether to have the test.\n\nEven among those who had a false-positive result, \u201cmore than 90 percent still believed that mammography could not harm a woman who ended up not having breast cancer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe seemly contradictory responses are part of \u201cthe tangled nature of emotions and values\u201d that women bring to mammography, Rosenbaum wrote.\n\nOne study of women in their 40s found that advising them to delay screening until they were 50 only strengthened their desire for screening. Some believed the task force guideline was an attempt to lower insurance costs and keep them from receiving needed care.\n\nDecisions relating to breast cancer are often based more on emotion than reasoning. Unrelenting publicity by well-meaning organizations has frightened many women, who are inclined to accept more risk than they might in, say, screenings for heart disease \u2014 which actually kills more women than breast cancer.\n\nAnd too many have seen firsthand the devastation breast cancer can wreak.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/hfbrody18.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd110e\"", "article_summary": "Decisions relating to breast cancer are often based more on emotion than reasoning.\nAnd too many have seen firsthand the devastation breast cancer can wreak.\nAmerican women face conflicting advice about whether to be screened for breast cancer, at what age and how often.\nDespite the task force guideline, the American Cancer Society, the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging continue to recommend yearly mammograms starting at 40 for women at average risk for breast cancer.\nBut if that, too, looks suspicious, a biopsy must be done, which happens to 2 percent of women screened."}
