And I can\u2019t think of a better question to decide this primary.\u201d\n\nCruz went on to tout his record as an uncompromising fighter in trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, stop President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration and, most recently, attempting to kill federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nHe criticized the rest of the Republican contenders for president for talking about taking on the group but not following through with action.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like they were in witness protection,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s presidential forum at Prestonwood Baptist Church, Cruz said his rivals left him alone in battle.\n\n\u201cHow different it would have been if 11 Republican presidential candidates descended on Washington and spoke in unison and said \u2026 don\u2019t send $500 million of taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz\u2019s dance with Trump is a study in high-wire politics.\n\nIn heaping praise on The Donald, he avoids the backlash that has befallen candidates like Rick Perry and Jeb Bush.\n\nThe former Texas governor was one of the earliest candidates to counterattack Trump, and he became the first contender to drop from the race.\n\nBush, the former Florida governor, has seen his poll numbers plummet amid a sustained war of words with Trump.\n\nCruz has taken a different approach. But while his kind words have made him Trump\u2019s buddy, it hasn\u2019t translated to movement in the polls.\n\nHe knows that at some point, he must make a clear distinction between him and Trump. If not, Trump could win the race.\n\nOn Sunday, Cruz said he was perfectly positioned for the nomination, \u2014 unlike his rivals, including retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\n\u201cI like Donald Trump. I like Ben Carson,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other candidates in this field that throw rocks. I have not been one of them. Indeed, I regularly sing their praises.\u201d\n\nBut he predicted GOP voters want \u201ca consistent conservative, someone who\u2019s been the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nCruz has used the term \u201cconsistent conservative\u201d in the past. And it\u2019s clear he\u2019s suggesting that Trump isn\u2019t one.\n\n\u201cThe reason that I believe our campaign is getting so much energy and momentum on the ground is that there\u2019s between candidates who talk the talk and those who have actually walked the walk and have stood and fought over and over,\u201d he said.\n\nHear that, Donald Trump?\n\nNotes\n\nGOP contenders visit Texas for fundraisers\n\nThe Republican contenders for president haven\u2019t lost their insatiable appetite for Texas cash.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was in Dallas on Monday for fundraisers. On Wednesday, his Sunshine State brother, Sen. Marco Rubio, is at the Park Cities Club for a fundraiser.\n\nMeanwhile, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is in Fort Worth and Plano on Tuesday selling and signing copies of his new book, A More Perfect Union.\n\nAt 11:30 a.m. he\u2019s at the Barnes & Noble at 4801 Overton Ridge Blvd. Then at 3:30 p.m. he\u2019s at the Sam\u2019s Club at 301 Coit Road in Plano.\n\nBid to block map could delay March primaries\n\nA group of plaintiffs have asked a federal court to prevent the 2016 Texas congressional elections from being held under boundaries set by the Legislature in 2013.\n\nThe federal panel in San Antonio is considering whether maps created in 2011 violated the voting rights of Hispanics and African-Americans. Plaintiffs in that suit point out that the redistricting plan signed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2013 has similarities to the 2011 plan, including potential voting rights violations in South, Central and North Texas.\n\nIf the court approves the motion, it could result in a delay of the March 1 Texas primaries, though the judges could seek an expedited solution that would result in the election going forward as planned.\n\nCandidates can start filing for Texas primary races next month.\n\nIn 2012 the Texas presidential primary was delayed because of a redistricting fight. What was supposed to be a March primary occurred on May 31, with the runoff at the end of July. That delay was instrumental in Ted Cruz\u2019s defeat of then Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the Republican race for Senate.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@gromerjeffers", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texan isn\u2019t criticizing the front-runner but touts himself as a consistent conservative and a fighter.", "og": {"description": "The Texan isn\u2019t criticizing the front-runner but touts himself as a consistent conservative and a fighter.", "title": "Jeffers: Ted Cruz keeping enemy close, subtly drawing distinctions with Trump", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20151019-jeffers-ted-cruz-keeping-enemy-close-subtly-drawing-distinctions-with-trump.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/national-politics/20151019-republicanforum_011.ece/BINARY/original/RepublicanForum_011", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-10-20T04:16:26Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-10-20T04:02:22Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jeffers: Ted Cruz keeping enemy close, subtly drawing distinctions with Trump\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20151019-jeffers-ted-cruz-keeping-enemy-close-subtly-drawing-distinctions-with-trump.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/national-politics/20151019-republicanforum_011.ece/BINARY/original/RepublicanForum_011\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2493185\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-10-20T04:02:22Z\", \"section\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/national-politics/20151019-republicanforum_011.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/RepublicanForum_011", "publishtime": "2015-10-20T04:02:22Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz\u2019s admiration for rival Donald Trump has its limits.\n\u201cI like Donald Trump.\nHear that, Donald Trump?\nCandidates can start filing for Texas primary races next month.\nAt Sunday\u2019s presidential forum at Prestonwood Baptist Church, Cruz said his rivals left him alone in battle."}
