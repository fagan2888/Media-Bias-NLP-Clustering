While many factors contributed to the decline, officials say the health law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level has played a role.\n\nGoing forward, other health law provisions will likely contribute to further reductions in preterm births, defined as live births at less than 37 full weeks, women\u2019s health advocates suggest.\n\n\u201cThis decline can\u2019t be attributed to the marketplaces, which haven\u2019t even had a full year of enrollment yet,\u201d says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes. \u201cBut there were places that did the Medicaid expansion earlier,\u201d after the law passed in 2010.\n\nSo far, 27 states and the District of Columbia have decided to expand their state Medicaid programs to adults as permitted under the health law.\n\nThe report card measures states\u2019 preterm birth rates against the March of Dimes\u2019 9.6 percent goal and assigns letter grades. This year, grades for 27 states improved from the previous year. The United States\u2019 11.4 percent rate earned it a \u201cC\u201d grade.\n\nMore from this series\n\nPreterm birth is the number one cause of death in newborns. In 2013, more than 450,000 babies were born prematurely.\n\nThe report card tracks states\u2019 progress in implementing strategies that reduce the risk of preterm birth. In 2013, 30 states and the District of Columbia reduced the percentage of women of childbearing age who were uninsured. The percentage of younger women who smoke fell in 34 states and the District, and the late preterm birth rate, meaning babies born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation, came down in 30 states.\n\nThe health law\u2019s expansion of public and private health insurance coverage to millions of women will likely have the largest impact on reducing preterm births, says Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and education organization. Pregnant women who meet their state\u2019s income eligibility standards (typically at or near 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $23,340), can receive Medicaid services until 60 days after they give birth, but more consistent coverage helps ensure that women are healthy before they become pregnant and that they receive early prenatal care.\n\nOther health law provisions will make inroads as well, according to Sonfield, who authored a Guttmacher brief on pregnancy-related services shortly after the law passed in 2010. Maternity and newborn care is now required coverage in plans sold on the individual and small group markets. A range of preventive services must be provided free of charge to pregnant women, including folic acid supplements, smoking cessation counseling, screening for gestational diabetes and prenatal care.\n\n\u201cBetter access to insurance helps you plan and space your pregnancies, and better access to preventive care helps make sure you\u2019re healthy\u201d before and between pregnancies, says Sonfield.\n\nPlease contact Kaiser Health News to send comments or ideas for future topics for the Insuring Your Health column.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: States Not Expanding Medicaid States Not Expanding Medicaid\n\n1 of 25 Under the Affordable Care Act, 24 states have opted not to expand Medicaid to those making no more than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, leaving roughly 5.7 low-income Americans uninsured.
