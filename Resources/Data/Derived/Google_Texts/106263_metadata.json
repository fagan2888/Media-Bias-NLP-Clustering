As a result, UnitedHealth may exit the program's exchanges as early as 2017, when federal backstops to help insurance companies are set to expire.\n\nAnd Yevgeniy Feyman, fellow and deputy director of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Medical Progress, says it's a real possibility that others will follow suit.\n\n\"The real danger here isn't that particular plans will stop being available; the danger is that this reduces competition on the exchanges,\" Feyman explains.\n\n\"In the case of United, some researchers last year did a study, and they found that in exchanges where UnitedHealth didn't participate, premiums were a little over five percent higher than they otherwise would have been. So just the participation of this one, massive insurer keeps premiums lower.\"\n\nFeyman\n\nMeanwhile, Feyman advises people with non-ObamaCare plans, or those who lack health insurance in general, to take note.\n\n\"This really impacts everyone, because at some point \u2026 anyone might end up having to buy a plan on the exchange or on the individual market,\" he warns. \"If you lose your job, if you don't pay for COBRA coverage, you might end up having to get coverage through the exchange or just on the individual market.\"\n\n\"So this is something everyone should be paying attention to,\" Feyman concludes. \"Even if they don't have an ObamaCare plan now, there is always the possibility they will in the future.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2015/11/23/why-everyone-should-watch-unitedhealth-group", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5935599/obamacare-logo_800x500.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "A free-market think tank sees a real danger in insurance companies thinking of getting out of ObamaCare exchanges.", "title": "Why everyone should watch UnitedHealth Group"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5935599/obamacare-logo_800x500.jpg", "description": "A free-market think tank sees a real danger in insurance companies thinking of getting out of ObamaCare exchanges.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why everyone should watch UnitedHealth Group"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A free-market think tank sees a real danger in insurance companies thinking of getting out of ObamaCare exchanges."}, "article_summary": "As reported by the Washington Examiner and other outlets, UnitedHealth Group has cut its earnings outlook, citing new problems related to the Affordable Care Act.\nA free-market think tank sees a real danger in insurance companies thinking of getting out of ObamaCare exchanges.\n\"The real danger here isn't that particular plans will stop being available; the danger is that this reduces competition on the exchanges,\" Feyman explains.\nAs a result, UnitedHealth may exit the program's exchanges as early as 2017, when federal backstops to help insurance companies are set to expire.\nAnd Yevgeniy Feyman, fellow and deputy director of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Medical Progress, says it's a real possibility that others will follow suit."}
