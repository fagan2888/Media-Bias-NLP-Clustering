PHOTO BY SARAH ALVARADO\n\nSAN BERNARDINO >> Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s revised two-year budget plan drew about 25 noontime demonstrators in front of City Hall Friday.\n\nFor Martha Garcia, 41, of Rialto, the neglected issue was a lack of health care provisions for in-home care providers, who made up the majority of those speaking at a rally on the stairs in front of the pond at the northeast side of the building.\n\n\u201cOur work is hard and demanding,\u201d said Garcia, a member of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 2015, which sponsored the rally.\n\nBrown unveiled his revised state budget proposal Friday, revealing a $122.2 billion plan that is slightly smaller than the $122.6 billion outline announced in January. Revenue estimates were lowered by $1.9 billion to reflect drops in sales and income tax receipts.\n\nThe governor has taken a stand against new spending and instead called for saving in the event of another economic slump.\n\nGarcia explained that she has concerns about diabetes in older age, as both her parents have high medical expenses because of the disease. Her husband, who works as an assembler in a Chino factory, does not have health insurance from his employer, she said.\n\nThe couple has not looked into insurance options resulting from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGarcia said she makes $10 per hour, after starting at $7.11 per hour about 15 years ago.\n\nAlso at the rally, Christina Duran, 61, said she is no longer able to work because after 15 years in home health care, has lost most of the use of her left arm.\n\n\u201cI lifted a lot of patients with no help. People don\u2019t realize how hard our job is,\u201d said Duran, who lives in Riverside.\n\nStaff Writer Jeff Horseman contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN BERNARDINO >> Gov.
