A positive or negative attitude can filter from the top down and reach every employee. A recent study published in Health Affairs found that when it comes to a hospital\u2019s performance on clinical quality metrics, the facility\u2019s management and/or board of directors can have a huge influence.\n\nPerformance practices\n\n\u201cWe found a strong and statistically significant relationship between hospital management practices and quality of hospital care. Hospitals with higher quality management practices also delivered higher quality of care,\u201d said lead study author Thomas C. Tsai, MD, MPH, a research associate in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a resident in the Department of Surgery at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between management practices and quality of care, Tsai and his colleagues looked at World Management Survey data from the United States and England. They found that hospitals that had higher quality care had better performance across four domains of management practice\u2014operations, monitoring, targets, and human resources.\n\n\u201cFor operations, better quality hospitals had strategies for patient flow and strategic rationales for clinical care pathways,\u201d said Tsai in an interview with Pharmacy Today. \u201cFor monitoring, better quality hospitals had a higher degree of performance tracking and consequence management.\u201d\n\nHe added that for targets, better quality hospitals were more able to balance multiple targets and convey to the staff the goals of targets. For human resources, better quality hospitals were more likely to reward high performers as well as have protocols for recruiting and retaining high-performing staff.\n\nHospital pharmacy leadership\n\nAccording to Tsai, while most efforts at quality improvement have focused on tracking and incentivizing physician performance, the study suggests that hospital leadership and management practices may be an important and underrecognized contribution to the variation in hospital quality. \u201cSimilarly, hospital pharmacy leadership has an important role to play,\u201d said Tsai. \u201cAs we move to focusing on value instead of volume, thoughtful decisions about cost-effectiveness of treatments and how to better coordinate care transitions will necessarily need to involve hospital pharmacy leadership.\u201d\n\nHospital pharmacists are already taking leadership roles in national programs that resulted from the Affordable Care Act. Tsai explained that as a result of the Hospitals Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), all-cause readmission rates in the Medicare population have fallen to 18.5% from a baseline of 19.5%.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most impressive about the reduction in readmission rates is that the reduction is not only for the three conditions initially included in the HRRP\u2014acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia\u2014but for all clinical conditions,\u201d explained Tsai. \u201cThis means that health care overall is becoming more efficient.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that pharmacists can play a key role in providing better medication reconciliation and after-hospital care plans. \u201cEspecially for older patients with multiple medical conditions, better education on how to properly take medications and anticipated side effects could help prevent complications that develop from poor medication adherence or polypharmacy,\u201d said Tsai.\n\nEmerging pharmacy opportunities\n\nWith more hospitals focusing on the value of health care, Tsai believes that pharmacists will continue to play a collaborative role in helping to shape formularies and clinical guidelines for expensive medications.\n\n\u201cJust as physicians are embracing new ways to coordinate the care of patients and follow-up after discharge, there may be innovative ways for hospital-based pharmacists to similarly collaborate with community-based pharmacists to ensure more seamless transitions from the hospital,\u201d said Tsai.\n\nAs hospitals move toward team-based care, hospital pharmacists can play an \u201cimportant collaborative role to proactively anticipate side effects of medications and being part of the discussion in determining optimal treatment regimens,\u201d said Tsai.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "It is well known that a company\u2019s leadership can set the tone for the entire organization.
