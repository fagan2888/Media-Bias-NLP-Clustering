But most Americans have paid little attention to how the changes taking place can affect their health insurance coverage.\n\nDespite the media frenzy, findings from the Health Reform Monitoring Survey show that only about a third of adults have heard some or a lot about the Marketplaces, and only a quarter have heard about the Medicaid expansion to low-income adults. Even for the more well-known ACA provisions, such as the expansion of dependent coverage to 26 year olds, the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions, and the individual mandate, only about 50 percent report having heard much about those changes.\n\nThis gap in awareness of the ACA\u2019s coverage provisions may be as much to blame as the widely publicized IT problems in driving the low levels of Marketplace enrollment. As shown in the figure below, only 24.3 percent of young adults (age 18 to 30) in the target population for the Marketplaces\u2014defined as adults with incomes above 138 percent of the federal poverty level who are either uninsured or who have private non-group coverage\u2014were aware of the availability of subsidies for coverage purchased through the Marketplace, compared to 43.6 percent of adults age 50 to 64.\n\nFurther, only 25.4 percent of young adults in the target population were aware of the availability of the Marketplaces themselves. Only 40.9 percent were aware of the individual mandate.\n\nExpanding enrollment in the Marketplaces and Medicaid will require more than improving the websites. Policymakers will need to put targeted outreach and education efforts in place to increase awareness of the ACA coverage options, particularly among young adults. The first step is making sure they are aware of their options, and the administration is already making strides toward that goal.\n\nHowever, the job isn\u2019t over when these young adults know about their coverage options. Many of them simply know very little about health insurance, and will need help choosing a health plan that best meets their needs.\n\nWhen asked about their understanding of key health insurance terms, fewer than a third (29.0 percent) of young adults in the HRMS were very or somewhat confident in their understanding of nine key health insurance concepts, well below the 50.1% for older adults. The results suggest that they don\u2019t understand the factors that are essential for choosing health insurance coverage that will meet their needs.\n\nThey were also much less likely to say they that would look for information from Consumer Reports or from a health insurance plan, insurance agent, or broker, and more likely to say that they would look to family members, friends and coworkers, or to their employer or a family member\u2019s employer when choosing a health insurance plan. To address these knowledge gaps, outreach efforts geared toward making young adults aware of the ACA will need to be combined with education efforts that help them enroll in appropriate plans.\n\nThe acrimony about who\u2019s to blame for IT problems should not obscure the need for more and better outreach and education. Well-functioning websites won\u2019t solve the enrollment problem if the target population isn\u2019t aware of the Marketplace and lacks the confidence to enroll, make choices, and pay their premiums.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/02/12/low-aca-knowledge-and-health-literacy-hinder-young-adult-marketplace-enrollment/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Low ACA Knowledge And Health Literacy Hinder Young Adult Marketplace Enrollment"}, "description": "Low ACA Knowledge And Health Literacy Hinder Young Adult Marketplace Enrollment | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfad0\"", "article_summary": "But most Americans have paid little attention to how the changes taking place can affect their health insurance coverage.\nThe results suggest that they don\u2019t understand the factors that are essential for choosing health insurance coverage that will meet their needs.\nMany of them simply know very little about health insurance, and will need help choosing a health plan that best meets their needs.\nPolicymakers will need to put targeted outreach and education efforts in place to increase awareness of the ACA coverage options, particularly among young adults.\nFurther, only 25.4 percent of young adults in the target population were aware of the availability of the Marketplaces themselves."}
