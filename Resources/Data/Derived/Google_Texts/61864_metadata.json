During the six months, Iran will limit its uranium enrichment to 5-percent, the level commonly used to power reactors. The fact that Iran is allowed to enrich uranium at all was a hard-fought point won by Iran\u2019s allies on the U.N. Security Council, Russia and China, reports the Washington Post.\n\nIran must also make sure its current stockpile of 20-percent enriched uranium is either destoryed or put into a different form so it cannot be used for further enrichment, and essentially freeze much of its critical program by dismantling certain aspects of the Arak plutonium plant and stop adding centrifuges to its plants in Attans and Fordo.\n\nDuring this interim period, inspectors from the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) will start verifying the roll back is being done.\n\nIn return, Iran will get about US$4.2 billion of previously frozen oil revenue over the six-month period. The first installment of US$550 million will be released on February 1, reports the Associated Press. The payments are contingent upon Iran\u2019s compliance with the agreement.\n\nNew sanctions and other measures will not be imposed on Iran\u2019s hard-hit currency, reports Now Media.\n\nSunday\u2019s agreement also means that from January 20, the clock starts ticking on negotiations with Iran for a final comprehensive agreement which would hopefully end all international doubts about Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nOnce Iran has met that final point, all the international sanctions levied against Iran would be lifted, and Iran would be viewed as any other nation that has signed on to the non-proliferation treaty.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Katherine Ashton welcomed an invitation to visit Iran to begin hammering out the details of the final deal, her spokesman Michael Mann confirmed late Sunday.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the deal.\n\n\u201cAs the United States has made clear many times, our absoute top priority in these negotiations, is preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, translated making absolutely clear, beyond any doubt, that Iran\u2019s program is a peaceful program,\u201d Secretary Kerry said during a press conference.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear all along. President Obama initiated this effort with the belief that diplomacy is our preferred path, because other options carry much greater costs and risks, and are less likley to provide a lasting solution.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama remained cautiously optimistic, saying in a statement that he has \u201cno illusions about how hard it will be to achieve the objective\u201d of a final deal with Iran.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iran and the P5+1 nations agreed on Sunday to begin a 6-month interim period that may lead to a peaceful resolution over the Islamic republic's disputed nuclear", "og": {"site_name": "The Right Perspective", "description": "Iran and the P5+1 nations agreed on Sunday to begin a 6-month interim period that may lead to a peaceful resolution over the Islamic republic's disputed nuclear program.", "title": "Iran, P5+1 Set Date On Nuclear Deal", "url": "http://www.therightperspective.org/2014/01/12/iran-p51-set-date-on-nuclear-deal/", "image": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRP_Logo_100x1001.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.therightperspective.org", "description": "Iran and the P5+1 nations agreed on Sunday to begin a 6-month interim period that may lead to a peaceful resolution over the Islamic republic's disputed nuclear program.", "title": "Iran, P5+1 Set Date On Nuclear Deal", "image": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRP_Logo_100x1001.jpg", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/newsguy2005", "site": "@http://www.twitter.com/newsguy2005", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-TRP_Logo_512x512-270x270.jpg", "keywords": "iran,p5+1,civilian nuclear program,nuclear enrichment,john kerry,obama,katherine ashton,p5 + 1,middle east,the new cold war", "article": {"tag": "the new cold war", "published_time": "2014-01-12T20:58:18Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-12T20:58:18Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd05e\"", "article_summary": "Iran and the P5+1 nations agreed on Sunday to begin a 6-month interim period that may lead to a peaceful resolution over the Islamic republic\u2019s disputed nuclear program.\nEU foreign policy chief Katherine Ashton welcomed an invitation to visit Iran to begin hammering out the details of the final deal, her spokesman Michael Mann confirmed late Sunday.\nDuring the six months, Iran will limit its uranium enrichment to 5-percent, the level commonly used to power reactors.\nSunday\u2019s agreement also means that from January 20, the clock starts ticking on negotiations with Iran for a final comprehensive agreement which would hopefully end all international doubts about Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nA date of January 20 was announced as the start of the period, which came out of the much-ballyhooed Geneva deal reached on November 24 of last year."}
