Burwell in June. The case argues that the tax subsidies given to individuals who are enrolled in the federal exchange are illegal. This bill would allow an individual that loses his or her tax credits to receive the subsidy through 2017.\n\nThe Preserving Freedom and Choice in Health Care Act is meant to ensure individuals can keep their plans during the transition period, which is expected to last two years. According to the co-sponsors, this bill confers freedom to develop alternatives for the American people and repeals the employer and individual mandates. It additionally permits health care plans that Obamacare restrictions would have canceled to continue until 2017.\n\n\u201cWe need commonsense solutions that improve the cost and quality of health care through competition and choice, rather than imposing job-killing taxes, mandates and penalties on the American people,\u201d Isakson said.\n\n\u201cAll Americans want and deserve quality, affordable health care, and we continue to see that Obamacare fails to deliver on those promises,\u201d stated Perdue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) decided to co-sponsor legislation to prevent Americans from any more negative effects of Obamacare if the United States Supreme Court were to rule against the administration, holding a key component of Obamacare unconstitutional.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) decided to co-sponsor legislation to prevent Americans from any more negative effects of Obamacare if the United States Supreme Court were to rule against the administration, holding a key component of Obamacare unconstitutional.", "title": "Sens Perdue, Isakson Push Repeal of Obamacare Mandates", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/23/senators-perdue-and-isakson-push-repeal-of-obamacare-mandates/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) decided to co-sponsor legislation to prevent Americans from any more negative effects of Obamacare if the United States Supreme Court were to rule against the administration, holding a key component of Obamacare unconstitutional.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "title": "Sens Perdue, Isakson Push Repeal of Obamacare Mandates", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, healthcare, individual mandate, obamacare, Obamacare Tax, repeal obamacare,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "repeal obamacare", "published_time": "2015-04-23T15:30:39-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cAll Americans want and deserve quality, affordable health care, and we continue to see that Obamacare fails to deliver on those promises,\u201d stated Perdue.\nIt additionally permits health care plans that Obamacare restrictions would have canceled to continue until 2017.\nThe Supreme Court is set to decide King v.
