John Boehner, R-Ohio, removed from his position as House speaker.\n\nBoehner has lost the confidence of his own party voters, according to the telephone survey conducted Dec. 26-30 by pollster Pat Caddell on behalf of People\u2019s Poll.\n\nThe national poll reveals that only 25 percent of GOP voters would vote to keep Boehner.\n\nThe official speaker\u2019s election is scheduled for Jan. 6.\n\nJOIN THE DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW CAMPAIGN.\n\nAsked if they believed Boehner has been ineffective at opposing Obama\u2019s agenda, a full 64 percent of voters agreed.\n\n\u201c[N]o respected party leader has polled this low among his own party\u2019s voters unless he was embroiled in a major personal scandal,\u201d wrote the Conservative Review.\n\n\u201cWith 60% of Republican voters desiring a more conservative Speaker, what does this mean for John Boehner next Tuesday \u2013 when members of the House will cast votes for the next Speaker? And how can Boehner continue to lead the opposition to President Obama when he has lost the confidence of his own party?\u201d\n\nAs WND reported, the idea of Republicans in the U.S. House not having Boehner as speaker come next week is catching on in the media, too.\n\nFox News reported on Tuesday about North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones\u2019 comments before Christmas that there was a \u201csmall group, and we \u2013 about 16, 18 \u2013 and we\u2019re hoping to have a name of a sitting member of Congress that we can call out their name.\u201d\n\nOnly hours earlier, the Daily Caller had cited the same local radio interview, which was reported by Buzzfeed at the time.\n\nBut WND had reported on Dec. 19 on Jones\u2019 comments, as part of the publicity over the new DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW CAMPAIGN, which encourages constituents to let all 247 GOP members of the House majority know they need to pick another speaker for the coming Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s because of Boehner\u2019s decision not to fight Barack Obama\u2019s amnesty and Obamacare, both of which now are funded through 2015, even though the GOP will hold the majority in both the House and the Senate \u2013 a stunning victory handed to the party by voters \u2013 starting next week.\n\nBizPacReview notes that there\u2019s been talk of Boehner\u2019s removal before, but there\u2019s been no action.\n\nThe report points out now there would need to be only 30 conservative GOP members denying Boehner their votes for him to face removal.\n\n\u201cBoehner spokesman Michael Steel indicated that the speaker is not concerned by the challenge,\u201d the report said. \u201c\u2018Rep. Boehner was selected as the House Republican Conference\u2019s choice for speaker last month,\u2019 Steel wrote in an email, \u2018and he expects to be elected by the whole House next week.\u2019\n\n\u201cPerhaps he shouldn\u2019t be so confident,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe DUMP BOEHNER campaign already has lined up more than half-a-million letters that are scheduled for delivery to GOP members of the House as soon as members convene next week.\n\nAnd it\u2019s earned the support of the founder of Tea Party Nation, one of the organizations that helped rouse the American electorate in 2010 and give the GOP control of the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Judson Phillips told WND Monday. \u201cI want people storming the halls of Congress. Melting the phone lines and anything else.\n\n\u201cSo, I love [WND CEO Joseph Farah\u2019s] letter writing idea.\u201d\n\nIt was in a commentary in the Washington Times, Phillips explained why he thinks Boehner should be replaced.\n\n\u201cA month after its incredible victory, the GOP squandered its mandate, surrendering to the Democrats,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe GOP-led House of Representatives did not proclaim its mandate and hold off on major decisions until the Republican majority in the Senate was sworn in. No, they went to the GOP position of preemptive surrender and gave President Obama and the Democrats almost everything they wanted.\n\n\u201cDespite the pleas and demands from the base, the GOP did nothing to stop Mr. Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. They even rewarded left-wing billionaires who had spent millions to keep the Democrats in power by extending so-called \u2018Green Energy\u2019 subsidies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe architect of the Republican surrender was House Speaker John Boehner.\u201d\n\nDespite Boehner\u2019s earlier reliance on the tea party, as soon as he was in office, he ignored the movement, Phillips wrote.\n\n\u201cMr. Boehner made the obligatory statements about cutting spending and reducing Obamacare. Yet time after time, when the occasion called for him to stand and fight, he chose surrender,\u201d he wrote. \u201c2014 is almost over and 2015 is almost here. The first order of business for the House of Representatives in 2015 is to elect a new Speaker of the House.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be John Boehner.\u201d\n\nActually, there are more than 510,000 letters that already have been put into the pipeline for delivery. They would make up a stack nearly 167 feet tall.\n\nOn Twitter, the hashtags #BoehnerMustGo and #DumpBoehner have been surging, and other commentators, while not adopting the specific Don\u2019t be Yellow, Dump Boehner Now! campaign, agree with the goal.\n\nAt the American Thinker blog, Layne Hansen wrote: \u201cIt is time to stop thinking of John Boehner and the rest of the Republican congressional leadership as being cowardly and recognize them for what they are: part of The Ruling Class that believes it has the right to tell the rest of us how to live.\n\n\u201cThe current GOP leadership has got to go; this has ceased to be an arguable point. We cannot count on these people to do what is right. Conservatives did not give them majorities in both chambers for them to keep playing the same game,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd at RedState.com, Editor Erick Erickson also delivered a \u201cno-other-options\u201d message.\n\nJOIN THE DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW CAMPAIGN.\n\n\u201cHouse conservatives must summon the courage to oppose Boehner\u2019s nomination on the floor in January. It is a moral imperative. You cannot consistently complain about leadership\u2019s many failures \u2013 and the treachery involved with a speaker fresh off a successful wave election conspiring with President Obama to fund amnesty and enjoy a celebratory phone call in the aftermath \u2013 and then vote for him to continue in this role. To paraphrase Albert Einstein, that is the definition of insanity, and it is enabled by a vote for Rep. John Boehner,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCritics of Boehner\u2019s actions are responding to the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Yellow: Dump Boehner Campaign\u201d from WND founder Joseph Farah for voters to let the majority members know their thoughts on the issues of amnesty and Obamacare, which both were funded into 2015 in a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill agreed to by Boehner.\n\nFarah said he expects, based on early reaction, to generate millions of letters in time for delivery when the new Congress opens its session this month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from the viral nature of this campaign that millions of Americans, mostly Republicans, by the way, would like to put coal in Boehner\u2019s stocking this year. And they\u2019d like him to accept the gift as just another member of the House of Representatives rather than as its leader,\u201d Farah said.\n\nThe innovative campaign that allows anyone to send a form letter on yellow paper to every Republican member of the House was organized quickly in response to growing anger and frustration from GOP voters. They felt betrayed by Boehner and his leadership team over what Farah characterizes as \u201chis capitulation to Obamacare and the unconstitutional amnesty executive action, which were both fully funded by House Republicans who were voted into office to do just the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the news cycle has forgotten about Boehner\u2019s betrayal of Republican voters in November, the grass-roots electorate has not,\u201d said Farah. Americans, he said, \u201care angry enough at the Republican establishment to put their money where their mouth is \u2013 investing in this unusual lobbying effort to wake up House members as to the state of their leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cWill Republican House members respond in January? At the very least, they won\u2019t be able to ignore the deluge of mail that awaits them,\u201d he said.\n\nJOIN THE DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW CAMPAIGN.\n\n\u201cYou can order your letters sent today, and they will be ready for delivery when the new Congress reconvenes. It would be great to see thousands or, better yet, tens of thousands flooding in that first week. That will make an impression that cannot be ignored by Republican members of the House,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited. Now it\u2019s up to you. I\u2019ve already ordered my letters. I\u2019ve even secured the domain names DumpBoehnerCampaign.com and DumpBoehnerNow.com for social media dissemination. Tell your friends,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRecruit your friends, neighbors, and fellow commuters to the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Yellow: Dump Boehner Now\u201d campaign with this exclusive bumper sticker.\n\nThe letter explains to members of the U.S. House that two issues have \u201cprompted Americans to turn in droves to the Republican Party in November 2014 \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s blatantly unconstitutional executive action to provide amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, and the deliberately deceptive restructuring of America\u2019s health-care system through Obamacare, which threatens to unravel the greatest health delivery system in the world.\u201d\n\nPointing out that Republicans before the election \u201csolemnly vowed to STOP this lame-duck president,\u201d the letter states: \u201cNow you have the power, right and duty to stop him.\n\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t happen with John Boehner leading you. You know this to be true. The trillion-dollar budget deal is just the latest proof that Boehner is not capable of leading the House to victory during this critical period.\u201d\n\nFarah noted that the launch of the program rivals the historic \u201cPink Slip Campaign\u201d in 2010 that generated some 9.5 million letters to Congress.\n\n\u201cAmericans are angry about Boehner\u2019s betrayal of the voters who gave him a bigger majority in the House and Republicans control of the Senate. This could prove to be Boehner\u2019s undoing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe campaign allows people to send letters, with their own names and addresses via FedEx, all for the one price of $29.95, to each of the House GOP members.\n\nFarah said, \u201cFrom previous campaigns we know this approach prompts members to talk about the boxes of letters that are coming into their offices each day. And that\u2019s exactly what we want to do with the DUMP BOEHNER CAMPAIGN \u2013 a grass-roots lobbying effort that can channel your outrage into effective and meaningful action.\u201d\n\nHe said what can be guaranteed is that members \u201cwill see, hear and feel your participation in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw the same thing in 2010,\u201d recalled Farah. \u201cPeople were angry then. They may be angrier now. It is as if elections have no consequences when Republicans vote.\u201d\n\nA sampling of just how upset people are has been posted online, with abundant promises of \u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d and \u201cDo it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "As Congress gets ready to convene, a new poll shows a full 60 percent of Republican voters want Rep.
