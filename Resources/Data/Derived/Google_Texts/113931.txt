Comedian Jimmy Fallon earlier this week donned a bald cap and a cheap suit, grabbed a bottle of vodka and transformed himself into Russian President Vladimir Putin.

He then picked up a phone and discussed the evolving situation in Crimea and Ukraine with “President Barack Obama.”

As Putin, Fallon not only managed to work in plenty of zingers aimed at Russia’s president, but he also managed to take a few digs at the Affordable Care Act.

“Don’t you see what you’re doing though?” “Obama” asked. “You’re forcing people to accept something that the majority of them don’t even want.”

“Yes,” Fallon’s Putin responded, “in Russia we have word for this: Obamacare.”

“That hurt,” the faux Obama responded.

“Does Obamacare cover burns?” Putin added for good measure.
