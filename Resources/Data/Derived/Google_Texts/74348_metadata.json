I\u2019m watching politicians saying what they\u2019re supposed to say in order to win the backing of some wealthy bullying benefactor, someone who wants politicians to do what they tell them to do, do everything they tell them to do \u2013 a person we would have called back in the sixties - a pig.\n\nThat\u2019s what I see.\n\nAll the people we used to call \u201cpigs\u201d want is what they wanted back in the Vietnam era: they want wars. You can bet on that one. And they want, of course, low taxes and the regulators off their backs. They want our young people to go to the wars they have on their bucket lists; they want old rich people not to have to worry about things like estate taxes.\n\nI\u2019d like to see some character out there, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great for some of the Republican candidates to stand up to the money guys and say: \u201cIf you want a presidential nominee who will do what the Bushes did, go from war to war \u2013 look elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want someone to make the rich richer, find yourself another patsy.\u201d\n\nNow that would be a case of character!", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Let me finish with character...you know, having the courage of your convictions, to go with your guts when the wind is blowing against you.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/let-me-finish-character-politics-today", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Let me finish with character...you know, having the courage of your convictions, to go with your guts when the wind is blowing against you.", "title": "Let Me Finish: Character in politics today", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/let-me-finish-character-politics-today", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/article-teasers/snaps-lmf-still-about-hardball-with-chris-matthews-on-msnbc-hd_be.jpg?itok=nMUNdGpi", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/let-me-finish-character-politics-today", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/article-teasers/snaps-lmf-still-about-hardball-with-chris-matthews-on-msnbc-hd_be.jpg?itok=pE732-QS", "title": "Let Me Finish: Character in politics today", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Let me finish with character...you know, having the courage of your convictions, to go with your guts when the wind is blowing against you."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-19T20:10:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "chrismatthews", "title": "Let Me Finish: Character in politics today", "tags": "hardball-let-me-finish,national-security,hardball", "published": 1, "date": "05/19/2015 20:10:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/let-me-finish-character-politics-today"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Let me finish with character...you know, having the courage of your convictions, to go with your guts when the wind is blowing against you.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "National Security, Hardball Let Me Finish"}, "article_summary": "Let me finish with character\u2026 you know, having the courage of your convictions, to go with your guts when the wind is blowing against you.\nOh, how I wish I could see character in politics today.\nI\u2019d like to see some character out there, wouldn\u2019t you?\nAll the people we used to call \u201cpigs\u201d want is what they wanted back in the Vietnam era: they want wars.\nWhat I see, what I hear through all the noise, is an auctioning of souls."}
