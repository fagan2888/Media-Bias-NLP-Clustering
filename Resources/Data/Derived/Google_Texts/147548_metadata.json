Brian Penoyer, commander of the Coast Guard for Houston-Galveston.\n\nAlmost 100 ships had been waiting to pass since 4,000 barrels of oil leaked into Galveston Bay on Saturday from a barge that collided with a ship.\n\nMore than 500 response workers were at the scene of the spill near Texas City on Monday to assist with the cleanup, officials said. Crews used tens of thousands of feet of containment boom to try to keep the oil away from the shore, but some oil washed up on local beaches.\n\nFerry service between Galveston and Port Bolivar had resumed, the Coast Guard said.\n\nThe spill has prompted concerns about the economic impact to one of the nation\u2019s busiest ports and the environmental effects for wildlife. The shipping channel connects Houston\u2019s oil refineries and other port facilities to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe spill occurred near popular bird sanctuaries on Bolivar Peninsula during the spring migration season. On Monday night, the Coast Guard confirmed that at least 10 birds had died and several others were found covered in oil.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe barge was carrying almost one million gallons of bunker fuel oil, a particularly thick type of oil, but only one tank was breached, officials said. The barge has been removed, and the Coast Guard said it was investigating the cause of the collision.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140325113721, "twitter": {"description": "About 100 ships had been waiting to pass through the Houston Ship Channel, days after a leak of 4,000 barrels of oil in Galveston Bay.", "title": "Shipping Channel Opens Partially After Huge Oil Spill in Galveston Bay", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/us/shipping-channel-still-closed-after-huge-oil-spill-in-galveston-bay.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002786744"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "emmagf", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/us/shipping-channel-still-closed-after-huge-oil-spill-in-galveston-bay.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002786744", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/us/shipping-channel-still-closed-after-huge-oil-spill-in-galveston-bay.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Shipping Channel Opens Partially After Huge Oil Spill in Galveston Bay", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 25, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Oil Spills,Maritime Accidents and Safety,Galveston (Tex),Gulf of Mexico", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Emma G.
