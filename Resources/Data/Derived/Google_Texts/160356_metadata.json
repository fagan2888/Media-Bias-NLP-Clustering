His critics say he'd push the country into recession, or worse.\n\nThis story is part of the Deseret News National Edition , which focuses on the issues that resonate with American families.\n\nFrom the outset, Donald Trump has positioned himself as the brash outsider, the only person running for president who actually understands how the economy works. As The New York Review of Books recently noted, millions of Americans have come to know him as the man they saw on \"The Apprentice:\" \u201cthe business magus, the grand vizier of capitalism, the wise man of the boardroom, a living confection whose every step and word bespoke gravitas and experience and power and authority.\u201d\n\nAnd that may be why, according to recent polls, more Americans trust him on economic issues than they do Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump\u2019s forecast for the future of the U.S. economy is not good. In interviews he has said \u201cwe\u2019re in a bubble\u201d that\u2019s about to burst and we\u2019re headed for a bad recession. But he\u2019s also told the Washington Post: \u201cI can fix it,\u201d he said in April. \u201cI can fix it pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nOver the past few weeks, Trump has begun to explain how he would do just that, or, in Trump parlance, how he would make America great again. The reviews have been mixed: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s economic plans would destroy the U.S. economy,\u201d the Atlantic declared earlier this month. The New York Post took a decidedly different tack: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s policy plans are real, detailed \u2014 and great.\u201d\n\nSo what does Trump actually propose? And would it work?\n\nAs with most Trump policy proposals, his economic plan, on its face at least, is simple and straightforward. According to Trump\u2019s website, \u201ctoo few Americans are working, too many jobs have been shipped overseas, and too many middle-class families can not make ends meet.\u201d He proposes four goals: tax relief for middle Americans, simplifying the tax code, growing the economy by discouraging corporate inversions, and not adding to the national debt.\n\nUnder the Trump plan, \u201cnearly 75 million American households would no longer pay income tax. That\u2019s because anyone who is single and earns less than $25,000 or married and jointly earns less than $50,000 would no longer owe income tax.\u201d Instead, they would \u201cget a new one-page form to send the IRS saying, 'I win.'\u201d\n\nThis would take care of over half of all Americans. The rest would \u201cget a simpler tax code with four brackets \u2014 0 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent \u2014 instead of the current seven\u201d and no business of any size would pay more than 15 percent of its business income in taxes.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Washington Times, Stephen Moore, an economic consultant with Freedom Works, argues that Trump\u2019s tax plan would result in growth and jobs: \u201cThe heart of the Trump tax plan is to cut our business tax from the highest in the world down to 15 percent, making our rate one of the lowest. This will reverse the stampede of businesses fleeing America \u2014 great companies like Burger King and Medtronics. When the businesses come back, so will good-paying middle-class jobs.\u201d\n\nMoore argues that small businesses will benefit too because \u201ctheir tax rate falls from close to 40 percent to 25 percent, because business owners pay taxes at the personal income tax rate. This will allow companies to invest more and hire more workers here at home. Getting rid of tax loopholes will help pay for these reductions.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group, has estimated that Trump\u2019s plan would cut taxes by $11.98 trillion over the next decade, which would \u201clead to an 11 percent growth in the GDP, 6.5 percent higher wages and 29 percent larger capital stock as well as 5.3 million jobs.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch \u2014 unless Trump plans to dramatically cut spending, tax revenues would be short to the tune of $10.14 trillion, according to The Street. Trump has said he\u2019d scrap Obamacare but has only offered vague suggestions of other areas of the federal budget he\u2019d trim, while at the same time suggesting he\u2019d increase military spending and not touch Social Security or Medicare.\n\nThe Trump tax plan would reduce federal revenue by a quarter, said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, to The Street. \u201cIf there weren\u2019t any spending cuts that materialized, you would see the deficit widen substantially the moment the plan was enacted.\u201d\n\nAnd that could set off a chain reaction that would result in recession, or worse. Creditors might demand higher interest rates on U.S. bonds, which could scare off investors.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine markets would react well to it. I can\u2019t imagine global investors looking to relocate will look on a United States that is driving deliberately over a fiscal cliff,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, to The Street. \u201cSending the U.S. into a debt spiral where you\u2019re borrowing interest on previous borrowing will generate a market reaction that will be far from benign and will, I think, in the end overwhelm the beneficial effects.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters is that while Trump says he doesn\u2019t want to add to the deficit, if there were a recession he says he\u2019d simply default.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve borrowed knowing that you can pay back with discounts,\u201d Trump told CNBC, according to The Atlantic. \u201cI would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic called this policy disastrous: \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t just represent a historic default, putting the U.S. in the position of a country like Greece or Argentina; it would also spark an international financial crisis.\"\n\nThen there are the other costs in Trump\u2019s plan: imposing tariffs as high as 35 percent, deporting 11 million illegal immigrants, building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and possibly ending free trade between the two countries by renegotiating or ending NAFTA.\n\nTwo writers for The American Action Forum, Ben Gitis and Laura Collins, estimated Trump\u2019s immigration policies would cost between $400 billion and $600 billion, shrink the labor force by 11 million workers and reduce the GDP by $1.6 trillion.\n\nIndustries that rely heavily on cheap labor, especially agriculture, would be devastated, leading to a rise in food prices, said John McLaren, a professor of economics at the University of Virginia, to The Street.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s plan to impose big tariffs on imported goods, economists worry that it will do little to bring back manufacturing jobs and will instead result in higher prices for American consumers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common mistake the people who don\u2019t really understand economics make that this would somehow be a tariff on exporters,\u201d Mark J. Perry, a professor at the University of Michigan at Flint and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told Politico.\n\n\u201cIt would actually be a tax on American consumers. And more than half of U.S. imports come in as raw materials. And those cheap imports benefit American companies that hire American workers to finish the production process. Trump is really harkening back to the outdated mercantilist positions of hundreds of years ago.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump has claimed his economic policies would jump-start the U.S. economy and create millions of jobs.
