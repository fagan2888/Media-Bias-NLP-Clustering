(NYSE:UNH) is the nation\u2019s No. 1 health insurer in an industry that\u2019s been thriving of late.\n\nThe aging Baby Boomer generation has reached that point where they will need more coverage for decades to come and the Affordable Care Act has and will add more Americans into the healthcare mix as the legislation mandates coverage.\n\nDemographics and legislation paint the picture of an industry with substantial growth potential, but does that mean the biggest player in this space is a buy?\n\nDespite UNH stock being up 47% in the last year, management at UnitedHealth Group isn\u2019t resting on its laurels. In fact, UNH is being proactive and strategically expanding. Now the company\u2019s set to report Q1 earnings on Thursday morning, and you can expect to hear continued good things.\n\nUNH Stock Earnings Preview\n\nAnalysts expect UnitedHealth Group to post first-quarter earnings of $1.34 a share, a 22% increase from last year. Revenue is expected to rise 9% to $34.6 billion.\n\nThese are positive numbers and most analysts are bullish on UNH stock. As Hannah Ishmael reported for Bidness ETC:\n\n\u201cAnalysts polled by Bloomberg indicate that the majority of the sell-side firms are bullish on UnitedHealth stock. Out of the 25 analysts who cover the stock, 18 rate it a \u2018Buy\u2019 and six recommend a \u2018Hold\u2019. The 12-month consensus target price stands at $131.30.\u201d\n\nThere remains the potential for growth as UNH stock was trading at midday today at $117.\n\nHowever, these expectations don\u2019t explain the latest boosting of price targets over the last past few weeks.\n\nCredit Suisse substantially raised its price target on UNH stock from $120 to $135 on March 31. And in a report released this week, Jeffries & Co. boosted its price target from $106 to $141. Jeffries also estimated earnings at $5.70 per share for 2015 and $6.20 for next year.\n\nThe upgrades were due to the acquisition of a company in what should be a game-changer for UnitedHealth Group.\n\nHow the Catamaran Deal Helps UNH Stock\n\nOn March 30, the Pharmacy Benefit Management arm of UnitedHealth \u2014 OptumRx \u2014 grew by leaps and bounds as the healthcare provider announced a deal to buy Catamaran Corp (USA) (NASDAQ:CTRX) for $12.8 billion. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year.\n\nHere\u2019s why this is a big deal.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers \u2014 or PBMs \u2014 run prescription drug plans for its clients that are made up of corporations and health insurers. It is their job to negotiate prices with drug makers and pharmacies, process mail-order prescriptions, and attempt to monitor patients to see if they are taking drugs when and as prescribed \u2014 this keeps costs down.\n\nUNH\u2019s deal to buy Catamaran will unite the third- and fourth-largest PBMs in the country. And in the PBM space, the bigger you are, the more power you have to negotiate better deals for drugs.\n\nAccording to Trefis, the combined efforts will handle nearly 1 billion prescriptions annually and give it a 20% market share in the industry.\n\nOn Thursday I will be interested in hearing of what management thinks the deal will mean for UNH\u2019s future than I am in the company\u2019s first-quarter numbers. This past quarter was business as usual. However, this deal will be a game-changer.\n\nAs of this writing, Jason Jenkins did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace", "article_metadata": {"description": "You can expect to hear good things when UNH issues its quarterly earnings on Thursday, but the most exciting news for UNH stock is its planned purchase of Catamaran Corp.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "InvestorPlace", "description": "You can expect to hear good things when UNH issues its quarterly earnings on Thursday, but the most exciting news for UNH stock is its planned purchase of Catamaran Corp.", "title": "UNH Earnings Preview: A Rosy Prognosis for UnitedHealth Group Stock", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/UnitedHealth185.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-15T12:05:15-04:00", "url": "http://investorplace.com/2015/04/unh-earnings-preview-a-rosy-prognosis-for-unitedhealth-group-stock/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "You can expect to hear good things when UNH issues its quarterly earnings on Thursday, but the most exciting news for UNH stock is its planned purchase of Catamaran Corp.", "title": "UNH Earnings Preview: A Rosy Prognosis for UnitedHealth Group Stock | InvestorPlace", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/UnitedHealth185.jpg", "creator": "@InvestorPlace", "site": "@InvestorPlace", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002035369734}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "5MtKaaO4K0OK-C2y-n9MKUc_WzF9GSkH0fLgruR0TKM", "keywords": "Markets, UNH, UNH stock, UnitedHealth Group, UNH earnings", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/investorplace", "section": "Stocks to Buy", "published_time": "2015-04-15T12:07:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T12:05:15-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20150415, "yandex-verification": "7449d54f0a1869d7", "news_keywords": "markets, unh, unh stock, unitedhealth group, unh earnings"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde687\"", "article_summary": "UNH Stock Earnings PreviewAnalysts expect UnitedHealth Group to post first-quarter earnings of $1.34 a share, a 22% increase from last year.\nDespite UNH stock being up 47% in the last year, management at UnitedHealth Group isn\u2019t resting on its laurels.\nThe upgrades were due to the acquisition of a company in what should be a game-changer for UnitedHealth Group.\nCredit Suisse substantially raised its price target on UNH stock from $120 to $135 on March 31.\nAs Hannah Ishmael reported for Bidness ETC:\u201cAnalysts polled by Bloomberg indicate that the majority of the sell-side firms are bullish on UnitedHealth stock."}
