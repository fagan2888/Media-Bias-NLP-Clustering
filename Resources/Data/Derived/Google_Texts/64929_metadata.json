This question has been plaguing political watchers ever since Chelsea Clinton, in her first solo campaign outing for her mom last week, threw a punch at Bernie Sanders. Specifically, Chelsea accused the Vermont senator of pushing a health-care agenda that would \u201cdismantle\u201d Obamacare and Medicare. The assault was misleading, to be sure. (Given his druthers, Bernie would implement a comprehensive single-payer system.) But it was the messenger more than the message that rocked people\u2019s world. Latest from Politics The Real Scandal of Hillary Clinton's Emails Conservative websites gleefully denounced Chelsea the \u201cattack dog.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, wrung their hands over why she of all people would be dispatched to do this kind of wet work. (As strategist Brad Bannon told The Hill, \u201cThis makes Chelsea just another political player in the arena, and if I was Chelsea, that\u2019s not where I\u2019d want to be.\u201d) And a media bored to sobs with the Democratic primary leapt on the episode like ducks on a June bug. Commentators mused endlessly about why the Clinton camp had taken this route and what it meant. (Consensus: nothing good.) Bernie Sanders was repeatedly invited to respond. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin might have sounded a smidge melodramatic when he asserted, \u201cI have covered the Clintons since 1991. It takes a lot to surprise me, and I am stunned watching Chelsea Clinton go on the attack. Stunned. Never seen anything like it.\u201d But that\u2019s only if you missed Mark Shields\u2019s proclamation on PBS: \u201cThe Clinton campaign this week, in perhaps the stupidest act of the entire year, took the one person who is a character witness, who\u2019s a privileged observer of Hillary Clinton, who can testify about Hillary Clinton as human being ... Chelsea Clinton, and turned her into a political hack. I mean it was just absolutely reckless and stupid.\u201d Team Hillary attempted damage control. The morning after Chelsea\u2019s remarks, spokesman Brian Fallon assured reporters that the attack had not been ordered up by the campaign and that Chelsea was simply a fiercely devoted daughter who had gone rogue. But nobody was buying it, and Hillary wound up playing defense on multiple shows. \u201cSo no regrets about using Chelsea that way?\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper pressed the secretary.\n\nOuch. From all the ruckus, you\u2019d think Chelsea had gone the full Lee Atwater and accused Sanders of being a drug-peddling, neo-fascist pedophile. Then again, of course Chelsea\u2019s dabbling in even low-level campaign combat was going to result in a collective seizure. Not because the offspring of big-name pols are forbidden from engaging in the rough stuff per se. Just last cycle, Beau Biden whacked Paul Ryan on behalf of his vice presidential father, and even the super-sunny Romney boys got saucy. Remember how cute it was when Tagg admitted the urge to leap from his seat and \u201ctake a swing\u201d at President Obama at the second debate? But Chelsea? Such ungraciousness\u2014and such disingenuousness\u2014isn\u2019t expected from Bill and Hillary\u2019s only child. It cuts against not only her meticulously tended good-girl persona but also the deeply rooted mythology of Chelsea as the sweet, loyal, vulnerable humanizer of her ambitious, inscrutable parents. (For some, Clinton fille will forever be the sad-eyed teen binding Mom and Dad together during the summer of Lewinsky.) At what point is Chelsea going to be recognized for something other than how she makes people feel about her high-wattage parents? For all her parents\u2019 flaws, Chelsea is typically regarded as above reproach\u2014perhaps all the more so for her parents\u2019 flaws. Many a piece has been written portraying her as the best parts of Hillary and of Bill, a triumph of natural selection if you will. Time and again, observers have marveled at Chelsea\u2019s poise in the political arena, her steadying effect on her parents, her attempts to bring order to her dad\u2019s notoriously unfocused foundation/legacy. She is praised most loudly on those occasions when she bursts forth with a warm-and-fuzzy tribute to her mother or, better still, her grandmother. Now and again, her patient handling of Clinton haters wows even the conservative opposition. In October, for instance, some jackass confronted Chelsea at an Austin signing for her children\u2019s book with crass questions about whether Webb Hubbell was her real father and whether Bill Clinton sexually targets teenage girls. Chelsea, smile unwavering, gently deflected the provocations, winning approving nods for her \u201cgrace\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d from the likes of Sean Hannity, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Her campaign-trail dig at Bernie Sanders drew fire from Americans unwilling to surrender their memories of the First Daughter.", "author": "Michelle Cottle", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Her campaign-trail dig at Bernie Sanders drew fire from Americans unwilling to surrender their memories of the First Daughter.", "title": "Chelsea Clinton Grows Up", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/AP_44436677454/facebook.jpg?1453215060", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/chelsea-clinton-bernie-sanders/424623/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It takes a lot to surprise me, and I am stunned watching Chelsea Clinton go on the attack.\nThis question has been plaguing political watchers ever since Chelsea Clinton, in her first solo campaign outing for her mom last week, threw a punch at Bernie Sanders.\nFor all her parents\u2019 flaws, Chelsea is typically regarded as above reproach\u2014perhaps all the more so for her parents\u2019 flaws.\nFrom all the ruckus, you\u2019d think Chelsea had gone the full Lee Atwater and accused Sanders of being a drug-peddling, neo-fascist pedophile.\nLatest from Politics The Real Scandal of Hillary Clinton's Emails Conservative websites gleefully denounced Chelsea the \u201cattack dog.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, wrung their hands over why she of all people would be dispatched to do this kind of wet work."}
