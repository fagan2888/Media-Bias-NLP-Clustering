U.S. crude was down 50 cents at $26.95 a barrel by 2:50 p.m. EST (1950 GMT), off from a 12-year low of $26.05 hit earlier in the session. The Journal quoted UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei as saying that OPEC members were ready to cooperate on a cut, but that current prices were already forcing producers outside the group to at least cap output increases. Reuters could not independently verify the report. (Reporting By Barani Krishnan; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
