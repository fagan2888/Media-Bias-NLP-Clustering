The group split a 12-pack of Corona beer, and Baca had two or three bottles, Marin said.\n\nMarin and Baca got hungry and made a midnight trip to Jack In The Box for bacon cheeseburgers and Sprites before Baca decided to leave.\n\n\u201cI got a little sleepy, so \u2026 I told him, \u2018You can stay at my house if you want,\u2019\u201d Marin said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just gonna head home.\u2019\u201d\n\nMarin said Baca has always been a \u201cresponsible drinker,\u201d and that he didn\u2019t seem impaired as he drove off into the night.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really think anything was going to happen,\u201d Marin said.\n\nRocio Baca said her brother, tired from an exhausting work schedule, may have dozed off when he was driving home from Marin\u2019s.\n\nShe said her brother was a quiet, respectful man and the \u201cpeacemaker\u201d of their family. He was dutiful in helping his mother with any request, and he loved to dote on his niece, she said.\n\nBaca also enjoyed hang gliding, bungee jumping and skydiving, his sister said.\n\nBaca\u2019s death is the 13th traffic fatality in Mesquite in 2015, police say.
