LOVELAND — Three drivers were treated at local hospitals after an accident shortly before noon on Sunday.

Loveland Police Department officers reported traffic was slowed on East Eisenhower Boulevard and southbound Boyd Lake Avenue was closed for about 3 ½ hours after the accident at the intersection of Eisenhower and Boyd.

According to a report from the department, Kailey Willoughby, 20, of Loveland, turned left onto Boyd Lake Avenue from eastbound Eisenhower in front of a car driven by Matthew Crandall, 32, of Loveland, who was headed west on Eisenhower.

He struck Willoughby's car on the passenger side, and her car then struck a vehicle stopped on North Boyd Lake Avenue, driven by Kirstie Stencel, 42, of Loveland.

Crandall's vehicle came to a rest on the driver's side.

Alcohol, drugs, speed and distracted driving are not considered to be contributing factors to the accident, according to a press release.

The Technical Crash Investigation Team is investigating and will meet with the District Attorney's office for possible charges.
