Panama City, FL --- In the first night of the Bay Barnstorm Classic, the Mosley Dolphins were looking for a late Christmas present in the form of a win

Dolphins head coach Chris Martello and his team started the tournament off, facing a tough 6A Pensacola team.

In the video highlights attached above, Mosley is in the white jerseys. The action takes place in the 4th quarter. The pass inside to Andrew Deramo gets the shot in the trees to fall. Dolphins up six.

A little later, the kickout comes to a wide open Jacob Harrison who knocks down the J. Mosley up seven.

But the Tigers would come back in a swift attack. Off the tipped pass, Traquan Knight comes up with the steal and then the slam. That gave Pensacola a one point lead.

So who else does Mosley go to, but Nat Dixon, he had a big night... shocker. Here he gets the bucket and the foul. The free throw put Mosley up two.

Tigers would go back up three and Nat says, whatever I'll just tie it up. He knocks down the trifecta as the Dolphins would start to pull away for good.

Mosley takes it by a final of 76-70. They're 5-7 now and will face winner of game 1, Leon, at 5:30 tomorrow. Dixon led all scorers with 33.
