Stein says his suite of services and team of experts can save companies a great deal of money while keeping them protected and up to date in the ongoing fight against cyber crime.\n\n\u201cHopefully I can say in the coming year through this venture, in no clich\u00e9 way, that I changed the world,\u201d says Stein, a triple major in computer science, film and Near Eastern and Judaic studies. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important to be protected. I want to inspire people to urge companies, health care providers, and anyone else with their personal information, medical records and credit card data to have the highest level of protection and security.\u201d\n\nStein started CyberSecurityPlan in June 2014 with the help of his uncle, Michael Rosenblatt, a New York City-based attorney, and Israeli computer expert Eitan Magid, a former computer networking engineer for the Israeli Defense Forces and one of the architects of the rebuilt Affordable Care Act\u2019s website, healthcare.gov.\n\nCyberSecurityPlan, which has an office in Manhattan, works with computer experts who will attempt to hack into their clients\u2019 system to check for vulnerabilities and then help the clients fix any flaws that would make it easy for a hacker to gain access. Stein says his company also offers a licensed application that can detect a cyber attack and then alert the client via their smartphone, allowing them to quickly respond and block the attack.\n\n\u201cWe focus on the front end \u2014 the workers who have access to information,\u201d explains Stein. \u201cWith a cyber security plan in place, someone oversees access to confidential information\u201d\n\nStein\u2019s expertise and interest in computer science has grown throughout his time at Brandeis. Though he serves, and has served, as a teaching assistant for a variety of computer science courses, his experience in the field started with an introductory course taught by professor Antonella DiLillo.\n\n\u201cProfessor DiLillo is an extraordinary person, friend, mentor and teacher,\u201d says Stein. \u201cI had the great privilege of learning from her numerous times and was engrossed in her classes from day one. It is to her credit that I am where I am today.\u201d\n\nStein was quick to laud the other professors in the COSI department, whom he was able to work with and learn from. \u201cI am thankful to all the professors who taught me the skills and information needed to put CyberSecurityPlan together\u201d and those such as Pito Salas \u201cfor teaching me the entrepreneurship side of the field. Pito was immensely supportive of the company\u2019s concept from the start.\u201d\n\nStein says Brandeis has given him the foundation for both his interests and the founding of CyberSecurityPlan, while also helping him emerge as a leader.\n\n\u201cI love the foundations of leadership here,\u201d says Stein. \u201cI have always seen myself as a community builder. I am a big advocate for the computer sciences, as the way of the future. I want to guide people who are not students of computer science in this field and hopefully inspire them to pursue it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BrandeisNOW", "description": "Imagine a time when computer hacking and cyber-terrorism are a thing of the past\u2014when the right means of defense would protect companies like Sony and Target from attacks that compromise the security of its computer networks.", "title": "Ethan Stein '15 launches cyber security company, eyes changing the world | BrandeisNOW", "url": "http://www.brandeis.edu/now/2015/january/stein-cybersecurity-profile.html", "image": "http://www.brandeis.edu/now/2015/january/images/steinedited-4.jpg", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfa5\"", "article_summary": "Ethan Stein \u201915 recently launched CyberSecurityPlan, a company to protect businesses\u2019 computer networks and safeguard confidential information through a customized computer business plan.\n\u201cWith a cyber security plan in place, someone oversees access to confidential information\u201dStein\u2019s expertise and interest in computer science has grown throughout his time at Brandeis.\nI want to guide people who are not students of computer science in this field and hopefully inspire them to pursue it.\u201d\nEthan Stein '15 launches cyber security company, eyes changing the worldBrandeis senior to make a contribution in fight against cyber crimesPhoto/Mike Lovett Ethan Stein '15Imagine a time when computer hacking and cyber-terrorism are a thing of the past\u2014when the right means of defense would protect companies like Sony and Target from attacks that compromise the security of its computer networks.\n\u201cHopefully I can say in the coming year through this venture, in no clich\u00e9 way, that I changed the world,\u201d says Stein, a triple major in computer science, film and Near Eastern and Judaic studies."}
