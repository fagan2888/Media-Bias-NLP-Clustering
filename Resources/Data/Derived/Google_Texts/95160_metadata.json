And while vacancy rates rose in most other metro-area counties, the Broomfield/Boulder area saw vacancy rates fall from 3.7 to 3.4 percent, the lowest in the metro area, according to the report.\n\nSince last year, Boulder County overall, excluding Broomfield data, has seen vacancy rates increase .3 percent.\n\nExcluding university areas, Boulder's vacancy rates are up 2 percent. Factoring those university areas back in, vacancy rates are down .2 percent with the current projection at 0 percent vacancies.\n\nThough the Broomfield-Boulder area saw the largest rent increases and lowest vacancy rates, it is not the only area seeing rent increases. Denver County saw the second-highest rent increase, which grew by 8.1 percent. The metro-Denver area saw average rent go up by $63 in 2013 compared to the previous year, from $978 to $1,041, according to the Division of Housing report.\n\nBroomfield residents on average are paying about 8.6 percent more for rent this year, going from an average of $1,103 to an average of $1,198, according to the report.\n\nHigh rents, low availability\n\n\"Broomfield is a desirable location, and people are moving to the area for employment and all the rest,\" said Cheryl St. Clair, Broomfield Housing Program manager.\n\nThose circumstances could be putting the squeeze on some people looking to call the city home, continuing a trend identified in a 2012 report. Affordable housing is a challenge for many single parents and lower-income families, according to Broomfield Community Foundation. The Foundation's 2012 Sweep Report, a summary of Broomfield's demographics and services, identified the need for more affordable housing as a priority.\n\nKaren Smith, executive director of the Foundation, said many of the nonprofit organizations the Foundation provides funding to are still seeing their clients struggle to afford rents in Broomfield.\n\n\"I know that the problem still exists,\" she said.\n\nThe Foundation has formed a working group to explore ways to create more affordable housing options in Broomfield, but right now those ideas are in the brainstorming and research stages, she said.\n\nSt. Clair said there is no hard and fast rule for what can be considered \"affordable.\"One typical measurement of housing affordability is if housing costs are less than 30 percent of a family's income, she said.\n\nUsing that formula, to be able to afford the average monthly rent of $1,198, an individual or family would have to net nearly $3,600 a month. When taking income taxes and other paycheck deductions into consideration, a person would need to make roughly $50,000 per year to afford that rent.\n\nNew units on the way\n\nThe Division of Housing report shows that while rents are going up in every metro-area county, so, too, are vacancies, because of new housing construction, said Ryan McMaken, an economist with the division. The exception is Broomfield.\n\nIn the Denver-metro area as a whole, the apartment vacancy rate increased to 5.2 percent during the fourth quarter of 2013, the highest in two years, the report stated.\n\nWhile it's not clear why there are so few vacancies in Broomfield, St. Clair said the September floods, which impacted neighboring communities, might have contributed to a higher demand for apartments.\n\nPeople also continue to move to Broomfield to take jobs in the area, she said.\n\nThe city will see as many as to 2,068 units, some of which are available now, with more available in the next year, according to a list of new and proposed construction projects provided by Broomfield staff.\n\nThe majority of new projects will be rental units, including condos, townhomes and apartment buildings, said Dave Shinneman, Broomfield Community Development director.\n\nThree projects on Broomfield's list have been completed, including two Vantage Point buildings in the Via Varra area and the Arista Place apartments near the 1stBank Center, which add 376 new rental units.\n\nThere are nine more projects under construction, including Harvest Station, a group of 13 three-story apartment buildings off Wadsworth Boulevard, according to the list.\n\nAn additional seven projects have either been approved or are under review, which could add another 1,264 units if plans move forward.\n\nAnd Broomfield could approve more projects over time, Shinneman said.\n\nThe most recently approved project is a group of 49 duplex buildings in North Park in northern Broomfield. City Council approved the project at its Feb. 18 meeting.\n\nMark Williams, executive vice president of the Apartment Association of Metro Denver, said new housing units are being approved and built throughout the metro area.\n\n\"The industry still sees relevant pent up demand out there,\" he said in an email.\n\nWill inventory drop prices?\n\nAn increase in rental units from new construction could drive down rental costs in older units in Broomfield, St. Clair said, but it's a wait-and-see game when finding out how the market will actually shake out in the next year.\n\n\"Historically, we see older buildings reduce their rents (when new buildings are built), but we haven't seen that yet,\" she said.\n\nIf that happens over time, \"we could see a bigger range of rental choices and affordability,\" she said.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_25255691/boulder-broomfield-counties-see-largest-metro-rent-increases", "sailthru.author": "By Megan Quinn \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25255691:view"}, "startDate": "2014-03-01T20:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Broomfield and Boulder counties saw the largest rent increase in the Denver-metro area last year, and local vacancy rates continued to decrease even as new multi-family housing units are being built.", "title": "Boulder, Broomfield counties see largest metro rent increases in 2013", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_25255691/boulder-broomfield-counties-see-largest-metro-rent-increases", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0301/20140301__02dcabrow~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "modificationDate": "2014-03-02T13:21:47-0700", "endDate": "2024-03-01T20:00:00-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Megan QuinnCamera", "pubDate": "2014-03-01T16:13:44-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-03-01T20:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder, Broomfield counties see largest metro rent increases in 2013", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0301/20140301__02dcabrow~1_300.jpg", "description": "Broomfield and Boulder counties saw the largest rent increase in the Denver-metro area last year, and local vacancy rates continued to decrease even as new multi-family housing units are being built.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_25255691/boulder-broomfield-counties-see-largest-metro-rent-increases", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Broomfield and Boulder counties saw the largest rent increase in the Denver-metro area last year, and local vacancy rates continued to decrease even as new multi-family housing units are being built.", "title": "Boulder, Broomfield counties see largest metro rent increases in 2013"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0301/20140301__02dcabrow~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf976\"", "article_summary": "Though the Broomfield-Boulder area saw the largest rent increases and lowest vacancy rates, it is not the only area seeing rent increases.\nBroomfield and Boulder counties saw the largest rent increase in the Denver-metro area last year, and local vacancy rates continued to decrease even as new multi-family housing units are being built.\nSince last year, Boulder County overall, excluding Broomfield data, has seen vacancy rates increase .3 percent.\nFactoring those university areas back in, vacancy rates are down .2 percent with the current projection at 0 percent vacancies.\nAnd while vacancy rates rose in most other metro-area counties, the Broomfield/Boulder area saw vacancy rates fall from 3.7 to 3.4 percent, the lowest in the metro area, according to the report."}
