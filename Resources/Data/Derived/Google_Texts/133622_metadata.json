Along with admission, those who attended the event had to bring some type of item for the shelter to use; like dog food, paper towels or a toy.\n\nProceeds from the event benefit the Humane Society of Bay County.\n\nVisitors had a chance to sample more than 70 different wines and craft beers. This is the largest third-party fundraiser for the humane society each year.\n\n\"It's always a shock to us that we have a great giving community,\" explained Sean Brosnan, a Board Member for the Humane Society of Bay County. \"We put the event out there, we put it on Facebook, we got our e-mail followers that we have, you can see the support. The second we opened the door, it was flooded with people, so we love that because we wouldn't exist without the community and the support from the community\"\n\nManagers with the Wine Dog say they expected to raise more than $10,000 for the humane society.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of wine lovers were in Panama City Friday night trying out different beverages and raising money for a local cause.", "language": "english", "author": "WJHG", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Annual-Toast-for-the-Paws-raises-thousands-for-Humane-Society-of-Bay-County-371894922.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/toast4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hundreds of wine lovers were in Panama City Friday night trying out different beverages and raising money for a local cause.", "title": "Annual Toast for the Paws raises thousands for Humane Society of Bay County"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of wine lovers were in Panama City Friday night trying out different beverages and raising money for a local cause.", "title": "Annual Toast for the Paws raises thousands for Humane Society of Bay County", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Annual-Toast-for-the-Paws-raises-thousands-for-Humane-Society-of-Bay-County-371894922.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/toast4.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Annual Toast for the Paws raises thousands for Humane Society of Bay County", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Annual Toast for the Paws, raises thousands for Humane Society"}, "article_summary": "The Wine Dog hosted its annual Toast for the Paws event Friday night.\nProceeds from the event benefit the Humane Society of Bay County.\nThis is the largest third-party fundraiser for the humane society each year.\n\"It's always a shock to us that we have a great giving community,\" explained Sean Brosnan, a Board Member for the Humane Society of Bay County.\nAlong with admission, those who attended the event had to bring some type of item for the shelter to use; like dog food, paper towels or a toy."}
