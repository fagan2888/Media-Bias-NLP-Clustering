Tax filings for 2014 are not yet publicly available.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act placed a $500,000 salary cap on co-op employees, and executives running the nonprofit insurers earned a high of $490,125\u2014paid to Jerry Burgess, chief executive of Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Insurance Cooperative in South Carolina\u2014and a low of $46,524\u2014paid to Joanne Hill of Colorado HealthOP in Colorado.\n\nIn 2014, the median income for households was $53,657.\n\nAaron Albright, spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told The Daily Signal the co-op loans cannot be used to provide \u201cexcessive compensation.\u201d Additionally, Albright said the Obama administration reviews top co-op officials\u2019 employment agreements to ensure the nonprofit insurers are complying with the terms of their loans.\n\nHill founded Colorado\u2019s nonprofit insurer but left last month after Colorado HealthOP elected new members to its board. Of the executives identified in relevant tax filings, four moved on to other jobs. One of those four, Tom Zumtobel, who previously served as Nevada Health Cooperative\u2019s chief executive officer, left and became the head of Arizona\u2019s co-op.\n\nCongress created the co-ops to inject competition into areas where few insurance providers offered plans. The federal government awarded $2.4 billion in startup and solvency loans to 23 co-ops that were approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nSince Obamacare went into effect in 2013, 11 co-ops have announced they\u2019re winding down operations and no longer offering insurance on the state-run and federal exchanges in 2016. Those 11 co-ops are located in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah.\n\nThe failed co-ops received more than $1.1 billion in total and enrolled more than 690,000 Americans in plans, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and state regulatory filings.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to all 11 co-ops for comment. Nine of the nonprofit insurers did not return requests for comment. Kentucky Health Cooperative directed questions to the state Department of Insurance, and the Louisiana Health Cooperative did not have a comment.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also did not return a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Top Officials With Failed Obamacare Co-Ops Made an Average of $245,000 By Melissa Quinn Reprinted with permission of The Daily Signal Before 11 of the 23 nonprofit insurers created under Obamacare announced they would be closing their doors, the top executives running their operations raked in large sums of money.
