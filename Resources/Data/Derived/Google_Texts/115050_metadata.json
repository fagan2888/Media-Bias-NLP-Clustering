Mark Hamilton is officially under way and has an election date and field of candidates.\n\nOn Friday, the state announced that the special election to fill House District 24\u2019s seat would be held on June 16, the same date as a special election to fill an opening on the Cumming City Council.\n\nHamilton announced on Monday he would be leaving his position and taking a private sector job in Nashville, Tenn. Hamilton was re-elected in 2014, so the elected candidate will sit for the remaining 18 months of the term.\n\nSince then, four candidates have announced their intention to run, including Sheri Gilligan, who ran against Hamilton for the Republican nomination last year; David Van Sant, a local personal injury attorney; Will Kremer, a member of the local Republican Party; and Ethan Underwood, a partner at the law firm of Miles Hansford and Tallant and former chair of the Forsyth County Republican Party.\n\nGilligan, who served in the U.S. Navy Reserves, worked for the CIA as an intelligence analyst and later taught at Lanier Technical College, ran in 2014 and said she plans to campaign on the same values.\n\n\u201cLast year when I ran, I ran because I wanted to have a new leadership down in the Capital,\u201d Gilligan said. \u201cI saw what went on this year with the budget increase and the tax increase, and I thought we still need new leadership.\u201d\n\nVan Sant, who owns Van Sant Law LLC, said that he has been waiting for this opportunity for years.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things is I want to make sure that we\u2019re ensuring continuing prosperity for the county,\u201d Van Sant said. \u201cI want to make sure that we continue to be a place for homeowners and business and I think there is a definite disconnect between the path we\u2019re on and the path I think we need to be going.\u201d\n\nKremer\u2019s family owns National Fleet Services, and he served as chair of the state College Republican National Committee, among other positions within the party.\n\n\u201cI want to bring Forsyth County values to Atlanta and to make sure that everything that we do down there, if I\u2019m elected, that it passes the Forsyth County test,\u201d Kremer said. \u201cThat means that we\u2019re going to have a real transportation solution. It means that we\u2019re going to make sure that taxes are kept low, and it also means that we\u2019re going to build consensus and stop the divide.\u201d\n\nUnderwood was the first candidate to announce his hopes of taking Hamilton\u2019s now vacant seat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that everyone will keep this a clean campaign and that we\u2019ll have a good debate on issues that are affecting the state of Georgia and Forsyth County,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cI think [the election date] is good. That\u2019ll save the tax payers by having the election day the same day as the city. Those people are already going to the polls, and hopefully that will increase turnout.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/27405/", "type": "article", "description": "CUMMING -- The race to fill the seat of state Rep.
