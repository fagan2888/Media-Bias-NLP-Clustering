Mr. Christie\u2019s loyal defense of President George W. Bush is based on a completely false premise at the heart of the discussion about Iraq.\n\nAccording to that premise, President Bush was focusing like a laser beam on protecting the homeland when the intelligence community presented him with information about chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in Iraq that compelled him to take action.\n\nWhat actually happened is that Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and a handful of other neo-cons in the administration decided to attack Iraq for ideological reasons that are still obscure. Needing congressional authorization, the administration cooked up a \u201cnational intelligence estimate\u201d that offered a false picture of confidence among the intelligence agencies about dangerous weapons and Saddam Hussein\u2019s ambitions to destroy America.\n\nIn fact, there was serious dissent within the intelligence community about that information, which turned out to be wrong. But that dissent, and evidence that contradicted the previously made decision to go to war, were ignored, covered up, papered over \u2014 choose your verb.\n\nMr. Cheney\u2019s team of ideologues actually established their own boutique intelligence operation within the Pentagon to massage analysts\u2019 reports so that they would conform to what the White House wanted them so say.\n\nThe National Intelligence Estimate was drawn up because Congress wanted it, when Mr. Bush asked lawmakers to approve an invasion of Iraq. It did not represent either what the intelligence agencies actually believed or what Mr. Bush had been told about Iraq. Mr. Bush did not reluctantly go to war because the nation\u2019s spies showed him powerful reasons to do that. He decided to go to war and then presented a version of the intelligence to justify his decision. As Mr. Christie said, it was a mistake of \u201cnational consequence.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150513111333, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "per": "Bush, George W;Bush, Jeb;Christie, Christopher J;Hussein, Saddam", "keywords": "Bush George W,Bush Jeb,Christie Christopher J,Hussein Saddam,Biological and Chemical Warfare,Espionage and Intelligence Services,International Relations,National Intelligence Estimates,Nuclear Weapons,Presidential Election of 2016,United States Defense and Military Forces,United States Politics and Government,Iraq,New Jersey,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Chris Christie Buys the Iraq Line ( 20150513 )", "news_keywords": "2016 Presidential Election,Biological and Chemical Warfare,Chris Christie,George W Bush,International relations,Iraq,Jeb Bush,National Intelligence Estimate,New Jersey,Nuclear weapon,Saddam Hussein,Spying and Intelligence Agencies,US Military,US Politics", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Andrew Rosenthal", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Andrew Rosenthal", "byl": "Andrew Rosenthal", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/chris-christie-buys-the-iraq-line/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/05/13/opinion/13rosenthalWEB/13rosenthalWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "George W.
