A massive wall behind the fireplace slides open to an office.\n\nLuke Winskowski and Ann Marie Miller didn\u2019t want to give up the modern vibe of their downtown loft \u2014 or the euphoric feeling of viewing the urban landscape from the sky.\n\nSo the couple decided to re-create that spirit inside their new family home near Lake of the Isles in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cWe loved the light and feeling of being up high,\u201d said Winskowski of their ninth-floor loft. \u201cBut we wanted some green space.\u201d\n\nNow instead of stepping into an elevator, the couple and their two small children climb a floating staircase to the top level of their home, which boasts vistas of treetops and the nearby Kenilworth Trail.\n\nThe free-flowing floor plan was inspired by the couple\u2019s condo with its multifunctional open spaces and a clean, simple aesthetic. \u201cThis design gave them the sensibility of a downtown urban loft but in a neighborhood with a yard,\u201d said architect Michael Roehr of RoehrSchmitt Architecture.\n\nFamily members spend most of their day on the \u201cpenthouse\u201d level of the home, which juxtaposes soaring ceilings with horizontal bands of glass. Off the dining area, there\u2019s even an expansive deck built atop the garage roof for summer barbecues.\n\nThe \"tower\" design features a folded roofline and a big deck on the roof of the cedar-clad attached garage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like living in a treehouse,\u201d said Winskowski. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re in the middle of the country.\u201d\n\nFortuitous find\n\nWinskowski and Miller knew it was a challenge to transport a 2-year-old via elevator every time they wanted to go outside, but their plan to build a home was far off in the future. Until 2012, that is, when they were cruising around and stumbled upon a tiny 1950s-era home for sale. The odd-shaped hilltop lot was overgrown with bushes and trees, but it was located on a picturesque block between Lake of the Isles and Cedar Lake.\n\nThe couple had to make a quick decision to compete with offers from other potential buyers. When they closed the deal, \u201cwe looked at each other and realized we had to sell the condo,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we wanted to save the home and renovate it,\u201d added Winskowski.\n\nSo they brought Roehr and Chris Schmitt on board to help them figure it out. Among many roadblocks to renovating, the couple discovered \u201cthe guts would have to be replaced because the wiring wasn\u2019t up to code,\u201d said Winskowski. Plus the modest home had no basement.\n\nIt made more sense, cost-wise, to tear down the house and start fresh, said Roehr. The new home design had to fit within the parameters of the designated setbacks, but Roehr could position the structure deeper on the \u201cpiece of pizza\u201d shaped lot to give the couple a bigger yard. \u201cWe pushed the house to the edge of the hill to get more front yard where the kids can play,\u201d he said.\n\nThe couple had requested a \u201cright-sized\u201d house under 3,000 square feet, dedicating more space to gathering areas than bedrooms. \u201cYou dream a lot and pretend anything is possible,\u201d said Winskowski. \u201cBut then you come back to Earth.\u201d\n\nRoehr and Schmitt\u2019s final design is an unconventional rectangular-shaped three-story \u201ctower,\u201d which includes a walkout lower level tucked into the hillside, as well as an attached two-car garage.\n\n\u201cThe house is organized from the top down,\u201d said Roehr. \u201cThe living space is at the top of the tower and the bedrooms below that.\u201d\n\nThe bold lime-green front door opens to the main level, which holds three bedrooms and two bathrooms. In the entry, a transparent floating staircase \u2014 flanked by a wall of warm textural cedar and a wall of sleek modern glass \u2014 leads to the upper level.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, you step into the open kitchen, dining and living area, beneath a dramatic folded roofline. Light streams in through horizontal bands of windows facing west. The family-friendly kitchen is anchored by floor-to-ceiling cabinets of engineered rosewood veneer, a sustainable product that mimics warm exotic woods, and adds color to the gallery-white walls.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a big interactive, social kitchen,\u201d said Winskowski. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in a cooking show.\u201d\n\nAround the corner, a sleek, linear slate-surround fireplace, which the couple had shipped from Israel, is built into an enclosed box and warms the entire level. Behind the fireplace, a 6-foot-long wall slides open to reveal an office, which can be closed off for a quiet work area. \u201cThe space unfolds and folds \u2014 instead of entering through doors,\u201d said Roehr.\n\nThe adjacent living room was designed with a lower ceiling to give it a cozy, nesting feel. It\u2019s where the family watches TV and reads. \u201cWe can live, work and play in the same spot, just like in the condo,\u201d said Miller. \u201cBut although it\u2019s open, it still has the feeling of closeness.\u201d\n\nWhite oak flooring, treated to give it a rich black-brown tone, unifies the entire level. \u201cI was against a dark floor \u2014 because it shows everything,\u201d said Miller, referring to daily use by their active family. \u201cBut I like the look, and it\u2019s easier to keep up than I thought.\u201d\n\nThe living spaces are on the top level for the best views. A massive wall behind the fireplace slides open to an office.\n\nRoehr agreed that the trade-off is worth it. \u201cIf you choose everything to be low-maintenance, you end up with a generic space,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you want to enhance the aesthetic experience, there\u2019s a certain commitment to a bolder design.\u201d\n\nThe couple are now expecting their third child, and have turned the walkout lower level into a kids\u2019 playroom and another bedroom, with plans to add a future entertaining area.\n\nBut every morning, the family heads upstairs to the top of the \u201ctower\u201d to make breakfast and greet the day.\n\n\u201cWe spend so much time up here,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cWe can see the treetops in the summer, and Lake of the Isles in the winter,\u201d added Winskowski.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A couple infused the best qualities of their former downtown loft into their new family home near Lake of the Isles to re-create the euphoric feeling of viewing the urban landscape from the sky.
