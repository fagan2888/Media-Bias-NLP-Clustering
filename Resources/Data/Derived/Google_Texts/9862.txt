Saturday was the fifth annual Seminole Service Day for the Panama City Seminole Club.

All over the country Florida State Alumni Clubs are volunteering at a non-profit organization.

The Panama City Seminole Club spent part of their day at the Humane Society of Bay County.

About 20 volunteers mopped the floors, walked the dogs, cleaned the litter boxes and did some laundry.

"Everybody's had fun, they're loving to walk the dogs they're getting to play with the animals," explained Tracy Roberts, the secretary for the Panama City Seminole Club. "Whether you have an animal or not, it's just a really good feeling to come out and be able to spend some time with somebody that wants to spend time with you."
