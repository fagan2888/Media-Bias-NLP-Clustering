So did Villanova.\n\nThe Wildcats missed so many shots \u2014 gimme layups, uncontested jumpers, airballed 3s \u2014 that it was no surprise the first thing to fall was their Final Four target.\n\nNo wonder it came to this: The \u2018Cats were the first to go from a top seed to No. 1-and-done.\n\nNorth Carolina State, a program that authored one of the early chapters on March shockers, can add another stunner to the list: The Wolfpack are back in the Sweet 16.\n\n\u201cWe came out today with the feeling that everybody expected us to lose to a one seed,\u201d said forward BeeJay Anya, \u201cbut we believe in ourselves and that we\u2019re good enough to beat anybody in the country and we went down and did it.\u201d\n\nN.C. State attacked one of the top teams in the nation for 40 minutes, playing with a chest-thumping swagger that helped them stun Villanova 71-68 on Saturday night.\n\nN.C. State guards Cat Barber and Desmond Lee shared a long embrace after the buzzer as their teammates danced around the court in celebration.\n\nBarber turned to Lee, pounded his chest and yelled, \u201call heart!\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: N.C. State is back in the Sweet 16\n\nNo, this wasn\u2019t quite as meaningful as Jim Valvano\u2019s mad dash looking for somebody \u2014 anybody \u2014 to hug after the Wolfpack won the 1983 national championship. But the Wolfpack (22-13) have designs on their own big March run and will move on to Syracuse, New York to play the winner of the Louisville-Northern Iowa game.\n\nLacey led them with 17 points, Barber had 13 and Malik-Adbul Abu had 13 points, 12 rebounds and absolutely destroyed the Wildcats inside.\n\nThe Wildcats (33-3) saw a 16-game winning streak end and have not reached the second weekend since 2009.\n\nThe Wildcats come up empty after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament opener.\n\n\u201cI know we have to answer to the fact that we did not get to the second weekend again,\u201d coach Jay Wright said. \u201cWe have to own that. But it\u2019s not going to define us within our program. It\u2019s going to define us outside of our program and we accept that.\u201d\n\nDylan Ennis was nearly inconsolable, his arms crossed over his head in disbelief. Ennis missed a 3-pointer after an N.C. State turnover with 20 seconds left that would have put the Wildcats ahead.\n\nDarrun Hilliard scored 27 points and gamely rallied the Wildcats in the final minutes. He hit 3-pointers that brought them to within four, within two with 41.1 seconds left and 69-68 with 1.2 seconds left.\n\nRalston Turner sealed the win with free throws and N.C. State was back in the Sweet 16 for only the third time since 1989 (2012, 2005). They hadn\u2019t defeated a top seed since that memorable night in 1983 when they upset Houston.\n\nYet for the all the Wolfpack did right to keep the \u2018Cats on their heels, they never went on that decisive run that would have ended a comeback threat. Barber lost the ball and N.C. State\u2019s ninth turnover led to Josh Hart\u2019s three-point play with 3:51 left.\n\nThe Wolfpack didn\u2019t have to win with authority, though \u2014 they just had to win.\n\nDesmond Lee\u2019s three-point play stretched the lead back to seven and put them minutes away from the signature win under coach Mark Gottfried. Wins over Duke, North Carolina and Louisville in ACC play let them know they could knock off the elite.\n\n\u201cWe respect Villanova, but we\u2019ve seen good teams,\u201d Gottfried said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of them in our conference. You see them about every night. So a league like that prepares you for games like tonight.\u201d\n\nGottfried also has a knack for pulling off March upsets \u2014 he led eighth-seeded Alabama to a win over No. 1 Stanford in the second round of the 2004 tournament.\n\nThe Wildcats have one more March failure to tack on the list. They shot a season-high 63 percent in the tournament opener against Lafayette. Against the Wolfpack, they fired \u2019em early in the shot clock, got stuffed at the rim and twice airballed 3-point attempts.\n\nThese were the top-seeded Big East champs?\n\nIn the first half, the Wildcats missed a whopping 20 of 28 field goals. Hart, the Big East tournament MVP, played just 4 minutes after he was whistled for two fast fouls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think missing those layups or those easy baskets really fazed us, it was just our decision making in taking them,\u201d Hilliard said.\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nNC State: The Wolfpack did not attempt a free throw until there was 2:27 left in the first half. \u2026 N.C. State held a 45-32 edge on the boards. \u2026 The Wolfpack missed 8 of 11 3-pointers.\n\nVillanova: The Wildcats shot 31 percent (19 of 61). \u2026 The Wildcats have not won more than one game in the NCAA Tournament since 2009.\n\nBALANCING ACT:\n\nThe Wolfpack had four players reach double-digit scoring and two of them had double-doubles. JayVaughn Pinkston scored 13 and was the only other Wildcat to crack double digits. Four players averaged double digits in the regular season.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nNC State: Will play the winner of Louisville-Northern Iowa game in the Sweet 16.\n\nVillanova: Season finished.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NC State upsets Villanova, advances to Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament", "title": "NC State upsets Villanova, advances to Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/21/nc-state-upsets-villanova-advances-to-sweet-16-in-ncaa-tournament/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321__ncstatep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321__ncstatep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T19:52:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T22:18:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "N.C.
