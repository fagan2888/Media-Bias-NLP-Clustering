Not everyone agrees.\n\nKWQC talked to two health professionals laid off from the Mt. Pleasant facility. They said the governor\u2019s proposal will only worsen Iowa\u2019s mental health crisis and land more mentally ill people in jail. The Lee County Sheriff agrees.\n\n\u201cMental illness is not a crime and I\u2019m certainly tried of seeing it treated as one,\u201d said Lee County Sheriff Jim Sholl.\n\nWith the Mt. Pleasant facility winding down, Sheriff Sholl expects to see his inmate count bumping up.\n\n\u201cPerson suffering mental illness that cannot receive the proper services in the community often times resort to self medication with alcohol or drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that they might commit misdemeanor crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see everything from depression, folks who are suicidal to people who have schizophrenia,\u201d said Cindy Fedler.\n\nFedler was a nurse clinician at the Mt. Pleasant MHI before she was laid off last month.\n\nShe saw some of the same people Sheriff Sholl is worried he may soon see in his jail.\n\n\u201cThese folks sometimes need longer term care and we\u2019re taking the hospitals away from them,\u201d she said.\n\nAnna Short was a drug abuse counselor at the same MHI until she was laid off.\n\n\u201cMy main fear is that folks will end up in prison that don\u2019t belong there,\u201d said Short.\n\nBoth worry that the governor\u2019s decision to close Mt. Pleasant and Clarinda MHI\u2019s will mean more people on the street and more people in jail.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see the prison population rise,\u201d said Fedler.\n\nShe said they\u2019re already seeing that now.\n\n\u201cOnce you close down two and you lose those beds there\u2019s just not the resources for them and so they get treatment in prisons,\u201d said Fedler. \u201cAnybody who works with the mentally ill will tell you this is the most absurd decision ever made.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Mt. Pleasant had three mental health programs at it\u2019s MHI. Now, it has one: the Iowa Residential Treatment Center for substance abuse. It will operate until funding runs out, likely sometime this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to serve more and more people in the community and have fewer people in institutions,\u201d said Iowa Department of Human Services public information officer Amy McCoy.\n\nMcCoy said the agency wants to modernize mental health care in the state by serving more people in community-based treatment centers.\n\n\u201cThis is really what the mental health and disability redesign was meant to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s to help those services come online all across the state instead of just having people served at these four rural institutions that are very difficult to keep running.\u201d\n\nMcCoy said with this move, counties have become apart of regional systems that allows them to pool resources. This includes Affordable Care Act funding that\u2019s available through expanding services to Iowans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really making it possible for counties to use that $100 million in surpluses to invest in a very types of crisis services and programs that can serve people in their own community,\u201d she said.\n\nBut, Sheriff Sholl said closing the MHI\u2019s will especially hurt rural areas like in Lee County, where there aren\u2019t many community-based treatment centers available.\n\n\u201cIf they want to close the MHI\u2019s I wish we would have had proper treatment facilities available locally before that happened,\u201d he said.\n\nShort said without IRTC more people will end up incarcerated.\n\n\u201cA referral to IRTC was a person\u2019s chance one step before prison,\u201d she said.\n\nShort said in her last week at the MHI former patients called her. One was an elderly man who struggled with alcoholism and had ruined relationships with his family.\n\n\u201cHe called me in my last week to tell me, he was dating his wife again,\u201d she said teary eyed. \u201cSo, don\u2019t tell me program\u2019s not valuable.\u201d\n\nFunding for Mt. Pleasant and Clarinda will be reallocated to the remaining state run mental health institutes in Cherokee and Independence.\n\nDHS said they\u2019ll be adding a net total of six in-patient beds, state-wide.\n\nState Senator Rich Taylor represents Lee and Henry counties, home to the Mt. Pleasant facility.\n\nHe said the governor\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\n\u201cHospitals are calling us all the time saying we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to put these people if you close these institutions down because we can\u2019t help them,\u201d said. St. Sen. Taylor.\n\nHe said the patients coming to Mt. Pleasant and Clarinda have already shown they need more help than they\u2019d get at home.\n\n\u201cThese people have already failed in the community and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve come to the state institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous the way we treat people that need our help.\u201d\n\nThe two remaining facilities in Independence and Cherokee are two and five hours away from Mt. Pleasant.\n\nFedler and Short, the health professionals said that\u2019s just too far and simply not fair.\n\n\u201cTo put mentally ill people in handcuffs, in chains, lock them in the back of a squad car when they\u2019re already mentally ill drive all that distance to Independence or possibly Cherokee because those are the only two set to be left open\u2026 We wouldn\u2019t do that do someone who was having a stroke,\u201d said Fedler.\n\nBut unless legislation changes, Mt. Pleasant and Clarinda will be shut down.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Iowa is not taking care of their citizens who are mentally ill,\u201d said Fedler.\n\nFedler, Short and Sheriff Sholl all worry patients will end up in jail instead of in treatment.\n\nCurrently, funding for Mt. Pleasant and Clarinda are set to run out June 30th. However, the governor is now supporting a proposed compromise to keep state funded services available at those two institutions through December 15th.\n\nThe state said it would work to find private vendors to fill space at Mt. Pleasant and Clarinda, once funding runs out.\n\nKWQC did reach out to the governor\u2019s office for an interview.
