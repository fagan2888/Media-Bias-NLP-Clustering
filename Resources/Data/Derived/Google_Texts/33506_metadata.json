One such time came yesterday afternoon in an address at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason fewer Republicans you hear them running about Obamacare \u2014 because while good, affordable health care might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of the American people on Fox News, it turns out it\u2019s working pretty well in the real world,\u201d said the commander in chief.\n\nThat slight comes on top of the president slamming Fox News for obliterating common ground in American politics; for bringing a \u201cdestructive\u201d viewpoint to politics; for propagating conspiracy theories.\n\nThe attacks signal that Fox News irks the president \u2014 that the network\u2019s frequent attacks against him aren\u2019t beneath contempt. Being in the cable-news business, Fox Newsers well understand that a tweak from the president elevates their network. In a blog post on the fantastic GretaWire, Fox News host Greta Van Susteren noted that the attention amounts to \u201cfree promo for Fox!\u201d And on her show, Van Susteren repeated the boast about promotion, then segued into the heart of the matter: \u201cIn these very troubling times, from Ebola to beheadings, we need the president to act presidential, that means not blaming others or acting cool in front of a bunch of students, by blaming Fox for whatever ails him or his administration \u2026\u201d\n\nVan Susteren also wrote on her blog: \u201cThere is a lot of VERY SERIOUS stuff going on in the world. That\u2019s what the President should be talking about.\u201d\n\nGreta Van Susteren, try unloading that whole very-serious-stuff argument on Dean Angstadt. He\u2019s the Pennsylvania logger who allowed Fox News to help shape his outlook on Obamacare. He had needed to have a heart valve replaced but lacked health insurance. Having heard all manner of negative information on Obamacare, Angstadt resisted signing up until a friend all but forced him to do so. Asked by the Erik Wemple Blog whether he had gotten his impression of the law from Fox News, Angstadt replied, \u201c\u201cYeah, yeah \u2014 they get people fired up. You know what, I really do have a different outlook on it. It\u2019s really wrong that people are making it into a political thing. To me, it is a life-and-death thing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s serious stuff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Look to a single case study in evaluating the critique of Fox News's Obamacare coverage.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Look to a single case study in evaluating the critique of Fox News's Obamacare coverage.", "title": "President Obama\u2019s criticism of Fox News Obamacare coverage confirmed", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/10/03/president-obamas-criticism-of-fox-news-obamacare-coverage-confirmed/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/files/2013/10/obamacare.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/10/03/president-obamas-criticism-of-fox-news-obamacare-coverage-confirmed/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Fox News, Obamacare, Greta Van Susteren", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Fox News, Obamacare, Greta Van Susteren"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd23\"", "article_summary": "Having heard all manner of negative information on Obamacare, Angstadt resisted signing up until a friend all but forced him to do so.\nThat\u2019s what the President should be talking about.\u201dGreta Van Susteren, try unloading that whole very-serious-stuff argument on Dean Angstadt.\nThe attacks signal that Fox News irks the president \u2014 that the network\u2019s frequent attacks against him aren\u2019t beneath contempt.\nPresident Obama and former Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius (Charles Dharapak/Associated Press)President Obama enjoys elbowing Fox News from time to time.\nAsked by the Erik Wemple Blog whether he had gotten his impression of the law from Fox News, Angstadt replied, \u201c\u201cYeah, yeah \u2014 they get people fired up."}
