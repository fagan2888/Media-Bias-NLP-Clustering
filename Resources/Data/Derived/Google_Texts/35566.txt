Acceptance of homosexuality in the U.S. has grown leaps and bounds over the past few decades. Only between 2001 and 2013, moral acceptance of gay and lesbian relations rose from 40 to 59 percent, according to a Gallup Poll. With that also came fewer objections to gay marriage, and the Supreme Court has declined more than a few times to review such cases. With such a change in public perceptions, it’s remarkable that in December 2014 in the United States, homosexuality, for some people, is considered a vile, disgusting habit unnatural to humans.

It should be obvious who those disgusted people are. Although all who are religious aren’t guilty of hating gays — some even support gay marriage — their religions mostly prohibit same-sex relationships. And Pastor Steven Anderson of Faithful World Baptist Church in Tempe, Ariz. is one of the enforcers. In a video from one of his Sunday sermons, he says, “No homos will ever be allowed in this church as long as I’m the pastor here… Never!”

Really, it’s incredible how much effort he puts into hating gays and lesbians, ranting about their supposed pedophilia. He even says he has a solution to the AIDS problem, and that it could be gone by Christmas if we did just one thing. "Here's what the Bible says, Leviticus 20:13, 'If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination,” he read in the video. “They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.' And that, my friend, is the cure for AIDS. It was right there in the Bible all along.”

So killing all the gays will get rid of AIDS, apparently. Because that makes sense.
