Records show it dates to about 1794.\n\nOwners Andrew and Jo-Ann Travis began uncovering rustic brick-built fireplaces, including one in their bedroom, soon after moving into the onetime log cabin in 1999.\n\n\u201cWe also kept the one log wall in our bedroom, which also is in three other rooms and the hall,\u201d Jo-Ann Travis said. \u201cThat helped provide us with the historic nature of the property.\u201d\n\nExactly when Walter built his log cabin isn't clear. Public records, newspaper stories and legends indicate the home was erected as early as 1787 to 1800. The Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission list the date as 1830-1849.\n\nBut experts say such dates are hearsay or guesses made by researchers with little documentation.\n\nThe oldest houses in Allegheny County include the Graham House in Monroeville, built in 1780, and the Neville House between Bridgeville and Heidleberg, built in 1785, researchers at the Carnegie Library in Oakland said.\n\nWalter was born in 1761 and died in 1846, according to a grave marker. The marker says he was a Revolutionary War soldier, serving as a private in Capt. J. Irwin's 8th PA Regiment between 1776 and his discharge in 1779 at age 18. The marker is a few houses away from the Travis home. According to various accounts, Walter's log cabin was expanded and remodeled by various owners. A bedroom and the beginning of a second story were added in the 1840s. Around 1900, the owners added three bedrooms upstairs as well as a dining room and kitchen, according to a 2003 book, \u201cHistoric Hampton Township.\u201d\n\nThe Travises bought the house from Pat and Jim Rafferty, of Florida, who spent 30 years there, adding modern improvements without disturbing the historical nature of the house. Jim Rafferty said it was in \u201cbad shape\u201d when they bought it.\n\nVarious claims about the Walter house seem to back up the idea of its origin in the late 1700s, while other books and maps create more questions than answers.\n\nAccording to a \u201cHistory of Allegheny County, Pa.,\u201d published in 1876 by L.H. Everts & Co., Walter settled on a 15-acre tract of land in Hampton in 1794. Census records show Walter as a resident of the county in 1800.\n\nThat the house was built around that time was noted by Sue Addis Stanny, formerly of the Depreciation Lands Museum, who wrote \u201csomehow Walters knew George Washington well, and sometime between the Revolutionary War and the start of his presidency (in 1789) Washington stopped at the Walters cabin.\u201d She was quoted in a 2011 In Hampton magazine article. She could not be reached for comment.\n\nKaren Parsons, office manager and volunteer coordinator for the Depreciation Lands Museum, said a map shows John Walter formally acquired the land in 1829.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the date of the house, it is an important historic home,\u201d she said.\n\nSandy Bardoner Rodenbaugh of Medina, Ohio, grew up in the house in Hampton where John Walter's grave is located. She is writing a history of Hampton, and believes the log cabin was erected in 1794 because of information that shows John Walter got a land grant that year, possibly as payment for his Revolutionary War service.\n\nCensus records viewed by the Tribune-Review online show a John Walter living in Westmoreland County in 1790, and apparent family records show he married Catherine Freund there in 1782. The 1800 census showed a John Walter living in Pine \u2014 a portion of which became Hampton \u2014 in Allegheny County.\n\nJo-Ann Travis says a man named Elmo Jay Walter Jr. showed up at her front door one day in 2010.\n\n\u201cHe said he was a descendant of John Walter, that he loved the house and wanted to look around,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter a tour, he wrote down the family tree back to John Walter's father and mother, who had 11 children.\n\n\u201cJohn Walter (was) in Revolutionary War for 9 months,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHad to prove to Allegheny County he was in the war (to confirm) Depreciation Land,\u201d wrote Walter, who could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Travises are asking $288,000 for the house.\n\nJohn D.
