Nobel Laureate recipient Sinclair Lewis put it even more succinctly when he warned, \u201cIt [fascism] would come wrapped in the flag and whistling the Star Spangled Banner.\u201d\n\nNo one who has followed the rise of the Christian Right in national politics over the course of the past three decades should be surprised by Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision to grant corporations religious personhood. It was as predictable as Pat Robertson saying something stupid about gay sex. The hyper religious conservatives on the bench of the nation\u2019s high court, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, see the federal government as being controlled by \u2018secular humanists\u2019 who wish to make war against the purity of the Christian belief system. Like the 89 million Americans who count themselves as evangelicals, they seek total cultural and political domination.\n\nNot only is the Christian Right the most politically agitated and reliable voting bloc of the Republican Party, but it is also emboldened like no other time in their warped history. With recent efforts to legalize discrimination against gay Americans defeated, the Hobby Lobby case against the Affordable Care Act has reenergized the theocratic wing of the GOP base \u2014 the wing that is now the party\u2019s fuselage. Throw red meat to their holier than thou rationalizations and they won\u2019t care what big business does to this great nation. They care for one thing \u2013 turning America into a theocratic regime. Don\u2019t be fooled by the flag-waving and the obnoxious hyper-masculine jingoistic platitudes; the Christian Right does not love America unconditionally. They love America on the condition that representatives they help get elected are carrying out their political agenda.\n\nThere is no conspiracy theory here. Their strategy is evidently clear and unashamedly boasted. Their strategy is to control state and federal legislatures, and the courts \u2013 in a way that says, \u201cWe don\u2019t care what the American people want. We write the laws, and those laws will not reflect the wishes of the center majority, but instead will cater only for the theological cranks within our ranks.\u201d\n\nIn state after state, the nation\u2019s theocrats are fighting and defeating America\u2019s secular sense of self. The Christian Right has not only moved from the fringes to become the main strain of the Republican Party; it is the Republican Party. \u201cThe results of this takeover are all around us: If the American people poll more like Iranians and Nigerians than Europeans or Canadians on questions of evolution, scriptural inerrancy, the presence of angels and demons, and so forth, it is due to the rise of the religious right, its insertion into the public square by the Republican Party, and the consequent normalizing of formerly reactionary beliefs,\u201d observes Mike Lofgren, who spent 28 years in Congress as a Republican.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christian right's plan is simple: Dominate courts, state legislatures, and push their twisted morality on all of us", "title": "We are a corporate theocracy now: The Christian right seeks cultural and political domination", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Christian right's plan is simple: Dominate courts, state legislatures, and push their twisted morality on all of us", "title": "We are a corporate theocracy now: The Christian right seeks cultural and political domination", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/03/we_are_a_corporate_theocracy_now_the_christian_right_seeks_cultural_and_political_domination/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/06/thomas_scalia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Christian right's plan is simple: Dominate courts, state legislatures, and push their twisted morality on all of us", "title": "We are a corporate theocracy now: The Christian right seeks cultural and political domination", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/06/thomas_scalia.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "CJ Werleman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alito, Editor's Picks, Hobby Lobby, Scalia, Supreme Court, Thomas, We are a corporate theocracy now", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36a6\"", "article_summary": "The Christian Right has not only moved from the fringes to become the main strain of the Republican Party; it is the Republican Party.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the flag-waving and the obnoxious hyper-masculine jingoistic platitudes; the Christian Right does not love America unconditionally.\nNot only is the Christian Right the most politically agitated and reliable voting bloc of the Republican Party, but it is also emboldened like no other time in their warped history.\nLike the 89 million Americans who count themselves as evangelicals, they seek total cultural and political domination.\nThey love America on the condition that representatives they help get elected are carrying out their political agenda."}
