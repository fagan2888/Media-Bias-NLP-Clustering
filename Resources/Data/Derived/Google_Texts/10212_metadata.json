Thursday\u2019s coordinated strikes are the biggest event yet.\n\nIn addition to higher wages, the workers from fast-food giants including McDonalds (MCD), Wendy\u2019s and Burger King want the right to unionize without retaliation. The movement has been called misguided by critics, who claim it would create job cuts and squeeze franchise owners with already-small profit margins. But supporters say the move would allow workers to better support themselves and potentially lessen strains on government safety net programs.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t Survive on $7.35\u201d says Martin Rafanan, community director of the St. Louis fast-food worker movement, adding that that the current minimum wage structure is \u201cslowly killing our community.\u201d\n\nThe movement has support from President Obama, who said in a speech Wednesday in Washington, D.C. that he would back a Senate measure to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25, and has not been raised since 2007. Wage inflation in 2013 has increased by 1.8%, compared to 1.1% overall economic inflation.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nStates with the highest minimum wage include Washington at $9.19, Oregon at $8.95 and Vermont at $8.60. Some cities have higher minimum wage than their states\u2019 levels including San Francisco at $10.55 an hour, Santa Fe, New Mexico at $10.51 and San Jose, Calif., at $10 an hour.\n\n\u201cNo one benefits from jobs in this economic structure,\u201d says Rafanan. \u201cA dollar increase in one person\u2019s salary puts a dollar back into the economy as well. We could essentially be dumping large amounts of money back into our economy, and that is worth it for us.\u201d\n\nThe Pros of Raising the Federal Minimum Wage\n\nWhile National Center for Policy Analysis labor analyst Pam Villarreal acknowledges minimum wage jobs were never intended for people to make a living and raise a family on, due to today\u2019s tight job market and post-recession economy, many are attempting to do just that.\n\n\u201cRaising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would help people make ends meet, especially those who are supporting families working in fast food jobs. Fifteen dollars an hour won\u2019t make anyone wealthy, but again it would provide a comfortable standard of living.\u201d\n\nA 2012 study from the UC Berkeley Labor Center found 52% of front-line fast food workers are on some form of public assistance, costing nearly $7 billion per year. The nation\u2019s 10 largest fast-food companies account for $3.8 billion of that, according National Employment Law Project estimates.\n\nDefenders of the movement say raising wages could help lower the amount of Americans relying on these safety nets.\n\n\u201cIf we increase their wages, it would relieve the taxpayers of paying these benefits for workers,\u201d Villarreal says. \u201cThe problem with that analysis is that they don\u2019t consider the fact that a lot of these workers would then be unemployed.\n\nThe Cons of Raising the Federal Minimum Wage\n\nVillarreal says in the long run, increasing the minimum wage can eliminate full-time jobs.\n\n\u201cThere is already pressure on the retail industry because of ObamaCare,\u201d she says. \u201cAnecdotal evidence shows people are reducing their staff so they don\u2019t have to provide health insurance. But I think even part-time workers would be laid off because it will increase their costs as well.\u201d\n\nMike Saltsman, research director at the Employment Policies Institute, says the move would cause stores to reduce their workforces and bring on more technological help to bridge the gap.\n\n\u201cIn this case, I think it means stores will close or go the way of European fast food restaurants where customers place their orders using technology.\u201d\n\nHe points out that many fast-food store owners are smaller franchisees, meaning they pocket small margins of the profits their stores bring in annually.\n\n\u201cA lot of the focus is on large corporations, but only about one-third of low-income earners are at large businesses with more than 1,000 employees,\u201d Saltsman says. \u201cFifty-two percent are at really small businesses with less than 100 employees. The people picking up the tab with this minimum wage hike running up that high are people with small businesses facing stark economics.\u201d\n\nThe Health-Care Connection\n\nA flood of full-time workers being moved to part-time due to a nationwide minimum wage hike could lead to a higher number of people needing subsidized health care on the exchanges, says Villarreal.\n\n\u201cIf that is the [government\u2019s] whole plan here, it\u2019s pretty smart,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost too intelligent for the government to think of\u2026 There\u2019s a possibility that you would have more people that would need to enroll in ObamaCare, which could increase subsidies that taxpayers provide.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates that every individual in the country have insurance by the end of open enrollment period on April 1, 2014 or face a penalty of up to $95 a year or 1% of their annual income. Those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which is $45,000 for an individual or $94,000 for a family of four, are eligible for subsidized plans at lower costs.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 01:10:42 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Fast food workers across the country are striking for $15 minimum wage.
