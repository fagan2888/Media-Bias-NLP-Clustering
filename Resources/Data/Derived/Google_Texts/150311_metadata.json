That would affect 130,000 of its members.\n\nFor those younger than 65 who have plans that do meet the law\u2019s requirements, which is about 19,000 members, the increase request will be between 11.9 percent and 14.5 percent.\n\nThe company said that individual rate increases will vary and renewal notices will be sent to members. The rate increases, if approved, would take effect Jan. 1.\n\nWellmark also said it will seek an increase between 2 percent and 4 percent for 90,000 small group plan members whose plans do not meet Affordable Care Act requirements and an increase of less than 4.9 percent for the 14,000 members whose plans do meet those standards.\n\nThe Obama administration and the state of Iowa said earlier this year that insurers would be allowed to continue offering grandfathered plans to their customers, a reaction to the uproar over the cancellation of insurance plans last year.\n\nWellmark\u2019s announcement comes after two other insurers in the state who are participating in the online exchange detailed their own rate requests.\n\nCoOportunity Health said last week that it was seeking a rate increase of 14.3 percent, affecting about 12,000 customers. It blamed much of its proposed increase on the decision to allow the grandfathered plans to be sold in the state, saying that has distorted the market.\n\nCoventry Health Care, meanwhile, said its average proposed rate increase for individual plans would be an average of 8.7 percent, although the range was between a decline of 11 percent and an increase of 18.5 percent.\n\nThe state insurance division\u2019s office of the consumer advocate has scheduled public hearings on the CoOportunity and Coventry rate requests. But because hearings are required only for requested increases of 6.1 percent or more, only Wellmark\u2019s ACA-compliant plans will be subject to a hearing.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Iowa's dominant health insurer announced Friday that it will not take part in the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace for a second consecutive year.\r\nWell", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "Iowa's dominant health insurer announced Friday that it will not take part in the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace for a second consecutive year.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/business/wellmark-again-declines-to-participate-in-affordable-care-act-marketplace-possibility-of-larger-exchange-federal-exchange-problems-weigh-into-decision-20140620", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20140620/ARTICLE/140629974/AR/0/AR-140629974.jpg", "article": {"section": "Business"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/business/wellmark-again-declines-to-participate-in-affordable-care-act-marketplace-possibility-of-larger-exchange-federal-exchange-problems-weigh-into-decision-20140620", "description": "Iowa's dominant health insurer announced Friday that it will not take part in the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace for a second consecutive year.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Wellmark again declines to participate in Affordable Care Act marketplace"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-06-20T13:16:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_business", "pubDate": "2014-06-20T13:16:14-05:00", "title": "Wellmark again declines to participate in Affordable Care Act marketplace"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The state insurance division\u2019s office of the consumer advocate has scheduled public hearings on the CoOportunity and Coventry rate requests.\nWellmark said that for plans held by people younger than 65 that do not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, the requested rate increase would be 5.9 percent or less.\nCoOportunity Health said last week that it was seeking a rate increase of 14.3 percent, affecting about 12,000 customers.\n\u201cEvery company determines where to sell their products, and we made this decision considering a number of variables,\u201d said Laura Jackson, Wellmark\u2019s executive vice president for health care innovation and business development.\nWellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield made the announcement as it also disclosed plans to increase rates for individual and small group policyholders."}
