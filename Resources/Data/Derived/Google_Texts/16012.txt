ADP and the California Society of Certified Public Accountants have announced a partnership through which payroll and human resources solutions provider ADP will be the the exclusively endorsed payroll provider for the association. ADP says the move is a part of its commitment to helping accounting professionals grow their practices and deepen client relationships.

The society has more than 40,000 members, who can now take advantage of ADP's suite of payroll, talent management and risk mitigation solutions.

"As trusted advisors to their clients, CalCPA members are uniquely positioned to not only take advantage of ADP's solutions to help them grow their practices, but they can also leverage our proven tools and resources to help their clients mitigate compliance risks and improve cash flow," said Amit Jain, ADP vice president for strategy and business development for ADP's Small Business Services division. "By leveraging ADP's exclusive offerings, CalCPA members can also help boost their bottom line and help provide superior service to their clients."

In addition to payroll and related services, CalCPA members will automatically have priority access to HR and payroll-related continuing professional education (CPE) webinars, the CCH Resource Library and the ADP Learning Center. These include extensive information and resources about the tax provisions impacted by the Affordable Care Act. CalCPA members will also have access to other helpful resources, including a web portal tailored for accounting professionals that provides additional information about issues and opportunities affecting the accounting industry as a whole.

"We are delighted to partner with ADP to offer these benefits to our members," said John Angelo, CalCPA division director of strategic relations. "ADP's products, services and pricing are all positioned to be a great resource for our members' success."
