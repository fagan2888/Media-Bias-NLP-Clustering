Scott Walker introduced himself Sunday to Iowans.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the world needs to know that there is no greater friend and no worse enemy than the United States of America,\u201d Walker told voters here, who will cast the nation\u2019s first votes in the presidential nominating contest.\n\nWalker, who earlier this month declared his candidacy as a Republican nominee for president, gave his remarks Sunday at an event for Iowa state Rep. Pat Grassley\u2013 U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley\u2019s grandson.\n\n.@ScottWalker Winnebago has arrived pic.twitter.com/Ttgr6Z9DNS \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) July 19, 2015\n\nSpeaking at the elegant Park Place Events Centre, Walker took on challenges facing the nation.\n\n\u201cThe greatest threat to future generations is radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd we need to do something about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday we can start by lifting the political restrictions we put on the military personnel we already have in Iraq today, so they can actually start helping our Kurd and Sunni allies reclaim the territory taken by ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that we acknowledge that Israel is an ally, and start treating Israel like an ally in the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing education, Walker said he embraces \u201chigh standards,\u201d but wants them enforced at the local level.\n\n\u201cEvery child deserves access to a great education,\u201d Walker said. \u201cBe it in a traditional public, a charter, a choice, a private, virtual or a home-school environment. That\u2019s why to me, I want high standards. But I want them set at the local levels. No Common Core, no nationwide school board.\u201d\n\nHe believes education is \u201cmore effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the American people\u201d when handled state-by-state.\n\n.@ScottWalker talks economy in Iowa pic.twitter.com/zyShkImDKl \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) July 19, 2015\n\nWalker has a similar vision for reforming the tax code.\n\n\u201cWe can lower the rates, broaden the base and increase the volume of people participating in the economy,\u201d Walker said.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to reform, I\u2019m for taking power out of Washington and sending it back to our states and to our people in a way that puts the hard-working taxpayers back in charge. That\u2019s who I\u2019m for. I\u2019m for helping to build an economy that helps everyone live their piece of the American Dream. That\u2019s pro-growth.\u201d\n\nWalker, placing a high priority on securing the border and legal immigration policies, believes America needs to improve its foreign policy to be able to combat threats such as China\u2019s cyber attacks.\n\nDave & Bev Dirksen of Iowa Falls ask @ScottWalker a question dealing w/ free speech in light of the gay marriage mov. pic.twitter.com/c9oojUGWm8 \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) July 19, 2015\n\nWalker said men and women who serve in the armed forces need access to resources to keep the country safe abroad.\n\n\u201cAnd now, more than ever, we need to give them the ability to protect themselves here in America and then we need to give them the quality and timely health care that they deserve when they return home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way we can honor them is by fighting to win,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThis is important because our goal should be peace. But there will be times when America must fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a goal of hitting all 99 counties here traveling by Winnebago bus, Wisconsin Gov.
