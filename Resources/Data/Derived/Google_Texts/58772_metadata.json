The increase in taxation was driven by increases in individual income tax and payroll tax payments.\n\n\u201cThe federal budget deficit was $200 billion for the first two months of fiscal year 2016, the Congressional Budget Office estimates,\u201d said the report. \u201cThat deficit was $22 billion larger than the one recorded during the same period last year. Revenues and outlays were both higher than last year\u2019s amounts, by 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively.\u201d\n\n(Screen capture)\n\n\u201cReceipts through November totaled $416 billion, CBO estimates\u2014$12 billion more than the amount for the same period last year,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cIndividual income taxes and payroll (social insurance) taxes together rose by $19 billion (or 6 percent),\u201d said CBO. \u201cIncreases in amounts withheld from workers\u2019 paychecks\u2014$16 billion (or 5 percent)\u2014accounted for the bulk of that gain. Total wage and salary income and withheld taxes have both grown at about that same rate in recent quarters.\u201d\n\nPart of the increase in spending, CBO said, was the result of the increase in Medicaid built into Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOutlays for the first two months of fiscal year 2016 were $616 billion, or $34 billion higher than they were during the same period last year, CBO estimates,\u201d said CBO.\n\n\u201cOutlays for the three largest mandatory programs increased by 7 percent,\u201d said the report. \u201cSocial Security benefits rose by $7 billion (or 5 percent), reflecting typical recent growth in the number of beneficiaries and their average benefits.\n\n\u201cMedicare spending increased by $8 billion (or 9 percent), some of which reflects the fact that the payment made to prescription drug plans each fall to account for unanticipated spending increases in the preceding calendar year was larger in 2015 than in 2014,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cOutlays for Medicaid rose by $6 billion (or 12 percent), largely because of new enrollees added through the optional expansion of coverage authorized by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said CBO.\n\nAs of the close of business on Friday, Dec. 4, the total federal debt was $18,786,830,545,682.60, according to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe Census Bureau says that there were 117,748,000 households in the United States as of September. Thus, the $18,786,830,545,682.60 in federal debt equals approximately $159,551.16 for each household in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "*/", "title": "CBO: Taxes, Spending, Deficit All Up in First 2 Months of FY2016", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/cbo-taxes-spending-deficit-all-first-2-months-fy2016", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/ryan-boehner-ap_photo.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-08T12:32:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-08T12:17:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T12:32:37-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "*/", "title": "CBO: Taxes, Spending, Deficit All Up in First 2 Months of FY2016", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/cbo-taxes-spending-deficit-all-first-2-months-fy2016", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/ryan-boehner-ap_photo.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "*/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The increase in federal spending in the first two months of fiscal 2016 was largely driven by increased expenditures on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\u201cIndividual income taxes and payroll (social insurance) taxes together rose by $19 billion (or 6 percent),\u201d said CBO.\nThe federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 and ends on Sept. 30.\n\u201cThe federal budget deficit was $200 billion for the first two months of fiscal year 2016, the Congressional Budget Office estimates,\u201d said the report.\n(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)(CNSNews.com) - The federal government taxed more, spent more, and ran a bigger deficit in the first two months of fiscal 2016 than it did in the first two months of fiscal 2015, according estimates the CBO published yesterday."}
