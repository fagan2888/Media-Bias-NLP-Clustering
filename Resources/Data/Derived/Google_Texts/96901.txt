Surely Richard Longworth was referring to President Barack Obama in his Monday Perspective piece, “A cautionary tale come November.” The president has used various forms of executive authority to move his political agenda forward without regard for the law and power vested in the three branches by the Constitution.

In many cases, the truth is also a casualty of this process — think Obamacare and climate change. The president's actions and the actions of others in the political establishment of both parties have turned a significant part of the electorate against insider candidates. That is why Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are so popular.

The people paying taxes are fed up with waste, corruption and inefficiency in government and the resultant high debt and taxes. If we are to avoid a 1930s Germany outcome, those in power had better address the concerns of the people who are paying the bills.
