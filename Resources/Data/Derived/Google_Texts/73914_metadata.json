And history suggests that the short-term partisan pain usually produces more lasting political gain.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what the Obama White House is hoping will be the result of its messy compromise with House Republicans on a year-end omnibus spending bill that left the president\u2019s liberal supporters seething. For anyone who lived through Bill Clinton\u2019s strategic compromises with Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, the complaints from the left had a familiar ring.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn June 1995, when Clinton countered GOP demands for fiscal probity by offering his own plan to balance the federal budget (over 10 years instead of seven), House Democrats cried foul. \u201cI think most of us learned some time ago that if you don\u2019t like the president\u2019s position on a particular issue, you simply need to wait a few weeks,\u201d declared Rep. Dave Obey, a liberal stalwart from Wisconsin. \u201cIf you can follow this White House on the budget, you are a whole lot smarter than I am.\u201d\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s aides explained that he had come to the conclusion that the American people would not see him as leading if he simply said \u201cno\u201d to the Republicans, and that he was determined to be seen as being on the \u201csolution side\u201d of problems, from the budget deficit to welfare.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The man behind the political cash grab)\n\nIn the six years of his presidency, Obama hasn\u2019t had to do much of that kind of compromising, nor has he been willing to. But in the wake of the GOP\u2019s midterm rout, the president and his aides have now apparently come to the conclusion that that\u2019s what the American public wants \u2014 and even expects.\n\nThe stakes facing the two presidents are not really comparable. Clinton \u2014 in the midst of his first term \u2014 was trying to reorient his party by upending three decades of Democratic orthodoxies concerning the social compact, while Obama \u2014 nearing the end of his second \u2014 was simply trying to avoid the threat of another round of brinkmanship over a government shutdown by passing what \u2014 in a less rancorous era \u2014 would have been a routine spending bill.\n\nThis president bent on Democratic priorities \u2014 allowing the weakening of a key provision of the financial reform bill he himself fought so hard to pass, and a big increase in individual contribution limits to political parties and their congressional campaign committees \u2014 to stave off even more unpalatable elements: cuts to Obamacare, or retribution for his recent executive actions on immigration. From the administration\u2019s perspective, accepting this bill \u2014 warts and all \u2014 was better than risking an immediate shutdown or a 90-day continuing budget resolution that would have to be relitigated in the far more unstable circumstances of a larger House GOP majority and a Republican Senate.\n\nObama\u2019s presumed intention is to live to fight another day. And if he has any hope of avoiding complete marginalization in his last two years in office, that\u2019s just what he\u2019ll have to do \u2014 if only by using his veto pen \u2014 in the new year.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: How the deal got done)\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that President George W. Bush passed his Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008 with crucial Democratic support, over the vociferous objection of conservative Republicans \u2014 and even then only after the House initially rejected the bill and sent the stock market plunging in shock. In negotiations over the bill, then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson knelt down in supplication to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for her support.\n\nSo it\u2019s probably not the worst thing for Obama, politically speaking, that Pelosi has declared herself \u201cenormously disappointed\u201d with the White House\u2019s support for the spending bill, which passed with just 57 Democratic \u201cyes\u201d votes and 139 \u201cnos.\u201d Indeed, the public tends to like presidents who stand up to their own parties, and couldn\u2019t care less about the internal rivalries and disagreements within the House Democratic caucus.\n\nEarly in Clinton\u2019s tenure, House Speaker Tom Foley and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, both Democrats, urged him to abandon any push for the kind of campaign finance overhaul that Ross Perot\u2019s outside-the-box campaign had put on the national agenda. Clinton acceded and later counted the decision as one of his biggest mistakes, in terms of setting the tone for his new administration.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: How Wall St. got its way)\n\nPerhaps no other single act of Obama\u2019s presidency has received sharper criticism from both parties than his early acceptance of his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel\u2019s advice to let Pelosi take the lead in drafting the economic stimulus bill that was roundly denounced by liberals as too small and by conservatives as too laden with pet Democratic pork barrel projects.\n\n\u201cHe was far too deferential to the congressional wing of his party, and it cost him,\u201d one senior Republican House aide said Friday. \u201cIt cost them more, but it cost him.\u201d And, the aide continued, in contrast to Clinton \u2014 who made a determined strategic decision that the only way to win reelection in the aftermath of the GOP\u2019s 1994 takeover of Congress was to seek artful compromise, \u201cthis president is not really driving events anymore.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Republicans said, the White House weighed in with its last-minute lobbying push only after the basic terms of the deal had been hammered out by Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), and his colleagues Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), thus giving Pelosi a good 24 hours to solidify liberal opposition.\n\nFrom the White House perspective, internal Democratic divisions on Capitol Hill were just as pronounced \u2014 and perhaps more significant \u2014 as Pelosi\u2019s irritation with Obama.\n\nThe paradox is that despite the liberals\u2019 discontent, the White House\u2019s all-out campaign for the compromise bill involved the kind of personalized outreach \u2014 from the president\u2019s top aides to senior Cabinet officers \u2014 that congressional Democrats have been craving in vain for six years. It\u2019s tempting to ponder what sort of results Obama might have achieved if he had employed such basic care-and-feeding techniques earlier, in less drastic circumstances.\n\nWere he inclined to be a careful student of Clinton\u2019s successes \u2014 which the record suggests he is not, particularly \u2014 Obama might take comfort from the reality that 20 years ago, Clinton was widely mocked by many in his own party (and among the opposition) as weak and waffling (or at least cynical) for his compromises with the Republicans. By the end of his tenure, no less a critic than Gingrich adjudged him \u201cthe best tactical politician, certainly of my lifetime,\u201d and today he is remembered, for better and worse, as the kind of president who could close the deal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Shunning the left, he revives the politics of the \u201990s.", "title": "Obama's big Clinton moment", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/barack-obama-bill-clinton-113553.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/12/141212_clinton_gingrich_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Newt Gingrich,Bill Clinton", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Shunning the left, he revives the politics of the \u201990s.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd360d\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s practically a truism that the only way for a president without big majorities in Congress to get anything big passed is to anger his own party\u2019s base.\nFrom the White House perspective, internal Democratic divisions on Capitol Hill were just as pronounced \u2014 and perhaps more significant \u2014 as Pelosi\u2019s irritation with Obama.\nClinton acceded and later counted the decision as one of his biggest mistakes, in terms of setting the tone for his new administration.\nAt least that\u2019s what the Obama White House is hoping will be the result of its messy compromise with House Republicans on a year-end omnibus spending bill that left the president\u2019s liberal supporters seething.\nIn negotiations over the bill, then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson knelt down in supplication to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for her support."}
