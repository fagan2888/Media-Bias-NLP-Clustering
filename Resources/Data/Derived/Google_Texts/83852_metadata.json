The results yielded a nine-seat gain for Republicans in the Senate \u2014 the biggest swing in 34 years \u2014 and the largest Republican majority in the House since 1928. But I do not read that outcome as an enthusiastic embrace of the Republican Party.\n\nRather, it was more of a repudiation of President Obama's aggressive expansion of an already-too-big government and a rejection of a completely dysfunctional Congress.\n\nThe president's regulatory overreach, from his signature health care law to government-controlled banking and unaffordable constraints on industry, has stifled small businesses, diminished job opportunities, stunted wage growth and reduced middle-class living standards. Congress has been unable to provide a check on these and other executive actions because the Senate, under the control of Majority Leader Reid, has been virtually closed \u2014 almost no legislation, no amendments, no debate. Voters decided: no more!\n\nWhen Republicans take control of the Senate on Tuesday, our first duty is to reopen it. We must return it to the deliberative, functioning body it once was. In so doing, we will restore the checks and balances essential to a well-functioning federal government.\n\nWe should begin by debating and voting on legislation with significant bipartisan support. We should approve the Keystone Pipeline bill and send it to the president. If he signs it, development of the pipeline will support 42,000 good-paying American jobs, according to a State Department study. The Keystone Pipeline will also have the capacity to supply our nation with 830,000 barrels of oil per day, which could reduce our dependence on non-North American oil by almost 20 percent.\n\nRestoring the normal legislative process in the Senate will allow us to consider many energy-related amendments to a Keystone Pipeline bill. I intend to offer or support amendments to eliminate counterproductive ethanol fuel mandates, to end taxpayers' multidecade subsidies of wind-generated electricity, and to encourage the federal government to use natural-gas-burning vehicles, to name a few. I don't know whether these measures will pass the Senate. But it is long past time to have the votes and find out.\n\nI want to repeal and replace the president's health care law. But that is impossible so long as President Obama occupies the White House. So I am intent on repealing the most onerous sections of Obamacare that we can. We made progress in recent legislation that exempts expatriate Americans from Obamacare, saves taxpayers from having to bail out health insurers, and reduces funding for the Obamacare bureaucracy empowered to ration health care services.\n\nWe should build on that progress with additional bipartisan reforms, including repealing Obamacare's harmful medical device tax that raises health care costs for families and threatens thousands of well-paying jobs in Pennsylvania. We should also curb the employer Obamacare mandate and try to eliminate the individual mandate to the extent that we can while attracting enough Democratic support to reach the 60-vote threshold needed for passage in the Senate.\n\nCongress should also pass a fiscally responsible budget with a number of important reforms to the disastrous budget process. We should establish real spending limits and make it very difficult for Congress to circumvent those caps. We should pass individual spending measures, one at a time, before the end of the fiscal year, rather than rolling them into gigantic 1,000-page, $1 trillion omnibus bills in the 11th hour. We should end the threat of disruptive government shutdowns by passing legislation that would automatically continue government funding of activities for which a spending bill has not been signed into law at spending levels, say, 5 percent below the previous year.\n\nMost importantly, we should be willing to work with the president if he decides to join us in tackling one or more of the great fiscal, economic and moral challenges of our time. We have a horrendous tax code that makes our country less competitive around the world. The finances of our retirement safety net are on an unsustainable trajectory and must be reformed to serve the next generation of seniors. We have a myriad of welfare programs that unfortunately tend to keep many Americans trapped in poverty rather than lifting them up to self-sufficiency and prosperity.\n\nThese great challenges can only be solved with broad, bipartisan support and inevitably require strong presidential leadership. This will be one of the biggest opportunities, and tests, of his presidency. I don't know how the president will respond.\n\nI do know that we in a Republican-controlled Senate must demonstrate that we have the competence and will to govern. We should pursue the pro-growth agenda that has been thwarted for several years. We should restore checks and balances on executive excesses where appropriate while we reach out to this president in areas in which he is willing to work with us. If we do these things well, we will earn the confidence that has been placed in us.\n\nPat Toomey, a Republican from Upper Milford Township, is in his first term representing Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Sen.
