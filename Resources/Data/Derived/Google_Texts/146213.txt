A bill was introduced that reassess the value of agricultural land, which could increase property taxes on farmers.

Senate Bill 178 was introduced by Senator Jeff Melcher of the Committee on Ways and Means.

Political Science Professor Chapman Rackaway of Fort Hays State University says this bill highlights how legislators from the eastern counties of Kansas value agriculture differently than legislators from western counties.

"There seemed to be this attitude among eastern Kansas representatives that there was this massive pile of money that western Kansas was sitting on and I thought it was incumbent upon me to say it really isn't that much of the case," Rackaway said.

Senator Jeff Melcher talked with KAKE News over the phone and says it is time for all Kansans to pay their fair share of property tax.

"If you look at a piece of commercial property that's not farming [ground], so another income producing piece of property, they are going to pay about 33 times as much as a farmer would," Melcher said.

Rackaway has analyzed the bill and says some farmers could see a 471% increase in the value of their farm land, meaning higher property taxes.

Senator Dan Kerschen is also on the Committee on Ways and Means and says the bill has made no progress moving forward.

"It was scheduled for a hearing, the hearing was postponed or cancelled because of lack of support, mostly because of overwhelming opposition to it," Senator Kerschen said.

Kerschen is a farmer and says he does not support Senate Bill 178.

Rackaway says that if the bill does get passed, it could lead to local farmers shutting down and people in western Kansas to leave the state.
