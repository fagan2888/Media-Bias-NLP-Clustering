He used to be homeless.\n\nFor a while, he had a good job with a company called Staff Pro.\n\nThey\u2019d assign him to jobs all over King County. They expected Parnin to find his own transportation.\n\n\"First couple weeks were hard. I kept having to ask my case managers for bus tickets. But then when I finally got paid, I was able to put money on an ORCA card and get to work on time.\"\n\nNow, Bryan is unemployed.\n\nAnd bus fare has become an issue.\n\nSo he came down to King County Public Health to sign up for the new, reduced fare bus card.\n\nSo why is Public Health giving out bus cards? Because they\u2019re good at signing people up for stuff. They\u2019ve been getting a lot of practice by signing people up for health care through the affordable care act.\n\n\"We should turn to our experts inside this government who\u2019ve already done this work.\"\n\nThat\u2019s King County Executive Dow Constantine. He has this idea, called One King County, where Public Health becomes one-stop shopping for a bunch of services from health care and bus cards, to discounted utility bills and food stamps.\n\n\"The good thing about King County, we\u2019ve always had various programs here, but they\u2019ve been spread all over the map,\" says Daphne Pie. She's with King County Public Health. She says the One King County idea has her asking, \"how is it that when we serve a client, we can say, in addition to this program, how can I help you with this program.\"\n\nBut not all programs can be accessed by everyone. Pie says she\u2019s not allowed to offer health insurance to undocumented immigrants (Washington State offers exceptions for children and pregnant women).\n\nThe ORCA LIFT program will be paid for by regular bus fares.\n\nThe cost of a one-zone trip will rise to $2.75 during peak hours this March.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Just because you have health insurance, doesn\u2019t always mean you have a way to get to the doctor.
