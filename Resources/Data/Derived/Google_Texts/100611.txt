An outdoor plaza will connect the New Westin Hotel and Conference Center and the Jeppesen Terminal and Denver International Airport officials are hoping the public will help come up with the perfect name for the space.

The airport, in its call for public nominations on Thursday, said it hopes to name the space for a person who has “made a significant contribution to the success of the airport from a cultural, political, economic or social perspective.”

The 82,000 square foot plaza, which will be dedicated Feb. 28, is a mostly covered space, designed to be used for events ranging from art installations to automobile shows. The space can be configured to accommodate as many as 4,500 people which makes uses such as gala events and performances possible.

DIA spokeswoman Stacey Stegman said the space will be programmed by Denver Arts & Venues.

“We envision many uses for it,” she said. “We would love to see it connected to events in Denver and the state, to feature things that are going on in the city at the same time.”

Name nominations will be accepted through Sept. 30 and can be made at denplaza.flydenver.com.

Stegman said the suggestions will be reviewed internally and then a recommendation will be forwarded to the Denver city council.

The plaza is part of a more than $500 million project that includes the 519-room hotel and conference center, scheduled to open in late 2015, and a new Regional Transportation District transit hub that includes the new East Rail Line set to begin operations in 2016.
