Are you old enough to caucus? If you are 17 but will be 18 on or before election day, which is Nov. 8, you may register as a Democrat or Republican and participate in your respective caucus.

Nevada’s Democratic and Republican parties will conduct presidential selection contests Saturday, Feb. 20 and Tuesday, Feb. 23, respectively. The caucuses will be the only chance you’ll have to vote for your favorite White House hopeful before November Election Day. Presidential candidates will not be on the ballot in Nevada’s June primary.

Although Nevada had its first early caucuses in 2008, this will be the first competitive early caucus for the GOP, since Mitt Romney was a shoe-in as the state’s top Republican pick in 2008 and again in 2012.

For Nevadans who haven’t caucused before, the process is different than a typical primary. There are no absentee ballots or early voting for the general public. That means you must show up at a certain time and place on the selected date to pick your candidate.

Democratic caucus, Saturday, Feb. 20

Democrats will make their presidential selections at more than 200 caucus locations statewide, including about 120 in Clark County. Most are schools, community centers or places of worship. There also will be six Strip precincts to accommodate shift workers.

To start:

The Democratic Party offers a “tele-caucus” for active duty members of the military.

• Doors will open for Democrats at 11 a.m.

• Registration will begin then, and the caucuses will be called to order at 11:30 a.m. You must be in line by noon to participate.

• Democrats can pre-register for the caucus online to expedite the process on-site. Anyone, even people not registered to vote, can show up. You’ll be able to register as a Democrat at the caucus site if you haven’t registered already.

• When the caucus begins, voters will break into groups in different corners of the room. Each group represents a candidate.

If the group fails to meet the threshold to win at least one delegate, voters can break off and join other groups.

• Supporters can try to persuade others to join them, but nobody has to speak if he or she doesn’t want to.

• Each group then will elect delegates to attend the county convention in April to cast their votes for their candidate of choice. In total, caucusing takes about an hour.

• And you're done.

Republican caucus, Tuesday, Feb. 23

Republicans will have more than 130 caucus locations across the state.

To start:

The GOP allows absentee voting for disabled veterans and active-duty military and their dependents serving outside of the country.

• Republican sites will open between 5 and 7 p.m., depending on location.

• Only people who have registered as Republicans before Feb. 13 can participate.

• The Republican caucus is different from the Democratic one because votes are secret. Participants will cast confidential paper ballots in a presidential preference poll.

• During the caucus, attendees first will select a caucus chair and secretary, who run the precinct caucus, then delegates and alternates to send to the county convention to vote in March.

Voters also can submit issues to be considered in the county platform at the county convention.

• After that, one representative for each candidate will stand and tell everyone at the caucus why they should support their candidate. Then, it’s voting time.

• The entire process takes 30 to 60 minutes. All of the caucus meetings are scheduled to end by 9 p.m.

• And you're done.

This year, Nevadans are expected to play a big role in choosing the 2016 presidential nominees. Nevada will be the first Western state to make its voice heard in the presidential primary. With Nevada conducting the “First in the West” caucuses (as well as the third and fourth caucuses in the Democratic and Republican lineups, respectively), residents are in a strong position to shape national opinion.
