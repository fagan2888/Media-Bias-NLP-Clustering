This week State of Reform sits down with Washington Rep. Joe Schmick (R-Colfax) who expresses concern about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the state. In his interview, Rep. Schmick points to three things he is watching closely—the ongoing problems in the user experience at the Exchange; footing the bill for Medicaid expansion; and the worsening physician shortage in rural areas.

An outspoken advocate for farmers and ranchers, Rep. Schmick has brought attention to “the many negative effects of Obamacare” on his webpage. His constituents of District 9 comprise Asotin, Garfield, Franklin, Adams, Whitman, and south Spokane counties.
