When we last checked in on Mr. Erick\u00b2 he was like, super duper mad about the fact that the wimmenz were going around making moneys like they had some kind of penis or something. Now, he is comparing our precious, glorious reproductive systems to the idiot Republicans in office right now.\n\nVia RedState:\n\nAs Editor of this site, I cannot use the word I wish to use. At the Republican National Convention in Florida, Code Pink activists dressed up in giant pink consumes designed to look like \u2026 well \u2026 to keep things polite here \u2026 \u201clady bits\u201d as some might say to convey the message without the word. They were decorative pink costumes that look like hot dog bun costumes but altered. Never has there been a better metaphor for the Republicans in Washington, DC.\n\nHe then goes on to explain that, um, because people think Ted Cruz is ridiculous, and because the \u201cestablishment Republicans\u201d are not 100% certain that taking their toys and going home or setting the entire country on fire is the best way to deal with the legislation of policies they don\u2019t like, that said \u201cestablishment Republicans\u201d are exactly like vaginas. I think?\n\nMore Americans oppose Obamacare now than at any time. As rhetoric on defunding Obamacare has gone up, so has Republican popularity and opposition to Obamacare. A full quarter of the American public wants Congress to actually blow up Obamacare. When is the last time a full quarter of the whole population wanted Congress to do any one thing? More than half want Obamacare either destroyed or substantially changed. But the GOP, its allies in the press and pundit core, and its very leadership are such [insert euphemism of choice related to the female reproductive system] that they\u2019d rather plan their surrender before making their retreat. [emphasis added]\n\nThis, um. Isn\u2019t actually true. In fact, as long as you refer to Obamacare as The Affordable Care Act, 39% of Republicans even support it.\n\nBut more importantly\u2013 how dare you Erick Erickson! How dare you compare one of nature\u2019s greatest majesties to a Republican! They should be so lucky! I can tell you right now that my \u201clady bits\u201d not only want healthcare for everyone in this country (although they would very much prefer single payer), but they also believe in evolution, in social programs that benefit our least well off, in affordable education, in reproductive rights, and they can go a whole five minutes without saying something so bizarre and far fetched that it sounds like it should be an Onion headline rather than something someone says out loud and on purpose.\n\nGranted, while one must assume that you have not seen many \u201clady bits\u201d in person, and may thus have a bit of a skewed perspective. I assure you, Sir\u2013my \u201clady bits\u201d as you so delicately refer to them, and the \u201clady bits\u201d of most ladies in this country, are quite vastly intellectually superior to any sitting Republican in these here United States. I am sure that we would all very much appreciate it if you could, perhaps, refrain from disparaging them so.\n\nLet me tell you, D.C. Republicans\u2013I served with my lady bits. I knew my lady bits. My lady bits were a friend of mine. D.C. Republicans, you are no \u201cmy lady bits.\u201d\n\nBut Erick Erickson might be a dick.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clearly, an insult to the intellectual ability of \"Female Reproductive Systems\" everywhere", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Clearly, an insult to the intellectual ability of \u201cFemale Reproductive Systems\u201d everywhere", "title": "Fox\u2019s Erick Erickson cruelly compares the \u2018female reproductive system\u2019 to D.C.
