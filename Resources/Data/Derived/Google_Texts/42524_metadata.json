Remarkably, this isn\u2019t new legislation. There was a Death in Custody law on the books, but it somehow was allowed to expire in 2006. Why? Who knows?\n\nThe legislation addresses \u201cdeaths that occur in the process of arrest,\u201d which might be too limited a definition given the recent tragic variety of police-related killings\u2014for example, the killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland. Still, this law will compel states to collect and report on most police killings that occur in their local jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, it improves on the 2000 law by empowering the Attorney General to withhold as much as 10 percent of a state\u2019s Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funding, money from the Department of Justice used by states and localities \u201cto support a range of program areas including law enforcement, prosecution and court programs, prevention and education programs, corrections and community corrections, drug treatment and enforcement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.\u201d In FY2014, the total amount of the 56 Byrne JAG awards given to states that year was $189,328,121. The Washington Post reports that the total amount of Byrne JAG funds is $500 million.\n\nGive some credit for this to nonprofit advocacy. This legislation actually passed the Republican-dominated House of Representatives in 2013, but languished in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Its passage this month reflects the dogged advocacy work of the NAACP in keeping the issue alive. The opposition, which was strong enough to block the reauthorization of the legislation four times, seems to have been a little odd. For example, the National Association of Police Organizations opposed the bill, apparently concerned about the possibility that states\u2019 failure to provide the required data on police killings would result in reductions of Byrne JAG funds, which benefit many local jurisdictions\u2019 police departments.\n\nConsider this the first of the Ferguson laws. Without the Ferguson protests, this bill sponsored by Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) might have failed to pass yet again. It is hardly a panacea for police killings, but it adds transparency to police activities and makes cover-ups harder to pull off. In this case, while the NAACP has been pushing for the legislation for several years, it was the unfortunate deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and others plus the street protests associated with the Ferguson Action movement that saved this bill from being deep-sixed in the latest congressional lame duck session.\u2014Rick Cohen", "article_metadata": {"description": "A \u201cdeath in custody\u201d law was on the books but somehow allowed to expire in 2006.
