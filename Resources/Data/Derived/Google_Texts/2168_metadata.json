That\u2019s why physician opinion is shifting toward a nonprofit, publicly financed, Medicare-for-All-type system that would cover everyone while also controlling costs.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Michigan State Medical Society, an AMA affiliate, began to move a resolution that would appropriate $50,000 for a feasibility study of a single-payer financing system. (The resolution was referred to the Medical Society\u2019s board of directors. A joint committee is now looking at the resolution and will give a recommendation back to the board of directors. Once the board has reviewed it, will then go back to the House of Delegates in April 2015.)\n\nAbout the same time, a survey by the Maine Medical Association (also an AMA affiliate) found 64.3 percent of its members support single payer, up 12 percentage-points from just six years ago.\n\nIn a 2011 survey of its membership, the Massachusetts Medical Society found that of five options for the U.S. health care system, including the ACA model, far more \u2013 41 percent \u2013 preferred single payer to any other option. This reflected a 7 percentage-point increase over the previous year.\n\nIn 2008, the Hawaii Medical Association, an affiliate of the AMA, adopted a pair of resolutions in support of single-payer systems on both the state and national levels.\n\nThese trends are also congruent with a 2008 study by Drs. Aaron E. Carroll and Ronald Ackerman in the Annals of Internal Medicine showing 59 percent of U.S. physicians \u201csupport government legislation to establish national health insurance,\u201d a leap of 10 percentage points in physician support since 2002.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 3.8.14"}, "article_summary": "The Medical Student Section of the American Medical Association adopted a resolution that supports state legislation to provide universal health care, including single-payer legislation.\nIn a 2011 survey of its membership, the Massachusetts Medical Society found that of five options for the U.S. health care system, including the ACA model, far more \u2013 41 percent \u2013 preferred single payer to any other option.\nAbout the same time, a survey by the Maine Medical Association (also an AMA affiliate) found 64.3 percent of its members support single payer, up 12 percentage-points from just six years ago.\nThe resolution calls for the AMA-MSS to support \u201cstate-level legislation to implement innovative programs to achieve universal health care, including but not limited to single-payer health insurance.\u201d The full text of the resolution is here.\nIn 2008, the Hawaii Medical Association, an affiliate of the AMA, adopted a pair of resolutions in support of single-payer systems on both the state and national levels."}
