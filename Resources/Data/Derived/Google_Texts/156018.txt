A video has gone viral showing a Milwaukee mom holding an accused teen robber who pushed her 13-year-old daughter and stole a cellphone.

Latrisha Thompson told WDJT-TV a 14-year-old boy pushed her daughter and swiped her phone last week while she waited for the school bus near N. 34th and W. Burleigh streets. Thompson used the device's GPS to track him down and hold him in a headlock until police arrived.

The video was uploaded to the website World Star Hip Hop, where it has received more than 680,000 views. Thompson, whose video also was discussed on WNOV-AM (860) last week, told WDJT-TV she regretted the profanity she used in the video.

In an earlier Facebook post, Thompson wrote she did what she thought was right and that in her experience speaking to children in a respectable manner does not work when they aren't accustomed to being addressed that way.

The TV station, citing Milwaukee police, reported the 14-year-old boy has been arrested nine times in less than three years.
