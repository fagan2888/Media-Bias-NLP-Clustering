In 2012, CMS began to use the surveys to help determine hospitals' reimbursements, the first major step in what is an ongoing transition from a fee-for-service model to a value-based one.\n\nHospitals' scores are available on the Hospital Compare website, but starting in April, CMS plans to pare down the survey results into five-star ratings for hospitals, according to the HCAHPS website. The American Hospital Association already has criticized the star-rating program, saying it could create an unfair disadvantage for some facilities, FierceHealthFinance reported.\n\nRecent research also has questioned the link between high patient satisfaction scores and better health outcomes. Indeed, \"sometimes what we see and hear from our patients doesn't show up on [the HCAHPS] surveys,\" Rowan Medical Center President Dari Caldwell, whose North Carolina hospital has some of the lowest levels of patient satisfaction in the country, told KHN.\n\nThis hasn't kept Rowan from a concerted effort to improve patients' experience, as Caldwell has reduced emergency department wait times by replacing the physician group that ran the ED, led an effort to improve doctors' and nurses' bedside manner, and taken steps to make the clinical environment more welcoming, according to the article. Recent research has been critical of expensive, hotel-inspired hospital renovations, however, noting they may not be the key to improving the patient experience, FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\nNovant Health, a nonprofit hospital system that runs Rowan as well as 13 other hospitals in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, meanwhile, has tried to reap patient-experience lessons from Medical Park Hospital in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The surgery center has the highest patient satisfaction scores among the company's holdings, KHN reports. While one of Medical Park Hospital's main advantages may be its \"mom-and-pop\" feel, Novant has also implemented pre-surgical discussions and improved doctor-nurse relations at its other facilities based on the surgery center's example.\n\nFor most hospitals that participate in the HACHPS surveys, however, rankings haven't shown a large degree of variation over the years, Deirdre Mylod, an executive for Press Ganey, a company that conducts many of the surveys, told KHN.\n\n\"For the most part, the organizations that are doing really wonderfully now were doing well five years ago,\" she said.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\n- read about the HCAHPS star-rating program\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSmaller hospitals tend to fare better with patient satisfaction bonuses\n\nStudy questions link between patient satisfaction and clinical quality\n\nFor patient satisfaction surveys, the details count\n\n3 keys to unlock the patient satisfaction puzzle\n\nExpensive new facilities don't improve patient scores on care\n\n3 reasons patient satisfaction is more important than ever\n\nTop patient care performers are most profitable hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals have launched many initiatives to boost\u00a0patient satisfaction, but many organizations\u00a0still find the goal elusive,\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals have launched many initiatives to boost\u00a0patient satisfaction, but many organizations\u00a0still find the goal elusive,\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0reports.", "title": "Hospitals find few easy fixes for patient satisfaction scores", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-find-few-easy-fixes-patient-satisfaction-scores/2015-03-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (HCAHPS),Novant Health,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,patient satisfaction scores", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f2c\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the article- read about the HCAHPS star-rating programRelated Articles:Smaller hospitals tend to fare better with patient satisfaction bonusesStudy questions link between patient satisfaction and clinical qualityFor patient satisfaction surveys, the details count3 keys to unlock the patient satisfaction puzzleExpensive new facilities don't improve patient scores on care3 reasons patient satisfaction is more important than everTop patient care performers are most profitable hospitals\nThe surgery center has the highest patient satisfaction scores among the company's holdings, KHN reports.\nRecent research also has questioned the link between high patient satisfaction scores and better health outcomes.\nHospitals have launched many initiatives to boost patient satisfaction, but many organizations still find the goal elusive, Kaiser Health News reports.\nHospitals' scores are available on the Hospital Compare website, but starting in April, CMS plans to pare down the survey results into five-star ratings for hospitals, according to the HCAHPS website."}
