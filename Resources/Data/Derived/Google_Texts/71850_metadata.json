Malaria can cause organ failure, unconsciousness, and coma, if left untreated, and is a major cause of decreased economic productivity in affected regions.\n\nThe overall expansion of malaria-vulnerable areas will challenge management of the deadly disease, said lead author Sadie Ryan, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Florida who also is affiliated with UF\u2019s Emerging Pathogens Institute.\n\n\u201cMapping a mathematical predictive model of a climate-driven infectious disease like malaria allows us to develop tools to understand both spatial and seasonal dynamics, and to anticipate the future changes to those dynamics,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nBy 2080, the study shows, the year-round, highest-risk transmission zone will move from coastal West Africa, east to the Albertine Rift, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. The area suitable for seasonal, lower-risk transmission will shift north into coastal sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nMalaria will arrive in new areas, posing a risk to new populations, Ryan said, and the shift of endemic and epidemic areas will require public health management changes.\n\nThe study uses a model that takes into account the real, curved, physiological responses of both mosquitoes and the malaria parasite to temperature. This model shows an optimal transmission temperature for malaria that, at 25 degrees Celsius, is 6 degrees Celsius lower than previous predictive models.\n\nThis work will play an important role in helping public health officials and Non- Government Organizations (NGOs) plan for the efficient deployment of resources and interventions to control future outbreaks of malaria and their associated societal costs, Ryan said.\n\nThe collaborative research team includes experts in epidemiology, public health, ecology, entomology, mathematical modeling and geography. In addition to Ryan, other team members are Amy McNally (NASA), Leah Johnson (University of South Florida), Erin A. Mordecai (Stanford University), Tal Ben-Horin (Rutgers), Krijn Paaijmans (Universitat de Barcelona) and Kevin D. Lafferty (University of California, Santa Barbara).\n\nCopyright 2015 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/29/Malaria%20map_1448831580237_799917_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "description": "A larger portion of Africa is currently at high risk for malaria transmission than previously predicted, according to a new University of Florida mapping study.", "og": {"site_name": "WJXT", "description": "A larger portion of Africa is currently at high risk for malaria transmission than previously predicted, according to a new University of Florida mapping study.", "title": "Malaria risks increases with future climate changes", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/health/malaria-risks-increases-with-future-climate-changes", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/29/Malaria%20map_1448831580237_799917_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A larger portion of Africa is currently at high risk for malaria transmission than previously predicted, according to a new University of Florida mapping study.", "title": "Malaria risks increases with future climate changes", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/health/malaria-risks-increases-with-future-climate-changes", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/29/Malaria%20map_1448831580237_799917_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@wjxt4", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-29T23:15:22+0000", "sailthru.title": "Malaria risks increases with future climate changes", "sailthru.tags": "health,malaria,Health,Top Stories,News", "fb": {"app_id": 196517170397638}, "keywords": "health,malaria,Health,Top Stories,News", "article": {"section": "Health", "tag": "health, malaria", "published_time": "2015-11-29T23:15:22+0000", "modified_time": "2015-11-29T23:15:22+0000"}, "news_keywords": "Malaria risks increases with future climate changes", "content_id": 147883873, "sailthru.description": "A larger portion of Africa is currently at high risk for malaria transmission than previously predicted, according to a new University of Florida mapping study.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/29/Malaria%20map_1448831580237_799917_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "The collaborative research team includes experts in epidemiology, public health, ecology, entomology, mathematical modeling and geography.\nMalaria will arrive in new areas, posing a risk to new populations, Ryan said, and the shift of endemic and epidemic areas will require public health management changes.\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. - A larger portion of Africa is currently at high risk for malaria transmission than previously predicted, according to a new University of Florida mapping study.\nThis model shows an optimal transmission temperature for malaria that, at 25 degrees Celsius, is 6 degrees Celsius lower than previous predictive models.\nThe study uses a model that takes into account the real, curved, physiological responses of both mosquitoes and the malaria parasite to temperature."}
