In particular, the Hillary Clinton camp has evidently decided it's time to go on offense against independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, lest 2016 start feeling like 2008 all over again.\n\nPredictably, one line of attack is on Sanders' record on gun control, which certainly has its blemishes. Another, though, makes far less sense, particularly in a Democratic primary: Clinton is lambasting Sanders' proposal for a universal, single-payer health care system. And she's doing it in a pretty dishonest way.\n\n\"His plan would take Medicare and Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act health care insurance and private employer health insurance and he would take that all together and send health insurance to the states, turning over your and my health insurance to governors,\" Clinton said. \"We had enough of a fight to get to the Affordable Care Act. So I don\u2019t want to rip it up and start over.\"\n\n\n\nClinton's daughter Chelsea got in on the act, too, in an even worse manner, claiming that Sanders wants to \"dismantle Obamacare.\" She said: \"I worry if we give Republicans Democratic permission to do that, we'll go back to an era, before we had the Affordable Care Act, that would strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance.\"\n\n[VIEW: 2015: The Year in Cartoons]\n\nThis is mostly rank nonsense. A single-payer system, like it does in many other countries, would cover everybody, period. To say otherwise is either willfully misunderstanding how it would work or simple scaremongering.\n\nHillary Clinton, jumping on a line in an old Sanders bill that says his plan would be administered by the states, is attempting to tie him to the failure of many Republican governors to embrace Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, which has resulted in millions of people being denied health insurance. But that's very different from single-payer: Sure, Republican governors could maybe try to weasel out of whatever a President Sanders had in mind, but to think he would design a plan that governors could just ignore is silly. (For the record, Sanders' camp emphatically says the plan would apply to everyone.)\n\nBernie Sanders is proposing single-payer, universal healthcare. You can hardly say he is trying to take health care away from anyone or retreat from Obamacare. He's trying to exceed it. And so it's not really an honest attack.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Hillary Clinton But Hillary Clinton doubled down on her daughter's words on Wednesday, saying on \"Good Morning America\" that Sanders would \"\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nThis actually isn't the first time Clinton has broken out this line of criticism. In a December debate, she also used it, while parroting a ridiculous analysis claiming that Sanders' proposals would cost $18 trillion to $20 trillion. (That analysis estimated the costs of his ideas without accounting for the savings or benefits.) But now, in the heat of an ever-tightening campaign, her broadsides have taken on new meaning and urgency.\n\nThere are certainly legitimate ways to question whether single-payer is feasible right now, particularly since the Republicans are going to be able to hold on the House for the foreseeable future. Or maybe Clinton thinks, like President Barack Obama did, that switching to single-payer would be too disruptive or too difficult considering the system we already have in place.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "pat-garofalo/blogentries", "keyword": "Decision 2016 [News]", "title": "Hillary Clinton's Bizarre Attack on Bernie Sanders' Health Care Plan", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Clinton camp is lambasting Bernie Sanders' health care plan, but its critique is blatantly dishonest.", "title": "Clinton's Health Care Attack Makes No Sense", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/pat-garofalo/articles/2016-01-13/hillary-clintons-bizarre-attack-on-bernie-sanders-health-care-plan", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/85/bf06c87c43fef73b7562d3d2b97c52/media:e2b7818ac1d94c6e9f4d8efea0a6706cDem2016Debate.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Hillary Clinton's Bizarre Attack on Bernie Sanders' Health Care Plan", "description": "The Clinton camp is lambasting Bernie Sanders' health care plan, but its critique is blatantly dishonest.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 13, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Pat Garofalo,picks,Sanders, Bernie,Clinton, Hillary,Clinton, Chelsea,health care,health care reform,health insurance,Affordable Care Act,2016 presidential election,Decision 2016 [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Clinton camp is lambasting Bernie Sanders' health care plan, but its critique is blatantly dishonest."}, "article_summary": "\"His plan would take Medicare and Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act health care insurance and private employer health insurance and he would take that all together and send health insurance to the states, turning over your and my health insurance to governors,\" Clinton said.\nAnother, though, makes far less sense, particularly in a Democratic primary: Clinton is lambasting Sanders' proposal for a universal, single-payer health care system.\nYou can hardly say he is trying to take health care away from anyone or retreat from Obamacare.\n\"We had enough of a fight to get to the Affordable Care Act.\nPredictably, one line of attack is on Sanders' record on gun control, which certainly has its blemishes."}
