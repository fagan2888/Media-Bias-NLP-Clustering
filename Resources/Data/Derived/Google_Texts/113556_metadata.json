His medical work has reached 70 countries, tackling everything from tuberculosis in Peru to child mortality rates in Ghana.\n\nBut that global acclaim didn\u2019t count for much on a recent Thursday afternoon when Don Berwick walked under a white tent in Waltham where the annual chamber of commerce barbecue was in full swing. Smoke billowed from a grill. Frank Sinatra crooned on the sound system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Berwick went from table to table, introducing himself to jewelry store clerks and realtors in golf shirts and sun dresses, he was met with blank stares.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re running for governor?\u201d one woman said, looking up from her pasta salad. \u201cOn what ticket?\u201d\n\nThis is Berwick\u2019s challenge as he struggles to make the jump from rock star in the rarefied realm of health care quality improvement to credible contender for governor of Massachusetts.\n\nHis high-flying r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 parts of which would fit comfortably on Bono\u2019s list of global achievements \u2014 has not translated easily onto the ground in Lowell and Worcester.\n\nThough his background is wider-ranging than any Democrat in the race, and though he has the most distinctive policy positions, Berwick is trailing far behind Martha Coakley and Steve Grossman. Polls show 65 percent of likely voters in Tuesday\u2019s primary don\u2019t even know who he is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA rumpled 67-year-old pediatrician from Newton who does crossword puzzles before bedtime, Berwick launched the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Cambridge in 1991. The $40 million nonprofit helps governments and hospitals around the world reduce medical errors and improve care. In 2005, he earned knighthood for helping an entire country, Britain, overhaul its troubled health care system. And from 2010 to 2011, he ran Medicare and Medicaid for President Obama.\n\nHe is the only Democrat running for governor who opposes casinos and supports single-payer health care, a seismic shift that he says would save millions of dollars by using the government, rather than private insurers, to finance the health care system.\n\nHe calls himself \u201cthe most progressive candidate in the field by far\u201d and likes to quote Hubert Humphrey\u2019s rubric that government needs to meet a \u201cmoral test\u201d of how it treats those on the margins of society.\n\nWith voters, he is so soft-spoken that, even in small groups, people have to lean in to listen to him. But his quiet basso should not be confused with a lack of self-confidence.\n\nHe often talks about himself in global terms \u2014 an expert \u201cwho helped design health care delivery around the world\u201d \u2014 and he can show flashes of frustration that the press and the broader electorate have not fully grasped the influence of his work.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one person in the world who has said the most about how we can have absolutely all the care we want and need,\u201d he recently told reporters, as he walked briskly along Atlantic Avenue to a fund-raiser at a downtown law office. \u201cAll we have to do is organize it properly.\u201d\n\nOn the trail, he travels modestly, in a Honda Civic owned by David Marsh, a 23-year-old Williams College graduate who holds the official title of policy director on the campaign.\n\n\u2018Part of it is being a doctor, but a lot more of it is being the kind of executive I know I can be, and what I know you can get done with that.\u2019\n\nOnly recently did he agree to give up driving himself after Marsh and other aides convinced him he could get work done if he wasn\u2019t behind the wheel.\n\nCruising on the Massachusetts Turnpike to a meeting with South Asian business executives in Boston, Berwick never mentioned the polls that showed him in third place or the latest ads his opponents were running. Instead, he and Marsh discussed the Affordable Care Act and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to e-mail you a blog posting about legal challenges to the ACA, just so we understand it,\u201d Berwick told Marsh, who nodded.\n\nThen Berwick raised a point that had been bothering him. A woman at a fund-raiser had reacted angrily, he said, when he mentioned that Hamas uses civilians as \u201chuman shields\u201d to protect its rockets in Gaza. She had argued there were no human shields, he said.\n\nBerwick asked where he could find reliable information on the issue. Marsh suggested trying a range of news outlets and tried to steer the candidate back to local concerns.\n\n\u201cFor our purposes, that\u2019s not a road I think we want to go down,\u201d the aide said.\n\nBut Berwick persisted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he told Marsh.\n\nIn between making fund-raising calls, Berwick eagerly courted the press \u2014 a sign of his openness and willingness to answer questions, but also a recognition that he needed every ounce of ink and second of airtime to help raise his profile with voters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no threshold to getting through to me,\u201d he told a WBUR reporter on the phone. \u201cAnytime. Anywhere.\u201d\n\nThroughout the day, as he traveled from an interview at Channel 5 to a meeting with activists on Beacon Hill, Berwick was asked by reporters and by some of his own supporters about his lowly poll numbers. At the time, he was at single digits, and has only recently cracked 10 percent. He remained unfailingly upbeat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a roll,\u201d he told a donor on the phone in Marsh\u2019s Civic. \u201cWinning is possible.\u201d\n\nYet about a week later, on a Monday morning, the main event of his day found Berwick sitting unnoticed in the accordion-midsection of the number 28 bus as it rolled past nail salons and discount stores from Mattapan to Dudley Square. The bus ride was intended to highlight the candidate\u2019s commitment to public transportation. But it drew little notice from the press or the traveling public.\n\nPassengers squeezed by Berwick as he talked about \u201csmart growth\u201d and \u201cmodal equity\u201d with a less-than-well-known political figure he had brought in for the occasion: Earl Blumenauer, a bow-tied congressman from Portland, Ore., who founded the Congressional Bicycle Caucus. With them was a former state transportation secretary and two young MBTA advocates.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cutting edge now in bicycle use? What\u2019s exciting?\u201d Berwick, sporting a green bicycle pin on his lapel, asked Blumenaeur. Then, as the congressman spoke about bike-share programs and dedicated lanes, Berwick listened intently, occasionally scribbling notes on a three-by-five card.\n\nLater, at a small fund-raiser at a downtown law office, Blumenauer handed Berwick a check for $500, saying he \u201cexemplified the kind of people we need in government\u201d and predicted he would surge in the polls, once voters get to know him.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is that competence and accomplishment doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into political crackle,\u201d Blumenauer said. \u201cBut this is going to be a very low-turnout primary that is going to engage people who are a little more thoughtful, and I think that\u2019s his sweet spot: people who think and process the information and pay attention.\u201d\n\nThe son of a small-town doctor from Connecticut, Berwick says he always wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. After graduating from Harvard College, the Kennedy School of Government, and Harvard Medical School, he started as a pediatrician in the Kenmore Square office of Harvard Community Health Plan in 1979.\n\nHe met the woman he would later marry, Ann Greenberg, when they were lab partners in biology class in their first week of freshman year at Harvard. She is now chairwoman of the state Department of Public Utilities.\n\nThe couple has four children: Ben, 37, a Justice Department lawyer in Washington; Dan, 35, a solar energy executive in Cambridge; Jessica, 32, a doctor who lives in Zimbabwe; and Rebecca, 27, a teacher who recently moved to Barcelona.\n\nBerwick\u2019s own career path shifted dramatically after Harvard Community Health Plan put him in charge of quality improvement in 1982. In the medical field, the job traditionally meant punishing doctors who made mistakes.\n\nBut Berwick took the position just as companies like Toyota were reshaping the corporate world with management theories that promised to cut costs while improving quality.\n\nFrustrated that error rates were not dropping at his own company, Berwick met with Swissair executives, NASA scientists, and engineers at Bell Labs, looking for advice.\n\nA. Blanton Godfrey, who was head of quality theory at Bell Labs, recalled leading Berwick on a tour and asking if there was anything he had seen that was new to him.\n\n\u201cHe stunned me by saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t see a single thing we do today in health care,\u2019\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cThat was my wake-up that health care was different and a little bit behind.\u201d\n\nBerwick became enamored of a particular brand of management theory \u2014 \u201ctotal quality management\u201d \u2014 that seeks to enlist the entire workforce in improving quality, rather than handing that task only to managers.\n\nIn health care, that meant having hospital employees check their own work \u2014 to verify, for example, that a bed should be placed at a 45-degree angle when a patient is on a ventilator and that antibiotics should be given exactly an hour before surgery to reduce infection, said Godfrey, who became a friend and mentor.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t invent anything per se,\u201d said Joel I. Shalowitz, a professor of health industry management at Northwestern University, who has followed Berwick\u2019s career. \u201cBut he drew on these management techniques and highlighted the need to do them\u201d in the highly complex medical field, which was revolutionary in its own right.\n\nThe Institute for Healthcare Improvement expanded the work globally. It runs educational programs for nearly 200,000 health care workers across the world, and its projects include the 100,000 Lives campaign, which seeks to improve patient safety and was featured in Berwick\u2019s first television ad.\n\nThe institute's office itself seeks to be a model of collaboration. There, Berwick made a point of eschewing the traditional chief executive\u2019s corner office and placed his desk in a room with six other employees. He considers the institute\u2019s work his proudest achievement, and a model for how he would govern.\n\n\u201cThis is what I can bring to the job,\u201d he said walking through the sleek glass space in Harvard Square.\n\nIn 2010, when Obama chose Berwick to run the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, he saw it as an opportunity to bring his management ideas to a sprawling federal bureaucracy. But Republicans vowed to block his nomination, seizing on Berwick\u2019s praise of the British-run National Health Service. (\u201cI am romantic about the NHS; I love it,\u201d he said in a 2008 speech.)\n\nRepublicans also portrayed Berwick as an advocate of health care rationing, pointing to a 2009 interview in which he said, \u201cThe decision is not whether or not we will ration care \u2014 the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.\u201d He says the quote was taken of out of context and that he was talking about trying to shine a light on the power of insurers to restrict care.\n\nObama bypassed Congress and installed Berwick as a recess appointment, allowing him to run the agency for 17 months.\n\nBerwick said he loved the job, rewrote the agency\u2019s mission statement, and encouraged his workers to innovate, telling them, \u201cIf you fail, I will cheer you on, because it means you tried.\u201d\n\nBut after his recess appointment ended and Berwick was effectively ousted from Washington, he returned home feeling \u201ckind of schizophrenic,\u201d he said. He was furious at Republicans, who he said distorted his views. But he was also yearning for another shot at public life.\n\n\u201cI have a strong sense that I can help,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of it is being a doctor, but a lot more of it is being the kind of executive I know I can be, and what I know you can get done with that. That\u2019s a story I\u2019d love to tell.\u201d\n\nHe has just a few days left to tell it, and a growing sense of urgency is setting in.\n\nAt a recent Friday evening fund-raiser at a home in Cambridge, only 10 people showed up, not exactly an overflow crowd. As the guests sipped white wine, Berwick stood in the living room and spoke passionately about ending hunger and homelessness and reducing the prison population. Then he begged for help. Take a bumper sticker. Write a check. Ask two friends to write checks.\n\n\u201cThis matters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s game time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.802806301", "eomportal-id": 627049, "description": "He has been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and rubbed elbows with the Dalai Lama.
