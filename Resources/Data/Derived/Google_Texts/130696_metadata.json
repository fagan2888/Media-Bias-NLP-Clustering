(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nFor tax year 2015, millions of Americans will be getting a new tax form related to health care reform measures.\n\nWill you know what to do with yours when it arrives?\n\nThe Affordable Health Care Act, colloquially known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d mandated three new tax forms to be used as a kind of proof of insurance so taxpayers may avoid paying a penalty for failure to be covered. They are:\n\nForm 1095-A, sent to those who purchase health insurance on government marketplaces.\n\nForm 1095-B, sent to employees of businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees\n\nForm 1095-C, sent to employees of businesses with more than 50 full-time employees\n\nWhile Form 1095-A debuted last year after Americans began purchasing insurance on exchanges and qualifying to related tax credits, tax year 2015 will be the first time the B and C version are mailed out to insured employees.\n\nBut if you\u2019re intimidated by the prospect of more paperwork, don\u2019t be. In fact, you don\u2019t even have to wait for the tax form to arrive in the mail if you know you were covered for all of 2015, said Debra Hammer, spokeswoman for tax preparation giant Intuit TurboTax.\n\n\u201cGo ahead and file your taxes before the form arrives. And when you do get a form, just review it for accuracy,\u201d Hammer said.\n\nYou may have to dig that 1095-B or 1095-C out of the filing cabinet if you get audited, she adds, so don\u2019t throw it away. But otherwise it\u2019s just a \u201ccheck the box\u201d exercise on your form 1040, then you\u2019re done.\n\nOf course, things are trickier if you do not have health insurance, or if you were only covered for part of tax year 2015.\n\nThe purpose of the forms, after all, is to prove you have insurance and, therefore, avoid paying a penalty that is sometimes referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\n\nThat penalty is going up in for tax filers this April to $695 per adult or 2.5% of household income, whichever is higher, up from $325 per adult or 2% of household income previously. The penalties for children under 18 have also risen to $347.50 from $162.50, and the household cap on fines has more than doubled to $2,085 annually from $975.\n\nIf you weren't insured for every month in tax year 2015, it\u2019s worth exploring any exemptions you might have before paying any related penalties. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service said about 300,000 people paid a penalty last year but likely qualified for some kind of exemption. If you are facing a fine, visit healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool to see if there\u2019s a way to reduce or eliminate that penalty.\n\nAll in all, Hammer of TurboTax said that the new Affordable Act Tax forms are straightforward and that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t panic.\n\n\u201cGiven that people don\u2019t have to wait until they have the B's and C's to file their taxes, it shouldn\u2019t be a difficult year,\u201d she said. And given that Form 1095-A is now a year old and the exchanges have been running for some time, both preparers and the IRS itself should easily be able to process filings without a hitch this year.\n\nBut are businesses prepared?\n\nHowever, while individuals may have an easy go of it, small businesses may find compliance with the new tax rules a bit troublesome on their end, said Vic Saliterman, senior vice president of health care reform at payroll service provider ADP.\n\nSome employers with 50 or more full-time workers may be subject to \u201cshared responsibility\u201d fines if they don\u2019t offer employees insurance \u2014 or if their plans are too costly or don\u2019t offer a minimum amount of coverage. That means they have to keep accurate records and report their insurance plans to the IRS or else suffer big fines of their own.\n\n\u201cThe 1095 form is really the mechanism that the IRS is going to use to assess whether or not each person has the required coverage, and it\u2019s what the individual is going to use to demonstrate that they\u2019ve got the coverage,\u201d Saliterman said. \u201cThen the IRS will marry the two up.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if you\u2019re a small-business owner and miss some forms, discrepancies may raise flags or result in fines with the IRS.\n\nADP recently conducted a survey of businesses to see how prepared they are, and more than half of businesses with 50 to 999 workers said they\u2019re not sure if they are in compliance. More than 4 in 10 businesses with 1,000 or more workers also aren\u2019t sure.\n\nSaliterman said that the study shows that the smaller the company, the more at risk it is.\n\n\u201cThey are so focused on running their business, they just don\u2019t have the additional resources to focus on things of this nature,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, Saliterman added, small businesses may have their hands full for some time because \u201cit\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ve seen the final chapter\u201d in tax changes related to the Affordable Care Act. He pointed to debates over the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on premium insurance plans as just one sticking point employers will have to watch.\n\n\u201cWith something as broad and complex as the ACA and with so many political interests, things will remain very fluid,\u201d Saliterman said.\n\nJeff Reeves is the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author of The Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RzqZiz", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Millions of Americans will be getting a new tax form related to health care.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Millions of Americans will be getting a new tax form related to health care.", "title": "Are you prepared for new Obamacare tax forms?", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2016/01/20/you-prepared-new-obamacare-tax-forms/79007062/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Millions of Americans will be getting a new tax form related to health care.", "title": "Are you prepared for new Obamacare tax forms?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/806155f42b8799e18ccd1b9922c377ff319d0ed9/c=0-0-1735-1735&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635888286811641483-494618138.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Income taxes", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Income taxes", "title": "Are you prepared for new Obamacare tax forms?", "author": "Jeff Reeves", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/personalfinance", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd95536f61ae1318d7f69a2e1d7f3b9820e7d799/c=378-0-1679-1735/local/-/media/2016/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635888286811641483-494618138.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2347638e8d3c1e1c2b22900b628232169917da1/c=0-0-1735-1735/local/-/media/2016/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635888286811641483-494618138.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ceb70955013bcb79b7e2f2a5cd25b276d930c90/c=0-34-1735-1339/local/-/media/2016/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635888286811641483-494618138.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b297facf50fb40b1b581915d45b2ae618828df6/c=0-223-1735-1203&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635888286811641483-494618138.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-02-19T11:33:16.860000-05:00", "shorthed": "Are you prepared for new Obamacare tax forms?", "articleid": 79007062, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6db33a9a96906c22920de476ec084c31300509fb/c=0-223-1735-1203/local/-/media/2016/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635888286811641483-494618138.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/36d32e993543c88a5a0c1311bb85d9209acf880e/c=456-0-1428-1735/local/-/media/2016/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635888286811641483-494618138.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "taxes, obamacare, health care, penalty, tax form, 1095, new form, irs, income taxes, prepare"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)For tax year 2015, millions of Americans will be getting a new tax form related to health care reform measures.\nThey are:Form 1095-A, sent to those who purchase health insurance on government marketplaces.\nOf course, things are trickier if you do not have health insurance, or if you were only covered for part of tax year 2015.\nAll in all, Hammer of TurboTax said that the new Affordable Act Tax forms are straightforward and that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t panic.\nThe Affordable Health Care Act, colloquially known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d mandated three new tax forms to be used as a kind of proof of insurance so taxpayers may avoid paying a penalty for failure to be covered."}
