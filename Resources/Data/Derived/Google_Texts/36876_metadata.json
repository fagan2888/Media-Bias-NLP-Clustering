(AP) - Yugo Aoki singled for Tokyo\u2019s first hit in the seventh inning, and then scored on a fielder\u2019s choice to help Japan beat Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, 1-0 on Saturday for a spot in the championship game of the Little League World Series.\n\nThe run came home when Mexico was unable to turn a double play on a bases-loaded ground ball up the middle by Koki Jo. It was the only offense during an impressive pitching performance for Japan\u2019s Kabu Kikuchi and Mexico\u2019s Armando Verdugo.\n\nKikuchi allowed four hits and struck out 10. Verdugo also struck out 10 and gave up just two hits, both in the extra frame.\n\n\u201cI knew today was going to be my last day as a Little League pitcher so I put 100 percent of my energy into every single pitch,\u201d Kikuchi said through a translator. \u201cThe Mexican pitcher was very good so I tried not to allow any runs.\u201d\n\nTokyo also beat the Mexican team 3-1 early in the tournament.\n\nTokyo, the international champion, will play the winner of the U.S. championship between Pearland, Texas, and Lewisberry, Pennsylvania, on Sunday for the World Series title.\n\nAoki led off the seventh with a grounder to shortstop Jorge Armenta, who made a nice play on a bad hop but was unable to get Aoki at first. Kengo Tomita then doubled over the head of left fielder Ernesto Rios.\n\nKikuchi reached after catcher Raul Leon dropped a third strike and didn\u2019t throw to first. Verdugo then struck out Nobuyuki Kawashima, but Jo hit a ground ball past the pitcher to drive in the winning run.\n\nAfter its first loss to Japan, the Mexican team got into a groove at the plate, winning games against Australia, Taiwan and Venezuela by scores of 14-3, 11-1 and 11-0.\n\nBut Kikuchi held its big hitters in check, throwing 57 strikes in 77 pitches.\n\nMexico dropped to 0-6 against Japan in its last three Little League World Series. It is 11-0 against everyone else in the same stretch.\n\nManager Jorge Armenta said he doesn\u2019t know why.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things, I think, their discipline, their culture,\u201d he said through a translator. \u201cThey\u2019re always focused on the game and always make plays.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s biggest threat came in the fifth inning. First baseman Daniel Zaragoza hit a leadoff double to left-center and advanced on a sacrifice by Alberto Bustos. But Kikuchi then struck out pinch-hitter Damian Garcia and center fielder Derik Lopez.\n\nJapan threatened in the bottom of the sixth, when Shingo Tomita reached on a questionable two-base error with two outs. Tomita\u2019s line drive to left was dropped by Ernesto Rios, who appeared to be transferring the ball to his throwing hand when it fell out. But Yuma Watanabe grounded out to third to end the threat.\n\nThis Kitasuna Little League won the World Series in 2001 and 2012, and the international championship in 2007. It is seeking Japan\u2019s 10th world title, and the third in four years. Another league from Tokyo won in 2013.\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Cody Butler contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yugo Aoki singled for Tokyo's first hit in the seventh inning, and then scored on a fielder's choice to help Japan beat Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, 1-0 on Saturday for a spot in the championship game of the Little League World Series.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Yugo Aoki singled for Tokyo\u2019s first hit in the seventh inning, and then scored on a fielder\u2019s choice to help Japan beat Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, 1-0 on Saturday for a spot in the championship game of the Little League World Series.", "title": "Japan beats Mexico 1-0 at Little League World Series", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/japan-beats-mexico-1-0-at-little-league-world-seri/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/6b9e6674ccb68126800f6a7067008b6e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/6b9e6674ccb68126800f6a7067008b6e.jpg", "description": "Yugo Aoki singled for Tokyo's first hit in the seventh inning, and then scored on a fielder's choice to help Japan beat Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, 1-0 on Saturday for a spot in the championshi", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Japan beats Mexico 1-0 at Little League World Series"}, "Author": "PAT EATON-ROBB", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc218\"", "article_summary": "Mexico dropped to 0-6 against Japan in its last three Little League World Series.\nThis Kitasuna Little League won the World Series in 2001 and 2012, and the international championship in 2007.\nSOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.
