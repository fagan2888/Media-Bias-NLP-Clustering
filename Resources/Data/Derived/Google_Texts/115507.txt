An advert for Obamacare provisions is targeting same-sex couples who are now eligible for partner benefits.

The new ad, released by Get Covered Illinois, focusses on a same-sex couple who are eligible for joint healthcare cover as a result of the Affordable Care Act.

The ad references the introduction of same-sex marriage in Illinois last year, saying: “Jake & Allen, Married & Insured 2014”

Jake says: “We levelled up: stranger to boyfriend to civil union to a marriage

“In Illinois we can enroll in affordable care together. The sign-up process took minutes, and after being uninsured for years, I had appendicitis.

“Having affordable care was sincerely a life-saving moment.”

Allen added: “I was telling myself, this is a really standard procedure, everything’s going to be okay… thank god we got insurance, because I don’t know what we would have done.

Jennifer Koehler of Get Covered Illinois said the drive was because “we’re in a really historic time in Illinois” after the introduction of same-sex marriage last June.

She told the Washington Post: “We’re making sure all families across Illinois understand what their new benefits are, what their new options are under the Affordable Care Act.”
