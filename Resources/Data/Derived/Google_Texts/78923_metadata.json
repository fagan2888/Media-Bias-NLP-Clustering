He would know \u2014 the screenwriter and his niece, Jazz Johnson, just penned The Social Climber\u2019s Bible, a satirical take on the \u201cart\u201d of getting ahead.\n\n\u201cWe realized how much the rules have changed and how much things socially really are different,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cThere are a certain set of rules that can no longer be found in Emily Post.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, the Johnson & Johnson heiress says, a successful social climber has to know all the power players: \u201cEverybody\u2019s already in the game of knowing who\u2019s who, and knowing the lineup, and knowing the big names.\u201d\n\nEating at the right see-and-be-seen restaurants with the right people is also crucial.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if you have the influence,\u201d Wittenborn explains, \u201cit\u2019s if people think you\u2019re best friends with someone.\u201d\n\nCompared to other cities, such as New York, social climbing can be done on the cheap in D.C., say the co-authors.\n\n\u201cYou can have lunch with a congressman or senator for not very much money. It\u2019s a lot easier than getting the head of Goldman Sachs to sit down with you,\u201d Wittenborn, the producer behind the film \u201cBorn Rich,\u201d says.\n\nThere are even ways to save money as someone is climbing the ladder: \u201cI\u2019ve heard of one nameless mountaineer that\u2019s so after the bargain that she just buys one ticket, and she has her husband wait in the car, and she goes to the event,\u201d exclaims Wittenborn. \u201cAnd I thought, my God, I only wish that the rest of our government was so thrifty!\u201d\n\nThe pair of scribes are divulging a few other tips for becoming kings and queens of the social scene: \u201cHonesty is rarely the best policy and is often hurtful;\u201d \u201cOne should never appear a gold digger, especially if they are one;\u201d and \u201cAlways kiss all four of your host or hostess\u2019 cheeks: Flattery will get you everywhere.\u201d\n\nWittenborn says for Washingtonians and the rest of the country, social climbing is simply in our blood: \u201cWe are a country of immigrants, and people came here to escape tyrannical political power or a class system. People have come to America to climb the ladder. So you could say social climbing is democracy in action and part of the democratic process of our republic.\u201d\n\nJohnson, an avid equestrian, adds that she\u2019s hoping readers of her tongue-in-cheek Bible are able to laugh at themselves, \u201cOur intention isn\u2019t to make social climbers more paranoid or worried about others\u2019 judgments. It\u2019s to kind of call it what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll great politicians are great social climbers,\u201d Wittenborn declares. Johnson calls it a \u201crequirement of the job,\u201d saying political candidates have a \u201chigher, more perfected level of social ease than the average person.\u201d\n\nBut, she says, \u201cLet\u2019s face it, everyone to a certain extent is a social climber.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Social self-advancement in Washington is \u201cpretty much just about influence and money,\u201d says author Dirk Wittenborn.
