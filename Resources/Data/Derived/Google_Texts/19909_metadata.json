And, if Democrats play along, they may have the votes.\n\nIf Boehner isn\u2019t feeling the heat, at least publicly, his friends certainly appear to be, after an ally went on a spectacular tirade that included calling conservatives communists.\n\nThe Hill reported that Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., used some rather colorful language to charge conservatives were siding with House Leader Nancy Pelosi against Boehner.\n\n\u201cThe right-wing Marxists have teamed up with Pelosi. They\u2019re the ones who always team up with Pelosi. They are the Pelosi Republicans,\u201d said Nunes.\n\nA conservative House GOP aide portrayed that as a case of the pot calling the kettle black, telling WND, \u201cMr. Nunes is conveniently rewriting history. It was House Republican leadership that worked with Pelosi\u2019s caucus rather than House conservatives to pass Trade Promotion Authority.\u201d\n\nBut, still, why would Nunes, considered a conservative himself, so scathingly attack fellow conservatives, as well as repeatedly defend Boehner?\n\nThe answer, according to a source with intimate knowledge of Capitol Hill behind the scenes, is that Nunes has made a deal and become \u201cBoehner\u2019s political assassin.\u201d\n\nThe source called Nunes \u201ca great guy and a conservative by philosophy\u201d but said he had made a pact with Boehner.\n\n\u201cIn exchange for status as a Boehner insider,\u201d the source told WND, \u201cDevin gives John Boehner a lot of NRCC (National Republican Congressional Committee) campaign money. Probably a million or more per cycle, because Devin has an easy district and easily gets reelected, so, instead of spending the money on himself, he gives it to Boehner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevin\u2019s assignment is to go to the press and savage conservatives or conservative strategy, saying what Boehner would say but without attribution to Boehner.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, the source said, Nunes was given \u201ca plum committee chairmanship.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoehner needs someone to publicly hatchet the tea-party congressmen because they are a political threat to John,\u201d explained the source.\n\n\u201cJohn can\u2019t afford politically to have those words come from his mouth, so he has loyal lieutenants leak a message to which ever media outlet Boehner wants his message delivered to.\u201d\n\nMultiple Capitol Hill sources confirmed the Boehner-Nunes pact to WND, but one source emphasized that all House committee chairs are required to raise certain amounts of money for the NRCC, and that it is common knowledge. That source said it was still clear that Nunes was doing Boehner\u2019s bidding.\n\nFellow Californian and former colleague Rep. Richard Pombo defended Nunes, telling WND, \u201cDevin is Devin, and he stands up for what he thinks and believes.\u201d\n\n\n\nPombo, who called himself more sympathetic to the tea-party wing of the GOP than the Republican establishment, called speculation of such a pact between Nunes and Boehner a \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nWND attempted to contact Boehner and Nunes for a response to the allegation of a pact but was not successful.\n\nNunes has an association with WND as the author of \u201cRestoring the Republic,\u201d published by WND Books in 2010.\n\nThe incident on Tuesday was not the first time Nunes has come to Boehner\u2019s defense.\n\nIn February, he called House Republicans who defied Boehner and pressed for defunding Obama\u2019s executive amnesty \u201cphony conservatives.\u201d\n\nNunes said, \u201cI prefer to be in the arena voting than trying to placate a small group of phony conservative members who have no credible policy proposals and no political strategy to stop Obama\u2019s lawlessness.\u201d\n\nWhen conservative Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., filed a surprise motion in July to remove Boehner as speaker, a motion that still looms over his head, Nunes belittled it as a fundraising tool and a publicity stunt.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t raise any money, you need a way to raise money, you do gimmicks like this,\u201d said Nunes.\n\nAnd, Tuesday was actually not the first time Nunes has called conservatives communists for trying to stop Obama.\n\nReferring to conservative efforts to defund Obamcare and the president\u2019s executive amnesty, as well as Planned Parenthood, Nunes told the Associated Press last month, \u201cThey\u2019re kind of like their own party,\u201d and, \u201cYou can\u2019t really do anything about it because they\u2019re right-wing Marxists. It\u2019s unpredictable what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nIf establishment Republicans seem on edge, conservatives are playing it cool while waiting to see what kind of budget Boehner proposes.\n\nWND asked a half-dozen conservative House members for reactions to Nunes calling conservatives Marxists, but most preferred not to go on the record, apparently biding their time and waiting for Boehner to make his move on the budget.\n\nAn exception was Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., a former economics professor who came into office in a stunning upset of a key GOP leader, former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nBrat is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative House members who have been frustrated with Boehner\u2019s perceived reluctance to effectively fight the president and to use the House\u2019s power of the purse to defund Obama\u2019s activities they find objectionable.\n\nThat frustration now may be coming to a head over the fight to defund Planned Parenthood, the abortion provider accused of selling baby parts for profit after the release of a series of undercover videos.\n\nReferring solely to the comments made by Nunes on Tuesday, not the allegation of a pact, Brat told WND, \u201cIn the first place, we are supposed to be on the same team, and team members should respect votes of conscious and votes that represent their constituencies.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the congressman has his facts upside-down. Marx was for big government, and I am for smaller government. I am not the one pushing to bust the budget caps, increase the debt ceiling, and push the next generation into a fiscal ditch.\n\n\u201cFinally, on the ethics, one should not be name-calling a member of their own team, especially when the pope is in town.\n\n\u201cAs a professor of economics and ethics, I urge my colleague to hit the books a bit harder.\u201d\n\nNo longer a direct party to the fray, and also speaking only about the recent Nunes comments, not the alleged pact, former Rep. Steve Stockman had no reservations, telling WND, \u201cMy fellow conservatives on Capitol Hill tell me the number of lawmakers who oppose John keeps growing, especially over Planned Parenthood funding. His weak allies will start looking for the exit doors.\u201d\n\nStockman also pointed out the irony of accusing conservatives of siding with Pelosi, because, \u201cBoehner will need Nancy to keep his seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s supporters are saying conservatives are tied to Nancy? Now that\u2019s hilarious. The clock is ticking. And when it strikes midnight, boom \u2013 he\u2019s going out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Boehner is left pondering what may be the biggest decision of his career.\n\nPolitical analysts have said the prospect of a shutdown terrifies GOP leaders because they are convinced they will lose the war of public opinion played out in a liberally biased mainstream media, even if it would be President Obama shutting down the government by refusing to sign a budget bill defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nEstablishment Republicans especially fear a shutdown in the middle of the 2016 presidential election campaign, but conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, point out that after the shutdown following the attempt to defund Obamacare in 2013, the GOP went on to a landslide victory in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nBut if Boehner does not propose to defund Planned Parenthood in the budget need by Sept. 30 to keep the government running, that could spark an all-out conservative revolt. Although full-fledged conservatives are a minority among House Republicans, if Democrats were to join their coup, it wouldn\u2019t take many additional votes to depose the speaker.\n\nIn fact, that prospect is considered so plausible, it is cited by some conservatives as the reason Boehner has not brought Meadows\u2019 motion to oust him to the floor for a quick vote, in order to quash the revolt.\n\nPombo expressed sympathy for Boehner on that score, telling WND, \u201cIf what you are doing relies on Democratic votes, something\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nBoehner may have already revealed his budget strategy, telling a group of dismayed conservative pastors in Ohio last week there would be no shutdown.\n\nHe told them he agreed with their goal of stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funding but disagreed with the tactic of defunding it in a budget, because it would provoke a shutdown.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a done deal.\n\nBoehner has been persuaded before to side with conservatives on crucial issues.\n\nUnder his stewardship, the House passed a bill defunding Obamacare in September 2013. When the then-Democrat controlled Senate failed to pass the budget, the 16-day government shutdown ensued. That ended only when GOP leaders gave in to pressure to pass a budget not defunding Obamacare.\n\nConservatives also persuaded Boehner to drop his own bill and pass a strong anti-amnesty border security measure after voters \u201cmelted\u201d the phone lines on Capitol Hill in July 2014. That bill also died in the then-Democrat controlled Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, it appears Democrats and the White House are virtually salivating over the prospect over another shutdown.\n\nA fundraising letter emailed from BarackObama.com warns supporters of an impending shutdown because of Congress\u2019 \u201cextreme political priorities \u2013 like defunding Planned Parenthood and restricting women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nThe letter continues, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: These votes aren\u2019t going to accomplish anything, other than showcase their backwards views on women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nThe email ends with a pitch for donations to the left-wing group \u201cOrganizing for Action,\u201d which originated as an Obama campaign organization.\n\nAnd, on Wednesday, the Obama administration began warning of an impending crisis, with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest telling reporters preparations for a possible federal government shutdown had begun.\n\nShifting all responsibility away from the president if he refuses to sign a budget that includes the defunding of Planned Parenthood, Earnest said, \u201cThe final decision rests with Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\u201d\n\nFollow Garth Kant @DCgarth", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The allegation of a conservative turning on his own and becoming an enforcer for Republican leadership came to light as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, arrived at a dilemma.
