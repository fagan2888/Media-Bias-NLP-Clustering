Burgundy\u2019s Joey Hishon scored his team\u2019s goal and centered what may have been the game\u2019s best line, with wingers Borna Rendulic and Dennis Everberg.\n\nRantanen, the No. 10 draft pick in June, continues to prove he\u2019s NHL-ready, and Skille, who is on a professional tryout contract, once again showed he is deserving of a deal as a third- or fourth-line forward.\n\nRantanen has played in the Finnish pro league since he was 16 and Skille, a 2005 first-round NHL draft pick, played for the Columbus Blue Jackets the last two seasons.\n\nAvs coach Patrick Roy had kudos for a handful of players in tight position battles, including goalies Reto Berra (shutout) and Calvin Pickard (one goal-against) and defenseman Brandon Gormley \u2014 who was paired with Tyson Barrie.\n\nFootnotes. Forward Jesse Winchester and defenseman Andrej Meszaros did not participate. Roy said Winchester, who missed all of last season with a head injury, may play in Tuesday\u2019s preseason opener against the visiting Anaheim Ducks. Meszaros, who is on a PTO, has a leg injury and is day-to-day. \u2026 Newcomer Black Comeau committed the game\u2019s only penalty, a high-stick to MacKinnon\u2019s face in the second period.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alex Tanguay, Mikko Rantanen score for White in Avs scrimmage", "title": "Alex Tanguay, Mikko Rantanen score for White in Avs scrimmage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/20/alex-tanguay-mikko-rantanen-score-for-white-in-avs-scrimmage/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920_042649_colorado-avalanche-1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920_042649_colorado-avalanche-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T16:22:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T20:19:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Veteran Alex Tanguay, 35, scored the game\u2019s first goal off a beautiful play by Nathan MacKinnon and White went on to win 3-1.\nTwo forwards desperate to make an impression \u2014 rookie Mikko Rantanen and unsigned Jack Skille \u2014 both scored in Sunday\u2019s Burgundy/White intrasquad scrimmage at Magness Arena.\nRantanen has played in the Finnish pro league since he was 16 and Skille, a 2005 first-round NHL draft pick, played for the Columbus Blue Jackets the last two seasons.\nRoy said Winchester, who missed all of last season with a head injury, may play in Tuesday\u2019s preseason opener against the visiting Anaheim Ducks.\n\u2026 Newcomer Black Comeau committed the game\u2019s only penalty, a high-stick to MacKinnon\u2019s face in the second period."}
