CLEVELAND — The Browns say linebacker Armonty Bryant and safety De’Ante Saunders were arrested Christmas morning after a traffic stop.

The team says Bryant will not travel with the team for Sunday’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs so he can tend to the legal matter.

The State Highway Patrol says Saunders was cited for driving under the influence.

The patrol says Bryant was arrested for having the medication Adderall without a prescription.

Patrol spokesman Lt. Craig Cvetan (suh-VEHT’-ehn) also says a gun was confiscated from Saunders’ car.

Browns general manager Ray Farmer said in a statement Saturday that the team takes the charges against the players “seriously” and calls the situation “extremely disappointing.”
