However, becoming familiar with the requirements being placed on hospitals and the steps they must take before and after the collection process is crucial when collecting hospital accounts.\n\n\n\nIn the What You Need to Know About IRS 501(r) session at ACA\u2019s Spring Forum Conference, Fred Lucky, president of C2A, Compliance Consulting and Auditing, provided a detailed look at \u201cextraordinary collection activity\u201d as described under 501(r)(6).\n\n\n\nThe proposed rules specify that charitable hospitals cannot engage in \u201cextraordinary collection activities\u201d before making reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient is eligible for financial assistance. Extraordinary collection activities include any action related to obtaining payment of a bill that involves:\n\nLegal process.\n\nSelling debt.\n\nReporting adverse information on credit bureaus.\n\nCommencing a civil action.\n\nGarnishments.\n\nLiens, attaching or seizing a bank account or other personal property.\n\nCausing an individual\u2019s arrest (warrant).\n\nLucky offered several reminders for collection agencies regarding extraordinary collection activities under 501(r):\n\nThe rule requires hospitals to have a written agreement with third parties (collection agencies) to abide by the 501(r) requirements.\n\nHospitals can place accounts with an agency within 120-day notification period if they meet the requirements.\n\nAccounts cannot be sold until after the notification period.\n\nBefore the collection agency can initiate extraordinary collection activity, reasonable effort criteria must be met, eligibility must be determined and the patient must be notified. Reasonable effort criteria include: being notified of financial assistance policy upon admission or discharge; three statements; and final notice 30 days before extraordinary collection activity.\n\nMust accept financial assistance policy applications for 240 days after the date of the first billing statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know when they sent the bill because of the 120- and 240-day limits,\u201d Lucky said. \u201cTiming is important.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "2014-03-21 10:01 AM", "dcterms.modified": "2014-03-21 10:01 AM", "description": "While the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate is receiving substantial attention, proposed 501(r) requirements are also impacting charitable care h MORE", "dc.description": "While the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate is receiving substantial attention, proposed 501(r) requirements are also impacting charitable care h MORE", "DC.rights": "/about-terms-of-use-12856.aspx", "dc.date": "2014-03-21 10:01 AM", "last-modified": "2014-03-21 10:01 AM", "dc.source": "http://www.acainternational.org/", "DC.coverage": "World", "publication_date": "2014-03-21 10:01 AM", "dc.subject": "While the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate is receiving substantial attention, proposed 501(r) requirements are also impacting charitable care h MORE", "dc.language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "What Does 501(r) Mean for Providers and Agencies? - ACA International"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeaf2\"", "article_summary": "Lucky offered several reminders for collection agencies regarding extraordinary collection activities under 501(r):The rule requires hospitals to have a written agreement with third parties (collection agencies) to abide by the 501(r) requirements.\nWhile the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate is receiving substantial attention, proposed 501(r) requirements are also impacting charitable care hospitals and their collection agency vendors.\nExtraordinary collection activities include any action related to obtaining payment of a bill that involves:Legal process.\nMust accept financial assistance policy applications for 240 days after the date of the first billing statement.\nBefore the collection agency can initiate extraordinary collection activity, reasonable effort criteria must be met, eligibility must be determined and the patient must be notified."}
