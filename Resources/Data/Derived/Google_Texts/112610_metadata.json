The short-staffing situation has in turn been caused by the decision by Cubs management to keep the seasonal workers who maintain the field working fewer than 130 hours each month.\n\nAnyone who works over 130 hours each month is defined as a full-time employee under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and is thus eligible for certain benefits.\n\nUnidentified sources told the Sun-Times that the Cubs grounds crew supervisors sent 10 employees home on Thursday despite a weather forecast calling for thunderstorms \u201cto linger\u201d through Thursday and Friday. Consequently, the grounds crew was \u201cundermanned.\u201d\n\nOfficials with other Major League teams criticized the decision. \u201cCheap,\u201d one told the Second City newspaper. \u201cEmbarrassing,\u201d opined another, \u201cand they got caught.\u201d\n\nJulian Green, a spokesman for the Cubs, described the staffing decisions as \u201corganizational changes\u201d made by management.\n\n\u201cEvery organization, whether it\u2019s baseball or corporate, is always continuing to evaluate inefficiencies, and obviously that translates to ours,\u201d Green told the Sun-Times.\n\n\u201cHowever, our efforts to manage costs had nothing to do with the episode on Tuesday night,\u201d he added.\n\nGrounds crew workers refused to speak to local media, fearing for their 130-hour-per-month jobs.\n\nAfter the protested game resumed at 4:05 p.m. on Thursday, the hard-luck Cubbies managed to eke out a 2-1 victory. The lovable losers then proceeded to lose Thursday\u2019s regularly scheduled game with the Giants by a score of 5-3.\n\nFor the season, the Cubs have assumed their customary position in last place in the National League Central Division. The team has a record of 56-72 and is 15.5 games out of first place.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter and on Facebook, and send story tips to [email protected].", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Owens", "description": "Tarp flop caused because Cubs want to avoid paying higher healthcare costs", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "As if the long-suffering fans of the Chicago Cubs haven't endured enough heartache these last 106 years, they are now seeing their games cut short because of Obamcare.
