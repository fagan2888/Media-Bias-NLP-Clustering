Twenty-eight percent of Millennials have sent a text to a supervisor after work that wasn\u2019t work-related.\n\nThough Millennials set the bar pretty high, they aren\u2019t the only ones who value work friendships. Out of the 11,500 employed professionals who were surveyed, 46% said that their work friends improve their happiness.\n\nWork friendships were especially important to respondents between ages 18-24. Fifty-seven percent of respondents in that age bracket said that their work friends make them happy, 50% said friends make them feel more motivated and 39% said their friends helped keep them feeling productive.\n\nGenerations were split when it came to whether or not work friendships are a good career move. One-third of Millennial respondents think that it can help their careers to be social at work, but only 5% of baby boomers thought so.\n\nThough work friendships tended to skew younger in the study, 51% of respondents said that they are still in touch with colleagues who they don\u2019t work with anymore.\n\nSome respondents (18%) said that having work friendships increased their competitiveness in the workplace.\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s blog pointed out some good takeaways from the study. For example, since the study shows that Millennials value workplace connections, offices can use this knowledge to increase engagement.\n\nThey suggest trying new ways to initiate conversations with Millennial employees, like taking walking meetings or simply asking about their interests.\n\nPublic acknowledgement was another suggestion. Taking the time to let employees know they did a good job is a great morale booster, the blog post said.\n\nGet Free Updates!
