We can call this the anatomy of a failure.\n\nThere is an old adage that there are two sides to a story, and it is understood that, usually, there is some truth to both of them. Where our 114th Congress is concerned, the truth is all on one side.\n\nYesterday, Nancy Pelosi tweeted about John Boehner\u2019s goals for the day:\n\nToday the @HouseGOP will vote for 56th time to repeal/undermine the Affordable Care Act. RT if you agree: It's time for #PeopleOverPolitics! \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 3, 2015\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t what Speaker of the House John Boehner was pushing publicly. He is still pretending he is all about creating jobs for the middle class! And combating the president\u2019s \u201coverreach on immigration.\u201d Overreach. As in issuing a perfect legal executive order. In other words, doing his job.\n\nYou know, because Congress \u2013 particularly the House \u2013 can\u2019t or won\u2019t do theirs.\n\nBoehner\u2019s weekly press conference told the lie:\n\nBoehner said, \u201cThis week, the House will take up three more jobs bills to help our economy. At the same time, the president provided the American people a good laugh yesterday \u2013 he sent up his budget. More taxes, more spending, bigger government here in Washington \u2013 the same old policies that have failed for the last six years. It\u2019s not what the American people want.\u201d\n\nHow about that vote to repeal Obamacare? You mean you are not going to tell the American people that you are on futile attempt?\n\nAnd what, precisely, are those \u201csame old (failed) policies\u201d? The economy has recovered, the deficit has been cut by two-thirds, and unemployment is dropping. Obama\u2019s popularity is surging. Where are the failures of which Boehner speaks?\n\nThe Republicans did manage to pass a bill (H.R. 596) that would take healthcare away from 19 million Americans when they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act 239-186. It is hard to see that as an accomplishment, however, unless you are a fascist.\n\nThe GOP did not create any jobs yesterday. Nary a one. Nor did they accomplish any other positive action that would benefit either the middle class specifically or America in general. Their action and inaction is instead a relentless march backward to some actual failed policies, those of Obama\u2019s predecessor in the White House, the guy who tanked the economy in 2008. A Republican.\n\nWhat would put Americans back to work \u2013 infrastructure funding for example \u2013 is, to Boehner, something to laugh at. He\u2019d prefer the 35 jobs created by the Keystone XL pipeline because that sort of legislation puts money in his pocket to pay for his fancy retirement home in Florida. Maybe he plans a big dyke around it to keep out the rising sea levels.\n\nThough no longer viewable online, these were Boehner\u2019s February 2 remarks on Obama\u2019s budget:\n\nToday President Obama laid out a plan for more taxes, more spending, and more of the Washington gridlock that has failed middle-class families. It may be Groundhog Day, but the American people can\u2019t afford a repeat of the same old top-down policies of the past.\n\nLike the president\u2019s previous budgets, this plan never balances \u2013 ever. It contains no solutions to address the drivers of our debt, and no plan to fix our entire tax code to help foster growth and create jobs. Worse yet, President Obama would impose new taxes and more spending without a responsible plan to honestly address the big challenges facing our country.\n\nWhile the president budget\u2019s is about the past, our budget will be about the future. We will address our government\u2019s spending problem and protect our national security. Our budget will balance, and it will help promote job creation and higher wages, not more government bureaucracy.\n\nA lot of hot air here, but little of substance. It is amusing that Obama\u2019s bottom-up strategy for economic recovery is called \u201ctop-down\u201d when the GOP\u2019s \u201ctrickle down\u201d policies somehow are not. We can laugh about that while we are scrounging in garbage cans for food.\n\nBoehner concluded yesterday before going into battle:\n\n\u201cTonight, the Senate\u2019s going to vote on our plan to fund the Department of Homeland Security and block the president\u2019s unilateral actions on immigration. There\u2019s a whole host of Democrats who issued press releases criticizing the president\u2019s executive overreach \u2013 McCaskill, Donnelly, others. Was it all talk?\n\nOf course, Boehner failed to undo Obama\u2019s alleged overreach, with the Democrats blocking the measure on a 51-48 vote. Yet another in a long line of failures for Boehner. Immigrants are people too, and thanks to the Democrats, they will remain people.\n\n\u201cWe won this fight in the House, now the fight must be won in the United States Senate. It\u2019s time for Senator Cruz, Senator Sessions, Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats to stand with the American people and to block the president\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nSay what? It\u2019s not clear what, precisely, Boehner thinks he has won in the House, because nothing jumps to mind. The story, rather, is one of unremitting failure thanks to Tea Party extremism. Don\u2019t judge the health of Tea Party ideology by Sarah Palin\u2019s popularity, folks.\n\nAnd don\u2019t you love it when a guy who can\u2019t control his own caucus tells his Senate colleagues to do their jobs? Of course, Bernie Sanders has already destroyed the Republican job creator myth, and Republican governors are busily waging war on the middle class by robbing pensions and slashing wages.\n\nYou want failed policies? Detroit is an economic wasteland thanks to Republican economic policies and Kansas is following suit. And they want to do this to the rest of us.\n\nSpeaking of jobs\u2026where are those jobs Boehner is always promising to create? I mean, besides the 35 jobs the Keystone XL pipeline would give us?\n\nThe GOP, led by John Boehner, is attempting to fool the American people into thinking they care. But they don\u2019t. Talking about creating jobs does not create jobs. And Americans are tired of empty words from our Congress.\n\nThe fact that Obama\u2019s approval rating is at a 20-month high ought to tell Republicans that maybe, just maybe, Obama is leading America in the direction it wants to go. It ought to be be a warning to Boehner and his fellow House Republicans that not only are they butting their heads against a wall, but they\u2019re probably fooling far fewer people than they think.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boehner twisted history to claim that \"the American people can\u2019t afford a repeat of the same old top-down policies of the past\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Boehner twisted history to claim that \"the American people can't afford a repeat of the same old top-down policies of the past\"", "title": "Boehner's Latest Attempt to Hoodwink America Fails Like the Rest", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/04/boehners-latest-attempt-hoodwink-america-fails-rest.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/boehner-overreach.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-04T15:25:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,114th United States Congress,america,Bernie Sanders,Congress,John Boehner,Keystone XL Pipeline,Nancy Pelosi,Presidency of Barack Obama,Tea Party,United States House of Representatives,United States Senate,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-02-04T07:59:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T15:25:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "114th United States Congress, america, Bernie Sanders, Congress, John Boehner, Keystone XL Pipeline, Nancy Pelosi, Presidency of Barack Obama, Republican Party, Tea Party, United States House of Representatives, United States Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7bb\"", "article_summary": "Speaking of jobs\u2026where are those jobs Boehner is always promising to create?\nAnd what, precisely, are those \u201csame old (failed) policies\u201d?\nLet\u2019s take a look at the latest Republican attempt to mislead the American people through obfuscation and sleight of hand.\nYou want failed policies?\nOf course, Boehner failed to undo Obama\u2019s alleged overreach, with the Democrats blocking the measure on a 51-48 vote."}
