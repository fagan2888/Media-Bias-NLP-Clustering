During one entry, he shut and blocked the door. That victim defended herself with a large umbrella and escaped.\n\n\n\nWhile that victim reported it to library staff, Harris repeated his efforts with another adult female victim in the same bathroom, according to police. The third woman corroborated the other two stories.\n\n\n\nHarris told officers that he had been Facebooking a willing female who agreed to meet him and perform oral sex on him in the bathroom. Harris simply mistook the victims, who looked nothing alike, as his date.\n\n\n\nHarris was charged with false imprisonment, a third-degree felony, and booked into the Alachua County jail.\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com.
