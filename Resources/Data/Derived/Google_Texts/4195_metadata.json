Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nCarson, the brilliant neurosurgeon-turned-terrible-presidential candidate, has never offered a policy plan specifically for African Americans during the presidential campaign. And although we didn\u2019t expect much from Carson since he\u2019s a staunch Republican, some Black folks were hoping that because Carson is from Detroit, that he would draw on his Black experience while talking to voters on the campaign trail.\n\nWell, it never happened.\n\nAnd it got worse.\n\nLast year, Carson criticized President Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first Black commander-in-chief, in a bizarre condemnation of Obama\u2019s policies \u2013 and his mindset.\n\nFirst, Carson called Obama a \u201cpsychopath.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike most psychopaths. That\u2019s why they\u2019re successful. That\u2019s the way they look. They all look great,\u201d Carson said.\n\nBizarre.\n\nThen he likened Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act to slavery.\n\n\u201cObamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d Carson said. \u201cIt is slavery, in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Carson has appeared on several Black radio programs to denounce the media for criticizing Black conservatives.\n\n\u201cMany people in the media have predetermined that if you\u2019re Black and you\u2019re conservative that you\u2019re bad,\u201d Carson said, adding, \u201cIf I were a White conservative, they wouldn\u2019t be concerned.\u201d\n\nCarson, who has not publicly supported many policies that benefit African Americans, plays the race card when it\u2019s convenient for him. He recently blamed the media for what he considers a sacking of Black conservatives.\n\nA highly successful neurosurgeon, Carson has disappointed some African Americans who thought, just maybe, that he would advocate for Black folks. He\u2019s also a man of contradictions: He was raised by a single mother in public housing; his family used food stamps; he benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school and was supported by welfare.\n\nBut, \u201cThe disintegration of the family unit and the welfare state are enslaving African-Americans and ruining their futures,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson is a confused mess of a candidate. He didn\u2019t win the Iowa caucuses, he won\u2019t win the New Hampshire primary, and he won\u2019t be crowned as the Republican nominee for president. We know it. He knows it. And there\u2019s nowhere for Carson to go but down. That\u2019s why Carson should quit the race now and spare us his warped views on, well, just about everything.\n\nhttp://www.afro.com/ben-carson-should-drop-out-of-the-2016-presidential-race/\n\nReprinted from the Afro American", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "AFRO Editorial", "description": "Ben Carson came in a distant fourth place in the Monday, Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses with 10 percent, behind Republican Sen.
