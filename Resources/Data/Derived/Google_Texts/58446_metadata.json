Correspondingly, we\u2019re seeing an uptick in the use of long-term incentives as healthcare organizations work to align incentive plan opportunities with longer-term desired outcomes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hay Group\u2019s study, the larger the system, the greater the likelihood it is using LTI plans. Sixty-three percent of systems with revenue over $5 billion had LTI plans in place in 2013, compared to 38 percent of systems with revenue between $3 billion and $5 billion. Seven percent of independent hospital respondents reported having a long-term incentive plan in place in 2013.\n\nCEO compensation continues upward trend; nursing salary increases trend downward\n\nHay Group\u2019s study also found that employees holding the same position year-over-year at large integrated health systems (IHS) received median base salary increases of 2.8 percent in 2013, slightly lower than the 2.9 percent increase they saw in 2012. Median base salary increases for independent hospital employees trended upward to 2.7 percent in 2013, compared to 2.4 percent in 2012. Hospital nurses saw the smallest pay increases of all employee groups in Hay Group\u2019s study, a 1.8 percent pay increase in base salary and a 2.0 percent increase in total cash in 2013. That\u2019s compared with 2.5 percent increases in both base salary and total cash in 2012 and 2.0 percent in 2011.\n\nThe largest base salary increases continue to be reported at the chief executive officer and \u201csenior executive\u201d level. Median base salary increases were 4.0 percent for CEOs and 3.0 percent for senior executives at not-for-profit IHS organizations in 2013; CEOs and senior executives at non-system hospitals saw base salary increases of 3.0 percent, steady with last year for CEOs but a drop for senior executives who saw 6.0 percent increases in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing temperance in the area of executive pay, amidst continued scrutiny from stakeholders, government and the public alike,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cEven so, it\u2019s more critical now than ever that hospitals and health systems properly incentivize and retain their executive talent. The environment has never been more complex: systems are becoming insurers, insurers are partnering with health systems, and CEOs are being charged with pushing the organization toward pay-for-performance and population health management. To succeed, healthcare organizations must have the right leadership guiding the ship.\u201d\n\nAbout Hay Group\u2019s 2013 Hay Group Healthcare Compensation Study\n\nThe 2013 Hay Group Healthcare Compensation Study is in its 30th year and results in two separate reports: the Integrated Healthcare Systems report and the Hospital report. Originally chartered by eight core companies, the report now provides data from 99 integrated healthcare systems as well as an additional 40 integrated healthcare subsystems, representing over 622,288 incumbents. There are 1,162 participating hospitals in this report, covering more than 600,000 incumbents; 994 of these hospitals are acute care facilities. The range of jobs covered in this study makes it the only top-to-bottom healthcare compensation database in the market.\n\nIn recognition of the difference in scope of responsibilities of similarly titled positions between organizations, jobs matched to the corporate and regional positions by participants are content evaluated using Hay Group\u2019s proprietary job evaluation methodology. Making pay comparisons on the basis of job title alone can produce comparisons that do not reflect job content or complexity. Hay Group\u2019s job evaluation methodology eliminates the potential of an inaccurate outcome by examining compensation relative to job content and complexity rather than merely by job title or company size. The data in these reports has an effective date of January 1, 2013.\n\nAdditional information about Hay Group\u2019s reward information services can be found at www.HayGroup.com.
