Pit bull bans have cruel consequences and should be rejected in favor of stronger breed-neutral penalties for irresponsible dog ownership. The council should also promote public education efforts as a more effective and humane answer to public safety concerns.\n\nNo breed is more misunderstood than the pit bull. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, \u201cpit bull\u201d refers primarily to two dog breeds: the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier. Pit bulls are athletic, hardworking dogs used for a variety of purposes, from search and rescue operations to cattle herding, drug and explosive detection to service work for those managing a disability.\n\nA pit bull can also be an excellent companion. Famous owners of the breed include Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, General George Patton, Helen Keller, Fred Astaire and Humphrey Bogart.\n\nUnfortunately, breed bans deter thoughtful, law-abiding people from owning pit bulls while increasing the breed\u2019s prestige among lawless individuals.\n\nPit bull ownership is only for responsible individuals. Pit bulls are not poodles. They were developed in the 19th century for fighting. While not more aggressive than other breeds, once provoked they are less likely to give a warning and less likely to stop fighting before inflicting harm. Pit bulls were not, however, bred to be aggressive to people. Just the opposite, in fact: Breeders favored dogs that could be easily handled even when agitated or wounded.\n\nBreed origins contribute significantly to dog behavior. According to Denver dog trainer and behaviorist Lisa Lucero, 30 percent of a dog\u2019s temperament is the result of genetic coding while 70 percent comes from environmental factors such as treatment, training and socialization. The 30 percent can be managed but not eliminated.\n\n\u201cWhat this means for pit bull owners,\u201d says Lucero, \u201cis they need to be extra judicious in the kind of situations and environments they place their dogs. The best temperamented pit bull in the world is still a pit bull.\u201d\n\nOwners of pit bulls are not the only ones who should be mindful of their dogs\u2019 pedigree. Powerful guarding breeds such as shepherds, Rottweilers, Shar Peis, Chow Chows, Great Danes, and mastiffs require diligent owners who have their dogs under control at all times. Potential and current dog owners should learn about dog breeds and understand their capabilities and limitations. Not every family situation is the right fit for every dog breed. Dogs should be spayed or neutered. The vast majority of serious and fatal dog attacks involve non-neutered males. Finally, obedience training is important for all dogs.\n\nIf Colorado wants to honor its official pet, it\u2019s time to reconsider breed-specific bans. Not only should the Breckenridge Town Council reject its proposed pit bull ban, other municipalities should repeal their bans as well. Educating owners \u2014 not euthanizing dogs \u2014 is the answer to public safety concerns.\n\nKrista Kafer is director of Colorado\u2019s Future Project, co-host of \u201cBackbone Radio,\u201d airing Sundays from 5 to 8 p.m. on 710 KNUS.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kafer: End bans on specific dog breeds", "title": "Kafer: End bans on specific dog breeds", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/08/kafer-end-bans-on-specific-dog-breeds/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131108__pit-bull-dog-breed-bansp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131108__pit-bull-dog-breed-bansp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-08T10:40:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:48:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Potential and current dog owners should learn about dog breeds and understand their capabilities and limitations.\nPit bull bans have cruel consequences and should be rejected in favor of stronger breed-neutral penalties for irresponsible dog ownership.\nAccording to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, \u201cpit bull\u201d refers primarily to two dog breeds: the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier.\nUnfortunately, breed bans deter thoughtful, law-abiding people from owning pit bulls while increasing the breed\u2019s prestige among lawless individuals.\nNot only should the Breckenridge Town Council reject its proposed pit bull ban, other municipalities should repeal their bans as well."}
