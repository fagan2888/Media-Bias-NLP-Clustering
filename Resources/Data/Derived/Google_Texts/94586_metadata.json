Nearly 15% of eligible citizens voted in those states\u2019 primaries for U.S. Senate and governor this year\u2014down from 18% in 2010, according to the center\u2019s report.\n\nOf those states, 15 saw turnout reach record lows this year, compared with just three states that had higher turnout this year than in 2010, the report states. The GOP base has a disproportionate number of older voters, a group that is more likely to cast ballots.\n\nDemocratic turnout, by contrast, dropped to record lows in 15 of the 25 states with statewide primaries. The GOP reached record lows in three states, but also saw record highs in four states. Among the four was Mississippi, which held one of the most contentious Republican primaries this election cycle, pitting incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran against tea-party challenger Chris McDaniel, who lost the runoff election.\n\nAmong the states that saw the lowest turnout this year were Iowa, where 9.7% of eligible voters went to the polls, as well as Ohio (11.2%), Texas (11.4%) and South Carolina (12.1%).\n\nThe report drew some worrying conclusions, most notably the potential for \u201cnarrow ideology\u201d to dominate political parties in the absence of any unity. \u201cPolitical parties in theory provide a degree of cohesion to American politics,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThat cohesion is being lost. High levels of involvement lessen the chances that both parties and politics will be dominated by narrow ideology and interest. Low levels make that result probable.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say turnout is their top priority this cycle, and a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it has launched \u201cthe most aggressive national field effort ever.\u201d Given the relative lack of close Democratic primaries, turnout might not be a reliable gauge of participation this fall when many incumbent Democrats will face tough re-election bids.\n\nThe report also offered some recommendations, highlighting the whopping 61 million Americans who are eligible to vote but are not registered. Creating a biometric national identification system would allow those 61 million to vote and get rid of the potential for fraud, the report argues.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "GOP May Have Advantage As Voter Participation Sinks", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/22/gop-may-have-advantage-as-voter-participation-sinks/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NA-CB716_STANDA_P_20140624211743.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "GOP May Have Advantage As Voter Participation Sinks", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Rebecca Ballhaus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-22T20:04:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/22/gop-may-have-advantage-as-voter-participation-sinks/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-47692", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/22/gop-may-have-advantage-as-voter-participation-sinks/", "type": "article", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NA-CB716_STANDA_P_20140624211743.jpg", "height": 499}, "site_name": "WSJ", "title": "GOP May Have Advantage As Voter Participation Sinks"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-47692", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-22T20:11:21-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e88\"", "article_summary": "The GOP reached record lows in three states, but also saw record highs in four states.\nOf those states, 15 saw turnout reach record lows this year, compared with just three states that had higher turnout this year than in 2010, the report states.\n(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) APWith voter turnout in midterm elections on track to be at a record low, a new report finds that Republicans may have an advantage come November.\nThe GOP base has a disproportionate number of older voters, a group that is more likely to cast ballots.\nNearly 15% of eligible citizens voted in those states\u2019 primaries for U.S. Senate and governor this year\u2014down from 18% in 2010, according to the center\u2019s report."}
