Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, faced Republican Andy Whallon in the June primary, he won by 14 percentage points.\n\nThe only other contestant in the election earned three votes, and since the top two-finishers advance, Whallon is contesting Lowenthal\u2019s re-election in November.\n\nAn aeronautical engineer by education, Whallon says he\u2019s the alternative to Lowenthal\u2019s voting record, which he sees as in line with the policies of President Barack Obama.\n\nHis top priority is job creation. Whallon labels the current economic recovery as weak, noting the economy has been growing an average of 2.2 percent per year compared to a 4.8 percent clip in the 1980s. According to government data, gross domestic product grew by 4.6 percent in the second quarter after shrinking 2.1 percent in the prior quarter.\n\nANDY WHALLON Age: 53 Party: Republican Occupation: Self-employed landlord, former aeronautical engineer Education: Bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Michigan Personal: Single, no children Issues: Job creation, personal freedom and privacy, health care reform, including repealing Obamacare Website: www.andy whallon.com\n\n\u201cWe need to do what has always worked in the past: Low taxes, light regulations, and little spending,\u201d said Whallon, a West Long Beach resident. \u201cIt worked in the \u201980s, and it will work again.\u201d\n\nIt will be difficult for Whallon to unseat Lowenthal in the strongly Democratic 47th Congressional District, which includes parts of Long Beach, Lakewood, Signal Hill, Avalon, Buena Park, Cypress, Garden Grove, Los Alamitos, Midway City, Stanton, Rossmoor and Westminster.\n\nYet if there\u2019s hope to be found, it may be that Whallon\u2019s loss to Lowenthal in the spring nearly matched the result of the better-financed campaign by former Long Beach Councilman Gary DeLong, also a Republican, who spent more than $1.4 million running against Lowenthal in 2012. Whallon, a first-time candidate, has disbursed $52,363 as of Sept. 30, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nHe\u2019s counting on his message of more personal freedom making an impact with voters.\n\nOn his campaign website, Whallon lays out a vision of curbing government intrusions into privacy, \u201cunwinding\u201d the war against drugs, addressing human trafficking and improving health care, beginning with repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an entitlement program that is already costing far more than what was projected at a time when our government can\u2019t even balance our books with the programs we have,\u201d Whallon said.\n\nIn its place, Whallon suggests allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines and giving everyone a tax credit for half the cost of a catastrophic health plan.\n\nLowenthal is a veteran of the state Assembly and Senate first elected to office in 1992 as a member of the Long Beach City Council.\n\nIn the state Legislature, Lowenthal authored the law creating California\u2019s bipartisan citizen redistricting commission, and his first act in the U.S. House was to introduce HR 2978, the Let the People Draw the Lines Act of 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill has sat in committee since, and Lowenthal acknowledges neither party likes the idea, but he told the Press-Telegram editorial board last week he will continue to push the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to get rid of hyperpartisanship until we get rid of gerrymandering,\u201d Lowenthal said.\n\nHe also introduced a bill last month to provide as much as $8 billion annually for roads and railways used to move freight across the United States by putting a 1 percent tax on bills for cargo transported more than 50 miles.\n\nThe funds would provide a needed infusion to neglected infrastructure projects and allow cargo to move more freely, the congressman said.\n\nAs a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Lowenthal said he has gained a new respect for the role the country plays in helping oppressed people around the world.\n\nHe is supportive of airstrikes against ISIS in the Middle East, but says the United States should play a leadership role and not commit ground troops to combat.\n\nWith a presidential election approaching in two years, Lowenthal expects Republicans to come to the table to address some sort of immigration reform.\n\nA supporter of the immigration bill the U.S. Senate passed last year, Lowenthal said it\u2019s in the GOP\u2019s best interest to agree to such legislation, which gives a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.\n\n\u201cIf not, they\u2019re going to win regional elections, but they\u2019re not going to win national elections, they\u2019re not going to win the presidency,\u201d said Lowenthal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LONG BEACH >> The last time U.S. Rep.
