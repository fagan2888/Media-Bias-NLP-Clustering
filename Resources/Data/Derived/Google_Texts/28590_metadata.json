A study conducted at Georgia State University has revealed that couples who share housework do not endanger their sex life contrary to a 2013 study that suggested conventional couples where the women handles the brunt of household chores were more sexually active than their equal counterparts.\n\n\u201cAttitudes are a big difference,\u201d Daniel Carlson, lead researcher and assistant professor of sociology at Georgie State, said in a statement. \u201cCouples today have role models to look at to make this work. In the \u201880s, egalitarian couples were at the forefront of change. Today\u2019s couples have those examples to look to. It makes it a lot easier, resulting in higher quality relationships. I think we\u2019ve moved to a place where a very stark division of labor is not something people want nor is it something couples want.\u201d\n\nCarlson and his colleagues from Georgia State gathered their data using the 2006 Marital and Relationship Survey (MARS), which included responses of low- to middle-income couples with a child. Couples who reported sharing the division of labor in their household did not experience negative consequences in terms of sexual frequency or satisfaction. In fact, couples that practiced equality within their relationship had similar if not better sex lives compared to couples who were more conventional.\n\n\u201cBoth arrangements are sexy for people,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cYou can find high quality relationships in both types of relationships. Neither are detrimental.\u201d\n\nA similar report based on research from the University of Illinois found that couples who share household chores are more likely to report being happy about their overall relationship. In addition to actually performing tasks around the house, communicating how the divide in housework would break down within the first two years of marriage was essential to avoiding patterns where one spouse performs the majority of chores. This result often lead to an increase in conflict and a decrease in happiness.\n\n\u201cIt is clear what the vast majority of people want,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that right now our social institutions are lagging behind our cultural values. Eventually, as people continue to argue and fight for policies that promote gender equality at home and at work, people will be able to achieve their desires.\u201d\n\nSource: Miller A, Hanson S, Sassler S, Carlson D.
