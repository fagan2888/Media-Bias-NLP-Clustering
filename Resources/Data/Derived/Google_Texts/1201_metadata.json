(AP) \u2014 After initial missteps caused a choppy start, California health care officials are betting that an upgraded website, more help and better Spanish-language outreach will result in a smoother and bigger second open enrollment season under the Affordable Care Act this year.\n\nStarting Saturday, Californians who don\u2019t have access to health plans through their employer can obtain coverage for 2015 through the state\u2019s insurance marketplace known as Covered California. The exchange allows individuals to shop for plans and qualify for subsidies to reduce their premiums. It also directs low-income people to Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s free or low-cost Medicaid program.\n\nThis season, state officials are trying to sign up more people in a shorter amount of time. Open enrollment runs three months through Feb. 15, compared to six months the first time.\n\nThe state has set a target of enrolling 1.7 million people for private health coverage next year, which would include re-enrolling the 1.1 million people who signed up the first season.\n\n\u201cIf you or someone you know doesn\u2019t have health care coverage right now, this is the opportunity to get the security and peace of mind that comes with health insurance,\u201d Executive Director Peter Lee wrote as part of a promotion for a nine-day bus tour advertising open enrollment.\n\nCalifornia, which was one of the more successful states in operating its own exchange, hopes to learn from last year\u2019s mistakes. Overwhelmed by public interest, the exchange was ill-prepared to handle the high volume of calls and applications, which triggered long wait times at help centers and problems with its website, http://www.coveredca.com .\n\nThe exchange was also criticized early in the first sign-up season for failing to reach out to the Latino community. To increase minority enrollment, the state has refined its outreach campaign to better target Latinos and others who missed the first year.\n\nThe exchange has beefed up staff at call centers and installed a dedicated line for insurance agents. There will be about 1,400 representatives to answer the phones compared to 700 last year.\n\nThe website has been improved for Spanish-speaking users and participating plans will allow people to pay their first month\u2019s premium when they sign up.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that about 3.4 million uninsured adult Californians gained coverage in the first year of open enrollment out of an estimated 5.9 million uninsured Californians ages 19-64. They were enrolled both through private insurance and Medi-Cal.\n\nHealth officials acknowledge that the second round will likely get harder because those who remain uninsured are more difficult to reach. According to Kaiser\u2019s survey, one out of four people who remain uninsured said they have never had health coverage and another 45 percent say they have been without coverage for two years or more.\n\nKaiser found they also tend to be Spanish speakers.\n\nThe exchange is responding by boosting spending on Spanish-language media and increasing partnerships with community groups anchored in Latino and African-American neighborhoods. The campaign is using the phrase \u201cI\u2019m in\u201d in English but \u201cTengo un plan de salud\u201d in Spanish, which means \u201cI have a plan for my health.\u201d\n\nCovered California has added representatives to help callers in Spanish, Chinese and other languages. The call centers will also be open on most Sundays during the first month of open enrollment.\n\nConsumer advocates say prospective buyers should take proactive steps such as calling their doctors to make sure they are in their plan network. Consumer Watchdog, a Santa Monica-based group backed by attorneys, warned that some insurers have small provider networks and large prescription co-pays that force consumers to pay more out-of-pocket.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants have also expressed concerns about changes to Covered California\u2019s identity-verification process. The exchange had allowed enrollment counselors to attest that they had verified documents but under federal rules, the state will now use the credit rating agency Experian.\n\nDoreena Wong, project director for Advancing Justice \u2013 LA\u2019s Health Access Project, which promotes health care programs for immigrants, said Experian may have misspelled names or have other wrong information. Some people may lack a credit history and get can\u2019t get verified.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait and see how many problems come up,\u201d Wong said.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
