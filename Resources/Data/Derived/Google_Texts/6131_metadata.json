Marco Rubio presented himself as the only Republican presidential candidate who can unite the party and win in November.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to agree on everything, but we\u2019d better be together or we are going to lose,\u201d he said to a crowd at the Statehouse Convention Center.\n\n\u201cI have a 15-year record of turning conservative ideas into conservative policy,\u201d said Rubio, who served as a Florida legislator from 2000-08 and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. \u201cI didn\u2019t become a conservative two years ago, or a year ago.\u201d\n\nAssessing the contenders for the Democratic nomination, Rubio said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is \u201ca socialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow usually when you say that about a candidate in America, they get angry, they deny it. Bernie says it in his commercials,\u201d he said.\n\nA woman shouted, \u201cSend them to Cuba!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am, we\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a Communist, he\u2019s a Democratic socialist. And that doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. Democratic socialist? There\u2019s like dozens of socialist countries in the world. If you want to live in a socialist country, move to a socialist country.\u201d\n\nRubio said former Arkansas and U.S. first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is \u201cnot qualified to be president\u201d because of her use of a private email server for official communications as secretary of state and because of statements she made to the families of four Americans killed in a 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. He claimed Clinton told the families the attack was \u201cbecause of a YouTube video,\u201d a claim Clinton has denied.\n\n\u201cAnyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America,\u201d Rubio said, to cheers from the crowd.\n\nDemocrats want to solve every problem with federal programs and regulations, Rubio said, pledging that if he is elected he will cancel Obama\u2019s executive orders, repeal the Affordable Care Act and reform social welfare programs.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m president of the United States, in order to receive welfare you are either going to be working or going to school,\u201d he said.\n\nRubio also promised a \u201cReagan-style rebuild of the military\u201d if he is elected.\n\nHe spoke of his parents\u2019 immigration from Cuba in 1956 \u201cwith nothing\u201d and said he owes a debt to America that he can never repay for the opportunities he received.\n\n\u201cThis is the only place on earth where the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as the son of a president and the son of a millionaire,\u201d he said.\n\nA woman shouted that she was from Cuba, prompting Rubio to joke that he had \u201cdoubled the Cuban population of Arkansas here today.\u201d\n\nRubio said that if he is elected he will \u201cbe a president for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will never ask you to be angry at one group of Americans so that I can win an election,\u201d he said, drawing one of the loudest cheers of the night.\n\nThe rally, Rubio\u2019s first public appearance in Arkansas since entering the presidential race, came a day after he finished second behind billionaire developer Donald Trump and slightly ahead of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the South Carolina primary. Rubio stumped in Little Rock for votes nine days ahead of the state\u2019s March 1 primary.\n\nSeveral Arkansas elected officials have endorsed Rubio, including Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and U.S. Reps. Steve Womack, R-Rogers, and Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro. State Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, Rubio\u2019s Arkansas chairman, said in introductory remarks at the rally that he is backing Rubio because he can win in November and because of his \u201cpersonal relationship with Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarco believes that God determines the definition of marriage and not a court,\u201d Hester said. \u201cMarco believes that life begins at conception and every single life is worth protection.\u201d\n\nScott Jones, a doctor from Clarksville who attended the rally, said he favors Rubio over Trump because Trump lacks foreign-policy experience.\n\nAs for Cruz, Jones said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s very honest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 In a rally Sunday in downtown Little Rock, Florida Sen.
