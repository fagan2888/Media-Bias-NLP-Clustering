The heroin antidote, Narcan, has saved another life in Ocean County.

A 39-year-old woman owes her life to three Little Egg Harbor Township police officers who found her unconscious at a home on Wild Oaks Court just after 11 a.m. Sunday, according to Cpl. Christopher Arciniegas, spokesman for the police department.

Officers Thomas Thornton, Steve Martin and Walt Sanford immediately observed several bags of heroin and a needle in plain view, Arciniegas said.

The officers administered first aid and deployed Narcan, also known by its generic name naloxone.

Within five minutes, the woman regained consciousness and was transported to an area hospital by the Great Bay Regional Ambulance Service for further treatment, Arciniegas said.

The woman was not identified by police.

Narcan was used 129 times in Ocean County last year, when it was put into service under a countywide program established by Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph D. Coronato. All but eight people who received the drug were revived. In Monmouth County, which later initiated its own program, Narcan was administered 97 times, with success in all but 11 cases.

As a result of Narcan, overdose deaths — almost all involving heroin or other opiates — have fallen by nearly a third in Ocean County, from 121 in 2013 to 86 in 2014.
