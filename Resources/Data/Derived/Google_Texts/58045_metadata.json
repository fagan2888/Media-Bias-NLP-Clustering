It might be worth it to indulge, according to a new study published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism.\n\nExercisers know after a tough workout they need to eat and drink for recovery, a process formally known as glycogen resynthesis. After running, spinning, or what have you, the muscle\u2019s glycogen levels deplete. And glycogen is what restores glucose, or blood sugar, the body relies on for energy throughout the day. So reaching for food and drink shortly after a workout, when the body is primed to easily absorb glycogen-fueling nutrients such as protein and carbohydrates, is key.\n\nBut most people who think about recovery think about sports bars and drinks, like Gatorade \u2014 not McDonald\u2019s. Given prior research has recommended time, dose, and macronutrients all influence how effective the recovery period is, researchers decided to measure the difference, if any, between sport-specific foods and fast foods.\n\nResearchers recruited 11 men to take two, 90-minute exercise tests on a stationary bike followed by a four hour recovery period, where participants either ate sports foods or fast foods during recovery. In this study, sports food included Gatorade, Clif, and PowerBars, while fast foods included McDonald\u2019s hamburger, fries, coke, and hashbrowns. Runner\u2019s World cited \u201call meals were roughly 70 percent carbohydrate and 10 percent protein.\u201d\n\nAfter the tests, researchers collected muscle biopsies and blood samples in order to measure level of recovery, which is dependent upon insulin response, glucose response, cholesterol, and a person\u2019s subsequent workout. Turns out, both types of food similarly aid recovery.\n\nDr. Brent Ruby, lead researcher, told Runner\u2019s World Newswire he and his team expected these findings, though they did not anticipate nearly identical blood data and later workouts. He said these \u201cresults show that fast food, in the right amounts, can provide the same potential for muscle glycogen as sports nutrition products that probably cost more.\u201d\n\nUltimately, this study suggests short-term food options for recovery aren't limited to foods marketed as sports nutrition products.\n\nSource: Cramer MJ, et al.
