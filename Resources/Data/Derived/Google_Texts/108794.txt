"The world is changing and I think adapting is good," explains Clara Massot, coordinator for the Next Pavilion at the March√© du Films, the expansive marketplace that each year coincides with the Cannes Film Festival. The Next Pavilion gathers companies, producers, and filmmakers interested in exploring new alternative models to a changing film business.

"Digital is changing everything," says Massot. "Today you can do everything through [digital technology], from writing your film, from getting financing, from distributing by yourself. It is like you are your own gatekeeper as a filmmaker."

Reason TV's Meredith Bragg caught up with Massot to discuss the impetus for the Next Pavilion, the democratization of film, and how new technology is empowering the audience.
