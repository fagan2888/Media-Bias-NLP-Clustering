Trump: Vince Foster shouldn\u2019t be a campaign issue MORE but expired more than a decade ago.\n\nThey blame assault weapons for rising casualties in a recent wave of mass shootings from San Bernardino, Calif., to a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs, Colo.\n\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s remember that assault weapons were first designed for the battlefield by Germans during the Second World War,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who is leading congressional efforts to ban these types of guns. \"The sole purpose of their existence was to kill as many people as quickly as possible during military combat.\"\n\nThe Assault Weapons Ban of 2015 introduced Wednesday by Cicilline would target semi-automatic and other military-style guns. It would ensure that no such weapons are manufactured for consumer use, while placing new restrictions on the sale of already existing assault weapons.\n\nThe legislation is backed by about 90 Democratic co-sponsors, but has no hope of passing through Congress, given opposition from Republicans.\n\nThe gun lobby argues that the bill would affect many law-abiding hunters who use assault weapons.\n\n\"The assault weapons we\u2019re talking about today are not just any guns,\u201d Rep. Janice Hahn (D-Calif.) told reporters. \"They\u2019re not for hunting, they\u2019re not for target practice. These are weapons of war, designed to inflict the maximum amount of death and injury.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any hunters who use an assault weapon \u2014 and if they do, that\u2019s not much of a sport,\u201d added House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.).\n\n\u201cI understand people want to protect themselves in their homes,\u201d Hoyer said, \u201cbut what we have here is a reasonable restraint.\u201d\n\nUnder the legislation, gun owners who already have assault weapons would be allowed to keep them, but they could face challenges reselling them.\n\nThe bill would intensify background checks for people looking to buy any of the estimated 8 million to 9 million assault weapons that are already in circulation.\n\nThe law would also close what gun control groups refer to as the \"Charleston loophole\u201d that allows a gun dealer to sell a gun after three days if the FBI does not complete a background check in that time frame.\n\nDylann Roof, the man accused of killing nine people during a Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church earlier this year, purchased a gun under those circumstances.\n\nCicilline\u2019s bill would close this loophole for resales of assault weapons that are already on the market, but not for other gun sales.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The legislation is backed by about 90 Democratic co-sponsors.", "description": "The legislation is backed by about 90 Democratic co-sponsors.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The legislation is backed by about 90 Democratic co-sponsors.", "title": "Dems introduce bill to ban assault weapons", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/263489-assault-weapons-ban-targets-semi-automatic-guns", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/assaultrifle_040615getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/263489-assault-weapons-ban-targets-semi-automatic-guns", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-16T15:27-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bill Clinton,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-16T15:27:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/263489-assault-weapons-ban-targets-semi-automatic-guns", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The legislation is backed by about 90 Democratic co-sponsors.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dems introduce bill to ban assault weapons"}, "dcterms.title": "Dems introduce bill to ban assault weapons"}, "article_summary": "House Democrats on Wednesday formally renewed their push to renew a 1990s-era assault weapons ban, introducing legislationA growing coalition of Democrats is looking to renew the assault weapons ban that was originally signed by President Bill Clinton Bill ClintonThe Trail 2016: Interleague play Could Romanian hacker \u2018Guccifer\u2019 assist FBI\u2019s probe of Clinton?\nIt would ensure that no such weapons are manufactured for consumer use, while placing new restrictions on the sale of already existing assault weapons.\nThe Assault Weapons Ban of 2015 introduced Wednesday by Cicilline would target semi-automatic and other military-style guns.\nCicilline\u2019s bill would close this loophole for resales of assault weapons that are already on the market, but not for other gun sales.\nThe gun lobby argues that the bill would affect many law-abiding hunters who use assault weapons."}
