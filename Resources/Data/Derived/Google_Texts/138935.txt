Overlooked in the NFL’s wild first week of free agency was the Broncos’ signing of 6-foot-4, 215-pound punter Karl Schmitz.

Granted, deals with punters don’t attract the same level of attention as the Darrelle Revises or Ndamukong Suhs, but Schmitz’ signing is interesting on multiple levels.

As The Post’s Troy Renck noted Thursday, Schmitz handled both punts and kickoffs for Jacksonville University in 2008, giving the Broncos a unique kicking option. Last season, the team used Connor Barth and Brandon McManus for field goals and kickoffs.

After playing for Jacksonville University, Schmitz transferred to the University of Missouri-St. Louis, which doesn’t have a football team. He graduated with a business degree in 2011 but has since gone nearly seven years without playing a football game.

After graduating, the 28-year-old Bermuda-born kicker moved back to Jacksonville to try to get back into football and land a spot on an NFL roster. He started working with former Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Mike Hollis at ProForm Kicking, with whom he’d spend nearly all of his “free time” perfecting his form.

Over the last few years, Schmitz has attended combines hoping to win over a pro team. He also posted highlights on YouTube to get his name out there. Check these out:
