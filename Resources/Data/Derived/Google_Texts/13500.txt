GOLDEN POND, Ky. (AP) - A controversial project that called for logging and burning to improve forest health at Land Between The Lakes has been canceled.

Land Between The Lakes Area Supervisor Tiny Tilley said Tuesday that officials will probably consider smaller projects within the 5,000-acre Pisgah Bay area to address erosion, road and trail maintenance and campsite access.

“This move is all about our desire to work with members of the public on the future of our national recreation area,” Tilley said.

Lyon County Judge-Executive Wade White, who has been a part of the Coalition for the Preservation of the Land Between the Lakes, praised the decision.

“It’s a huge victory for the Coalition, it’s a huge victory for Lyon County and Trigg and all those around here,” White told WKMS in Murray (http://bit.ly/1I0HMao ). It “doesn’t mean the battle is over. … But it does show that Ms. Tilley is willing to listen to our concerns and make moves.”

White said the Coalition for the Preservation of the Land Between The Lakes is meeting Thursday to explain to the public the group’s concerns with land management practices at the national recreation area.

According to information from the Forest Service, some aspects of the Pisgah Bay plan will still be considered, such as replacing some culverts, improving about 31 miles of roads, changing a trail and creating road access to a campsite.

“We’ve canceled the project as originally proposed, but we want to re-look at some of the parts with the public,” Jan Bush, public affairs officer with the Forest Service, told The Paducah Sun (http://bit.ly/1gCkXO2 ). “We’ve decided there are a lot of good proposed actions in here that we’d like to go back out and say let’s talk about this.”

Bush said the agency will consult with the public before taking any further actions.
