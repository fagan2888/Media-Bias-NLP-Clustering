NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) â€” Kenyan wildlife authorities have started moving at least 105 tons of ivory and 1 ton of rhino horn in preparation for the torching of the items at the end of the month to discourage ivory and rhino horn trade believed to be fueling poaching of elephants and rhinos.

Kenya Wildlife Service Deputy Director Patrick Omondi said Monday the stockpile is from elephants and rhinos killed in conflict with humans, from problem-animal control, those that died naturally or were killed by poachers.

The mass destruction is timed to coincide with an April 28-30 summit on protection of elephants in Kenya.
