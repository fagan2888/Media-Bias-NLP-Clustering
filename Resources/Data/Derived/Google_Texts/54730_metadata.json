W \u2013 when he complained about a lack of financial accountability, and now claimshe claimed he\u2019s he was \u201cbeen \u201csingled out for retaliation and retribution,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said last week in a letter to Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nRelated: The $43 Million Gas Station: Why We Need to Audit the Pentagon\n\nHope told Grassley\u2019s office that his evaluation, or performance review, is being slow-rolled as a form of retaliation.\n\n\u201cBeing long overdue, (the evaluation) has placed his next assignment in jeopardy, leaving him in limbo,\u201d Grassley wrote to Carter. \u201cWould you please look into this and find out why Colonel Hope\u2019s (evaluation) has not been completed? I respectfully ask that you provide a deadline for completing that task and providing Colonel Hope with a new set of orders for his next assignment. Your assistance is necessary in this case.\u201d\n\nIn a statement accompanying the letter\u2019s release on Monday, the Iowa Republican put the Pentagon on notice if Hope\u2019s allegations turned out to be true.\n\nRelated: U.S. Wastes More Than $40 Million on a Gas Station in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cIf the Pentagon is retaliating against someone for speaking out on poor accountability and wasteful spending, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cIt\u2019s detrimental to the individual and to the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) recently issued a damning report that found the task force, which has since been disbanded, spent $43 million to build a gas station in Afghanistan when the project should have cost something in the neighborhood of $500,000.\n\nGrassley\u2019s letter is just the latest example of congressional outrage over the SIGAR study. Last week, Sen. Ron Wyden (OR), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, used the report to push for an update on the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to meet a legally-mandatedlegally mandated audit in 2017.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon's $766 Million Afghan 'Slush Fund' Comes Under Scrutiny\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee will likely hold a hearing next month specifically to examine how the Pentagon squandered $12 million on direct costs and around $20 million in overhead for the gas station.\n\nThe Iowa Republican\u2019s missive isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s weighed in on the Afghan boondoggle. He sent a letter to Carter earlier this month asking for a record of all the expenditures for the controversial task force because he wants to audit the organization\u2019s receipts.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top Republican senator wants to know if the Defense Department is punishing the Army colonel who blew the whistle on the task force responsible for building a $43 million gas station in Afghanistan.", "title": "The $43 Million Afghan Gas Station Scandal Blows the Lid Off Pentagon Waste", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/24/43-Million-Afghan-Gas-Station-Scandal-Blows-Lid-Pentagon-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11242015_Afghan_Gas_Station.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/24/43-Million-Afghan-Gas-Station-Scandal-Blows-Lid-Pentagon-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11242015_Afghan_Gas_Station.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A top Republican senator wants to know if the Defense Department is punishing the Army colonel who blew the whistle on the task force responsible for building a $43 million gas station in Afghanistan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: The $43 Million Gas Station: Why We Need to Audit the PentagonHope told Grassley\u2019s office that his evaluation, or performance review, is being slow-rolled as a form of retaliation.\nA top Republican senator wants to know if the Defense Department is punishing the Army colonel who blew the whistle on the agency task force responsible for building a $43 million gas station in Afghanistan.\nRelated: U.S. Wastes More Than $40 Million on a Gas Station in Afghanistan\u201cIf the Pentagon is retaliating against someone for speaking out on poor accountability and wasteful spending, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Grassley said.\nRelated: The Pentagon's $766 Million Afghan 'Slush Fund' Comes Under ScrutinyThe Senate Armed Services Committee will likely hold a hearing next month specifically to examine how the Pentagon squandered $12 million on direct costs and around $20 million in overhead for the gas station.\nHe sent a letter to Carter earlier this month asking for a record of all the expenditures for the controversial task force because he wants to audit the organization\u2019s receipts."}
