Hundreds of people packed into downtown’s new Water Works Park for its grand opening celebration Saturday evening.

A band serenaded the crowd from the newly-built bandshell, and the splash pad area was so crowded with kids there hardly was room to move.

“This has been two years in the making and I couldn’t be happier,” said Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who attended the city-hosted party which included food trucks, fireworks and live entertainment.

Ulele, a new endeavor from the Columbia Restaurant’s Gonzmart family, will open Aug. 26 in the old Tampa water works building at the north end of the park. It is named for Ulele Spring, which was restored during construction and again bubbles fresh water that flows into the adjacent Hillsborough River.

Water Works Park, at Doyle Carlton Drive and West Henderson Avenue, is the third riverfront park in the city’s urban heart.

“This will truly be a destination park,” Buckhorn said.
