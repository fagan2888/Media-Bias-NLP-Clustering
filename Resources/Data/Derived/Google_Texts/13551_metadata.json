After all, he\u2019s got a pen and a phone.\n\nAll these bailouts and threatened executive action got me to thinking that maybe there is a common underlying and unspoken premise.\n\nThe premise is that government \u2013 civil government \u2013 can actually do something to improve the economic vitality of the county, the state, the region, the country, and/or the world.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nHere\u2019s the bad news \u2013 the premise is a false one.\n\nGovernment \u2013 and by government here, I mean the civil government as distinguished from the church or the family or the individual \u2013 can\u2019t do anything to improve the economy. It can\u2019t create jobs, and for the president to continue to talk of such is nonsense. It can\u2019t affect the climate, assuming that it needs any correcting; and it can\u2019t bring about world peace \u2013 this should be eminently clear by now.\n\nIn fact, it should be quite clear to us by now that government really doesn\u2019t do anything well. It blunders and bumbles and pretty much ruins everything it touches.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nSo why do we keep thinking it will do something right? How many government-run catastrophes do we need to learn this lesson?\n\nBut here\u2019s the more important point \u2013 the critical (legal) point from the American, Constitutional view:\n\nEven if it could fix any of these things \u2013 which it can\u2019t do any better than it handled hurricane Katrina \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have the authority to do any of them. Let me be clear \u2013 for the Federal government under the executive direction of Barack Obama to attempt any of the foolish, impossible things he is promising is unlawful. Let me be as clear as possible. The president has shown himself a criminal by attempting to do that which is not authorized in Article II of the Constitution of these united States.\n\nHe is not authorized to spend money from the treasury for jobs programs \u2013 or for banking viability or for smart growth, or for undeclared wars, or for health care, or for education, or for energy regulation.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nHow do I know this? I read the Constitution. Article I Section 8 lists eighteen areas where spending is authorized, and only if it\u2019s for the general welfare\u2013i.e. not for the specific benefit of a select few, or a certain subsection of the population such as the elderly, or those with children, or those with a specific disability.\n\nWho keeps the president from breaking the law when he so brazenly declares that he will do so? Well, Congress and the courts are supposed to do this; but they don\u2019t seem to know that they should, or they don\u2019t care. In either event, they don\u2019t do their sworn duty and stop him. Sometimes they posture and preen and \u2013 with the single exception of Congressman Ron Paul of Texas \u2013 then they go along with the criminality, in one way or another.\n\nIn fact, they regularly engage in their own law-breaking, oftentimes justifying it by expediency.\n\nFor example, Senator Harry Reid, Barack Obama, and Nancy Pelosi frequently say that \u201cDoing nothing is not an option.\u201d\n\nWell, sure it is.\n\nIn fact, in most cases, doing nothing is the only legal option that government has; and our experience has shown it would work.\n\nLearn more about your Constitution with Michael Anthony Peroutka and his Institute on the Constitution and receive your free gift.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How many government-run catastrophes do we need to learn this lesson?", "author": "Michael Anthony Peroutka", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "How many government-run catastrophes do we need to learn this lesson?", "title": "What Exactly Does The Government Do \"Right\" Anyway?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 784, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5227589198_54e43d338e_o.jpg", "height": 600}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/exactly-government-right-anyway/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How many government-run catastrophes do we need to learn this lesson?", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5227589198_54e43d338e_o.jpg", "title": "What Exactly Does The Government Do \"Right\" Anyway?", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-22T17:21:28-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "Constitution", "published_time": "2014-08-22T17:21:28-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack obama, congress, constitution, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87b5\"", "article_summary": "Advertisement \u2013 story continues belowSo why do we keep thinking it will do something right?\nLearn more about your Constitution with Michael Anthony Peroutka and his Institute on the Constitution and receive your free gift.\nAll these bailouts and threatened executive action got me to thinking that maybe there is a common underlying and unspoken premise.\nIn fact, it should be quite clear to us by now that government really doesn\u2019t do anything well.\nFor example, Senator Harry Reid, Barack Obama, and Nancy Pelosi frequently say that \u201cDoing nothing is not an option.\u201dWell, sure it is."}
