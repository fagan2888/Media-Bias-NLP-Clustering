HOLLYWOOD — God bless America, and how’s everybody?

President Obama released his federal income tax returns to the public Monday which showed he made only $436,000 in the past year. The president’s income has steadily declined every year since he became president. That’s why he’s voting for Trump.

Donald Trump pulled off a huge victory Tuesday in the GOP primary in his home state of New York, giving his campaign a major momentum swing. He won his home state by sticking to three rules. Be yourself, mean everything you say, and always remember to thank all the heroes of 7-Eleven.

Donald Trump delighted comedians by accidentally referring to the World Trade Center attack as 7-Eleven on Monday. It’s not like Republicans don’t associate the guys who run 7-Elevens with terrorism anyway. Later, Trump made up for it by going to the 9-11 Memorial and ordering a Slurpee.

United Health Care announced it’s pulling out of ObamaCare in all but a few states because it’s cost the insurer five hundred million in losses. It’s been a disaster for Democrats. On the first day of ObamaCare, Bernie Sanders went to see a chiropractor, who referred him to a paleontologist.
