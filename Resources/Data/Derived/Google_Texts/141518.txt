Advent-Backed DI Expands in Building Materials Market with 3i Purchase

The company's recent targets include E.J. Bartells, Selle Supply and PBI Supply

Distribution International Inc. (DI), a distributor and fabricator in the mechanical insulation market, has acquired a target in the sector, 3i Supply Company. The transaction aligns with DI’s growth strategy centered on acquisitions that expand both its geographic presence and capabilities, the company says.

3i Supply is headquartered in Midland, Michigan. DI, which is backed by private equity firm Advent International, is based in Houston, Texas. In December 2014, Advent announced plans to add DI to its portfolio with its purchase of the company from PE firms Audax Group LP and CapStreet Group LLC, which jointly-owned the company since 2010.

DI has 85 branch locations, from which the company provides customers with products and services across the commercial building, chemicals, energy, power, railcar and marine end markets. DI has broadened its reach over the past four years with 14 acquisitions.

In December, DI acquired Renton, Washington-based E.J. Bartells, a supplier of mechanical and industrial insulation, fabrication, refractory, and HVAC products. This was preceded by DI’s October purchase of Selle Supply Company and sister company PBI Supply Inc., full-line distributors of insulation products and related construction materials, specializing in the lamination of fiberglass insulation for metal buildings.

Financial details regarding DI’s purchase of 3i have not been disclosed.
