Rodgers was just doing his job, and Lee just needed a place to park.\n\nA disabled man walks outside to find his truck gone and contacts News 9 for help. It all started Thursday.\n\n\u201cLee had to go into Bethany on appointment yesterday,\u201d Lee Skodak\u2019s friend Mark Nance said.\n\nLee Skodak had to take care of some business. He's disabled. While working beneath a car years ago, it fell and crushed him. He had a stroke from complications, and now he can't speak. However, he hears everything and communicates by text. He also drives, but when he walked outside to the parking lot, his truck was gone.\n\nHe called 911, but, of course, he couldn't talk and that was useless. Someone finally got a hold of police for him. His truck was reported stolen.\n\n\u201cAs he says, his old worn out truck,\u201d Nance said.\n\nHis friend called News 9 for him, and then we went back to where the truck was taken, noticed the slew of no parking signs and talked with a few folks who told us who tows vehicles that aren't supposed to be there.\n\nWe called the wrecker service, and lo and behold, they had Skodak's truck. It'd been towed.\n\n\"Your car was left in a bad spot. That's what happened, and it was private property and it said no parking, and so the owner called us to impound the vehicle,\u201d Bob Rodgers of Bob Rodgers Garage and Wrecker said.\n\nRodgers said he sent Lee a certified letter which he hasn't had time to get. Rodgers was just doing his job, and Skodak just needed a place to park.\n\nRodgers waived all the fees he could and didn't charge him for storage.\n\nBusinesses have 72 hours to notify someone when they're vehicle is towed. There was no handicapped parking in the parking lot.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A disabled man walks outside to find his truck gone and contacts News 9 for help.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31624364/news-9-helps-disabled-man-find-missing-truck", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10238326_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A disabled man walks outside to find his truck gone and contacts News 9 for help.", "title": "News 9 Helps Disabled Man Find Missing Truck"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10238326_G.jpg", "description": "A disabled man walks outside to find his truck gone and contacts News 9 for help.", "card": "summary", "title": "News 9 Helps Disabled Man Find Missing Truck"}, "wnreadableurl": "news-9-helps-disabled-man-find-missing-truck", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/04/01", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, missing truck, disabled, lee, bob rodgers, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, missing truck, disabled, lee, bob rodgers, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f61\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLee had to go into Bethany on appointment yesterday,\u201d Lee Skodak\u2019s friend Mark Nance said.\nLee Skodak had to take care of some business.\nWe called the wrecker service, and lo and behold, they had Skodak's truck.\nRodgers said he sent Lee a certified letter which he hasn't had time to get.\nA disabled man walks outside to find his truck gone and contacts News 9 for help."}
