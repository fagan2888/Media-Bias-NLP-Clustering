Just four medications with missing codes resulted in about $100,000 in delayed or lost billings. All told, the addition to revenue was around $194,000.\n\nAnother area where Effingham was able to increase the amount of money generated was by properly invoicing medications paid on a billable units basis. If there is 100 mg of injectable medication, then you have 100 billable units. Having this information added into the billing system increases revenue and speeds turnover by having the initial bill correct.\n\n\u201cWe can also save the hospital money by looking at revenue generated relative to the cost of medications,\u201d said Logan. \u201cStreamlining the formulary by cost and income brings it into better focus. Managing the formulary efficiently, along with billing help, means the pharmacy makes a contribution to the hospital\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\n\nAt the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, a team approach is used to shorten reimbursement times and error rates. Each group essentially has their own area of expertise with pharmacy management coordinating and helping find and eliminate problems.\n\n\u201cAll of our clinical pharmacists look at utilization trends, clinical guidelines and collaborate with our physicians, case managers and other providers to make sure that expensive medications are used appropriately,\u201d said Mary Peaslee, PharmD, clinical pharmacy specialist, managed care at the hospital. \u201cWe also keep an eye on patterns that indicate we may be coding drugs improperly or that the charts don\u2019t reflect the information the payers require. We communicate these needs to the appropriate individuals and work to make improvements.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado hospital also is reactive when needed. They have a revenue recovery team that assists with appealing claims. They also have a referral team that works mainly to get prior authorizations for outpatients. However, the team can also assist in orderly transitions from inpatient to outpatient care. This not only lessens the chances of payment concerns, but more importantly, means fewer disruptions in treatment during the hand off.\n\n\u201cHere we do a really great job of anticipating which drug is likely to be used and making sure we have the support needed to satisfy our payers,\u201d said Peaslee. \u201cIt is a collaboration making sure that the patient gets what they need while also making sure we are paid appropriately.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospital-pharmacies-aid-revenue-cycle", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "When it comes to speeding up the revenue cycle, the hospital pharmacy has its own part to play.", "title": "Hospital pharmacies aid revenue cycle"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "title": "Hospital pharmacies aid revenue cycle", "description": "When it comes to speeding up the revenue cycle, the hospital pharmacy has its own part to play.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "When it comes to speeding up the revenue cycle, the hospital pharmacy has its own part to play.&#13; \u201cThere are a lot of decisions taking place in the pharmacy that can have an impact on the financial health of the entire hospital,\u201d said Durwin Logan, manager of pharmacy operations at Effingham Hospital in Springfield, Ga.&#13; When Effingham Hospital initially began to look at the pharmacy\u2019s contribution to the revenue cycle, the amount of money involved hit home rather quickly.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9a9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt is a collaboration making sure that the patient gets what they need while also making sure we are paid appropriately.\u201d\nWhen it comes to speeding up the revenue cycle, the hospital pharmacy has its own part to play.\n\u201cWe can also save the hospital money by looking at revenue generated relative to the cost of medications,\u201d said Logan.\nWhen Effingham Hospital initially began to look at the pharmacy\u2019s contribution to the revenue cycle, the amount of money involved hit home rather quickly.\nFor instance, making sure the National Drug Code (NDC) number is correct is vital."}
