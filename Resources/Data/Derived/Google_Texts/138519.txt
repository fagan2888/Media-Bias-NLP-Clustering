TALLAHASSEE (AP) â€” The number of registered voters in Florida is growing and there has been a last-minute jump in the number of registered Republicans.

Florida's Division of Elections this week released information on the number of voters eligible to vote in the March 15 presidential primary.

The total number of eligible voters has risen to 12.06 million. There were about 11.93 million voters eligible during the 2014 election and the 2012 presidential election.

The new numbers show that there are now 4.27 million registered Republicans and that more than 82,000 Republicans have registered since the start of the year. There were about 4.17 million GOP voters during the 2014 election.

Florida is a closed primary state meaning that only registered Republicans and Democrats can vote in the presidential primary election.

Local numbers:
