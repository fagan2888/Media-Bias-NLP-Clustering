In 48 hours President Obama departs the nation\u2019s capital for points west and an extended stay. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on the big travel agenda, beginning Wednesday:\n\n\u201cNine years after he announced his candidacy for president, the President will return to the place where his political career began by traveling to Springfield, Illinois. Now in the final year of his second term, the President looks forward to addressing the Illinois General Assembly about what we can do, together, to build better politics,\u201d the White House advises.\n\nMr. Obama then journeys to scenic San Jose, California, for the night, bound for two Democratic Party fundraisers, then it\u2019s on to Los Angeles to appear on Ellen DeGeneres\u2018 show and attend a few more fundraisers on Thursday. The morning finds Mr. Obama in Palm Springs \u2014 presumably for a long golf weekend.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday he\u2019ll host a summit for Southeast Asian officials in Sunnylands \u2014 the 200-acre estate once owned by philanthropist Walter Annenberg \u2014 in Rancho Mirage, right at the corner of Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope drives. No, really, that\u2019s where it is.\n\nThis is the president\u2019s sixth visit to the swank, picturesque region. \u201cThe president is becoming quite a fixture in our valley,\u201d noted The Desert Sun in an editorial Sunday.\n\nMr. Obama returns to Washington after the summit ends Feb. 16.\n\n\u2018CROOKED\u2019\n\nWell, that\u2019s simple enough. Rasmussen Reports asked 1,000 likely voters whether they felt that the federal government is corrupt. The response: 81 percent agreed with the idea. \u201cVoters strongly believe the federal government is crooked,\u201d the pollster points out. The survey was released Friday.\n\nAND ABOUT THOSE SPEECHES\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, combined to earn more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign last spring, a CNN analysis shows,\u201d reports Robert Yoon, a correspondent for the network.\n\n\u201cIn total, the two gave 729 speeches from February 2001 until May, receiving an average payday of $210,795 for each address. The two also reported at least $7.7 million for at least 39 speeches to big banks, including Goldman Sachs and UBS, with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic 2016 front-runner, collecting at least $1.8 million for at least eight speeches to big banks,\u201d Mr. Yoon adds.\n\nA MINUTE WITH MADELEINE\n\nWhile campaigning in New Hampshire for the aforementioned Mrs. Clinton, Madeleine Albright advised young female Democrats there was a \u201cspecial place in hell for women who don\u2019t support other women.\u201d Yes, well. And the candidate? During an appearance Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mrs. Clinton herself shrugged off the remark.\n\n\u201cWell, good grief, we\u2019re getting offended about everything these days. Honest to goodness, I mean, people can\u2019t say anything without offending somebody,\u201d she told host Chuck Todd, who suggested that some people had been taken aback by Ms. Albright\u2019s comment.\n\n\u201cI think what she was trying to do, which she has done in every setting I\u2019ve ever seen her in, going back 20-plus years, was to remind young women in particular that this struggle, which many of us have been part of, it\u2019s not over \u2014 and don\u2019t be in any way lulled by the progress we\u2019ve made,\u201d Mrs. Clinton noted.\n\nGASEOUS AGENDA\n\nThe greater implications are sinking in: President Obama\u2019s upcoming 2017 budget proposal includes a $320 billion tax increase to fund a \u201cclean transportation\u201d plan. The main vehicle for this lavish measure is a $10 tax on each barrel of oil, which translates to higher prices at the gas pump. Among the plan particulars: $200 billion for bullet trains, $100 billion on a \u201cclimate smart fund\u201d and $20 billion worth of research that includes self-driving cars.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s new tax hike violates the spirit \u2014 if not the letter \u2014 of the president\u2019s firm pledge against any form of tax increase on any American earning less than $250,000,\u201d says Americans for Tax Reform, noting that Mr. Obama already broke his middle-class tax pledge when he signed Obamacare into law.\n\n\u201cOnly President Obama, with his fierce hatred of fossil fuels, would propose a tax on the very industry that is almost entirely responsible for the modest recovery we\u2019ve experienced since the Great Recession,\u201d says H. Sterling Burnett, a research fellow for The Heartland Institute.\n\nBut never fear, the U.S. House is here. Or appears to be, anyway.\n\n\u201cThe good news is this tax is dead on arrival in the people\u2019s House. We\u2019re not going to let President Obama make hardworking Americans pay for his radical climate agenda,\u201d declares House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 62 percent of Americans say the federal government does not help middle-class people enough; 53 percent of Republicans, 68 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 29 percent overall say the federal government helps middle-class people the \u201cright\u201d amount; 35 percent of Republicans, 28 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 6 percent overall say the federal government helps middle-class people too much; 9 percent of Republicans, 2 percent of Democrats and 8 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 32 percent overall say the Democratic Party favors the middle class; 10 percent of Republicans, 54 percent of Democrats and 28 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 26 percent overall say the Republican Party favors the middle class; 56 percent of Republicans, 7 percent of Democrats and 25 percent of independents agree.\n\nSource: A Pew Research Center poll of 1,300 U.S. adults conducted Dec. 8-13 and released Friday.\n\n\u2022 Chit-chat, salient points to jharper@washingtontimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rev up Air Force One, it's fundraising time again, along with symbolic moments and scenic views.
