Now, for the first time, the society plans to make a similar play on Congress.\n\nAt its annual convention in Washington last week, the legal society announced the \u201cArticle I Project,\u201d a pro bono effort to analyze the health of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nTraditionally, the influential legal group has focused on issues concerning the executive and judicial branches. But in recent years, Federalist Society President Eugene Meyer says, the legislative branch has not received \u201cthe kind of steady stream of attention it deserves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope to change that dynamic through this project,\u201d Meyer said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\nProminent and influential in legal circles, the Federalist Society has achieved significant success at the judicial level since its founding in 1981. In the past three decades, the group has spearheaded the effort to advance an original or textual interpretation of the Constitution.\n\nMeyer said the Article I Project\u2014which takes its name from the section of the U.S. Constitution granting legislative power\u2014will examine the evolving challenges facing a modern Congress in light of permanent principle.\n\nRather than tailor-made policies, the Article I project aims at producing a guiding philosophy for lawmakers.\n\nMeyer said a \u201cphilosophical perspective\u201d on the proper role of Congress has been lacking in recent discussions among academics and policy makers.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are really hoping to contribute, and think we have a good chance to do,\u201d he told The Daily Signal.\n\nAlready, the Federalist Society has recruited leading legal experts for the project, Meyer said. Over the next year, they will study and analyze Congress before offering their findings to lawmakers.\n\nMeyer declined to speculate on where he thinks Congress could improve. Another society member, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, was not as reserved.\n\nDuring a keynote address at the organization\u2019s national conference, Lee chastised Congress \u201cfor investing in its own irrelevance\u201d by surrendering lawmaking authority to administrative agencies.\n\nLee also praised the Federalist Society for taking \u201can increasing role in shaping how the Constitution operates [and] how it\u2019s followed within the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nMore than an academic exercise, the society\u2019s project could yield significant result, Heritage Foundation scholar David Azerrad said.\n\nAzerrad, director of the think tank\u2019s Simon Center for Principles and Politics, credits the Federalist Society with being \u201cone of the great conservative success stories of the latter half of the 20th century.\u201d He described its examination of Congress as \u201ca welcome effort.\u201d\n\nSince beginning as a student group at Yale Law School, the Federalist Society has grown into a national network of scholars, students, lawyers and judges. Three of its members currently sit on the Supreme Court: Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.\n\nExtending that influence to lawmakers on Capitol Hill will be difficult but achievable, said Randy Barnett, director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution.\n\nBarnett, who represented the National Federation of Independent Business in its landmark challenge of Obamacare in 2012, said he believes the society can convince Congress to change.\n\n\u201cThis is where the Federalist Society comes in,\u201d Barnett told The Daily Signal. \u201cGenerally ideology can trump narrow parochial interest when they are salient, when they are well publicized enough. That\u2019s how we got the Constitution in the first place.\u201d\n\nAlthough the society has yet to reach out formally to congressional leadership, Meyer said he\u2019s certain lawmakers are aware of the project.\n\nBefore he got the job, House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s chief of staff, David Hoppe, was scheduled to speak at the Federalist Society\u2019s recent annual convention. Hoppe canceled after Ryan tapped him, Meyer said.\n\nMeyer cautioned that the Article I Project shouldn\u2019t be construed as a shift away from the legal group\u2019s traditional emphasis on judicial matters.\n\nThe society\u2019s president dismissed rumors that conservative Supreme Court justices wouldn\u2019t attend the group\u2019s convention this month. Although Scalia and Alito did not speak at the event, they attended a banquet afterward, Meyer said.\n\nSome news outlets reported earlier in October that justices were skipping this month\u2019s convention to avoid any appearance of encroaching on another branch of government. Since 2010, the event has featured addresses each year by either Alito or Thomas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Federalist Society is about to put Congress under a constitutional microscope, as the little-known group of legal scholars begins its Article I Project.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Federalist Society is about to put Congress under a constitutional microscope, as the little-known group of legal scholars begins its Article I Project.", "title": "Why This Legal Group Is Examining How Congress Works", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151125_Roberts.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-01T11:30:54+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Tf6Ags"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Federalist Society is about to put Congress under a constitutional microscope, as the little-known group of legal scholars begins its Article I Project.", "title": "Why This Legal Group Is Examining How Congress Works", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151125_Roberts.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "congress,constitution", "published_time": "2015-11-25T18:40:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T11:30:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Article I Project, Supreme Court, Federalist Society, Federalist Society Congress, Constitution, legislative branch, Alito, Thomas, Scalia, Eugene Meyer"}, "article_summary": "Prominent and influential in legal circles, the Federalist Society has achieved significant success at the judicial level since its founding in 1981.\nAlready, the Federalist Society has recruited leading legal experts for the project, Meyer said.\nThe Federalist Society has catapulted traditional jurisprudence into prominence, making constitutional principles vogue at both law schools and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\u201cThis is where the Federalist Society comes in,\u201d Barnett told The Daily Signal.\nTraditionally, the influential legal group has focused on issues concerning the executive and judicial branches."}
