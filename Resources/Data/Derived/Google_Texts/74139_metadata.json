According to RTXB founder Jerry Grisaffi, the first batch of new products are expected to be ready in September.\n\n\u201cThe beautiful thing is that it\u2019s all legal in all the states because there\u2019s no THC in it,\u201d said Mr. Grisaffi. \u201cEven though it doesn\u2019t make you high, it makes you feel good.\u201d\n\nThe new products and brands will emphasis the purported health benefits of hemp extracts. Indeed, Mr. Grisaffi said he hopes the ingredients will help land some of the products in Whole Foods Market.\n\nOn its website, RTXB says it plans to offer an extensive selection of cannabis and hemp-based products, such as hemp oils, hemp energy drinks, candies and chewing gums. Mr. Shuman says the company is in talks with several large investment groups to finance the new products.\n\nShould Texas ever legalize medical marijuana, the company says it will be well positioned to enter that market. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d Mr. Grisaffi said of legalized medical marijuana. \u201cOnce it happens, these products can be infused with THC very easily.\u201d\n\nOriginally, RTXB was in the barbecue business, selling barbecue sauce, smoked brisket, chicken, turkey and pork ribs. If not for the bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring, Mr. Grisaffi says he would never have become interested in hemp, which he discovered while looking for new ways to bring revenue into his company.\n\n\u201cSometimes when one door closes on you, another door opens up,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com.
