She held off for three months before calling him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for your phone call,\u201d Eder said.\n\nOn their first date, they drove around city lakes. At Christmastime, they gazed at lights together. When Eder took off for Florida to visit his best friend, he called Van Epps and they talked for four hours straight.\n\nThat was it. She and \u201cthis cute little round guy\u201d never separated again.\n\nEder worked as a union stagehand. Van Epps, who has faced her share of health and housing challenges, founds jobs as a cook, eventually being hired at Peace House, a drop-in center.\n\nThe ambience at Peace House is welcoming to all, the food robust and free \u2014 sloppy Joes sometimes, with cheesy potatoes, plus a few healthy touches such as green beans and fruit salad.\n\nWhile working there, 58-year-old Van Epps met Ward Brennan, an 82-year old Minneapolis native who retired from the insurance business. Brennan knows something about soul mates.\n\nHe began volunteering at Peace House after his wife, Frances, died in 2001.\n\n\u201cI was so despondent after she died,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know where I was going. But it\u2019s hard to feel sorry for yourself here.\n\n\u201cThis place saved me.\u201d\n\nThe Peace House Community was founded in 1985 by Sister Rose Tillemans as a place for the ostracized \u2014 many facing mental health challenges or chemical dependency \u2014 to feel welcomed and affirmed.\n\nBrennan, who volunteers two to three times a week, remembers when he met Van Epps many years ago.\n\n\u201cShe was a very good cook,\u201d he said. She\u2019d cook whatever was available, he said, typically chicken and ground beef. \u201cVery few lobsters,\u201d he joked.\n\nShe and other cooks feed up to 60 people a day, usually without glowing feedback.\n\n\u201cYou have to be pretty tough to work here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t always say, \u2018What a delicious meal!\u2019 \u201d\n\nOver the years, Brennan got to know Eder, too. Eder didn\u2019t hang out at Peace House, but Brennan got a sense of the man whom Van Epps loved: a father of three, grandfather of five, a man whose across-the-street neighbor never had to shovel her driveway because Eder always got out his plow.\n\nFor years, Eder had complained about his knees and hips, but he was afraid to go to the doctor because he figured he\u2019d have to have surgery.\n\nThis year, Van Epps started worrying about her little round guy. He was losing weight, looking buff, even.\n\n\u201cI joked, \u2018Who are you seeing?\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nAbout a month ago, Brennan dropped by the couple\u2019s home in Robbinsdale. He was shocked at how sickly Eder looked.\n\nEder finally saw a doctor. He was told not to plan for hip or knee surgery: He had end-stage pancreatic cancer.\n\nHe endured three rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, and still managed to shoot pool on a few Monday nights. But over Memorial Day weekend, Van Epps faced the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s the end now,\u201d she realized. Though tiny herself, she lifted Eder back into their bed when his legs gave out.\n\nThe following Friday, May 29, Brennan was volunteering at Peace House when a panicked Van Epps called at 1 p.m. from North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale. Eder was there now. He might not make it through the night.\n\nBrennan approached Zimmerman, also volunteering that day, with a \u201ctroubling\u201d situation.\n\nVan Epps and Eder lived in the home they bought together five years ago, but they weren\u2019t married. Van Epps\u2019 name was not on the title, and she worried she\u2019d lose the house when Eder died.\n\nEarlier in the week, Van Epps and Eder had received a marriage license, signed and properly notarized. But the marriage license provided that the earliest date a marriage could take place was Sunday, May 31.\n\nEder clearly didn\u2019t have that long.\n\nThe couple had a minister who would drive from the Milaca area to Minneapolis to marry them.\n\nZimmerman told Brennan that Van Epps needed to obtain a waiver that would allow them to be married before Sunday. The waiver was not valid unless signed by judge, a form issued by a court service center.\n\nVan Epps couldn\u2019t drive, so getting to a government center on a late Friday afternoon was a problem. So was quickly finding a judge.\n\nZimmerman called his former judicial clerk, who contacted Hennepin County Judge Fred Karasov. Karasov told Edge he\u2019d be delighted to handle the request for a waiver.\n\nBrennan raced out of Peace House to North Memorial and \u201cdrove like mad\u201d to pick up Van Epps, who was waiting outside. They drove to Hennepin County Government Center in downtown Minneapolis, where Karasov signed the waiver.\n\nThe wedding license then needed to be amended. But the downtown licensing bureau closed at 4 p.m.\n\nTurns out, Brookdale courthouse in Brooklyn Center was open until 6 p.m. Brennan and Van Epps rushed there next, but faced a long line.\n\nVan Epps was growing despondent.\n\n\u201cI was more worried about getting back to Joe, but we had to do this,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI told the [courthouse] lady I was desperate,\u201d Brennan added.\n\n\u201cAt a quarter to 6, we were still sitting there,\u201d he said. \u201cAt five minutes to 6, I swear, they issued us the revised license.\u201d\n\nHe and Van Epps rushed back to North Memorial and the final pieces fell together.\n\nThe minister arrived, and, at 9:45 p.m., Eder uttered his final words: \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, he was able to squeeze Van Epps\u2019 hand. She wiped away his tears. Then he fell into a coma.\n\nOn Monday, a grateful Sheila Van Epps Eder called Brennan at Peace House.\n\nHer husband, she said, had just died.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Sheila Van Epps always knew she'd marry her longtime love, Joe Eder.
