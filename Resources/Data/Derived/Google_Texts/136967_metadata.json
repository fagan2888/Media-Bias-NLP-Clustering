They\u2019re right!\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to impeach yourself, but Obama has employed contorted sophistry to appear imperiled and gin up his base. Indeed, Democrats talk about impeachment 20 times \u2013 twenty \u2013 more often than Republicans.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to be the most transparent presidency in history when 47 inspectors general sign a letter to congressional oversight leaders saying the Justice Department, the Peace Corps and the Chemical Safety Board have withheld information on the basis that it was privileged.\n\nNo one begrudges our president a vacation, but it\u2019s impossible to play so many rounds of golf, as the world is alight in conflict, without slip sliding away. Sure, Eisenhower, as Supreme Commander allied forces, played a bit of golf in WWII, but did anyone doubt his tenacity to stomp the Nazis into oblivion? Obama revels in the perks of office, exclaiming, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about being president, I can do whatever I want,\u201d but does not embrace the work. That\u2019s partly why even his liberal media allies are starting to wonder if he has checked out altogether.\n\nConsider that within an hour of condemning ISIS for beheading an American Journalist, Obama was teeing it up with NBA player Alonzo Mourning. Contrast that to the chiseled determination of the British PM who abruptly ended his vacation to deal with the implications of the evil ISIS perpetrator being British. I stand corrected \u2013 he wasn\u2019t truly pip-pip British, though he had the accent.\n\nDoctrinaire liberals were eager to consign George W. Bush to the lair of worst presidents ever. But Obama may be the most impossible president; incorrigibly aloof even from traditional allies, he\u2019s the impossible imposter.\n\nEvery major piece of social legislation, including the Social Security Act of 1935, has had some bi-partisan support \u2013 until the impossible imposter forced through Obamacare. Obama may whine about duly elected representatives of \u201cthe people\u2019s House,\u201d but it\u2019s impossible to engender engagement when foisting impossible legislation upon a body he publicly derides. I guess community organizers can squeak loudly, speak pretty, but are bleak. They\u2019re prone to provocation and agitation, which may be why the White House values Al Sharpton\u2019s counsel.\n\nGovernment by executive action is nigh on impossible in our political system. Even the politically demarcated SCOTUS unanimously ruled that Obama\u2019s shenanigans, such as recess appointments to the NLRB, are unconstitutional. Go figure, Ginsburg and Alito on the same side \u2013 9-0! While SCOTUS remains an independent, co-equal branch of gov\u2019t, it will be impossible for imposters to subvert our Constitution without being laid bare.\n\nIt\u2019s inconceivable for a Democrat administration to spurn the unrequited support of Labor unions. Their agendas are entangled in a self-perpetuating cycle \u2013 union fees go to support pandering Democrat candidates who then push legislation to proliferate unions. But just a few days ago the head of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (ILEW) said that the EPA\u2019s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions will \u201chave a dramatic impact on the American economy but only a minimal effect on global carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nUnions are also distraught over Obama\u2019s acquiescence to extreme environmentalists who oppose job creating projects like Keystone XL pipeline; and they\u2019re disquieted by Obamacare, from which they are seeking exemptions, especially from taxes on Cadillac plans. It seemed impossible given big labor\u2019s unerring efforts to help Democrats jam Obamacare through, but now their slobbering adoration rescinds.\n\nForeign policy that \u201cleads from behind\u201d is oxymoronic, and impossibly pathetic in a world where power vacuums are a voracious vortex sucking in vicious tyrants and terrorists. Security threats require consistent policy and rapid response plans; they are not manageable from behind irresolute allies. But we shouldn\u2019t be surprised, the imposter who grew up on the periphery of America instinctively bows to dubious characters abroad while downplaying our salubrious ideals. For the sake of humanity, for all the souls yearning to breathe free, now is the time to project American exceptionalism.\n\nFor Obama and his media minions, success is often rooted in egalitarianism. Perhaps a noble value in theory, but consigning everyone to mediocrity in reality. Their world view skews from good ol' fashioned American optimism. Their bias is contrary to the zeitgeist of an exceptional America, where traits like hard work, courage and perseverance are riveting. Where inspiration is welcome, for sure, but trumped by perspiration in the expectation that you, not the grim tax reaper, will reap most of the benefits of your labor.\n\nEven with a complicit media, it\u2019s simply impossible to persuade dynamic, innovative, risk-taking Americans that they didn\u2019t build their businesses, to invoke a revealing Obama attitude. It\u2019s impossible to ensure equality of outcomes when Americans still value equality of opportunity based on meritocracy. We appreciate a helping hand, occasionally, but most of us are too proud and hard-working to succumb to a culture of stupefying dependency. And most of us favor a work requirement as a condition for receiving welfare.\n\nIn a vast bureaucracy it may be impossible to control every overzealous bureaucrat with a wayward agenda, but it is possible to convey respect for the rule of law. Curiously, Obama has repeatedly claimed that he first learned about various scandals in the media, yet he hinted hypocritical hubris when dissing the media at a recent fundraiser: \u201cWhatever they\u2019re reporting on I usually know about.\" Except the scandals, that is.\n\nWith so many smidgens of evidence congealing into a preponderance of impropriety, it\u2019s impossible to claim that every single scandal is conjured by political foes. Over 2 dozen and counting \u2026 in a corrupt, ideological administration. They\u2019re all phony? That\u2019s phooey. For example, the odds of 7 hard drives failing at the IRS within one month are about 1 in over 78 billion. There\u2019s a prevailing sense of corruption not seen since the Nixon administration; that\u2019s a big reason that trust in Federal government is so fragile.\n\nIt\u2019s well documented that under Obama\u2019s policies we\u2019ve had the slowest economic recovery since\u2026 well, ever. That\u2019s because it\u2019s impossible to rapidly grow the economy when government pursues bizarre efforts to actually increase energy prices; when it favors central-style planning with burdensome regulations and red tape; when it chooses winners that the marketplace deems losers; when it punitively sues banks; and when it takes a health-care system admired around the world and puts the government in charge of an ill-fated overhaul, rather than actually tweak improvements.\n\nYes, I guess Obama\u2019s remaining apologists in the media get the gist \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to be a successful modern day president when the incumbent is a community-organizing imposter.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-token": "OlZDNF8wkTAhg+8YMNtAP1j9GevqQBRfysLxE/A1dx0=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Amidst Obama&rsquo;s dismal poll numbers some in the media had an epiphany: it&rsquo;s impossible to be a successful modern president.
