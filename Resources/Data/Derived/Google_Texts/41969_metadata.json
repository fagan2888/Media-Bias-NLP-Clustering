Now that information will be available in a search feature on healthcare.gov.\n\nAs of Tuesday, healthcare.gov has access to data from more than 90 percent of insurance companies on the marketplace, CMS said.\n\n\"If an insurance company has not provided validated data, consumers will be alerted when they search for a provider that there is 'no data from insurance company,'\" according to the agency.\n\nThe agency added that health plans can change doctors in their networks on a continual basis, so consumers need to check with their doctor or plan to confirm that the doctor accepts that plan.\n\nThe doctor lookup was touted by CMS as a new tool for helping consumers navigate healthcare.gov. Another tool is an out-of-pocket cost calculator, which is available to everyone on healthcare.gov, that allows consumers to see how much they will have to pay out of pocket for a certain plan.\n\nThe agency is still working on a pilot for a similar lookup tool for prescription drugs, where consumers can search to see whether a plan covers the drugs they take.\n\nA pilot on the prescription drug lookup tool will be ready in the coming weeks, the agency said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consumers can now use an experimental feature on healthcare.gov to look up whether their doctor is included in an Obamacare plan.\nHealthcare.gov, which residents in 38 states use to sign up for Obamacare, is piloting a beta version of the new feature, the administration announced Tuesday.
