'You're not going to get me impeached, are you?'\n\nPresident Barack Obama listened to immigration activists run through a long wish list of executive actions \u2013 then added a request of his own.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me impeached, are you?\u201d Obama said, according to people in a private White House meeting late last month. \u201cBecause there\u2019s lots of other things I want to do besides immigration.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe president was joking \u2026 mostly. Obama said he was frustrated that Republicans wouldn\u2019t talk about passing an immigration bill but were openly toying with an impeachment vote over the notion that he would use his executive powers to circumvent Congress.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Does the GOP need a FrankenCandidate?)\n\nThe issue came up enough in the meeting, one person in the room said, that it caused some anxiety among immigration reform advocates that Obama could use the threat of impeachment as a rationale against going too big or too fast on executive actions.\n\nImpeachment is one of the rare things that nearly everyone in Washington can agree on: it\u2019s a radical idea, and there\u2019s no way it\u2019s happening. But in a White House that\u2019s seen enough ideas move from the fringe to the mainstream they are, with a level of disbelief, finding themselves talking about the topic more and more.\n\nThis time last year, after all, few believed the Republicans would actually shut down the government over Obamacare.\n\nWhite House aides haven\u2019t called in the lawyers yet or had a formal strategy session. But it\u2019s coming up in conversations inside the West Wing, and there\u2019s even an argument from Democratic allies who think that impeachment \u2014 or, at the very least, more talk about it \u2014 could be great for Democrats politically and even give the White House the kind of focus it\u2019s been lacking of late.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: An Obamacare disconnect in N.C.)\n\nObama\u2019s been paying attention, too. \u201cYou hear some of them \u2014 \u2018Sue him,\u2019 \u2018Impeach him,\u2019\u201d he said, laughing along with the crowd at a speech in Austin, Texas, last week. \u201cReally? Really? For what? You\u2019re going to sue me for doing my job? Okay.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s public comments came after Sarah Palin wrote a Breitbart News column that said Obama\u2019s record of \u201clawlessness\u201d running up the debt and threatening American workers, \u201cif after all this he\u2019s not impeachable, then no one is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis unsecured border crisis is the last straw that makes the battered wife say, \u201cno mas,\u2019\u201d Palin wrote.\n\nThen there\u2019s Iowa Republican Senate nominee Joni Ernst or Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who added Benghazi to the list of possible offenses. And initial polls from YouGov and Rasmussen show Republicans at large favoring the idea by huge, better than two-thirds margins \u2014 all connecting to the larger GOP argument that Obama has overreached with executive actions and efforts to circumvent Congress.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Ready for Warren? Backers start site)\n\nFor some Democrats, the idea that Republicans may overreach with impeachment talk reminds them of the lost opportunity of the government shutdown. In polls and fundraising, the party never clocked higher numbers than during the shutdown, but the Obamacare website meltdown squandered any Democratic momentum.\n\n\u201cIt has the potential to wake up a lot of Democrats whose energy level about voting this year is low,\u201d said Democratic consultant Joe Trippi.\n\nDemocrats have been struggling with how to get African-Americans and Latinos to turn out in force this year the way Obama did in 2008 and 2012. Impeach him over immigration reform, they say, and Republicans will do the work for them.\n\n\u201cThe more they talk about it, the more it has a red hot effect on their base. So if you can get the temperature just right, you\u2019re turning out all your base voters and Democrats don\u2019t take it seriously and it\u2019s a good year for you,\u201d Trippi said. \u201cIf that stove gets just a little too hot and you lose control of it, you\u2019re going to have every Democrat on the planet turning out to stop it.\u201d\n\nThe president, aides say, isn\u2019t embracing the political argument. He\u2019ll joke about it in front of a friendly crowd, but he doesn\u2019t like the idea of delegitimizing him as president and the certainty he feels that if he gets impeached, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the next Democratic president gets impeached, too.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is obviously a very serious topic being bandied about in an unserious way by unserious people,\u201d said senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer.\n\n\u201cWe understand that some on both sides could find potential for this to be good politics,\u201d said another senior administration official on Tuesday. \u201cWe think it\u2019s dangerous and corrosive to trivialize something so serious as impeaching the president of the United States.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "White House aides haven\u2019t called in the lawyers yet, but it\u2019s coming up in conversations.", "title": "'You're not going to get me impeached, are you?'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/whos-talking-about-impeachment-barack-obama-108964.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/16/140716_barack_obama_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,Impeachment,Immigration,Politics", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "White House aides haven\u2019t called in the lawyers yet, but it\u2019s coming up in conversations.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me impeached, are you?\u201d Obama said, according to people in a private White House meeting late last month.\n'You're not going to get me impeached, are you?'\nYou\u2019re going to sue me for doing my job?\n\u201cIf that stove gets just a little too hot and you lose control of it, you\u2019re going to have every Democrat on the planet turning out to stop it.\u201dThe president, aides say, isn\u2019t embracing the political argument.\nBackers start site)For some Democrats, the idea that Republicans may overreach with impeachment talk reminds them of the lost opportunity of the government shutdown."}
