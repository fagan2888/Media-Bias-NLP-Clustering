Ted Cruz wants to hear President Obama apologize for Obamacare. We know the administration wants Republicans like Cruz to drop their demands for repeal and start working together.\n\nWhere\u2019s the common ground? There doesn\u2019t seem to be much.\n\nShortly before Obama headed to the Capitol to deliver his annual address, Cruz reiterated his scathing critique of the health care law and \u2013 a bit reluctantly \u2013 acknowledged that he\u2019s not at all interested in tweaking or improving it. He\u2019s after the same thing he\u2019s always been after: repeal.\n\n\u201cOur health insurance system cannot be fixed as long as Obamacare is in place,\u201d he said on a call with Texas reporters. \u201cIt is an experiment in social engineering run amok.\u201d\n\nTexas Democrats such as Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio see growing public warmth toward Obamacare, and tonight\u2019s State of the Union as a great opportunity for the president to showcase his policies and burnish his image.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the midst of a comeback. You see his poll numbers rebounding,\u201d Castro said in an interview at his office. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is gaining momentum. There are over 3 million people who\u2019ve signed up through the exchanges. Millions more that have enrolled in Medicaid. The pace of signups has accelerated.\u201d\n\nCruz cited the same 3 million figure. But he said, more than 5 million people have lost health coverage because of Obamacare. Of the 3 million who have signed up for insurance through Medicaid or the online exchanges, he said, estimates show that only 11 percent had been uninsured beforehand \u2013 meaning a net gain of about 330,000, a costly result that Cruz called \u201can abject disaster.\u201d\n\nCastro is more upbeat about the law, and about Obama\u2019s prospects coming out of Tuesday night.\n\nThis is a real opportunity for a kind of comeback. Now, like just about every other president, I doubt during his second term he\u2019s going to get to 60 percent approval ratings again as he did when he had just become president. But I do think you\u2019ll see him gain a decent amount of support back,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMS90ZWQtY3J1ei1hbmQtam9hcXVpbi1jYXN0cm8td2VpZ2gtaW4tb24tb2JhbWFjYXJlLWFoZWFkLW9mLXN0YXRlLW9mLXRoZS11bmlvbi5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
