(AP) \u2014 The story has played out the same way in Ferguson, Missouri, New York City and Milwaukee. A white police officer kills an unarmed black man, sparking waves of protests before a white prosecutor ultimately decides not to file charges or hands the case off to a grand jury.\n\nThat narrative looks different in Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, where a liberal biracial prosecutor will decide whether to charge a white officer in an unarmed biracial man\u2019s death.\n\nBlack protesters have likened last month\u2019s fatal shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson by police officer Matt Kenny to the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York City and Dontre Hamilton in Milwaukee. Grand juries in Ferguson and New York, convened by white prosecutors, chose not to charge the officers in those cases. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, who is white, declined to file charges in the Hamilton shooting.\n\nThe decision to press charges in the Madison case will be made by Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne, a biracial Democrat who identifies as black.\n\nOzanne, whose mother was an activist in the South during the Freedom Summer of 1964, got his start as an assistant Dane County district attorney in 1998. Ten years later, then-Gov. Jim Doyle chose Ozanne to help lead the state Department of Corrections, where he helped implement Doyle\u2019s early release program.\n\nDoyle appointed Ozanne as Dane County district attorney two years later, and Ozanne was elected to the position in 2012, running on promises to reduce racial disparities. Last year, he ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general, vowing to expand programs that allow young adult offenders to clear their records by completing their sentences and connect violent offenders to mentors.\n\nDoyle said he thinks more African-Americans should serve as prosecutors and judges, a view that factored into his decision to appoint Ozanne to his position.\n\n\u201cNot to say they should make decisions (based) on race, but it brings a greater sense of fairness to the system,\u201d said Doyle, a Democrat who served as Wisconsin attorney general before he was elected governor in 2002.\n\nHe said he\u2019s confident that Ozanne will weigh the facts in the Robinson case impartially.\n\n\u201cHis decision isn\u2019t to see whether all of justice is done in the world or all the wrongs have been righted or whether police behavior is appropriate or inappropriate,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cHis decision will determine whether he thinks there\u2019s probable cause (to support charges). You just really have to go back to the basics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black DA to decide charges against white Wisconsin officer", "author": "Todd Richmond", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Black DA to decide charges against white Wisconsin officer", "title": "Black DA to decide charges against white Wisconsin officer", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/black_da_to_decide_charges_against_white_wisconsin_officer/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/killings-by-police-madison-prosecutor.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black DA to decide charges against white Wisconsin officer", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/killings-by-police-madison-prosecutor.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Black DA to decide charges against white Wisconsin officer", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Black DA to decide charges against white Wisconsin officer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That narrative looks different in Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, where a liberal biracial prosecutor will decide whether to charge a white officer in an unarmed biracial man\u2019s death.\nMilwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, who is white, declined to file charges in the Hamilton shooting.\nA white police officer kills an unarmed black man, sparking waves of protests before a white prosecutor ultimately decides not to file charges or hands the case off to a grand jury.\nThe decision to press charges in the Madison case will be made by Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne, a biracial Democrat who identifies as black.\nDoyle appointed Ozanne as Dane County district attorney two years later, and Ozanne was elected to the position in 2012, running on promises to reduce racial disparities."}
