The battery-powered devices simulate cigarette smoking, producing a smoke-like vapor that usually contains nicotine and flavoring agents.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration recently proposed regulating e-cigarettes, just as it does regular cigarettes and cigars.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is looking into the use of e-cigarettes and the tobacco surcharge, according to an agency official.\n\nIn a recent review of research on e-cigarettes, researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that, although the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes are still largely unknown, they emit potentially harmful substances into the air and can be a source of indoor pollution.\n\nThe researchers also found that e-cigarettes actually reduce the likelihood that people will quit smoking, in contrast to advertising claims that firing up an e-cig will help people kick the habit.\n\nThe potential role of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool has insurance coverage implications too. The health law requires most health plans to cover FDA-approved smoking cessation products and counseling without any out-of-pocket cost to consumers. The federal government recently released guidance clarifying which services and products must be covered.\n\nSince e-cigarettes aren\u2019t FDA-approved for quitting smoking\u2013and in fact are considered by the agency to be tobacco products that warrant regulation like cigarettes\u2014they aren\u2019t covered as a free preventive benefit under the law.\n\nBut more specific guidance may be needed. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act does not specify e-cigarette use for purposes of cessation coverage or tobacco surcharge application,\u201d says Catherine McMahon, policy principal at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cThe lack of clarity may allow health plans to try to add the surcharge for e-cigarettes.\u201d\n\nMichelle Andrews writes for Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
