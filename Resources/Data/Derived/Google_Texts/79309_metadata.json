We have excerpts from some of the season's biggest entertainment biographies and memoirs all day -- guaranteed perfect for someone on your list. Excerpted from \"Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story\"\n\nJerry Lee Lewis did not know where he was, precisely, just somewhere in Canada. The caravan thundered down highways that were barely there, the roadbed eaten by permafrost, the gravel flying like buckshot against the bottoms of the big cars. There was a long Lincoln Continental, a Fleetwood Cadillac, a mean-looking Hudson Hornet, and a brand-new Buick Supreme; it was new for only a thousand miles or so, till the potholes got it. The big sedans might have been different colors, once, but now they were all a uniform gray, the color of the blowing dust. Jerry Lee rode in the passenger seat of the Buick, sick of this great distance between crowds and applause, six hundred, seven hundred miles a day. \u201cI didn\u2019t drive. . . . I was paid to play piano and sing. Stars don\u2019t drive.\u201d Instead, he read Superman, or used a cigarette lighter to fire up one cherry bomb after another and flung them out the half window to explode under the trailing cars.\n\n\u201cThat first tour was me, Johnny, and Carl, and Sonny James, Marvin Rainwater, Wanda Jackson. We put eighty, ninety thousand miles on that Buick, across Canada, across everywhere . . . throwing cherry bombs the whole way.\u201d Sometimes he missed high and the cherry bombs exploded against windshields or on the hoods, and Johnny and Carl would curse him mightily, curse unheard, but one time he misjudged and the cherry bomb bounced off a window frame and into J. W.\u2019s lap, and J. W.\u2019s screams echoed inside the Buick for a good long while, longer than was seemly for a man. They could have used a chaperone, all of them, or a warden. The lead car was jammed with drum kits, guitar cases, and sharp-cut jackets and two-tone shoes. The only other provisions they packed were whiskey, cherry bombs, and comic books.\n\nHe cannot really remember all the little cities and towns they traveled through, not even the names on the road signs, only the vast, empty spaces in between. They would go two hundred miles or more and not see a caf\u00e9 or a motel. \u201cWe\u2019d stop at a store and get some Vienna sausages and bologna and bread and pickles and mustard, and pull over to the side of the road and have a picnic. . . . Calgary, that was one of the places. Quebec. They went crazy in Quebec. Pulled their dresses up.\u201d\n\nTo the owners of the motels and truck stops, it must have seemed like the lunatics had wandered off the path, had stolen some good cars, and were terrorizing the countryside. \u201cJohnny came in my room and saw this little bitty television in there, and he said, \u2018You know, my wife\u2019s always wanted one of them.\u2019 And I told him, \u2018Fine, go steal one from your own room.\u2019 \u201d And it went that way, eight hundred, nine hundred miles a day, half drunk, pill crazy, larcenous, and destructive and beset by loose women and fits of temper, and it was perfect.\n\n\u201cWe had some good fights,\u201d says Jerry Lee. \u201cA good fight just cleared the air.\u201d\n\nCarl Perkins and Johnny Cash had begun the tour as headliners. They were still the big names at Sun then and, Sam Phillips believed, his best moneymaking ventures. The problem was this newcomer, this blond-haired kid, who did not know his place and had no governor on his mouth, and in such close proximity, they could not tune him out and could not run away and could not kill him, either, though they considered it. He even had the gall to suggest, as the days wore on, he should close the shows, him with just two records cut and shipped and not even one yet on the charts. Who, they wondered aloud, did that Louisiana pissant think he was?\n\nThey were starting to call the music \u201crockabilly\u201d now, but the kid refused to label himself as that, to endorse any kinship with that hillbilly-heavy blues that sold so well in any town with a tractor dealership on its main drag. To Jerry Lee, the word was denigrating, something imposed on these country boys and their music by the outside world. \u201cI wasn\u2019t no rockabilly,\u201d he says, \u201cI was rock and roll.\u201d Carl was pure rockabilly\u2014\u201cBlue Suede Shoes\u201d was the music\u2019s anthem\u2014and Johnny, the storyteller, was more country than most young rock and rollers aspired to be, though his \u201cGet Rhythm\u201d rocked out good and strong, as Jerry Lee recalls. The audience loved all of it, bought tickets by the handful and just moved to it, man, because it made old, traditional country music seem like the record player was too slow, and in town after town they lined up, hungry. But increasingly, as his stage presence swelled and swelled, it was Jerry Lee who created the excitement, who got them dancing, and so he demanded more and more of the spotlight. It was, he believed, only his due.\n\nMore than one music fan, more than one historian of rock and roll, have wished for a time machine, just so they could travel back to this one time, this one tour, to wedge into those packed auditoriums on the vast plains and in the Canadian Rockies, to see it all happen the way it did, to see Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, young and raw and wild, singing into big Art Deco microphones that looked like something that shook loose off the hood of an Oldsmobile, on stages scarred by a million metal folding chairs, in auditoriums where next week the featured attraction would be a high school production of The Merchant of Venice.\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, from Maud, Oklahoma, it\u2019s the Queen of Rockabilly, Wanda\u2026\u201d And before the announcer could even get it out, the crowd was hollering and hooting\u2014with here and there a wolf whistle or two\u2014as Wanda Jackson came out from the wings in high, high heels, hips swinging free and easy like she walked that way going to the mailbox. She had not a made a sound yet, and already the loggers, drillers, and insurance men were beginning to sweat. This was no cowgirl. Her dresses were fringed, to accentuate her flying hips, and low-cut, to accentuate something else, and her legs were slim and perfect and her waist was so tiny a big man could encircle it with his two big hands. Her big hair was dark brown and flowing, and her big eyes were framed by a starlet\u2019s arched eyebrows; she was a goddess with a voice like a beast, and she growled as she sang that a hardheaded woman is a thorn in the side of a man.\n\nThat was hard to follow. But here came Sonny James of Hackleburg, Alabama, striding out in his Western suit, a thin, dark-haired man who had survived the Korean War, singing a love song of the ages. \u201cYoung Love\u201d was the song, and it wasn\u2019t the words that made it lovely but how he did it, like smoke on velvet.\n\nNext came that good-looking Marvin Rainwater, who wore a fringed buckskin shirt and a headband onstage, because he was one-quarter Cherokee. He sang in deep baritone about how he was \u201cgonna find him a bluebird, let it sing all night long.\u201d He was a mellow singer, a balladeer, and smoothed out the crowd before the real headliners came on, the boys from the land of the rising Sun.\n\nFirst came Carl Perkins, in his too-tight pants and pointy sideburns, and he let it rip:\n\nWell, it\u2019s one for the money\n\nTwo for the show . . .\n\nThrough force of will, Jerry Lee had climbed up the bill and over and straight through Carl, till now there was only Johnny Cash, in his elegant, somber black, hovering just above him on the marquee. That night, there had been the usual argument over who would close the show. Johnny, with the bigger name and a song on the charts, had the promoters on his side: he got top billing, which meant he had to follow Jerry Lee. But first Jerry Lee had to surrender the stage.\n\nThe stage had become a kind of laboratory for Jerry Lee, and he was the mad scientist. Onstage he mixed and matched songs and versions of songs, stitched together some parts and discarded others; because he was Jerry Lee, he did what he felt like in the moment, in a set that was supposed to be four or so songs, but he ignored that, too. He gave them \u201cCrazy Arms\u201d one minute and \u201cBig-Legged Woman\u201d the next, and they clapped to one and stomped and howled to the other. His show got wilder and increasingly wicked on that tour, and the audiences bellowed for encores. He had heard that Canadians were earnest, reserved people, but he must have heard wrong. More and more he was beginning to understand that, while the music was at the core, that was just the start of it. Putting on a show was like flipping the switch on Frankenstein\u2019s monster, then watching it show the first twitching signs of life. \u201cYou got to dress right, act right, carry yourself right; it all had to come together.\u201d\n\nThe good-looking part, well, God had handled that. But you had to use it. His hair, by now, had become almost like another instrument. Under the lights, it really did shine like burnished gold, and at the beginning of a show it was oiled down and slicked back, and he looked respectable, like a tricked-out frat boy or preacher\u2019s kid. But on the rocking songs, he slung his head around like a wild man, and that hair came unbound; it hung down across his face, and that just did something to the women\u2014and their screams did something to the crowd, and things just got kind of squirrely. As it came unbound, the waves turned into tangled curls and ringlets, and it seemed to have a life of its own, a wicked thing, like Medusa herself. Sometimes he would whip out a comb onstage and try to comb it back under control, but it was too wild to tame. \u201cI was the first one in rock and roll to have long hair,\u201d he says, thinking back to that night, \u201cand I did shake it.\u201d\n\nThese were the biggest crowds he had seen or heard, and he can see and hear them still.\n\n\u201cMore!\u201d\n\n\u201cMore!\u201d\n\n\u201cMore!\u201d\n\nHe did one encore, then two, and at the end he did \u201cShakin\u2019,\u201d in pandemonium.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me off the stage.\u201d By the time he finished, the people were out of their seats and the constables were looking antsy. Jerry Lee swaggered off the stage, one arm held stiffly in the air, a salute more than a wave. \u201cAnd I left \u2019em wondering who that wild boy was.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cash, Perkins, Jackson -- they were all legends, they were all young, and the early tours were unforgettably cool", "title": "Jerry Lee Lewis on touring with Elvis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins: \u201cThey knew, even then, they were seeing the greatest thing\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cash, Perkins, Jackson -- they were all legends, they were all young, and the early tours were unforgettably cool", "title": "Jerry Lee Lewis on touring with Elvis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins: \u201cThey knew, even then, they were seeing the greatest thing\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/jerry_lee_lewis_on_touring_with_elvis_johnny_cash_carl_perkins_they_knew_even_then_they_were_seeing_the_greatest_thing/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/lewis_perkins_presley_cash.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cash, Perkins, Jackson -- they were all legends, they were all young, and the early tours were unforgettably cool", "title": "Jerry Lee Lewis on touring with Elvis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins: \u201cThey knew, even then, they were seeing the greatest thing\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/lewis_perkins_presley_cash.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rick Bragg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Carl Perkins, Editor's Picks, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Music, Rick Bragg, Wanda Jackson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Excerpted from \"Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story\"Jerry Lee Lewis did not know where he was, precisely, just somewhere in Canada.\nTopics: Books, Carl Perkins, Editor's Picks, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Music, Rick Bragg, Wanda Jackson, Entertainment NewsYou need a great gift.\nJerry Lee swaggered off the stage, one arm held stiffly in the air, a salute more than a wave.\nThe stage had become a kind of laboratory for Jerry Lee, and he was the mad scientist.\nFirst came Carl Perkins, in his too-tight pants and pointy sideburns, and he let it rip:Well, it\u2019s one for the moneyTwo for the show ."}
