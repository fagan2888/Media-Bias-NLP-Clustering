Testing their message on the conservative Iowa crowd, they took a hard line in their prescriptions for the country.\n\n\u201cThe most important tax reform we can do is abolish the IRS,\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told the fired-up audience.\n\nThe firebrand senator compared the EPA to a locust and got a huge reaction when he demanded to \u201crepeal every word of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nSarah Palin, too, after telling reporters she\u2019s thinking about a 2016 run, laced her speech with snappy one-liners as she lit into the current president.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nOf Obama, she said: \u201cAmerica, he\u2019s just not that into you.\u201d The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee also knocked the idea of a Hillary Clinton run.\n\n\u201cHey Iowa, can anyone stop Hillary? To borrow a phrase, yes, we can!\u201d she said.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u2013 who was interrupted by immigration protesters \u2013 helped closed out the daylong event. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum spoke earlier.\n\nChristie also was interrupted by a protester in the crowd. Unlike Perry, who kept talking through it, Christie couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cDon\u2019t they know I am from New Jersey? This stuff doesn\u2019t bother me one bit,\u201d he said. He went on to dismiss the notion he\u2019s too blunt for Iowa.\n\n\u201cIf that was the case, why would you keep inviting me back and why would I keep coming back?\u201d he asked, to applause.\n\nThe summit, which included a packed schedule of speeches back-to-back, served as the unofficial kickoff to the 2016 Republican presidential race.\n\nIt included big names like Cruz and Christie, but also some rising stars, like Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon who has reinvented himself as an outspoken conservative and won an enthusiastic following in the process.\n\nDrawing some of the biggest applause of the day, Carson took on the thorny subject of immigration, saying fixing the country's immigration issues should rest on Congress' shoulders and not the president's \u2013 in a dig at Obama\u2019s executive actions.\n\nCarson, who has been flirting with the idea of a 2016 presidential run, told the crowd the next president should \"make it their goal to seal the border within a year.\"\n\nHe said part of the problem is that the United States is too attractive to illegal immigrants.\n\n\"We have to reverse the magnet,\" he said. \"We should not be employing illegal immigrants. Do we have the ability to seal the border? Yes. We don't have the will.\"\n\nCarson suggested adopting a guest-worker program similar to the one Canada has and said anyone applying for guest-worker employment should do so while in another country.\n\nCarson also took on the Affordable Care Act and said \"even if it worked, I would oppose it.\"\n\nCarson warned the crowd that health care should not be put in the hands of the government and said ObamaCare fundamentally changes America.\n\nDonald Trump, too, told a revved-up audience he'd build an impenetrable wall to keep illegal immigrants out. \u201cI\u2019m Trump. I build things,\u201d he said, while saying he\u2019s \u201cseriously thinking\u201d of running for president.\n\nFreshman Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, who gave the GOP response to the State of the Union address, also had tough words for the president\u2019s record on fighting terrorism. Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore told the crowd he was \u201cashamed\u201d of that record and said the president should have gone to Paris to join the unity rally after the attacks in that city this month.\n\nThe summit was sponsored by Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King and Citizens United.\n\nKing, in his opening remarks, called for abolishing the IRS and going after Obama\u2019s \u201cexecutive overreach,\u201d while largely sidestepping the broader immigration issue.\n\nKing, known for controversial statements on immigration, recently called a 21-year-old illegal immigrant who was Michelle Obama\u2019s guest at the State of the Union address \u201ca deportable.\u201d He told an Iowa radio station Friday he was being \u201ckind and gentle\u201d with that description.\n\nThe incident became quick fodder for Democrats eager to cast Republicans attending as \u201cextreme\u201d on immigration. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, in a press conference across the street from the summit in Des Moines, called it an \u201cextremist ring-kissing summit masquerading as a political forum.\u201d\n\nKing, though, did not fuel the immigration fire in his opening remarks. Instead, he focused on the future and said the next president of the United States must \u201crestore that separation of powers.\u201d\n\nHe also took a jab at those in his party who declined to attend. (2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul were among those not in attendance.)\n\n\u201cDo you believe that the next president of the United States is going to be speaking from this stage to you today?\u201d he asked, to applause. \u201cAs do I.\u201d\n\nKing said he wants Americans to elect a new president who is ready to sign legislation that will \u201crip ObamaCare out by the roots.\u201d He also told the crowd he has penned a 40-word bill to make ObamaCare \u201cas if it had never been enacted.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential", "dcterms.modified":
